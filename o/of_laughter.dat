5|$|Four days later, Armstrong was {{involved}} in a second incident, when he flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. Their job, flying a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. Armstrong tells a different version of events, where Yeager never tried {{to talk him out of}} it and they made a first successful landing on the east side of the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck and according to Armstrong, Yeager was in fits <b>of</b> <b>laughter.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{prolific}} writer {{during his time}} in Torquay, he also wrote Stalky & Co., a collection of school stories (born of his experience at the United Services College in Westward Ho!) whose juvenile protagonists displayed a know-it-all, cynical outlook on patriotism and authority. According to his family, Kipling enjoyed reading aloud stories from Stalky & Co. to them and often went into spasms <b>of</b> <b>laughter</b> over his own jokes.|$|E
25|$|Gelotology {{was first}} studied by psychiatrists, {{although}} some doctors in antiquity recommended laughter {{as a form}} of medicine. It was initially deprecated by most other physicians, who doubted that laughter possessed analgesic qualities. One early study that demonstrated the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>laughter</b> in a clinical setting showed that laughter could help patients with atopic dermatitis respond less to allergens. Other studies have shown that laughter can help alleviate stress and pain, and can assist cardiopulmonary rehabilitation.|$|E

25|$|Crying and {{vegetative}} {{sounds are}} controlled by the brain stem, which matures earlier than the cortex. Neurological development of higher brain structures coincides with certain developments in infants’ vocalizations. For example, the onset of cooing at 6 to 8 weeks happens as {{some areas of the}} limbic system begin to function. The limbic system is known {{to be involved in the}} expression of emotion, and cooing in infants is associated with a feeling of contentedness. Further development of the limbic system might be responsible for the onset <b>of</b> <b>laughter</b> around 16 weeks of age. The motor cortex, finally, which develops later than the abovementioned structures may be necessary for canonical babbling, which start around 6 to 9 months of age.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Louis-Dreyfus {{was granted}} the honorary award for Legacy <b>of</b> <b>Laughter</b> at the TV Land Awards. Previous winners had {{included}} Lucille Ball and Mike Myers.

The following year, Louis-Dreyfus received the 2,407th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on May 4, 2010, for her remarkable contribution to the broadcast television industry as both an actress and a comedienne. Originally, the star was set with Louis-Dreyfus' name spelled incorrectly. It was missing both the 'o' and the hyphen in her last name. The star was corrected and the misspelled portion was removed and presented to the actress. Celebrity guests at the event included past and current colleagues from throughout her career, including Clark Gregg, Larry David, Eric McCormack, and Jason Alexander.|$|E
25|$|The {{educational}} {{perspective of}} internet linguistics examines the Internet's impact on formal language use, specifically on Standard English, {{which in turn}} affects language education. The rise and rapid spread of Internet use has brought about new linguistic features specific only to the Internet platform. These include, {{but are not limited}} to, an increase in the use of informal written language, inconsistency in written styles and stylistics and the use of new abbreviations in Internet chats and SMS text messaging, where constraints of technology on word count contributed to the rise of new abbreviations. Such acronyms exist primarily for practical reasons — to reduce the time and effort required to communicate through these mediums apart from technological limitations. Examples of common acronyms include lol (for laughing out loud; a general expression <b>of</b> <b>laughter),</b> omg (oh my god) and gtg (got to go).|$|E
40|$|Pathological {{laughter}} and crying are episodes <b>of</b> either <b>laughter</b> or crying, which is intense and uncontrollable, usually lasting for brief periods and occurring in paroxysms. In the literature, pathological laughing and crying, emotionalism, pseudo-bulbar affect are synonymously used. Favorable evidences exist {{with regard to}} the use of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-glutaminergic agents for the management <b>of</b> pathological <b>laughter</b> and crying. In this case report, we highlight the clinical presentation of hypertensive bleed in the form <b>of</b> pathological <b>laughter</b> and its management with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor - sertraline along with literature review regarding its neurobiological basis and pharmacological management...|$|R

25|$|This {{mismatch}} {{also shows}} up in the phenomena of the supernormal stimulus, a stimulus that elicits a response more strongly than the stimulus for which the response evolved. The term was coined by Niko Tinbergen to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist Deirdre Barrett said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. She explained junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats, and she says that television is an exaggeration of social cues <b>of</b> <b>laughter,</b> smiling faces and attention-grabbing action. Magazine centerfolds and double cheeseburgers pull instincts intended for an EEA where breast development was a sign of health, youth and fertility in a prospective mate, and fat was a rare and vital nutrient. The psychologist Mark van Vugt recently argued that modern organizational leadership is a mismatch. His argument is that humans are not adapted to work in large, anonymous bureaucratic structures with formal hierarchies. The human mind still responds to personalized, charismatic leadership primarily in the context of informal, egalitarian settings. Hence the dissatisfaction and alienation that many employees experience. Salaries, bonuses and other privileges exploit instincts for relative status, which attract particularly males to senior executive positions.|$|E
500|$|Then Hazlitt {{observes the}} {{connection}} between Falstaff's body and his [...] "wit": [...] "Falstaff's wit is an emanation of a fine constitution; an exuberance of good-humour and good-nature; an overflowing of his love <b>of</b> <b>laughter</b> and good fellowship; a giving vent to his heart's ease, and over-contentment with himself and others." ...|$|E

500|$|The jackdaw is {{featured}} on the Ukrainian town of Halych's ancient coat of arms, the town's name allegedly being derived from the East Slavic word for the bird. In The Book <b>of</b> <b>Laughter</b> and Forgetting (1979), Milan Kundera notes that Franz Kafka's father Hermann had a sign {{in front of his}} shop with a jackdaw painted next to his name, since [...] "kavka" [...] means jackdaw in Czech.|$|E
500|$|For {{a reason}} {{which was not}} specified, the sound of Lois's {{footsteps}} when going down the basement stairs during her dream of killing Stewie, had to be overcome by Stewie talking more often. This line of Stewie making general conversation in the same scene, was altered several times due to lack <b>of</b> <b>laughter</b> from the audience. MacFarlane comments that the scene of Peter standing up to his teacher who was giving the class a test, is a reference to [...] "80's TV bullshit".|$|E
500|$|A {{challenge}} {{of a different}} kind was the cover version of Gary Moore's [...] "Over the Hills and Far Away" [...] (2001), as it required a deeper voice, far below the vocal range of an average soprano. In an interview with Breakout magazine, she reported that in the studio, the band members were shaken by a paroxysm <b>of</b> <b>laughter</b> as she tried to warm up for the vocal lines. As a side benefit of her efforts, Turunen gradually expanded her vocal range considerably into the lower range, which manifested even more on the following albums.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with school-children’s communication, behavioural, and emotional development, in which the first concern has been to focus on their laughter. Although commonly thought of as an integral component <b>of</b> childhood, children’s <b>laughter</b> seldom receives the attention it deserves. The significance <b>of</b> <b>laughter’s</b> correlation with children’s social connectivity remains largely undiscovered. Little account has been taken <b>of</b> <b>laughter’s</b> exclusive orientation, and the strain this may create in schools with an avowedly inclusive ethos. Teachers and pupils who agreed {{to take part in}} this study were recruited from two primary schools. Together, they formed the substantive part of a pair of ethnographic case-studies. Data obtained from a series of playground/classroom observations and informal interviews were framed around Robert Putnam’s theory of social capital, and its own inclusive-exclusive (bridging and bonding) dynamic. Findings indicate that our diminishing stocks of social capital may be directly correlated with our decline in laughter production. They also confirm the view that it is unhelpful to consider inclusive and exclusive entities in isolation. Exclusive laughter appears to be a fundamental condition of inclusive schooling, with pupils and their teachers apparently natural exponents of a form of behaviour that may be described as inclusive-exclusive. ...|$|R
