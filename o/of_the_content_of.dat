5|$|In 1994, Slayer {{released}} Divine Intervention, the band's {{first record}} with drummer Bostaph. The album featured songs about Reinhard Heydrich, an {{architect of the}} Holocaust, and Jeffrey Dahmer, an American serial killer and sex offender. Other themes included murder, the evils of church, and the lengths to which governments will go to wield power, Araya's interest in serial killers inspired much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the lyrics.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, Johns became commandant of the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir. The wartime Engineer School was {{responsible}} for the training of officers. Some were engineers in civilian life who were trained as officers; other were officers transferred from other arms who were given training in engineering subjects. The Officer Candidate School (OCS) prepared enlisted men for commissioning as officers. There had been strong criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> training courses from SWPA, where it was the norm for machinery to be operated around the clock and for engineer officers to supervise all manner of construction tasks. The commanders there felt that the training courses taught by the Engineer School were concentrating too much on leadership in combat, and not enough on technical matters, such the operation and maintenance of construction equipment. Johns reformed the curriculum, but by this time {{it was too late for}} the changes to have much effect in the overseas theaters of operations. For his work at Fort Belvoir, Johns was awarded the Legion of Merit.|$|E

5|$|The score {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from various soundtrack forums soon after being released. Spectral analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the CD revealed certain frequency cutoff patterns around 16kHz, which are typical for lossy codecs. By analyzing the block size of these cutoffs, individuals at Hydrogenaudio {{were able to}} identify the lossy codec that was used before mastering the CD as MP3 with a sample rate of 48kHz. According to the aforementioned forums, Varèse's German subsidiary Colosseum Schallplatten acknowledged this as a mastering error, while Varèse Sarabande itself denied this. It is so far unclear if a remastered version with full frequency content will be released.|$|E

25|$|Like the Theravada Abhidharma, the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma also {{consists}} of seven texts.

In particular, the Theravāda Abhidharma contains two texts (the Katha Vatthu and Puggala Pannatti) that some consider entirely out of place in an Abhidharma collection.|$|E

25|$|On April 16, {{a report}} on the dangers of the microcapsules was sent as a letter to Dr. Robert Leavitt of the {{environmental}} advisory task force, by Dr. Dennis Knepp, a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and Dr. Jeff Haferman, also an engineer, explaining that the spray was shown to include capsules with diameters {{less than or equal to}} 10 micrometers in diameter (termed PM10) which, in sufficient concentration, is a known health hazard regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> the particulates.|$|E
