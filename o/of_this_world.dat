5|$|The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing to the definition of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression it gives the reader.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{published}} in North America under the title Out <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> {{in order to avoid}} confusion with the popular but unrelated soap opera television series Another World. Coincidentally, the science fiction sitcom Out <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> aired {{at the same time as}} the game's USA-Canada release.|$|E
5|$|In The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World,</b> Carpentier {{creates a}} {{succession}} of characters that engage in very similar actions. This repetition, a stylistic tool that resembles baroque writings, constructs a cyclical pattern in the novel which depicts the author's social views. The succession of characters (as well as places) that replace each other without fully developing on their own (or blocked from developing, in a sense) represent Carpentier's view of the social context in which forces are preventing characters from developing.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the intense single character focus of his first novel, ¡Ecue-Yamba-O! (Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers a diversified understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World.</b> There exists remarkable respect for accuracy on all sides including historical facts, character names, place names, and even street names. This adds to the key blend of marvellous fantasy and historical accuracy.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> {{has a deep}} {{focus on}} the nature of revolution, and the novel itself {{can be viewed as a}} {{reflection}} of Carpentier's ideological perspective towards revolutions. Carpentier tries to establish the idea that a distinction must be made between revolutions and reactions. While a revolution produces progress, a reaction does not.|$|E

5|$|The {{brutality}} of the Spanish American dictatorship is omnipresent in The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> through the images of torture, fire, suppression, and hungry dogs for example. Carpentier's characters often find consolation in sexuality (which {{is closely related to}} the sadism of the violence theme) after experiencing violence.|$|E
5|$|The picture {{he painted}} {{of his father}} was of a pious {{religious}} man who {{was not interested in}} the affairs <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>world.</b> He would spend most of his time reading the Quraan, fasting and hunting during the day and at night would copy the Quraan. He also recounted a few battles his father joined against the crusaders in his autobiography Kitab al Itibar.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} {{confusion}} appears through the transplantation of characters from one world to another, for example from the characters' childhood culture {{to the one}} imposed upon them as occurs in The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World.</b> Often, the characters find that reality does not lie entirely in either world. It is possible that this theme is well-developed in Alejo Carpentier's work because of the author's own personal experience with cultural transplantation (Carpentier grew up in Havana but later moved to France for six years and travelled extensively).|$|E

5|$|The theologian Sallie McFague {{believes}} that the more recent problem of religious language is based on individual experience, owing to the increased secularisation of society. She notes that human experience is <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> rather than regular encounters with the divine, which makes the experience of God uncommon and potentially unnecessary. Because of this, she argues, religious language is both idolatrous because it fails to express sufficient awe of God, and irrelevant because without adequate words it becomes meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel is well {{established}} early on as not only a witness to events, but also as someone who makes observations and offers reflection. It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under French rule because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including his belief in the African gods.|$|E
5|$|Alejo Carpentier {{grew up in}} Havana, Cuba and {{was born}} on December 26, 1904 in Lausanne, Switzerland. He {{subsequently}} moved to France in 1933 (at the age of 29) and returned to Cuba six years later, in 1939. Once in Cuba, Carpentier joined {{a group of young}} writers whose goal was to establish a literature faithful to the New World, by recovering origins, history, and tradition. In 1943, he travelled to Haiti, where he was made aware of Dominique Hyppolyte's play, Le Torrent, about the Haitian Revolution, which features a character named Ti Noel. As The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> coincides with Carpentier's return to Cuba, it is very much influenced by the author's re-encounter with himself and his origins.|$|E

5000|$|The yellow <b>world.</b> <b>This</b> {{is a very}} 'mellow' world {{filled with}} Hippies, literally. The only known portal here is through an old Volkswagen Type 2 Kombi van located {{in front of the}} house <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>world's</b> Francis (A.K.A.

5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|Earthsea {{itself is}} an {{archipelago}} {{or group of}} islands. In the fictional history <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> the islands were raised from the ocean by Segoy, an ancient deity or hero. The world is inhabited by both humans and dragons, and several among the humans are sorcerers or wizards. The world is shown as being based on a delicate balance, which most of its inhabitants are aware of, but which is disrupted by somebody {{in each of the}} original trilogy of novels. The setting of Earthsea is preindustrial, and has many cultures within the widespread archipelago. Most of the characters of the story are of the Hardic peoples, who are dark-skinned, and who populate most of the islands. Some of the Eastern islands are populated by the white-skinned Kargish people, who see the Hardic folk as evil sorcerers: the Kargish, in turn, are viewed by the Hardic as barbarians. The far western regions of the archipelago are where the dragons live.|$|E
5|$|The World of Continent {{is a large}} {{land mass}} ruled by three kings in {{constant}} war for control of their world. They each carry an object needed to open the tower's entrance. The World of Ocean consists of various small islands surrounded by water, each connected by small caves. Pirates roam the sea <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> forbidding travel by ship. The World of Sky contains large land masses suspended in clouds, and is ruled by a powerful dictator from his flying castle. The World of Ruins is a technologically advanced cityscape, reduced to a post-apocalyptic wasteland by constant monster attacks.|$|E

50|$|The {{functional}} homeworld and, possibly, Demos's future. Less than 10% of {{the surface}} is habitable, and the remaining inhabitants <b>of</b> <b>this</b> once-prosperous <b>world</b> live on islands. The remaining 90% of the planet, including the mainlands, is covered by a volcanically-active radioactive wasteland. All customs that open to Earth 16 only open to the mainlands, ensuring that no one finds out the truth about <b>this</b> <b>world</b> (most functionals believe Earth 16 to be Hell). The only remaining sign <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>worlds</b> former greatness is a strange-looking skyscraper on an inhabited island, unseen to most humans. The structure is, actually, a museum and holds little value to functionals. It is protected by an angel-like functional.|$|R
5|$|Through Interplay Entertainment, {{the game}} was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive), and the Apple IIGS in 1992. The SNES, Sega CD, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (3DO) and Apple IIGS ports each contain a prologue before the {{introduction}} begins, which consists of an entry that comes from Lester's diary. The Mega Drive port's prologue {{is different from that}} of the SNES and 3DO ports. The Sega CD version of Another World combines the original game (with CD quality new music by Freitas) with the sequel, Heart of the Alien, and was released exclusively in North America as Heart of the Alien: Out <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> Parts I and II.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the novel, varying {{perceptions}} of reality that arise due to cultural differences between its characters are emphasized and contrasted. Carpentier explores hybridization, nature, voodoo, ethnicity, history and destiny, confusion, violence, and sexuality {{in a style}} that blends history with fiction and uses repetition to emphasize the cyclical nature of events. The novel was largely well-received with much attention paid to Carpentier's inclusion of magic realism and The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> {{has been described as}} an important work in the development of this genre in Caribbean and Latin American literature. However, some technical aspects of his style have been ignored by the academic community, and the novel's narrative organization has been criticized.|$|E
5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing the room to be rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. He understands that being a goose {{does not imply that}} all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes with the end of Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World.</b>|$|E
