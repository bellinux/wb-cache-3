5|$|Australian openside David Pocock, who {{was also}} shortlisted for the IRB award, admires the way he reads the game {{as well as his}} ability to read the referee. One of McCaw's {{strengths}} is his ability to re-invent himself. For example, he adapted quickly to changes in the breakdown laws (e.g., the 2008 the Experimental Law Variations (ELVS) and the 2010 New IRB Law Interpretations) and, over time, other areas <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as having a good work ethic and the ability to carry the ball and retain possession for the team. He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively high pass completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E
5|$|Jovanovski {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman. Able to {{contribute}} offensively, he is an adept puck-carrier and joins plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He plays defence physically, bodychecking opponents primarily with his shoulder. In both aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> he is considered to play {{with a high level of}} risk, taking the chance of being out of position in favour of a good scoring chance or a hit.|$|E

5|$|At Arsenal, Fàbregas {{also often}} assumed {{responsibility}} for set pieces, taking corners, free kicks and penalties. By his own admission, scoring was a weaker part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> {{in his first}} few seasons at Arsenal; wasteful finishing also being symptomatic of the larger problem surrounding Arsenal in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. This changed initially in the 2007–08 season when he scored 11 goals in his first 16 games, and Arsenal manager Wenger claimed that the Spaniard's previous inability to score was down to a mental state, and even compared the Spaniard to Michel Platini, a French midfielder renowned for scoring. There were also concerns raised over {{the large number of}} games Fàbregas was playing for club and country at such a young age, but while he initially avoided long spells on the sidelines, he played significantly fewer games due to injury in his last three seasons with Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Cognizant of his {{increasing}} {{age and the}} wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and rapport with each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.|$|E
5|$|During the off-season, Brulé {{worked with}} a sports {{psychologist}} to address the mental aspect <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> including his confidence. Near {{the end of the}} Oilers' training camp, on October 2, 2011, he was placed on waivers for the purpose of being assigned to the team's AHL affiliate, the Oklahoma City Barons. While the departure of Andrew Cogliano in July 2011 made room for Brulé to move up the Oilers' depth chart at centre, the performance of Oilers rookies Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Anton Lander helped make him expendable. Regarding the move, Oilers General Manager Steve Tambellini described Brulé as having lacked consistency. Brulé cleared waivers two days later; an Edmonton Sun article suggested that he would have likely been picked up by another team if not for his $1.85 million salary.|$|E
50|$|Sutherland {{apparently}} made a {{much better}} reliever in his career than starter—he won all five <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career <b>games</b> while in relief. He lost all four <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>games</b> as a starter.|$|R

5|$|Hamhuis' third WHL {{season in}} 2000–01 saw him {{increase}} his offensive production to 13 goals and 59 points over 62 games, eighth in scoring among league defencemen. He received WHL West First All-Star Team honours {{and was named}} Prince George's most dedicated player. Playing in his NHL draft-eligible season, he participated in the 2001 CHL Top Prospects Game, where he served as captain for his team. Hamhuis was ranked by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau as the second-best North American prospect overall (behind Jason Spezza) and the top defenceman. He went on to be selected with the 12th overall pick in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators. He was the second defenceman to be selected after the Montreal Canadiens took Mike Komisarek seventh overall. Scouting reports listed him as a physical offensive defenceman with excellent skating, passing and open-ice hitting abilities, {{as well as a}} good hockey sense. Having identified his shot as a weaker aspect <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> he worked on improving it during his junior years. His coach in Prince George likened his playing style to Scott Niedermayer.|$|E
5|$|Barkley was a {{prolific}} scorer who averaged 22.1 points-per-game {{during the regular}} season for his career and 23.0 points-per-game in the playoffs for his career. Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He was one of the NBA's most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA's premier clutch players. During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a set of very uncommon skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He {{was one of the most}} efficient scorers of all-time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season).|$|E
5|$|Murray {{is known}} for {{being one of the}} most {{intelligent}} tacticians on the court, often constructing points. Other strengths in his game, although not huge parts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game,</b> include a well-disguised drop shot and his net game. As he plays predominantly from the baseline, he usually approaches the net to volley when finishing points more quickly. Murray is most proficient on a fast surface, like grass, where he has won eight singles titles including the Wimbledon Championships and the 2012 Olympic Gold Medal, although hard courts are his preferred surface. He has worked hard since 2008 on improving his clay court game, ultimately winning his first clay titles during 2015 at Munich and Madrid, as well as reaching his first French Open final during 2016. While Murray's serve is a major weapon for him, with his first serve reaching speeds of 130mph or higher on some occasions and winning him many free points, it can become inconsistent when hit under pressure, especially with a more vulnerable and slower second serve. Since his 2011 season and Ivan Lendl's coaching, Murray has played a more offensive game and has also worked to improve his second serve, forehand, consistency and mental game which have all been crucial to his further success.|$|E

5|$|Zolak {{was again}} the backup behind O'Donnell in 1989. He played in eight games, {{completing}} 33 of 69 passes for 407yards and two touchdowns. In 1990, after O'Donnell graduated and began his NFL career, Zolak became the starter for Maryland, and head coach Joe Krivak had {{high hopes for}} him heading into the season. In his first start as a senior, Zolak completed a school record 28 passes in 46 attempts for 303yards and two touchdowns, including a 51-yard pass to Gene Thomas with 61 seconds left that gave Maryland the win against Virginia Tech, 2013. The following week, he once more featured in a dramatic conclusion, throwing a 59-yard touchdown pass to Gene Thomas with 2:27 left to beat 25th ranked West Virginia, 1410. However, he was struggling in other aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game.</b> In an October game against Georgia Tech, Zolak was sacked 10 times. In four games, he had been sacked 23 times and had a pass intercepted 12 times. By {{the end of the}} season, as Maryland was preparing to face Louisiana Tech in the , he had thrown 225 completed passes in 418 attempts for 2,589yards and 10 touchdowns. The teams tied, 3434, in Zolak's final collegiate appearance. At the time of his graduation, he ranked fifth in school history with 270 pass completions, seventh with 3,124 career passing yards, and second with 2,589 passing yards in a season. He was also named Atlantic Coast Conference Offensive Player of the Week four times.|$|E
25|$|Taylor had ups {{and downs}} during a January 7, 2006 wild card game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Although he scored a {{touchdown}} {{that proved to be}} the Redskins' game-winning touchdown, he was ejected after spitting at Buccaneers running back Michael Pittman. He was subsequently fined $17,000, the amount <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> bonus check.|$|E
25|$|The Penguins {{dispatched}} the New Jersey Devils in {{the first}} round in five games, but were upset by the New York Islanders in seven. During the series against the Islanders, Lemieux was repeatedly knocked out <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> by Darius Kasparaitis. After the season, Lemieux was awarded his second Pearson Trophy, and his first Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, given to the player who best exemplifies perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey.|$|E

25|$|His {{career has}} been subject {{of a number of}} TV films and documentaries. In Freddie Flintoff: Hidden Side of Sport {{broadcast}} on the BBC One in 2012, he talks candidly in moving interviews with Steve Harmison, Vinnie Jones and Ricky Hatton and others about the serious effects of depression. He confronts his own issues as captain of England under pressure and under fire at the top <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game.</b> Freddie reveals the stigma attached to talking about depression {{in the face of an}} often unforgiving public.|$|E
25|$|Debuting with Adelaide as a 19-year-old, Mattner {{began his}} career slowly. After being {{elevated}} from Adelaide's rookie list {{at the start of}} the 2002 season, he played just seven games for the year. One of his best performances was a game against Geelong where he laid 13 tackles, a feature <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> that he has become noted for. He picked up 11 disposals in his first game, and then 13 disposals in a win over St Kilda. He averaged eight disposals a match over his seven games, and had an impressive average of just over three tackles a game.|$|E
25|$|Another major {{influence}} on the development <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> was former India captain Bishan Bedi, coach of Jammu and Kashmir between 2011 and 2014. With Bedi's guidance helping him overhaul his mental approach to batting, Dev Singh scored 406 runs at 67.66 in first-class matches in 2011-12, and earned selection for North Zone in the Duleep Trophy. For his part, Bedi described Dev Singh as 'a very good shorter version batsman and a brilliant fielder' who was 'definitely ready for a break', either {{in the form of}} an international call-up or an IPL contract. As of 2017, however, such honours have eluded him.|$|E
50|$|Andy Roddick {{appeared}} in two matches and lost both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> men's singles sets.

Playing men's singles and doubles in his only match appearance, Rubin recorded wins in 9 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 16 <b>games.</b>|$|R

25|$|With his {{effectiveness}} {{hindered by}} {{the necessity of}} pitching two days in a row, the Browns found themselves on their heels quickly when ace Bob Caruthers walked four of the first five batters, surrendering a second run on a base hit given up to third baseman Tom Burns of the Chicagos. The game was called after completion of eight innings due to darkness. John Clarkson was again on top <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> as the right hander struck out 8 Browns in earning his second win of the series. Caruthers took the loss for the Browns, giving Chicago a lead of two games to one in the series.|$|E
25|$|A hard-working, {{versatile}} and technically gifted player, McManaman was usually deployed as a winger, or occasionally {{as a central}} midfielder; his preferred position, however, {{was that of a}} more offensive and creative attacking midfielder, an uncommon position in the Premier League throughout his career. McManaman was a quick, strong, creative, and energetic player, with good dribbling ability, as well as accurate passing and crossing ability with either foot, which allowed him to create chances and provide assists for teammates as a playmaker. He was often criticised, however, for his inability to score many goals, although he would later improve upon this element <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> during his career.|$|E
25|$|The {{year was}} {{noticeable}} for {{the introduction of}} Joe Cole and Michael Carrick to the first team proper, the ignominious exit in the League Cup to Aston Villa due to an enforced replay after it transpired that last minute substitute Emmanuel Omoyinmi had featured in the competition whilst on loan {{earlier in the season}} (this event saw the resignation of Martin Aldridge), and the barracking Paulo Wanchope received for {{the early part of the}} year. The striker failed to settle despite scoring 12 league goals in 33 games. Unfortunately, his erratic form and the unpredictable nature <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>game</b> meant he would move on at the end of the year.|$|E
