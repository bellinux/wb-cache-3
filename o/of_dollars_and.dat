40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the exchange rate on the role <b>of</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>and</b> euro as international currencies. It is found that exchange rate fluctuations are a major determinant of the international role of currencies only if they reflect sizeable inflation differentials. Accordingly, major changes in the international role <b>of</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>and</b> euro are not to be expected given the continuation of a stability-oriented US monetary policy. However, a move towards more exchange rate flexibility in emerging market economies, reflecting the need for greater monetary policy autonomy, might lead to a relative strengthening of the international role of the euro.

5|$|Varno later filed {{a second}} {{arbitration}} upon learning that Gene Corman was to receive writing {{credit for the}} original story. Varno claimed Corman {{had nothing to do}} with the story, and produced large amounts of dated notes he claimed proved he wrote it himself. Varno won both arbitration matters. However, Roger Corman refused to pay Varno, and as a result he was not allowed to use Writers Guild of America members on his films. Corman used non-union writers for several years, but he finally agreed to pay Varno when he wanted to use a union writer on one of his films. Varno said he would have sought more money for the delay, but he was out of the country when Corman paid the money and missed his opportunity. Additionally, despite winning arbitration in the writing credit matter, Gene Corman was given on-screen original story credit in Night of the Blood Beast. When contacted by the distributor, American International Pictures, he was told removing Corman's credit would mean recalling all of the prints and changing them, which would have cost thousands <b>of</b> <b>dollars,</b> <b>and</b> Varno agreed to allow it to remain unchanged.|$|E
