5|$|As Bristol {{expanded}} {{in the early}} 20th century, {{the need for a}} new station to serve the outskirts grew, and on 29 August 1927, the Great Western Railway opened a station at Parson Street, named Parson Street Halt. There were two platforms, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the two running lines. There was a wooden shelter on the westbound platform, and a metal shelter on the eastbound platform. The platforms were made of wood, with access from the main road via steps. No goods facilities were provided.|$|E
5|$|The larvae have silk glands {{which are}} located on the labium. These glands are {{modified}} salivary glands. They use these silk glands to make silk for cocoons and shelters. Located below the labrum are the mandibles. On {{each side of the}} head there are usually six stemmata just above the mandibles. These stemmata are arranged in a semicircle. Below the stemmata there is a small pair of antennae, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

5|$|They were {{intended}} to carry a number of boats aboard, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, two pinnaces, two yawls, and two dinghies. The ships were also to be equipped with a double catapult mounted between the two funnels, and four Arado Ar 196 seaplanes for maritime reconnaissance. The aircraft were stored in a main hangar just aft of the forward funnel, along with two smaller hangars, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the rear funnel.|$|E
5|$|Australia carried eight BL 12-inch Mark X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets; {{the largest}} guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted {{fore and aft}} on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4-inch Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two submerged tubes for 18-inch torpedoes, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> aft of 'X' barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|Early warning {{would have}} been {{provided}} by a Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radar mounted {{at the top of}} the foremast. A Type 93 passive hydrophone system {{would have been}} fitted in the bow. The ships were designed to carry three aircraft on a platform between the funnel and the mainmast. These would have consisted of one three-seat Aichi E13A and two two-seat Yokosuka E14Y floatplanes. They would have been launched by a pair of aircraft catapults, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the aircraft platform.|$|E

Darbu is meaningfully used on certain occasions like Khuallam and other traditional group dances.|$|R
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} {{common to all}} versions. This had bench seats, one for the driver and his assistant, and another for the crew. The rear portion of the upper body was adapted for the vehicle's intended role. The artillery model had two extra bench seats for the gun's crew and space for its ammunition. The cargo version had just two storage compartments mounted {{in the front of}} the cargo compartment, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> that opened to the outside. The windshield could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the windshield when erected.|$|E
5|$|While most insects {{have three}} simple eyes, or ocelli, only two ocelli {{are present in}} all species of Lepidoptera, except a few moths, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the head {{near the edge of}} the {{compound}} eye. On some species, sense organs called chaetosemata are found near the ocelli. The ocelli are not homologous to the simple eyes of caterpillars which are differently named as stemmata. The ocelli of Lepidoptera are reduced externally in some families; where present, they are unfocussed, unlike stemmata of larvae which are fully focussed. The utility of ocelli is not understood at present.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the genital slit. The ability to stow their reproductive organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E

5|$|For , Rindt's {{partner at}} Lotus was John Miles; Graham Hill {{had left the}} team to drive for Rob Walker's {{customer}} franchise. Rindt became the clear team leader. At the first Grand Prix {{of the season in}} South Africa, he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with Chris Amon and Jack Brabham, the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career. At the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the Lotus 72 featured two, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> of the cockpit. Further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted inboard to reduce unsprung weight. During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin. The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.|$|E
5|$|The {{bell tower}} rises , and halfway up its length {{is a large}} round sign. The sign denotes the school district, Pine Rock, and {{the year of the}} school's foundation. Originally, the sign graced the front {{exterior}} wall of the larger of the two rooms. The tower rises above the roof by about fifteen feet and at its top are four arches, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side.</b> Wooden construction is found throughout the tower, its arches, {{and the rest of the}} schoolhouse, save the limestone and cement foundation. At the bottom of each of the four arches are balustrades decorated with spindles. Inside the tower is the school bell. The bell house is topped with a multi-gabled roof. The roof of the overall schoolhouse is covered with cedar shingles and features chimneys rising from each of the classrooms.|$|E
5|$|The main {{building}} designed by Lange is in historicism and was originally built in two stories in brick. A third was {{added in the}} 1950s, some {{with some of the}} original feel being lost in the addition, since it was not stylistically true. In 1965 two annexes were built, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side</b> and in two stories. The western was used for offices and the other as part of the waiting area—these were both in line with the historicist style. They replaced a cargo expedition and a restaurant building, respectively. In 1995 the bus station was moved from the city center at Leüthenhaven to the central station, and the eastern annex was razed in favor of a postmodernistic glass and concrete building. In addition to the bus station it features and extension of the waiting area, offices, a restaurant and a parking lot.|$|E

5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>each</b> <b>side,</b> rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E
