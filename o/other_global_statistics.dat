40|$|Information {{retrieval}} systems {{often use}} proximity or term dependence models {{to increase the}} effectiveness of document retrieval. Many of the existing proximity models examine document-level local statistics, such as the frequencies that pairs of query terms occur within fixed-size windows of each document, before applying standard or adapted weighting functions – for instance Markov Random Fields. Term weighting models use Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) to control the influence of occurrences of different query terms in documents. Similarly, some proximity models also {{take into account the}} frequency of pairs of query terms in the entire corpus of documents. However, pair frequency is an expensive statistic to pre-compute at indexing time, or to compute at retrieval time before scoring documents. In this work, we examine in a uniform setting, the importance of such <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> for proximity weighting. We investigate two sources of <b>global</b> <b>statistics,</b> namely the target corpus, and the entire Web. Experiments are conducted using the TREC GOV 2 and ClueWeb 09 test collections. Our results show that local statistics alone are sufficient for effective retrieval, and <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> usually do not bring any significant improvement in effectiveness, compared to the same proximity approaches that do not use these <b>global</b> <b>statistics...</b>|$|R

In this paper, we propose a novel method using <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> to rank retrieval systems without relevance judgments. In our method, a series of <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> of a system, which indicate the percentage of its documents found by k out of all the N systems (k = 1, 2, [...] ., N), are selected, then a linear combination of the series of <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> is utilized to fit the mean average precision (MAP) of the retrieval system. Optimal coefficients are obtained by linear regression. No human relevance judgments are required in the entire process. Compared with existing evaluation methods without relevance judgments, our method has two advantages. Firstly, it outperforms all early attempts. Secondly, it is adjustable for different effectiveness measurements, e. g. MAP, precision at n, and so forth...|$|R

However, through theoreti-cal modeling and simulations we demonstrate this technique also greatly increases the ability for adversarial peers to ma-nipulate search results.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a combined feature extraction method {{to improve the}} perfor-mance of bag-of-features image classification. The bag-of-features approach {{is the most popular}} approach for generic object recognition and uses <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> (histogram) of visual words. To alleviate the loss of spatial layout information, the local statistics of visual words is also used in many researches. However, it is possible to extract richer information from these <b>global</b> or local <b>statistics</b> of visual words. We apply 10 relevant operations to global/local statistics of visual words. Each operation is meaningful to describe the property of the pairwise relation-ship among histogram components. For example, multiplication indicates strong co-occurrence of different visual words and binarized minus operator indicates bigger/smaller relationship. Because the pairwise combination of visual words is large, we apply feature selection methods including fisher discriminant criterion and L 1 -SVM. Experimental results using Scene- 15 dataset show that min operator achieved the best performance for <b>global</b> <b>statistics,</b> and division and binarized operators achieved better performance for local statistics. ...|$|R

Based on the findings in this investigation, a variety of weighting mod-els, called NG (standing for “no global statistics”) models, are derived from the Divergence from Randomness frame-work, in which only the within-document statistics {{are used in the}} relevance weighting. Compared to the state-of-the-art weighting models in extensive experiments on various stan-dard TREC test collections, our proposed NG models can provide acceptable retrieval performance in ad-hoc search, without the use of <b>global</b> <b>statistics...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we propose a {{comprehensive}} multi-criteria validation test for rainfall-runoff modeling by artificial neural networks. This study applies 17 <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> and 3 additional non-parametric tests to evaluate the ANNs. The weakness of <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> for validation of ANN is demonstrated by rainfall-runoff modeling of the Plasjan Basin in the western region of the Zayandehrud watershed, Iran. Although the <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> showed that the multi layer perceptron with 4 hidden layers (MLP 4) is the best ANN for the basin comparing with other MLP networks and empirical regression model, but the non-parametric tests illustrate that neither the ANNs nor the regression model are able to reproduce the probability distribution of observed runoff in validation phase. However, the MLP 4 network is the best network to reproduce the mean and variance of the observed runoff based on non-parametric tests. The performance of ANNs and empirical model was also demonstrated for low-medium and high flows. Although the MLP 4 network gives the best performance among ANNs for low-medium and high flows based on different statistics but the empirical model shows better results. However, none of the models is able to simulate the frequency distribution of low-medium and high flows according to non-parametric tests.

40|$|Gradient conveys {{important}} salient {{features in}} images. Traditional fusion methods based on gradient generally treat gradients from multichannels as a multi-valued vector, and compute its <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> {{under the assumption}} of identical distribution. However, different source channels may reflect different important salient features, and their gradients are basically non-identically distributed. This prevents existing methods from successful salience preservation. In this paper, we propose to fuse the gradients from multi-channels {{in the concept of}} saliency. We first measure the salience map of each channel’s gradient, and then use their saliency to weight their contribution in computing the <b>global</b> <b>statistics.</b> Gradients with high saliency are properly highlighted in the target gradient, and thereby salient features in the sources are well preserved. Furthermore, we handle the dynamic range problem by applying range compression on the target gradient, and thereby halo effect is effectively reduced. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As RFID {{applications}} are entering our daily life, many new security and privacy challenges arise. However, current research in RFID security focuses mainly on simple authentication and privacy-preserving identification. In this pa-per, we widen {{the scope of}} RFID security and privacy by introducing a new ap-plication scenario. The suggested application consists of computing statistics on private properties of individuals stored in RFID tags. The main idea is to compute <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> while preserving the privacy of individual readings. PPS assures the privacy of properties stored in each tag through the combination of homomor-phic encryption and aggregation at the readers. Re-encryption is used to prevent tracking of users. The readers scan tags and forward the aggregate of their en-crypted readings to the back-end server. The back-end server then decrypts the aggregates it receives and updates the <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> accordingly. Therewith, PPS is provably privacy-preserving. Moreover, tags can be very simple since they {{are not required to}} perform any kind of computation, but only to store data. ...|$|R

Nevertheless, the approach is suitable to be extended to other random decorated surfaces like marble, granite, wood or textile stuff. The experiments make us to conclude that a simple collection of <b>global</b> <b>statistics</b> of color in the CIE Lab space is powerful enough to well discriminate surface grades.
