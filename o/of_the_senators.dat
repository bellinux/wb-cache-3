5|$|Much of {{the press}} {{attention}} to the Keating Five focused on the relationships of each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senators</b> to Keating.|$|E
5|$|Because Republicans {{controlled}} neither {{house of}} Congress, nor the Supreme Court, Breckinridge {{did not believe}} Lincoln's election was a mandate for secession. Ignoring James Murray Mason's contention that no Southerner should serve in Lincoln's cabinet, Breckinridge supported the appointment of Virginian Montgomery Blair as Postmaster General. He also voted against a resolution to remove the names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senators</b> from seceded states from the Senate roll.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, he {{was elected}} as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arizona's 1st congressional district. After serving two terms there and making an {{impression}} as a rising political figure, {{he was elected}} U.S. Senator from Arizona in 1986. He became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senators</b> entangled in the Keating Five scandal of the late 1980s, but survived it and was re-elected in 1992 and 1998.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} Republic, {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} aristocracy to limit the increasing level of chaos associated with the obstructive tendencies and democratic impulses of some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senators.</b> Laws were enacted to prevent the inclusion of extraneous material in bills before the Senate. Other laws were enacted to outlaw the so-called omnibus bills, which are bills, usually enacted by a single vote, that contain a large volume of often unrelated material.|$|E
5|$|Professional {{services}} {{for members of}} the Senate and the House of Delegates are provided by the Department of Legislative Services, which is non-partisan. Individual members are also assisted by partisan staff members, and those in leadership positions have additional partisan staff. These staff members help to manage the offices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> in the Miller Senate Office Building. Each Senator has one year-round administrative assistant, as well as a secretary who assists them during the legislative session. There is also an allowance given to help pay for district offices.|$|E

5|$|The 2006–07 Senators thus {{became the}} first Ottawa team {{to be in the}} Stanley Cup Finals since the 1927 Stanley Cup Finals. Despite the 80-year gap, one fan {{attended}} games both the 1927 and the 2007 Finals—the third game of the series and first home game for Ottawa on June 2 was attended by 99-year-old Russell Williams as a guest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senators.</b> He had attended the last Finals game in Ottawa on April 13, 1927, played in the old Ottawa Auditorium. Both the 1927 and 2007 games were won by the Senators.|$|E
5|$|The breach between Antony and Octavian {{prompted}} {{a large portion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senators,</b> as well as both of that year's consuls, to leave Rome and defect to Antony. However, Octavian received two key deserters from Antony {{in the autumn of}} 32BC: Munatius Plancus and Marcus Titius. These defectors gave Octavian the information that he needed to confirm with the Senate all the accusations that he made against Antony.|$|E
5|$|When Charles X of Sweden invaded Poland in 1655, Czarniecki {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} his defence of Kraków, which he eventually surrendered on good terms, retreating with his army. He remained {{loyal to the}} Polish king, even when much of the army, including most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senators</b> and the hetmans, temporarily joined the Swedes. His vocal support for the wavering king, which at that time found refuge abroad, and was considering abdication, was instrumental. For his continuing support, the Polish king rewarded him with more lands, {{and the office of}} the royal army regimentarz.|$|E
25|$|Durenberger raised {{questions}} over Arthur's possible mishandling {{of sexual harassment}} allegations brought by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senator's</b> constituents, Rebecca Hansen, a female student naval aviator who had not successfully completed flight training.|$|R

5|$|When the {{two sides}} met in late-February, {{a week before the}} brawl game, during the third period, Flyers winger Mark Recchi was {{following}} Martin Havlat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> when he crossed into the Philadelphia defensive zone. As this happened, Recchi hooked Havlat, causing both of the players to collide and fall into the boards. When Havlat got up from the ice, angered by Recchi's hook, he took his stick above him and slashed Recchi, hitting him in the face.|$|E
5|$|On September 25, 1989, several Republicans from Ohio {{filed an}} ethics {{complaint}} against Glenn, charging {{that he had}} improperly intervened on Keating's behalf. The initial charges against the five Senators were made on October 13, 1989, by Common Cause, a public interest group, who asked for the U.S. Justice Department and the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate the actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senators</b> relative to Lincoln and the contributions received from Keating and whether they violated {{the rules of the}} Senate or federal election laws. But the most public attention came from the House Banking Committee, whose new chair Henry B. Gonzalez held 50hours of hearings into the Lincoln failure and associated events.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1918–19 season, {{ownership}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> changed. While Ted Dey {{negotiated with}} Percy Quinn for a lease for The Arena, Dey was also negotiating with Rosenthal over the lease, causing Rosenthal to seriously consider moving {{the team from}} The Arena back to Aberdeen Pavilion. However, {{it turned out that}} Dey was engineering a takeover of the club and Rosenthal ended up selling his share of the club to Dey, making Dey the majority owner in both the Arena and the hockey club. Rosenthal, a prominent local jeweller, had been involved with the club since 1903. Dey's machinations also helped the NHL in its continuing fight against Blueshirts owner Livingstone. The Senators instigated an agreement with the other NHL clubs, binding them to the NHL {{for the next five years}} and locking out any rival league from their arenas.|$|E
50|$|At <b>the</b> age <b>of</b> 30 in 2003, Webber {{ran in the}} Republican primary against {{incumbent}} State Senator Robert Martin {{by running}} to <b>the</b> right <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senator.</b> Martin defeated Webber by approximately 1,900 votes, 15 percentage points from the total vote.|$|R
50|$|For {{more than}} 10 years, Kerrigan worked in <b>the</b> office <b>of</b> <b>Senator</b> Ted Kennedy. Kerrigan began {{his work for}} Senator Kennedy as an intern. Once a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senator's</b> staff, Kerrigan {{fulfilled}} <b>the</b> roles <b>of</b> scheduler and constituent services director until becoming <b>the</b> <b>senator’s</b> political director, a position he maintained from 1996 to 2003. After his departure, Kerrigan maintained his relationship with <b>the</b> <b>Senator</b> and his family. In 2009 he arranged <b>the</b> <b>Senator’s</b> funeral mass in Boston.|$|R
50|$|After four {{successful}} {{seasons with}} the Toronto St. Michael's Majors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OHL, Cameron moved up to the AHL, where he became <b>the</b> head coach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Binghamton <b>Senators.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Senators</b> saw a 26-point improvement in Cameron's first season with the team, as Binghamton finished in {{first place in the}} East Division with a 47-21-7-5 record, earning 106 points. In <b>the</b> first round <b>of</b> <b>the</b> playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> were upset by the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins in six games.|$|R
5|$|The 1924–25 season, {{the first}} year of NHL {{expansion}} to the United States, saw major changes in Ottawa's lineup. Jack Darragh retired and had died from appendicitis months after his final game. Making his debut in goal for Ottawa was Alex Connell, replacing Benedict. Replacing Broadbent was Hooley Smith, who had played for Canada in the 1924 Olympics. Lionel Hitchman was sold to the expansion Boston Bruins and replaced by Ed Gorman. It was also the debut season of Frank Finnigan. Off the ice, Gorman and Ahearn squabbled over ownership. In January 1925, during the season, Gorman sold his share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> to Ahearn and left the Senators organization, later joining the expansion New York Americans.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{consists}} of two chambers. It makes legislation and is empowered by the constitution to oversee {{the activities of the}} President and the Cabinet. The lower chamber is the Chamber of Deputies, which has 80 members serving five-year terms. Twenty-four of these seats are reserved for women, elected through a joint assembly of local government officials; another three seats are reserved for youth and disabled members; the remaining 53 are elected by universal suffrage under a proportional representation system. Following the 2013 election, there are 51 female deputies, up from 45 in 2008; , Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament. The upper chamber is the 26-seat Senate, whose members are selected by a variety of bodies. A mandatory minimum of 30% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senators</b> are women. Senators serve eight-year terms. (See also Gender equality in Rwanda).|$|E
5|$|The {{events were}} precipitated by an {{incident}} in the previous meeting between the two teams, when Ottawa's Martin Havlat had swung his stick at Mark Recchi's head. Just under two minutes {{before the end of}} the game, enforcers Donald Brashear of the Flyers and Rob Ray <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> engaged in a fight. As they skated off to the penalty box, Brashear became involved in another scrap, and the rest of the players on the ice for each team, including goaltenders Robert Esche and Patrick Lalime began to fight. On both of the next two face-offs to restart the game, further fights occurred. The first of these angered the Flyers management, who believed that the fights were deliberately unbalanced against their players.|$|E
50|$|After a 5-5-0 {{record in}} <b>the</b> first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season, <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> {{would go on}} to a 7-1-0 record in the second half.|$|R

5|$|When no {{help was}} {{forthcoming}} and {{the armies of}} the combined nations occupied Warsaw, the capital, to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative could be chosen save passive submission to their will. Those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senators</b> who advised against this step were threatened by the Russians, represented by the ambassador, Otto von Stackelberg, who declared that {{in the face of}} refusal the whole of Warsaw would be destroyed by them. Other threats included execution, confiscation of estates, and further increases of partitioned territory; according to Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin, some senators were even arrested by the Russians and exiled to Siberia.|$|E
5|$|Around 66 BC, a {{movement}} to use constitutional, or at least peaceful, means to address the plight of various classes began. After several failures, the movement's leaders decided to use any means that were necessary to accomplish their goals. The movement coalesced under an aristocrat named Lucius Sergius Catilina. The movement was based {{in the town of}} Faesulae, which was not a natural hotbed of agrarian agitation. The rural malcontents were to advance on Rome, and be aided by an uprising within the city. After assassinating the consuls and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senators,</b> Catiline would be free to enact his reforms. The conspiracy was set in motion in 63 BC. The consul for the year, Marcus Tullius Cicero, intercepted messages that Catiline had sent in an attempt to recruit more members. As a result, the top conspirators in Rome (including at least one former consul) were executed by authorisation (of dubious constitutionality) of the senate, and the planned uprising was disrupted. Cicero then sent an army, which cut Catiline's forces to pieces.|$|E
5|$|In 1916–17, {{the last}} {{season of the}} NHA, Ottawa won {{the second half of}} the split schedule. An Army team, the Toronto 228th Battalion, {{composed}} of enlisted professional players, joined the league before leaving for war after the first half-season. When the Battalion left, the other Toronto team, the Blueshirts was suspended by the league and its players dispersed including Corb Denneny, brother of Cy Denneny, who joined the Senators. Future Hall of Famer Cy had been picked up in a trade with Toronto earlier that season and he would be a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Senators</b> until 1928. Benedict was the NHA's top goaltender once again, and Nighbor tied for the scoring lead with 41 goals in 19 games. As second-half winners, the Senators played off in a series with the Canadiens, the first-half winners. The Senators ended their play in the NHA by losing a two-game total goals playoff series to the Canadiens, who eventually lost to Seattle in the Stanley Cup final. This season saw the final decline of Ottawa's old rivals, the Wanderers, who finished at the bottom of the standings. The next year, the Wanderers played only four games in the NHL, winning only one before folding the franchise after their home arena burned down.|$|E

50|$|Although a hold {{is placed}} anonymously, <b>the</b> {{identity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> placing <b>the</b> hold can quickly become common knowledge. Under traditional dictates <b>of</b> Senate courtesy, <b>the</b> identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holder {{is not made}} public. However, senators have become increasingly willing to identify colleagues who place holds, in all but name.|$|R
25|$|Good fortune came to {{the rescue}} when Casanova, unhappy with his lot as a musician, saved <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> a Venetian nobleman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bragadin family, who had a stroke while riding with Casanova in a gondola after a wedding ball. They {{immediately}} stopped to have <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> bled. Then, at <b>the</b> <b>senator's</b> palace, a physician bled <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> again and applied an ointment <b>of</b> mercury to <b>the</b> <b>senator's</b> chest (mercury was an all-purpose but toxic remedy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time). The mercury raised his temperature and induced a massive fever, and Bragadin appeared to be choking on his own swollen windpipe. A priest was called as death seemed to be approaching. However, despite protests from the attending physician, Casanova ordered <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ointment and <b>the</b> washing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>senator's</b> chest with cool water. <b>The</b> <b>senator</b> recovered from his illness with rest and a sensible diet. Because of his youth and his facile recitation <b>of</b> medical knowledge, <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> and his two bachelor friends thought Casanova wise beyond his years, and concluded that he must be in possession of occult knowledge. As they were cabalists themselves, <b>the</b> <b>senator</b> invited Casanova into his household and became a lifelong patron.|$|R
