These strains were rod-shaped forms, grown at a pH 3. 5 limit, and tolerated 1 % oleuropein and 8 % NaCl in the growth medium.

40|$|Consumption of <b>olives</b> (<b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> L.) is {{associated}} with a low incidence of inflammation-related diseases. Olive fruit is rich in bioactive pentacyclic triterpenoids, mainly maslinic acid. This study, a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial, examined the effects of an orally administered maslinic acid supplement, olive fruit extract, on 20 middle-aged and elderly volunteers with mild knee joint pain. Each subject (58 ± 7 years) received either olive fruit extract, containing 50 mg maslinic acid (n = 12), or placebo (n = 8) daily for 12 weeks and evaluated for pain and physical functions as primary outcome measures. Secondary outcome measures included body composition and inflammatory biomarkers in serum. Although both groups exhibited improved pain visual analogue scale score and quality of life after supplementation, symptoms were better in the maslinic acid group than in the placebo group. After 12 weeks, maslinic acid group exhibited significant decrease in body weight and body mass index suggesting that maslinic acid affected the weight of volunteers with mild knee joint pain. Therefore, olive products containing maslinic acid may be useful as a new preventive and therapeutic food ingredient for arthritic diseases.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that whole-tree water consumption of <b>olives</b> (<b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> L.) is fruit load-dependent and investigated the driving physiological mechanisms. Fruit load was manipulated in mature olives grown in weighing-drainage lysimeters. Fruit was thinned or entirely removed from trees at three separate stages of growth: early, mid and late in the season. Tree-scale transpiration, calculated from lysimeter water balance, {{was found to be}} a function of fruit load, canopy size and weather conditions. Fruit removal caused an immediate decline in water consumption, measured as whole-plant transpiration normalized to tree size, which persisted {{until the end of the}} season. The later the execution of fruit removal, the greater was the response. The amount of water transpired by a fruit-loaded tree was found to be roughly 30 % greater than that of an equivalent low- or nonyielding tree. The tree-scale response to fruit was reflected in stem water potential but was not mirrored in leaf-scale physiological measurements of stomatal conductance or photosynthesis. Trees with low or no fruit load had higher vegetative growth rates. However, no significant difference was observed in the overall aboveground dry biomass among groups, when fruit was included. This case, where carbon sources and sinks were both not limiting, suggests that the role of fruit on water consumption involves signaling and alterations in hydraulic properties of vascular tissues and tree organs. </p...|$|E
40|$|Rosa, Raúl de la et al. Wild <b>olives</b> (<b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> subsp. europaea var. sylvestris) {{may offer}} new and {{interesting}} plant material {{which can be}} used either as rootstocks or genitors in breeding programs. Recent studies, carried out at in situ and ex situ level, and focused on morpho-agronomic and genetic (by means of SSRs, DArTs and cpDNA markers) diversity, have shown that wild olives include a great variability. In this sense, prospecting surveys have made possible the establishment of a collection of wild olive trees and related subspecies coming from different environmental conditions. The wild olive tree collection held at IFAPA, Cordoba, Spain, is being evaluated for agronomic characters of interest, including resistance to Verticillium dahliae Kleb. Additionally, in order to test the suitability of wild olives for breeding, the segregation of two open pollination progenies coming from a wild olive located in a forest in Cadiz, southern Spain, and 'Picual' respectively, were compared at both morpho-agronomical and molecular level. As expected, seedlings from the wild progeny produced fruits of low weight and oil content but also showed significantly shorter juvenile period than the ones coming from 'Picual' open pollination progeny. Similarly, seedlings from two progenies coming from the cross of 'Picual' with two wild olive trees showed shorter juvenile period than the one observed in the progenies coming from crosses between cultivars. Our results suggest the utility of wild germplasm in olive breeding that needs to be better known, evaluated and preserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{microbiome}} of {{the olive}} fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin), a worldwide pest of <b>olives</b> (<b>Olea</b> <b>europaea</b> L.), has been examined for > 100 yr as part of efforts to identify bacteria that are plant pathogens vectored by the fly or are beneficial endosymbionts essential for the fly's survival and thus targets for possible biological control. Because tephritid fruit flies feed on free-living bacteria in their environment, distinguishing between the transient, acquired bacteria of their diet and persistent, resident bacteria that are vertically transmitted endosymbionts is difficult. Several culture-dependent and -independent studies have identified a diversity of species in the olive fruit fly microbiome, {{but they have not}} distinguished the roles of the microbes. Candidatus Erwinia dacicola, has been proposed to be a coevolved endosymbiont {{of the olive}} fruit fly; however, this was based on limited samples from two Italian populations. Our study shows that C. Erwinia dacicola was present in all New and Old World populations and in the majority of individuals of all life stages sampled in 2 yr. Olive fruit flies reared on olives in the laboratory had frequencies of C. Erwinia dacicola similar to that of wild populations; however, flies reared on artificial diets containing antibiotics in the laboratory rarely had the endosymbiont. The relative abundance of C. Erwinia dacicola varied across development stages, being most abundant in ovipositing females and larvae. This uniform presence of C. Erwini dacicola suggests that it is a persistent, resident endosymbiont of the olive fruit fly. 10 page(s...|$|E
