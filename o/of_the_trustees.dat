30|$|Benevolence or malevolence is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key {{dimensions}} <b>of</b> trust or distrust.

Benevolence is different from credibility, which {{is believed to be}} associated with cognitive assessment of contracts, laws, and structural assurances (Williamson 1985). On the opposite note, malevolence is associated with the trustor’s emotional assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trustee’s</b> negative and/or harmful behavior. Malevolence is different from discredibility, which deals with the trustor’s cognitive assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> potential loss through <b>the</b> <b>trustee’s</b> incompetence and unreliability.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Trust is a {{construct}} {{of paramount importance}} in society. Ac-cordingly, computational trust is evolving fast {{in order to allow}} trust in artificial societies. Despite the advances in this research field, most com-putational trust approaches evaluate trust by estimating <b>the</b> trustwor-thiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agents under evaluation (<b>the</b> <b>trustees),</b> without however distinguishing between <b>the</b> different dimensions <b>of</b> trustworthiness, such as ability and benevolence. In this paper, we propose different techniques to extract <b>the</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> in <b>the</b> task at hand and to infer <b>the</b> benevolence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> toward <b>the</b> truster when the trust judgment is made. Moreover, we propose to dynamically change the relative im-portance and impact of both ability and benevolence on <b>the</b> perceived trustworthiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trustee,</b> taking into consideration <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the truster and <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> and <b>the</b> disposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> truster in the specific situation. Finally, we set an experimental scenario to evaluate our approach.

The model is tested using action research data collected from a network of local social service providers. Key findings include the following: (a) Successful past cooperation between a trustor and a trustee and structural equivalence increase the likelihood the trustor will perceive <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> as trustworthy; (b) <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> interactions between <b>the</b> trustor and <b>trustee,</b> trust transferability, and <b>the</b> perceived trustworthiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> have a direct, positive impact on whether the trustor trusts the trustee; and (c) trust between <b>the</b> trustor and <b>trustee</b> has {{a positive impact on}} expected future cooperation...|$|R
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939 Duxford was home to three RAF squadrons engaged on coastal patrol duties. From July 1940, Duxford saw considerable action during the Battle of Britain as a sector station of RAF Fighter Command's No. 12 Group. In the middle years of the war Duxford was home to specialist units, such as the tacticians and engineers of the Air Fighting Development Unit. In April 1942 the first Typhoon Wing was formed at Duxford. Notable among the pilots of the Wing was Group Captain John Grandy who would later rise to be Chief of the Air Staff and also served as Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trustees</b> of the Imperial War Museum from 1978 to 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial War Museum is an {{executive}} non-departmental public body under the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, {{from which it}} receives financial support {{in the form of}} a grant-in-aid. The governance of the museum is the responsibility of a Board of Trustees, originally established by the Imperial War Museum Act 1920, later amended by the Imperial War Museum Act 1955 and the Museums and Galleries Act 1992 and other relevant legislation. The board comprises a president (currently Prince Edward, Duke of Kent) who is appointed by the sovereign, and fourteen members appointed in varying proportions by the Prime Minister, and the Foreign, Defence, and Culture Secretaries. Seven further members are Commonwealth High Commissioners appointed ex officio by their respective governments. As of January 2012 the Chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trustees</b> is Sir Francis Richards and his deputy is Lieutenant-General Sir John Kiszely. Past chairmen have included Admiral Sir Deric Holland-Martin (1967–77), Admiral of the Fleet Sir Algernon Willis and Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir John Grandy (trustee 1971–78, Chairman 1978–89). During the Second World War Grandy had commanded RAF Duxford, and was chairman during the planning of Duxford's American Air Museum, which opened in 1997.|$|E

30|$|Osman et al. [17] {{describe}} {{a model that}} estimates <b>the</b> trust <b>of</b> a truster based on <b>the</b> <b>trustee’s</b> capability and willingness to execute a commitment. <b>The</b> willingness <b>of</b> a <b>trustee</b> to execute <b>the</b> commitment is computed using <b>the</b> <b>trustee’s</b> past behavior in executing similar commitments. <b>The</b> capability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> is computed by matching the capability needed for the current commitment with <b>the</b> capabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> observed in <b>the</b> past. Osman et al.’s model suffers from two important limitations: First, the model considers commitments {{as a set of}} actions to be performed by <b>the</b> <b>trustee,</b> thus omitting a formal representation as well as an operationalization (lifecycle) of commitments. This makes the model less intuitive with respect to its applicability on real-world data such as emails. Second, similar to Wang et al.’s [4] model, Osman et al.’s trust model needs the initial trust to be manually set. For example, the model considers the initial trust as zero which may not hold in different settings.|$|R

40|$|When do {{recipients}} of an apology (‘trustors’) base {{their decision to}} trust a perpetrator (a ‘trustee’) on the attributional information embedded in an apology? Attributions provide a detailed account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trustee’s</b> causal involvement in committing a transgression. We therefore argue that trustors in a low construal level mindset use this information in their trusting decision. However, trustors in a high construal level mindset likely consider all apologies as simple statements of regret, regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attributional information they contain. We find support for this argument in four laboratory experiments. This research nuances the idea that to restore trust by means <b>of</b> an apology, <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> must only use an effective attribution for a negative outcome. We also present a more realistic understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process leading from apologies to trust than has been offered in previous work by simultaneously considering <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trustor and that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trustee</b> in <b>the</b> trust restoration process...|$|R
