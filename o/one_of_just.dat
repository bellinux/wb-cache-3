5|$|Following {{the season}} eight Giants—tight end Mark Bavaro, {{offensive}} lineman Brad Benson, nose tackle Jim Burt, linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson, punter Sean Landeta, running back Morris, and defensive end Leonard Marshall—were selected to the Pro Bowl. Taylor, who recorded a league-leading 20.5 sacks, became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> three defensive players {{to win the}} NFL Most Valuable Player award and the only defensive player to ever win the award unanimously.* Sprechman and Shannon. pg. 13 Taylor also won his record third Defensive Player of the Year Award and coach Bill Parcells won his first NFL Coach of the Year Award.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 Taylor {{had one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} seasons by a defensive player in the history of the NFL. He recorded a league-leading 20.5 sacks and became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> two defensive players to win the NFL Most Valuable Player award and the only defensive player to be the unanimous selection for MVP. He also was named Defensive Player of the Year for the third time. The Giants finished the season 14–2 and outscored San Francisco and Washington by a combined score of 66–3 in the NFC playoffs. He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated alone the week leading up to Super Bowl XXI with a warning from the magazine to the Denver Broncos regarding Taylor. The Giants overcame a slow start in Super Bowl XXI to defeat Denver 39–20. Taylor made a key touchdown preventing tackle on a goal line play in the first half, stopping Broncos quarterback John Elway as he sprinted out on a rollout.|$|E
5|$|Koht {{graduated}} with a cand.philol. degree from the Royal Frederick University in 1896. He studied history with geography as a minor subject until 1895; his main history teacher was Gustav Storm. The next examination was in different languages, both classical and modern. Koht had the choice between Ancient Greek and Classical Latin or Norwegian and German (including Norse); he chose the Norwegian and German. In 1895, after finishing his history studies, he spent three months in the Mediterranean, travelling with three ships, the first from Norway to Venice, the second from Venice to Constantinople, the third back to Norway. He studied German literature during this travels. In December 1896 Koht was finally examined by Sophus Bugge and earned his degree. He was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> three students to be examined in Norwegian and German in late 1896, and {{had been the only}} candidate in history the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Maryland {{freshman}} {{wide receiver}} Torrey Smith, with his 99-yard kickoff return touchdown, broke the all-time ACC record for single-season kickoff returns with 1,089yards. Maryland running back Da'Rel Scott rushed for 174yards, earning Most Valuable Player honors alongside Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick who threw for 370yards. Scott set the University of Maryland's record for rushing {{yards in a}} bowl game, in what was just one-and-half quarters of playing time due to his curfew suspension. He also broke the 1,000-yard per season barrier, making him <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> seven players in school history to do so. Four Maryland back-ups who saw significant play due to the curfew suspensions also scored touchdowns: second-string X-receiver Torrey Smith, second-string slot receiver Ronnie Tyler, third-string slot receiver Adrian Cannon, and third-string running back Morgan Green.|$|E

The Rockies spent just three days, last on April 6, with a lead in the division.

The seniors who graduated following the Orange Bowl game were the winningest team in Virginia Tech history, becoming <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> three teams in Division I to win at least 10 games each of the previous four years. Junior Sean Glennon's second consecutive failure to win a bowl game, however, re-opened the question of whether he or Tyrod Taylor would be the Hokies' starter at quarterback in 2008.|$|E

5|$|The plank {{road was}} {{operational}} for about 38 years when a major flood on June 1, 1889 washed out much of it. The flood also destroyed the canal at the creek's mouth. The same storm system caused the Johnstown Flood, which killed over 2200 people. The Cogan House Covered Bridge {{was the only}} one on Larrys Creek to survive the flood, as a fallen tree formed a protective dam just upstream. The 90foot (27m) long Burr arch truss bridge was built in 1877, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, rehabilitated in 1998, and is today <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> three left in the county.|$|E

Thoroughly obsolete by that point, she saw little action and returned to barracks duties after the war. The ship remained in the fleet's inventory through the 1920s, being decommissioned in 1929 and broken up thereafter.|$|E

5|$|With 174yards, Da'Rel Scott set the Maryland {{record for}} rushing {{yards in a}} bowl game, despite playing just {{one and a half}} {{quarters}} due to his curfew suspension. The previous record was 165yards, set by Lu Gambino in Maryland's first bowl game, the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also broke the 1,000 yards-per-season barrier, making him <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> seven players in school history to do so. Scott said earlier in the year that reaching the 1,000-yard benchmark was a personal goal he set for the 2008 season. Between Scott and Davin Meggett, Maryland also came the closest it ever has to having both a 1,000- and 500-yard rusher in the same season. Meggett fell just 43yards shy of the 500-yard mark.|$|E
5|$|Pierce's 1954 {{season was}} {{interrupted}} when he reported {{pain in his}} left arm in a May 25 win over Cleveland; after several days of difficulty in determining the problem, he had oral surgery to remove an infected wisdom tooth and adjacent molar on June 3. He did not pitch again until June 20, but a lack of arm strength caused him to be ineffective in that start before slowly coming back with two relief appearances and another poor start, finally picking up wins with consecutive 3–0 shutouts on July 5 and 11, the latter being his fourth career two-hitter. It was later reported that the tooth problem had possibly existed as early as spring training, when Pierce initially suffered arm problems. But although he recorded only nine wins that season, he was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>just</b> four pitchers to defeat the Indians three times as they racked up a league-record 111 victories, after also having been one of four pitchers to defeat the champion Yankees four times in 1953.|$|E
