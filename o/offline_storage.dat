40|$|This paper focusses on the Carbon Footprint of IT-Services (CFIS) by {{presenting}} a {{comparative study of}} energy consumption for <b>Offline</b> and Online <b>Storage.</b> We therefore conducted a case study with an IT-Service provider as well as experimental simulation of customer’s ICT hardware. Based on literature review, we initially present related work and describe underlying concepts e. g.

Geared towards the framework we present a comparison of ICT-related energy consumptions for <b>Offline</b> and Online <b>Storage</b> as well as allocation and calculation approaches. Finally, presented carbon footprint results are {{discussed in terms of}} limitations and further research directions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the CMS trigger {{system and its}} performance during Run 1 of the LHC. The trigger system consists of two levels designed to select events of potential physics interest from a GHz (MHz) interaction rate of proton-proton (heavy ion) collisions. The first level of the trigger is implemented in hardware, and selects events containing detector signals consistent with an electron, photon, muon, Ï lepton, jet, or missing transverse energy. A programmable menu of up to 128 object-based algorithms is used to select events for subsequent processing. The trigger thresholds are adjusted to the LHC instantaneous luminosity during data taking in order to restrict the output rate to 100 kHz, the upper limit imposed by the CMS readout electronics. The second level, implemented in software, further refines {{the purity of the}} output stream, selecting an average rate of 400 Hz for <b>offline</b> event <b>storage.</b> The objectives, strategy and performance of the trigger system during the LHC Run 1 are described. 0 info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of the ATLAS Inner Detector (ID) trigger algorithms running online on the high level trigger (HLT) processor farm for 13 TeV LHC collision data with high pileup are discussed. The HLT ID tracking is a vital component in all physics signatures in the ATLAS Trigger for the precise selection of the rare or interesting events necessary for physics analysis without overwhelming the <b>offline</b> data <b>storage</b> {{in terms of both}} size and rate. To cope with the high expected interaction rates in the 13 TeV LHC collisions the ID trigger was redesigned during the 2013 - 15 long shutdown. The performance of the ID Trigger in the 2016 data from 13 TeV LHC collisions has been excellent and exceeded expectations as the interaction multiplicity increased throughout the year. The detailed efficiencies and resolutions of the trigger {{in a wide range of}} physics signatures are presented, to demonstrate how the trigger responded well under the extreme pileup conditions. The performance of the ID Trigger algorithms in the first data from the even higher interaction multiplicity collisions from 2017 are presented, and illustrates how the ID tracking continues to enable the ATLAS physics program currently, and will continue to do so in the future...|$|R

30|$|The {{majority}} of high-performance DVC systems {{make use of}} a feedback channel to solve the rate control problem. Such an approach, {{often referred to as}} decoder-driven rate control, sends non-systematic information in chunks[5]. Should the channel rate prove insufficient for proper decoding, the decoder is able to request a larger amount of non-systematic information from the encoder and attempt decoding anew. The process is repeated until decoding proves successful. In this way, the presence of a feedback channel not only guarantees decoding success but also ensures that this is achieved at a minimal channel rate. However, it is evident that a feedback-channel-based rate control scheme is incompatible with unidirectional application scenarios. Moreover, decoder-driven rate control links the encoding and decoding process. Consequently, feedback-channel-based DVC is unsuitable for <b>offline</b> applications, e.g. <b>storage</b> purposes, and may demonstrate excessive delay[9].|$|R
5000|$|Display {{was over}} an RF {{connection}} to a household television, and simple <b>offline</b> program <b>storage</b> was possible using a cassette recorder. The video display generator of the ZX80 used minimal hardware plus a combination of software to generate a video signal. This was an idea that was popularised by Don Lancaster in his 1978 book The TV Cheap Video Cookbook and his [...] "TV Typewriter". As {{a result of this}} approach the ZX80 could only generate a picture when it was idle, i.e. waiting for a key to be pressed. When running a BASIC program, or even when pressing a key for any input, the display would, therefore, blank out momentarily while the processor was busy. This made moving graphics difficult since the program had to introduce a pause for input to display the next change in graphical output. The later ZX81 improved on this somewhat because it could run in a [...] "slow" [...] mode while creating a video signal, or in a [...] "fast" [...] mode without generating a video signal (typically used for lengthy calculations). Another issue was that the main RAM was used to store the screen display, with the result that the available screen size would gradually decrease as the size of a program increased (and vice versa); with 1 KB RAM, running a 990 byte program would result in only one row of characters being visible on the screen; a full screen (32×24) would leave only 384 bytes to the programmer.|$|R
40|$|Few digital {{repository}} systems {{allow the}} creation of copies of a collection that can be viewed <b>offline</b> from distributable <b>storage</b> media such DVD-ROMs or flash drives. To date, the system closest to providing such functionality is the Greenstone Digital Library software suite (New Zealand Digital Library Project, 2009). It allows content to be viewed directly off a CD-ROM. However, the problem with Greenstone is that it requires the installation of several software packages including a Web server before this is possible. This project is aimed at demonstrating the feasibility of a digital repository system supporting {{the creation of}} distributable collections {{that can be used}} with no prior software installation. This is achieved through the use of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) technologies that are supported by all major Web browsers. CALJAX is the AJAX-based digital repository system developed.

30|$|The {{increase}} in the availability of bandwidth for wireless links, network integration, and the computational power on fixed and mobile platforms at affordable costs allows nowadays for the handling of audio and video data, their quality making them suitable for medical application.

The system is based on ITU-T H. 323 multimedia terminal recommendation, suitable for real-time data/video/audio and telemedical applications. The audio and video codecs, respectively, H. 264 and G 723.1, were implemented and optimized {{in order to obtain}} high performance on the system target processors. <b>Offline</b> media streaming <b>storage</b> and retrieval functionalities were supported by integrating a relational database in the hospital central system.

Implementation and testing were carried out for medical emergency and telemedicine application. In this paper, the emergency case study is described.|$|R
40|$|As the proliferation, {{reliance}} {{and importance}} of rich digital formats have increased over the years, so have demands on data storage capacity. However, backup technologies have not kept up with this trend. The traditional timestamp based Towers of Hanoi backup methodology cannot handle {{the sheer volume of}} data and backup windows have been significantly reduced due to the 24 hour online economy. This methodology also backs up the same content repeatedly, even if the content has not changed. This results in a flood of data transfer that can overwhelm networks and other critical resources. Over the same period of time disk technology has progressed in leaps and bounds, both in performance and more importantly, in reliability. In comparison to disks, tape technologies are still comparatively slow and the media tends to deteriorate over time. Additionally, there are the future hardware compatibility issues of trying to match a degraded tape to a working tape drive, not to mention the physical issues such as <b>offline</b> labeling and <b>storage.</b> To work around these issues several new backup and archival paradigms have been developed, however, these are mostly out of reach of the open source community due to cost and licensing issues. ...|$|R
