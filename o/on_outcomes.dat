5|$|Undertale is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} created by American indie developer and composer Toby Fox. In the game, players control a human {{child who has}} fallen into the Underground, a large, secluded region underneath {{the surface of the}} Earth, separated by a magic barrier. The player meets various monsters during a quest to return to the surface, mainly through the combat system; the player navigates through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent, and can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of murdering them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based <b>on</b> <b>outcomes.</b>|$|E

25|$|Transcortical aphasias include transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory aphasia, {{and mixed}} transcortical aphasia.

Patients with transcortical sensory and mixed transcortical aphasia have poor comprehension and unawareness of their errors. Despite poor comprehension and more severe deficits in some transcortical aphasias, small {{studies have indicated that}} full recovery is possible for all types of transcortical aphasia.

30|$|Conclusions: Time {{spent in}} ED had no {{negative}} impact <b>on</b> <b>outcome.</b> However, {{given the fact}} that the majority of patients admitted to ICU beds were cared in a devoted area with trained staff and full level III equipment, we hypothesize that what might impact the most <b>on</b> <b>outcome</b> is provision of early critical care.|$|R

25|$|In 2004, California {{became the}} first state to legally mandate minimum nurse-to-patient {{staffing}} ratios in acute care hospitals. A subsequent study evaluated the effect <b>on</b> <b>outcomes</b> for nurses and patients by comparing outcomes in California in the subsequent two years with those of New Jersey and Pennsylvania — two similar states without such mandates. There was substantial compliance with the mandate in California, with over 80% compliance rates reported across several different units of surveyed hospitals; equivalent levels of non-mandated compliance in the comparator states were considerably lower, at 19%, 52%, and 63% compliance in medical/surgical, pediatric, and intensive care units (ICUs) in New Jersey and 33%, 66%, and 71% in Pennsylvania. After extensive adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics, the study revealed statistically significant relationships between the nurse-to-patient ratio and 30-day mortality and failure to rescue (FTR — that is, failure to prevent a clinically-important deterioration, such as death or permanent disability, from a complication of an underlying illness or of medical care) in all three states. Across all three states, facilities with nurse-to-patient ratios consistent with those mandated in California were associated with lower rates of nursing burnout, and nurses reported consistently better quality of care.|$|E

2500|$|Eating or {{drinking}} during labour {{is an area}} of ongoing debate. While some have argued that eating in labour has no harmful effects <b>on</b> <b>outcomes,</b> others continue to have concern regarding the increased possibility of an aspiration event (choking on recently eaten foods) {{in the event of an}} emergency delivery due to the increased relaxation of the esophagus in pregnancy, upward pressure of the uterus on the stomach, and the possibility of general anesthetic in the event of an emergency cesarean. A 2013 Cochrane review found that with good obstetrical anaesthesia there is no change in harms from allowing eating and drinking during labour in those who are unlikely to need surgery. They additionally acknowledge that not eating does not mean there is an empty stomach or that its contents are not as acidic. They therefore conclude that [...] "women should be free to eat and drink in labour, or not, as they wish." ...|$|E

2500|$|Riessman's seminal article {{explored}} how nonprofessionals supported {{one another}} in self-help/mutual-aid support groups based on Riessman's observations of a sample of these groups, {{as well as his}} summary of the findings of research in the areas of social work, education, and leadership. This article suggested that although the [...] "use of people with a problem to help other people who have the same problem in [...] more severe form" [...] is [...] "an age-old therapeutic approach," [...] the traditional focus <b>on</b> <b>outcomes</b> for those receiving help to the exclusion of considering outcomes for those providing help is too narrow; instead, Riessman advocated for increased consideration of the experience of [...] "the individual that needs the help less, that is, the person who is providing the assistance" [...] because [...] "frequently it is he who improves!" [...] (p.27). Although Riessman expressed doubt that individuals receiving help always benefit from the assistance provided to them, he felt more sure that individuals providing help are likely experiencing important gains; thus, according to Riessman, the helping interaction at least {{has the potential to be}} mutually beneficial for both parties involved (i.e., for both the individual giving and for the individual receiving aid), but it is not absolutely necessary for the [...] "helpee" [...] to benefit in order for the [...] "helper" [...] to enjoy the benefits of helping. In instances where true mutual benefit occurs, the helper and helpee benefit in different ways, such that the person receiving help benefits by way of receiving whatever specific form of assistance is offered to them (e.g., emotional support, information, etc.) while the person providing help benefits by the very act of providing help, regardless of the type of aid they provide.|$|E

40|$|Movement variability, {{while being}} a topic {{discussed}} extensively throughout the movement sciences, {{is still not}} understood. The effect of movement variability <b>on</b> <b>outcome</b> has not been ascertained. In particular, {{there has been a}} dearth of research investigating movement variability in the golf swing. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the effect of movement variability <b>on</b> <b>outcome</b> and outcome variability. Using experimental methods, the initial aim of this thesis was to quantify movement variability of sixteen participants and investigate the relationship between the quantified movement variability and outcome variability in the golf swing. The results indicated no statistically significant relationship between movement variability and outcome variability either in the backswing or downswing phase of the swing. Following this, modelling methods were used in the investigation of movement variability <b>on</b> <b>outcome</b> in the golf swing. Firstly, a computer model of a participant’s golf swing was created and validated. Then a method to apply movement variability at single anatomical points to the computer model was developed. Subsequently, different levels of movement variability were applied to single anatomical points in the computer model. The results revealed there was no practical effect <b>on</b> <b>outcome.</b> In order to investigate movement variability of measures more complex than single anatomical points, the final stage of this thesis investigated the movement variability of a multi-segment measure, torso-pelvic separation angle. Torso–pelvic separation angle was quantified for all sixteen participants. The results revealed no significant relationship between movement variability in this measure and outcome variability. Applied movement variability in this measure to the validated computer model created previously, revealed no practical effect <b>on</b> <b>outcome.</b> Collectively, the results of this thesis indicate that movement variability has no effect <b>on</b> <b>outcome</b> beyond the natural variation range of the participant at the elite level of performance. These findings have implications for coaching the golf swing in that it is important for golf coaches to understand the effect of variability relative to shot outcome for each individual. At the elite level, advocating an invariant swing may not lead to a more consistent shot outcome...|$|R
