In this review, we discuss the use and effectiveness of <b>omacetaxine</b> <b>mepesuccinate</b> in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, with coverage of its pharmacology, mode of action, and pharmacokinetics.

40|$|To the editor: Activity of <b>omacetaxine</b> <b>mepesuccinate</b> against ponatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-positive cells Abelson {{murine leukemia}} viral {{oncogene}} homolog (ABL) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib have improved {{the survival of}} Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -positive leukemia patients. 1 However, despite the impressive efficacy of these agents, disease relapse has been frequently ob-served. Mutations in the breakpoint region cluster protein (BCR) -ABL kinase domain can cause ABL TKI-resistance. 2 One particular BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation, T 315 I, {{is associated with a}} high level of resistance to all available ABL TKIs. Ponatinib (AP 24534) is a multitarget TKI.

Using BCR-ABL-expressing myelogenous and lymphoid cell lines and mouse models of CML and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) induced by wild type BCR-ABL or T 315 I mutant-BCR-ABL, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of omacetaxine on CML and B-ALL. We demonstrated that more than 90 % of the leukemic stem cells were killed after treatment with omacetaxine in vitro. In contrast, less than 9 % or 25 % of the leukemic stem cells were killed after treating with imatinib or dasatinib, respectively. After 4 days of treatment of CML mice with omacetaxine, Gr- 1 +myeloid leukemia cells decreased in the peripheral blood of the treated CML mice. In the omacetaxine treated B-ALL mice, only 0. 8 % B 220 +leukemia cells were found in peripheral blood, compared with 34 % B 220 +leukemia cells in the placebo group.

40|$|<b>Omacetaxine</b> <b>mepesuccinate</b> (hereafter {{referred}} to as omacetaxine) is a protein translation inhibitor approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for adult patients with chronic myeloid leukemia with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The objective {{was to investigate the}} metabolite profile of omacetaxine in plasma, urine and faeces samples collected up to 72 h after a single 1. 25 -mg/m 2 subcutaneous dose of 14 C-omacetaxine in cancer patients. High-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (MS) (high resolution) in combination with off-line radioactivity detection was used for metabolite identification. In total, six metabolites of omacetaxine were detected. The reactions represented were mepesuccinate ester hydrolysis, methyl ester hydrolysis, pyrocatechol conversion from the 1, 3 -dioxole ring. Unchanged omacetaxine was the most prominent omacetaxine-related compound in plasma. In urine, unchanged omacetaxine was also dominant, together with 4 ′-DMHHT. In feces very little unchanged omacetaxine was found and the pyrocatechol metabolite of omacetaxine, M 534 and 4 ′-desmethyl homoharringtonine (4 ′-DMHHT) was the most abundant metabolites. Omacetaxine was extensively metabolized, with subsequent renal and hepatic elimination of the metabolites. The low levels of the metabolites found in plasma indicate that the metabolites are unlikely to contribute materially to the efficacy and/or toxicity of omacetaxine...|$|E
40|$|Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is {{maintained}} by a rare population of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) -insensitive malignant stem cells. Our long-term {{aim is to}} find a BcrAbl-independent drug that can be combined with a TKI to improve overall disease response in chronic-phase CML. <b>Omacetaxine</b> <b>mepesuccinate,</b> a first in class cetaxine, has been evaluated by clinical trials in TKI-insensitive/resistant CML. Omacetaxine inhibits synthesis of anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl- 2 family, including (myeloid cell leukaemia) Mcl- 1, leading to cell death. Omacetaxine effectively induced apoptosis in primary CML stem cells (CD 34 + 38 lo) by downregulation of Mcl- 1 protein. In contrast to our previous findings with TKIs, omacetaxine did not accumulate undivided cells in vitro. Furthermore, the functionality of surviving stem cells following omacetaxine exposure was significantly reduced in a dose-dependant manner, as determined by colony forming cell and the more stringent long-term culture initiating cell colony assays. This stem cell-directed activity was not limited to CML stem cells as both normal and non-CML CD 34 + cells were sensitive to inhibition. Thus, although omacetaxine is not leukaemia stem cell specific, its ability to induce apoptosis of leukaemic stem cells distinguishes it from TKIs and creates the potential for a curative strategy for persistent disease...|$|E

To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of omacetaxine, sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays for the quantification of omacetaxine and its inactive 4 '-des-methyl (4 '-DMHHT) and cephalotaxine metabolites in human plasma and urine were developed and validated. Since omacetaxine is mainly metabolised by esterases, the plasma samples were immediately stabilised after collection with an esterase inhibitor and stored at a nominal temperature of - 80. °C. Urine samples were stored at - 80. °C immediately after collection. Protein precipitation was applied as the sample pretreatment method for the plasma samples, and urine samples were processed using solid-phase extraction (SPE). For both assays, the dried and reconstituted extracts were injected on a XBridge BEH Phenyl column for analysis of all analytes. Gradient elution was applied with 0. 1 % formic acid in water and methanol as mobile phases. Analytes were ionised using a turbospray ionisation source in positive mode and detected with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The validated plasma assay quantifies all analytes in the concentration range of 0. 1 - 100. ng/mL and the urine assay in the range of 0. 1 - 50. ng/mL. At all concentrations, the accuracies were within ± 15 % of the nominal concentrations and precisions were ≤ 15 %.

40|$|Background <b>Omacetaxine</b> <b>mepesuccinate</b> is {{indicated}} in adults with chronic myeloid leukemia resistant and/or intolerant to ≥ 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatments. This phase I study assessed the disposition, elimination, {{and safety of}} 14 C-omacetaxine in patients with solid tumors. Methods The study comprised a 7 -days pharmacokinetic assessment followed by a treatment period of ≤ six 28 -days cycles. A single subcutaneous dose of 1. 25  mg/m 2 14 C-omacetaxine was administered to six patients. Blood, urine, and feces were collected through 168  h or until radioactivity excreted within 24  h was < 1  % of the dose. Total radioactivity (TRA) was measured in all matrices and concentrations of omacetaxine, 4 ′-desmethylhomoharringtonine (4 ′-DMHHT), and cephalotaxine were measured in plasma and urine. For each treatment cycle, patients received 1. 25  mg/m 2 omacetaxine twice daily for 7  days. Results Mean TRA recovered was approximately 81  % of the dose, with {{approximately half of the}} radioactivity recovered in feces and half in urine. Approximately 20  % of the dose was excreted unchanged in urine; cephalotaxine (0. 4  % of dose) and 4 ′ DMHHT (9  %) were also present. Plasma concentrations of TRA were higher than the sum of omacetaxine and known metabolites, suggesting the presence of other 14 C-omacetaxine-derived compounds. Fatigue and anemia were common, consistent with the known toxicity profile of omacetaxine. Conclusion Renal and hepatic processes contribute to the elimination of 14 C-omacetaxine-derived radioactivity in cancer patients. In addition to omacetaxine and its known metabolites, other 14 C-omacetaxine-derived materials appear to be present in plasma and urine. Omacetaxine was adequately tolerated, with no new safety signals...|$|E
