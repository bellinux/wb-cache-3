40|$|To {{understand}} the nature of the mutation in type I collagen genes in cells from an infant with the perinatal lethal form of <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> (<b>type</b> <b>II),</b> we cloned and sequenced almost 2 kilobases of a normal alpha 1 (I) collagen gene and the corresponding region of a mutant alpha 1 (I) gene from cell strain CRL 1262. The mutant gene had undergone recombination between two non-homologous introns, which resulted in the loss of three exons coding for 84 amino acids in the triple-helical domain. The deletion predicted the loss of amino acid residues surrounding and including the methionine at the junction between the CNBr peptides alpha 1 (I) CB 8 and alpha 1 (I) CB 3, a result confirmed by analysis of the cleavage peptides from the product of the mutant gene.

40|$|SummaryProlyl {{hydroxylation}} is {{a critical}} posttranslational modification that affects structure, function, and turnover of target proteins. Prolyl 3 -hydroxylation occurs at only one position in the triple-helical domain of fibrillar collagen chains, and its biological significance is unknown. CRTAP shares homology with a family of putative prolyl 3 -hydroxylases (P 3 Hs), {{but it does not}} contain their common dioxygenase domain. Loss of Crtap in mice causes an osteochondrodysplasia characterized by severe osteoporosis and decreased osteoid production. CRTAP can form a complex with P 3 H 1 and cyclophilin B (CYPB), and Crtapâ/â bone and cartilage collagens show decreased prolyl 3 -hydroxylation. Moreover, mutant collagen shows evidence of overmodification, and collagen fibrils in mutant skin have increased diameter consistent with altered fibrillogenesis. In humans, CRTAP mutations are associated with the clinical spectrum of recessive <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> including the <b>type</b> <b>II</b> and VII forms. Hence, dysregulation of prolyl 3 -hydroxylation is a mechanism for connective tissue disease...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{prenatal}} diagnosis of skeletal dysplasias {{in a single}} center over a ten-years period. METHODS: All antenatal detected skeletal dysplasias during the period January 1 st 1996 until December 31 2005 (10 years) were retrieved from the genetic database. This database includes all skeletal dysplasias where invasive prenatal diagnosis (chorionic villus sampling/amniocentesis) was performed. The final diagnosis was sought {{on the basis of}} fetopathological examination, radiographic studies and if possible molecular testing. RESULTS: A total of 46 antenatal skeletal dysplasias were diagnosed during this period. Follow-up was only available in 38 cases. The other 8 cases involved prenatally presumed lethal skeletal dysplasias that were interrupted in the referral hospital with no further information sent to us. The mean gestational age at diagnosis was 23 weeks (range 12 - 33 weeks). A diagnosis 30 weeks (29 %) and these included all achondroplasias (n = 6), hypophosphatasia (n = 1), Jeune syndrome (n = 1), <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> <b>type</b> <b>II</b> (n = l), type I (n = 1) and type III (n = 1). In 27 cases a lethal skeletal dysplasia was present (71 %) and these were all correctly predicted. Of the lethal skeletal dysplasias 5 cases were diagnosed only after 24 weeks of pregnancy (19 %) and 3 were only referred after 30 weeks (11. 5 %). A final diagnosis was obtained in 36 cases by fetopathological examination and radiographic studies and molecular testing as deemed necessary. Specific diagnoses included: achondroplasia (n = 6), achondrogenesis (n = 2), <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> <b>type</b> <b>II</b> (n = 9), osteogenesis imperfecta type I (n = 1), osteogenesis imperfecta type III (n = 1), thanatophoric dysplasia (n = 7), hypophosphatasia (n = 1), Majewski syndrome (n = 11), Mohr-Majewski syndrome (n = 11), Jeune syndrome (n = 2), Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (n = 2), Roberts syndrome (n = 1), campomelic dysplasia (n = 2). In two cases postnatal investigation revealed no certain diagnosis and these included one patient with symmetrical tetraphocomelia with aspects of Roberts and Femur-fibula-Ulna syndrome and one patient at 15 weeks with a lethal skeletal dysplasia with rhizomelic limb shortening, a narrow thorax, platyspondyly, normocephaly, a normal pelvis, and a posterior cleft palate. A correct antenatal diagnosis was made in 25 cases (65. 8 %) including <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> <b>type</b> <b>II</b> (n = 9), thanatophoric dysplasia (n = 7), achondroplasia (n = 6), achondrogenesis (n = 2) and Roberts syndrome (n = 1).

In 65 families for which there were complete data on sibship size, there was recurrence of the OI <b>type</b> <b>II</b> phenotype in five families such that six (8. 6 %) of 70 sibs were affected. In two families with recurrence, the radiographic phenotype was milder than that for the remainder; {{and one of those}} families was consanguinous, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance.

In studies of collagens synthesized by cells from 43 infants, we identified two probands with separate rearrangements in an allele of one of the genes of type I collagen; but in the rest there were subtle mutations that disrupted the normal triple-helix structure of type I collagen molecules. In two probands we identified de novo mutations; in 16 additional families cells from the parents made only normal collagens, compatible with new mutations in their offsprings.

40|$|The {{culture of}} skin {{fibroblasts}} {{in the presence}} of 0. 01 % (w/v) dextran sulphate results in complete proteolytic processing of procollagen to collagen. Processing occurs predominantly via a pN-collagen intermediate, suggesting that C-propeptide cleavage occurs early during the processing pathway. The processed collagen is associated with the cell-layer fraction. This method of inducing procollagen processing was evaluated for use in detecting procollagen processing abnormalities in heritable connective-tissue diseases. Abnormal type I procollagen processing was clearly demonstrated in two cases with known defects of pN-propeptide cleavage. In one, the cleavage deficiency was due to diminished N-proteinase activity (dermatosparaxis) and in the other case (Ehler's-Danlos syndrome type VIIA) the cleavage site was deleted. In a case of <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> (<b>type</b> <b>II)</b> the slow electrophoretic migration of type I collagen alpha-chains due to over-modification of lysine was readily demonstrated. Inefficient procollagen processing was also evident in this patient, as had been previously reported [de Wet, Pihlanjaniemi, Myers, Kelly & Prockop (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7721 - 7728].

40|$|A single base {{mismatch}} {{was detected}} by a chemical cleavage method in heteroduplexes formed between patient mRNA and a control collagen Î± 2 (I) cDNA probe {{in a case of}} <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> <b>type</b> <b>II.</b> The region of the mRNA mismatch was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction, cloned and sequenced. A heterozygous point mutation of G to C at base pair 1, 774 of the collagen Î± 2 (I) mRNA resulted in the substitution of glycine with arginine at amino acid position 457 of the helix. Type I collagen of Î± 1 (I) - and Î± 2 (I) -chains from the patient migrated slowly on electrophoresis due to increased levels of posttranslational modification of lysine. The parents' fibroblast collagen did not contain the mRNA mismatch and the collagens showed normal electrophoretic behaviour. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the CNBr peptides from the patient's collagen confirmed the excessive posttranslational modification of the Î± 1 (I) - and Î± 2 (I) -chains in the CNBr peptides N-terminal to the mutation due to disruption of the obligatory Gly-X-Y triplet repeat of the helix. The mutation led to reduced procollagen secretion and helix destabilization as evidenced by a decreased thermal stability. These data lend further support to the accumulating evidence that type I collagen Î± 2 (I) glycine substitution mutations result in the same spectrum of clinical severity as those in the Î± 1 (I) -chain. The disruptive effect of the glycine mutations seems to be largely dependent {{on the nature of the}} substituted amino acid, the position in the Î±-chain of the mutation, and the nature of the local surrounding amino acid sequence, rather than whether the mutation resides in the Î± 1 (I) - or Î± 2 (I) -chain.
