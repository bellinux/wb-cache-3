5|$|After {{holding out}} in Arnhem for four nights and three days, the 2nd Parachute Battalion {{surrendered}} overnight. At Oosterbeek there was around 3,000 {{men of the}} 1st Airborne Division dug in to form a perimeter. Everything including ammunition was now in short supply and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> not eaten for over twenty-four hours.|$|E
5|$|The KRRC's 3rd Battalion, {{including}} {{a platoon of}} 70 Rhodesians, was transferred from France to the Salonika Front in 1915. On this comparatively quiet front, they were slowly whittled down {{over the course of}} the war: 26 of them remained in January 1917, and by the end of the war so few were left that the platoon no longer existed. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> been killed in action, while others were prisoners of the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E

25|$|At Hui-tse, {{south of}} Dali in China, the mission reached its climax {{in the death}} of the expedition's leader, de Lagrée, on 12 March 1868 after the health and {{condition}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> begun to seriously deteriorate and malaria was widespread north of Luang Prabang near the Chinese frontier.|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} of the cell phone calls made by {{passengers}} indicate that all the hijackers they saw were wearing red bandanas. The calls also indicated that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> tied a box around his torso, and claimed there was a bomb inside; it is not known which hijacker this was.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the Indonesian army {{evacuated}} {{hundreds of}} Christian {{refugees from the}} remote Kesui and Teor islands in Maluku after the refugees stated {{that they had been}} forced to convert to Islam. According to reports, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> been circumcised against their will, and a paramilitary group involved in the incident confirmed that circumcisions had taken place while denying any element of coercion.|$|E

25|$|Guantanamo Bay murder accusations {{were made}} {{regarding}} {{the deaths of}} three prisoners on June 10, 2006 at the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camp for enemy combatants at its naval base in Cuba. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> been cleared by the military for release. The United States Department of Defense (DOD) claimed their deaths {{at the time as}} suicides, although their families and the Saudi government argued against the findings, and numerous journalists have raised questions then and since. The DOD undertook an investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, published in redacted form in 2008.|$|E
25|$|Once on {{the ground}} the paratroopers regrouped. Most of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 517th PIR reached their {{assembly}} areas shortly after dawn, and the British troops who had landed near Callas arrived later in the morning. The bulk of the troops who landed outside of the immediate area joined their parent units on D+1, but the last scattered elements did not arrive until D+5. Overall, less than 40 percent of the troops in the pre-dawn drops landed in their zones, and by dawn at 06:00, only about 60 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> assembled in the Le Muy area.|$|E
25|$|The {{attack was}} the product of careful planning. Quantrill had been able to gain the {{confidence}} of many of the leaders of independent Bushwhacker groups, and chose the day and time of the attack well in advance. The different groups of Missouri riders approached Lawrence from the east in several independent columns, and converged with well-timed precision in the final miles before Lawrence during the pre-dawn hours of the chosen day. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> been riding for over 24 hours to make the rendezvous and had lashed themselves to their saddles to keep riding if they fell asleep. Almost all were armed with multiple six-shot revolvers.|$|E

25|$|The {{standoff}} {{continued as}} locals kept the place surrounded {{until the next}} morning when, cautiously entering, the authorities found two dead bodies, both with numerous bullet wounds to the arms and legs. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> a bullet wound in the forehead and the other had a bullet hole in the temple. The local police report speculated that, judging from {{the positions of the}} bodies, one bandit had probably shot his fatally wounded partner-in-crime to put him out of his misery, just before killing himself with his final bullet. In the following investigation by the Tupiza police, the bandits were identified as the men who robbed the Aramayo payroll transport, but the Bolivian authorities didn't know their real names, nor could they positively identify them.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish {{fortress}} of Svartholm under command of Major Carl Magnus Gripenberg was ill-prepared for a war. While the garrison was 700 men strong {{only a third}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> actually functioning weapons {{while most of the}} fortress' guns had no carriages. The fortress had fallen into disrepair and lacked both adequate food and ammunition stores. Even the wells were found to be unusable. After starting the siege on 21 February the Russians issued a surrender demand for the fort but refused by the Swedes. The demand was repeated on 2 March but without success. After a meager Russian bombardment Gripenberg agreed to negotiations on 10 March. The fortress surrendered to the Russians on 18 March after a siege that had lasted roughly a month with just one man having been wounded in action.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Israel’s {{national}} {{legislative body}} the Knesset adopted new legislation barring insurance companies from providing coverage to Israeli citizens who travel abroad to purchase organs. The move was partly {{a response to}} an investigation in which Israeli authorities arrested several men involved in mediating transplants of Chinese prisoners’ organs for Israelis. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> stated in an undercover interview that the organs came from “people who oppose the regime, those sentenced to death and from prisoners of the Falun Gong.” In addition to prohibiting citizens from buying organs overseas, the law also imposed criminal charges on organ traffickers. The new rules resulted in {{a significant decrease in}} the number of Israeli citizens seeking transplants abroad, while also helping to catalyze an expansion of the voluntary donor registry domestically.|$|E
50|$|Maigret, {{aware that}} three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>have</b> children, {{does not take}} any action; in a month's time it will be ten years since the crime, and {{prosecution}} will not be possible.|$|R

50|$|The {{offences}} {{only came}} to light after police seized videos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>having</b> sex, which they had filmed for their own personal use. All <b>the</b> <b>men</b> were either lovers, ex-boyfriends, or friends of friends.|$|R
25|$|On 5 November 1962 the Østre Senterfelt Mine {{experienced}} an explosion, which killed 21 of the 25 men which {{were on the}} shift. The rescue operation provided difficult, and by 9 November only ten <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> been found. The Ministry of Industry appointed a commission, led by Finn Midbøe, to investigate the accident. The arrived on 9 November and departed on the 16 November with the last coal ship to avoid being frozen stuck at Ny-Ålesund for the winter. Thus it never {{had an opportunity to}} enter the mine. The fire continued, while the lower levels were flooded. Permission to drain the shafts were never given, and the deceased were never brought up. Production continued in the new Vestre Senterfelt, while Østre Senterfelt remained closed, with 102 employees staying the winter.|$|E
25|$|In Royal Indian Navy (RIN) service, crewing LCAs {{followed}} {{somewhat similar}} lines. By mid-1941 {{members of the}} RIN Reserve and RIN Volunteer Reserve were being trained to operate LCA. In 1942, the RIN began receiving four battalions of Indian army troops to provide crews for landing craft. Seven hundred soldiers of the 9/1st Punjab Regiment volunteered for such a transfer in February 1943. The 15/13th Frontier Force Rifles Regiment voted similarly. These battalions were transferred {{despite the fact that}} few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> ever seen the sea. Their training suffered severely from lack of landing craft, spares, and trained instructors. From around mid-1943 there was also a Burma Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in existence working closely among LCA and LCS crews. By 1945, the BRNVR seems to have been formed into the 59th Motor Launch Flotilla. In all likelihood, it had been put together at least partly from those with maritime experience escaping from the 1942 Japanese onslaught in Burma.|$|E
25|$|After the Italian Government's {{surrender}} in September 1943, Nazi armies marched {{south to}} occupy most of Italy. The German Wehrmacht occupied the {{town for the}} next several months. Allied raids induced the Germans to evacuate the population of the whole town just before Christmas 1943. Thousands of the town's inhabitants were evicted from their homes and forced to endure significant hardships and deportations. The only major structural loss from the war was the destruction of the historic Mulino or town mill by the retreating German troops. When the Pacentrani returned however, they found their crops ruined, animals slaughtered and personal property stolen. Pacentro was finally liberated by British Troops and Italian partisans on 9 June 1944. After the war, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> to emigrate to other parts of Italy, the United States, South America or Australia to find work. This eventually led to the severe depopulation of the town by the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war on 4 August 1914 the Kent RGA went to its war stations manning the coast artillery and the Heavy Battery mobilised at Faversham. After mobilisation, units of the TF were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service, and on 15 August the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, {{the formation of a}} reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Thus were formed the 1/1st and 2/1st Home Counties (Kent) Heavy Bys.|$|E
25|$|When war was {{declared}} in Europe in 1914, {{there was only}} one military hospital in Van, Turkey, which was soon overcrowded with wounded and sick people. The conditions were extremely bad; There were only two surgeons and no nurses, only male soldiers helping. The conditions on the whole in the Ottoman army were almost bad beyond description. Soldiers, even at the front and who received the best care in comparative terms, were often (a) undernourished, (b) underclothed; troops deployed at high altitude in the mountains of Eastern Anatolia often had only summer clothes; Ottoman soldiers in Palestine often took great risks just to rob the British dead of their boots and even clothing; and (c) largely suffering from diseases (primarily cholera and typhus), which took many more lives than the actual fighting. The German general Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein, in a report he wrote to army group headquarters on 20 October 1917, describes how a division (the 24th) that departed from Istanbul-Haydarpaşa Terminal with 10,057 men arrived at the Palestinian Front with only 4,635. 19% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> to be admitted to hospitals since they were suffering from various diseases, 24% had deserted and 8% were allocated on the way to various local needs.|$|E
25|$|On April 17, a Surratt {{neighbor}} told US {{military authorities}} that he overheard {{one of the}} Surratt's servants saying that three men {{had come to the}} house on the night of Lincoln's assassination and that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>had</b> mentioned Booth in a theater. (The servant was mistaken about the date, as John Surratt, Jr. had indeed been in Elmira, New York, on a mission for a Confederate general). Other pieces of information also mentioned the boarding house as a key meeting place of the possible conspirators. Either Colonel Henry H. Wells, Provost Marshal (head of the military police) of the District of Columbia, or General Christopher C. Augur told Colonel Henry Steel Olcott to arrest everyone in the house. Federal soldiers visited the Surratt boarding house again late on the evening of April 17. John, Jr., could not be found, but after a search of the house, the agents found in Mary's room a picture of Booth, hidden behind another photograph, pictures of Confederate leaders including Jefferson Davis, a pistol, a mold for making bullets, and percussion caps. As Mary was being arrested for conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Powell appeared at her door in disguise. Although Surratt denied knowing him, Powell claimed that he was a laborer hired by Surratt to dig a ditch the next morning. The discrepancy and Powell's unusually well-groomed appearance, quite unlike a ditch-digger, prompted his arrest. He was later identified as the man who had attempted to assassinate Secretary of State William Seward.|$|E
