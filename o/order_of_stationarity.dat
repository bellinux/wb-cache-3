So the preliminary analyses involves checking the stationarity {{of all the}} variables using unit root analyses or in other words {{to know about the}} order of the integration. The analyses of stationarity is carried out by two commonly used methods i.e. Phillips and Perron (1988) PP and Dickey and Fuller (1979) ADF.

40|$|In [5] {{we define}} a {{stationary}} tangent process, or a locally optimal stationary approximation, {{to a real}} non-stationary smooth Gaussian process. This paper extends the idea by constructing a discrete tangent – a “locally” optimal stationary approximation – for a discrete time, real Gaussian process. Analogously to the smooth case, our construction relies on a generalization of the recursion formula for the orthogonal polynomials of the spectral distribution function. More precisely, we use a generalization of the Schur parameters to identify the stationary tangent. By way of discretizing, we later demonstrate how this tangent {{can be used to}} obtain “good” local stationary approximations to non-smoothcontinuous time, real Gaussian processes. Further, we demonstrate how, analogously to the curvatures in the smooth case, the Schur parameters can be used to determine the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>stationarity</b> of a non-smoothprocess...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to examine the}} short and the long-run interrelationships between savings, investment, foreign capital inflows and economic growth in India for the period 1950 to 2005. The analysis firstly tests for the short-run dynamic effects of savings and investment on growth (consistent with the Solow-Swan model) and the long-run effects of savings and investment on growth (in line with the endogenous AK models of growth). Secondly, the investigation is extended to examine the interrelationships between sectoral savings and investment and their roles in the growth process. Since independence, the Indian economy has been subject to numerous wars, structural changes, regime shifts and economic reforms during the sample period. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} apply unit root tests which take into account endogenously determined structural breaks. This study not only applies the traditional unit root tests of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and the Phillip-Perron, it goes further by applying Perron’s (1997) innovational outlier and additive outlier model tests; and the Lee and Strazicich (2003) Minimum Lagrange Multiplier unit root test. These tests determine endogenously the likely time of the major structural breaks in the Indian economy which removes the bias of incorrectly non-rejecting the null of unit root. Unit root tests indicate that the variables under consideration are of mixed stationary and non-stationary order. Furthermore, these tests reveal that the major economic changes in the country occurred during the 1960 s and 1980 s with the Green revolution (starting in 1967), along with the wars with China (1962) and Pakistan (1965); the severe droughts (1965 - 1967); the balance of payments crisis (1966); the economic reforms that took place under Rajiv Gandhi’s tenure in the mid- 1980 s and the balance of payments crisis of 1990, before the formal deregulation of the Indian economy which started in 1991. Endogenous growth models are estimated to examine the interrelationships between gross domestic product (GDP), gross domestic savings, gross domestic investment and foreign capital inflows. The analysis is further extended to include the three sectors of savings and investment, household, private corporate and public. The estimations are undertaken with both cointegration and error-correction modelling, in the presence of structural breaks. These empirical estimations combine the short-term information with the long-run, consistent with the Solow and the endogenous AK models of growth. As the variables under consideration are of a mixed <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>stationarity</b> and non-stationarity, this study uses the bounds testing approach to cointegration to determine the long-run relationship between variables. The study also examines the long-run and short-run coefficients using the autoregressive distributed lag approach through the error correction mechanism. The empirical estimations indicate firstly, that neither savings nor investment, including the three sectoral measures of savings and investment, have any positive impact on GDP growth in India. This result is robust in the short-run and the long-run, providing no evidence for both the short-run dynamic affect of savings and investment on growth (the Solow model) and the long-run (permanent) affect of savings and investment on growth (the AK model of growth) in India. Secondly, foreign capital inflows is the only variable found to affect GDP growth, in the both the short and long-run. A feedback effect exists between foreign capital inflows and GDP growth, although it is much smaller than from GDP growth to foreign capital inflows. Third, the Carroll-Weil hypothesis and a strong accelerator effect of GDP are supported in the Indian context, only when gross savings and investment are disaggregated into the household, private corporate and public sectors. GDP growth is affecting household and private savings in the long-run; and GDP has a large effect on household investment in the long-run and public investment in the short-run. Fourth, foreign capital inflows are found to be negatively related to gross domestic savings, indicating a substitution affect between the two. But a feedback effect exists between gross domestic investment and foreign capital inflows, in both the short and the long-run, with domestic investment attracting foreign capital inflows much stronger than the reverse. Lastly, as per the Feldstein and Horioka (1980) proposition, gross savings are driving gross investment in the long-run; however evidence of perfect capital mobility is found in the short-run. There is also evidence that household savings has a positive effect on private sector investment in the long-run; and public sector investment in both the long and short-run. While the direction of these relationships from savings to investment is consistent with the growth models, there is the serious missing link from investment to economic growth. Overall, these findings do not support policies designed to increase household, private or public savings and investment in order to promote economic growth in India. This is further strengthened by the findings that GDP has large elastic affects on household investment in the long-run and public investment in the short-run. Further to this, public investment has a negative impact on GDP growth in the long-run; however it is only significant at the ten percent level. There is therefore, no statistical evidence of the popular endogenous explanation that investment is the driver of long-run economic growth in India...|$|E

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{production}} environments with job shop characteristics, much {{research has been done}} on partial control such as priority dispatching. The development of comprehensive control concepts lags behind. However, the principles of workload control (WLC) have been elaborated to more comprehensive production control concepts. WLC concepts buffer the shop floor against external dynamics by creating a pool of unreleased jobs. The use of workload norms should turn the queueing <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> on the shop floor into a stationary process which can be characterised by an equilibrium.

40|$|Most {{evidence}} of hyperbolic discounting {{is based on}} violations <b>of</b> either <b>stationarity</b> or time consistency as observed in choice experiments.

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Risk management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Since most {{time series}} data are non–stationary, the econometrician and {{financial}} analyst are re–quired {{to make the}} data stationary before embarking on any econometric analysis {{in order to avoid}} spurious results. Although there are several different ways to render a non–stationary time series stationary, few econometricians and financial analysts look past the first differencing and log–differencing methods. Due to this "difference first, ask questions later" approach, this study aims to determine the impact of different forms <b>of</b> <b>stationarity</b> on financial time series analysis. Further–more, this study aims to determine whether it is of any significance to consider one of the other methods of rendering a time series stationary rather than simply first differencing. As a starting point, the literature on the different forms <b>of</b> <b>stationarity</b> as well as the tests for sta–tionarity is reported. After an extensive review of the literature, it was found that there are at least five different forms <b>of</b> <b>stationarity,</b> each characterised by specific statistical properties of the particu–lar time series. The literature also revealed that the most popular tests <b>of</b> <b>stationarity</b> are the DF–GLS, ADF and KPSS tests. Furthermore, {{the manner in which the}} fractional differencing parameter or fractional integration parameter of a time series is determined was reviewed. The methods used to determine the fractional differencing parameter, which were reported in this work, are that of the MRS and GPH methods. Incorporating all the tests and the GPH method, a novel process to deter–mine the correct form <b>of</b> <b>stationarity</b> for a specific time series was introduced. The process was then applied to different types of time series data, which included stock prices, a stock index, consumer price index and an exchange rate. After finding that the time series do differ statistically and have different forms <b>of</b> <b>stationarity,</b> ARFIMA and OLS were employed. ARFIMA and OLS allowed each time series (in its own form <b>of</b> <b>stationarity</b> suggested by the relevant process) to be compared to the al–ternative form. For example, if a time series was found to be fractional difference stationary, its forecasting performance would be tested against its first differenced form. Results indicated that the form <b>of</b> <b>stationarity</b> found in a time series, after employing the relevant process, outperformed its alternative in every instance tested. The results confirmed that it is indeed reckless to "difference first, and ask questions later". First dif–ferencing is not the only method that should be used to render a time series stationary, and it is im–perative that econometricians and financial analysts begin exploring properties of the data and cease blindly following processes suggested for different datasets in the literature. The data should lead the analyst to the method that should be used to truly render a particular non–stationary time series stationary. Master...|$|R
