25|$|A macaque mother {{moves to}} the {{periphery}} of her troop to give birth in a secluded spot, unless the group is moving, when the female must stay with it. Macaques usually give birth on the ground. Infants are born with dark-brown hair. They consume their first solid food at five to six weeks old, and can forage independently from their mothers by seven weeks. A mother carries her infant <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> for its first four weeks. After this time, the mother carries her infant on her back, as well. Infants continue to be carried past a year. A mother and her infant tend to avoid other troop members, and the mother may socialize again very slowly. However, alloparenting has been observed, usually by females which have not had infants of their own. Male care of infants occurs in some groups, but not in others; usually, older males protect, groom, and carry an infant as a female would.|$|E
500|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} about Shiloh, Naylor said: [...] "Like a patchwork quilt, a novel {{is made up}} of things that have happened to me and things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings." [...] Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered a dog in the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was [...] "the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently shuddered and slunk forward <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>belly,</b> Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them until they reached the Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's trip home that night.|$|E
500|$|Critics had widely {{divergent}} {{views of}} Sue's storyline. Keller wrote, [...] "They made Sue Sylvester into a cartoon character." [...] Though he called Sue's {{destruction of the}} choir room [...] "a fun little parody to watch", he added, [...] "in {{the grand scheme of}} what was a pretty damn good episode, it {{was too much of a}} distraction", and worried that the role of Sue was becoming [...] "a big fat joke". While Canning also noted the shift in tone [...] "from despicable Sue to cartoony evil Sue", he enjoyed her [...] "attempt to hijack Secret Santa", and said it was [...] "another fun reason to love to hate Sue Sylvester". Hankinson felt that the Grinch was [...] "the perfect touchstone for the heartless Ms. Sylvester and Jane Lynch's lanky frame made the physical humor (think gliding around the base of the tree <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>belly)</b> really sing." [...] Poniewozik called Sue's transformation [...] "pretty amusing to watch", admitted that he doubted he would [...] "have been able to resist the urge to put the rangy Jane Lynch in that classic role" [...] and called Brittany as Cindy Lou Who [...] "unexpected, clever and surprisingly touching". Several reviewers commented favorably on Becky playing Max, including Canning, who wrote [...] "it was all worth it to realize Becky is and always will be the Max to Sue's Grinch", and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack declared, [...] "I totally love how Becky is becoming Sue’s little minion. It’s both adorable and hilarious." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 31, 2013, Gaga {{revealed}} via Twitter that [...] "Dope" [...] {{would be}} the final song available for purchase before the release of Artpop, accessible for digital download from November 4. The single's cover art was also revealed, depicting Gaga wearing a black floppy hat with her brunette hair falling over her shoulders, an oversized [...] "boxy" [...] double-breasted blazer, sheer underwear, one black leather boot and a grill that made her teeth appear larger. Her eyes are covered by a scarf and she has bruises <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> and around her crotch area. Idolator writer Mike Wass named the cover art [...] "a cross between Frankenstein and Michael Jackson". Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post found the cover relatively modest compared to the previous single covers of songs from Artpop. John Walker from MTV News compared the cover to director Tim Burton's works and called it [...] "terrifying". He described Gaga's face and the grills as [...] " [...] the gum-less teeth of a long-buried skull cast in titanium" [...] and believed that the hands and legs were prosthetic. Walker concluded {{by saying that the}} cover reminded him of a [...] "bizarro world" [...] version of singer Janet Jackson's [...] for a 1993 Rolling Stone issue. Lily Harrison from E! Online complimented Gaga for taking the fashion of grills to a [...] "whole new level". She commended the singer's ability to portray her toned figure in spite of the [...] "odd ensemble". A writer for Metro felt that the singer was as [...] "peculiar as ever" [...] on the artwork. Emma Kelly from Daily Star called the cover [...] "creepier" [...] than any horror film and felt that the wide jacket made the singer appear as a rugby player. She compared the digitally altered smile on the single cover to the cover of electronic musician Aphex Twin's EP, Come to Daddy (1997) which features similar inflated grills. Fashion website Refinery29's Leila Brillson felt that the artwork was more of a surrealist move which made Gaga look like a [...] "nightmarish" [...] version of virtual band Gorillaz. Brillson was also unclear if the bruises were related to the song.|$|E

60|$|A young orang, made jealous by her keeper {{attending}} to another monkey, slightly uncovered her teeth, and, uttering a peevish noise like tish-shist, {{turned her back}} on him. Both orangs and chimpanzees, when a little more angered, protrude their lips greatly, and make a harsh barking noise. A young female chimpanzee, in a violent passion, presented a curious resemblance to a child in the same state. She screamed loudly with widely open mouth, the lips being retracted so that the teeth were fully exposed. She threw her arms wildly about, sometimes clasping them over her head. She rolled on the ground, sometimes on her back, sometimes <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>belly,</b> and bit everything within reach. A young gibbon (Hylobates syndactylus) in a passion has been described[16] as behaving in almost exactly the same manner.|$|E
60|$|It {{might be}} {{four in the}} afternoon, perhaps, when the back door was thrust slowly open, and a strange old native woman crawled into the house almost <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>belly.</b> She was swathed in black stuff to her heels; her hair was grey in swatches; her face was tattooed, which was not the {{practice}} in that island; her eyes big and bright and crazy. These she fixed upon me with a rapt expression that I saw to be part acting. She said no plain word, but smacked and mumbled with her lips, and hummed aloud, like a child over its Christmas pudding. She came straight across the house, heading for me, and, {{as soon as she}} was alongside, caught up my hand and purred and crooned over it like a great cat. From this she slipped into a kind of song.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Landau began to create video art works. One is Barbed Hula (2000), showing a nude female body (the artist’s) rolling <b>on</b> and around <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> a hula hoop made of barbed wire, which injures the skin with every move. The visual {{experience}} combines hypnotic beauty {{with a sense}} of excruciating pain, making it difficult to watch. In this work, as in some of her other videos, the theme of circular and cyclical motion is central. Landau integrates her experience in the medium of movement in space - she studied dance at the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance’s high school - with a deep understanding of the video-art form, which is based on continued movement and the projection cycle (loop).|$|R

50|$|Kneeboarding is a {{discipline}} of surfing where the rider paddles <b>on</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>belly</b> into a wave on a kneeboard, then rides the wave face typically on both knees. The typical kneeboard is {{between five and}} {{six and a half}} feet in length, with a wide round nose and constructed of Glassfibre over a polyurethane foam core. Kneeboard designers however are known for their wild experimental excess and so most modern materials including various aerospace elements such as Titanium alloys (for fins), carbon fibre and kevlar in epoxy matrices are not unusual. Modern kneeboards may have a rubber pad for the rider's knees, preventing undue wear of the knees, also preventing slipping to help the rider maintain control. Kneeboarders also typically use swimfins and an ankle surfleash.|$|R
