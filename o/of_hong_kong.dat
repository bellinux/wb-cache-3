5|$|During the Japanese {{occupation}} <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong,</b> the Japanese army committed atrocities {{against civilians}} and POWs, {{such as the}} St. Stephen's College massacre. Local residents also suffered widespread food shortages, limited rationing and hyper-inflation arising from the forced exchange of currency from Hong Kong dollars to Japanese military banknotes. The initial ratio of 2:1 was gradually devalued to 4:1 and ownership <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> dollars was declared illegal and punishable by harsh torture. Due to starvation and forced deportation for slave labour to mainland China, the population <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> had dwindled from 1.6 million in 1941 to 600,000 in 1945, when the United Kingdom resumed control of the colony on 2 September 1945.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the factors underpinning the vicissitudes <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong’s</b> film industry since the 1980 s. It explores the industry’s competitive edge and discusses <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong’s</b> {{contributions to the}} growth of the Chinese film market {{in the context of the}} regional integration of the Chinese movie value chain. The analysis is organized in four sections. The first provides an overview <b>of</b> the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> film industry from a historical perspective. The second describes the structure and the production system <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong’s</b> film industry in its golden age of the 1980 s. The third illuminates the causes <b>of</b> the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> film industry’s collapse since the mid- 1990 s.

5|$|There {{are eight}} public and one private {{universities}} in Hong Kong, the oldest being the University <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> (HKU), established in 1910–1912. The Chinese University <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> {{was founded in}} 1963 to fulfill {{the need for a}} university with a medium of instruction of Chinese. Competition among students to receive an offer for an undergraduate programme is fierce as the annual number of intakes is limited, especially when some disciplines are offered by select tertiary institutions, like medicine which is provided by merely two medical schools in the territory, the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine at the University <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> and the Faculty of Medicine of the Chinese University <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong.</b> In addition to the public post-secondary institutions there are also a number of private higher institutions which offer higher diplomas and associate degree courses for those who fail to enter a college for a degree study so as to boost their qualification of education, some of whom can have a second chance of getting into a university if they have a good performance in these sub-degree courses.|$|E

5|$|The Flag <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> between 1959 and 1997 was a Blue Ensign {{with the}} {{coat of arms}} <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> on a white disk.

In 1959, {{following}} {{a grant from the}} College of Arms and with the consent of Queen Elizabeth II, it was adopted as the flag of British Hong Kong.

5|$|The Hong Kong {{government}} generally {{respects the}} human rights of its citizens, and members of the Legislative Council <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> and the District Council <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> are elected into office by Hong Kong citizens. However, there are 27 ex officio members of the district council (the Rural Committee Chairmen in the New Territories) as of the fifth District Council Assembly, and roughly half of the legislative council seats are elected by 3% of the people in Hong Kong through the functional constituency. The imbalance of voting power in the LegCo has led to widespread criticism of its inability to represent Hongkongers' socio-economic needs. In addition, the Chief Executive <b>of</b> <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> is elected by 1,200 members based on their contributions to four different sectors of Hong Kong's society. This policy has received criticism from various political figures in Hong Kong, and led to the Umbrella Revolution. Plans to expand the voting population had begun to appear in the 2000s, and political figures liaised with the government to provide universal suffrage.|$|E
