25|$|A brush is the {{traditional}} writing instrument for Chinese calligraphy. The body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> is commonly made from bamboo or other materials such as wood, porcelain, or horn. The head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> is typically made from animal hair, such as weasel, rabbit, deer, goat, pig, tiger, wolf, etc. There is also a tradition in both China and Japan of making a brush using the hair of a newborn child, as a once-in-a-lifetime souvenir. This practice {{is associated with the}} legend of an ancient Chinese scholar who scored first in the imperial examinations by using such a personalized brush. Calligraphy brushes are widely considered an extension of the calligrapher's arm.|$|E

25|$|How {{the brush}} is held {{depends on the}} {{calligrapher}} and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches {{the upper part of}} the shaft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush</b> (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, very much like a Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or her grip depending on the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for cursive and lower for regular script.|$|E

500|$|Another {{well-documented}} gunfight {{resulted in}} the most kills by one person in a single event, when Capt. Jonathan R. Davis shot eleven bandits single-handedly on 19 December 1854. Unknown to Davis and his companions, a band of robbers was lying in wait in the canyon brush near the trail. They were a typically diverse and motley group of Gold Rush bandits: two Americans, one Frenchman, two Britons, five Sydney Ducks, and four Mexicans. As Captain Davis and his companions trudged on foot, the bandit gang charged out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brush,</b> pistols flaming. James McDonald died instantly, without time to draw his revolver or react in any way. Dr. Bolivar managed to get his six-shooter out and fire twice at the highwaymen before he dropped, badly wounded. Captain Davis later described himself as being [...] "in a fever of excitement at the time." [...] Unfazed, he stood his ground, pulling out both pistols and firing a barrage at the charging outlaws. He shot down his assailants, one after another. The outlaws' bullets tore at Davis's clothing, but caused only two slight flesh wounds. Within moments, seven of the bandits were dead or dying {{on the ground and}} Davis's pistols were empty. Four of the remaining robbers now closed in on the captain to finish him off. Davis whipped out his Bowie knife, and quickly warded off the thrusts from the two of the bandits. He stabbed one of them to death; the other he disarmed by knocking the knife from his grasp and slicing off his nose and a finger of his right hand. The two last attackers were the men who had been wounded in a previous bandit raid. Despite their weakened condition, they foolishly approached Davis with drawn knives. The captain reacted in an instant. Slashing with his heavy Bowie, he killed them both.|$|E

40|$|Polyelectrolyte (PE) brushes {{refer to}} surface {{tethered}} polyelectrolyte chains with sufficiently high grafting density {{such that the}} polymer chains are forced to extend from the surfaces. Most physicochemical properties of PE brushes are stimuliresponsive and they are thus able to create "smart" surfaces for various applications. In addition, many biointerfaces inside biological systems possess "brush-like" structures and may also carry many ionizable groups. PE brushes can serve as realistic models to better understand <b>the</b> behaviors <b>of</b> those biological interfaces. This dissertation describes the synthesis, characterization and applications for several types of PE brushes. Surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization in protic solvents was used to directly synthesize <b>the</b> PE <b>brushes.</b> A variety of characterization methods were used to understand the chemical structure and physical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brushes.</b> We were able to estimate <b>the</b> pKa <b>of</b> weak polyacid brushes and experimentally confirmed <b>the</b> variation <b>of</b> pKa inside <b>the</b> weak PE <b>brushes.</b> Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brushes were patterned on silica surfaces by a protocol modified from photolithography. <b>The</b> patterned PAA <b>brushes</b> were used to create arrays of biomolecules to study <b>the</b> signaling pathways <b>of</b> rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells. Cell adhesion on patterned PAA brush surfaces changed dramatically, depending on <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pattern, incubation temperature and thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brushes.</b> Positively charged poly((2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl) trimethylammonium chloride) (PMETA) brushes were shown to be promotive for neuron growth. Patterned PMETA brushes surrounded by a poly(ethylene glycol) monolayer guided neuron growth very well. Finally, several types of pH-responsive polymer brushes were used to tailor electrochemical properties of gold electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modified electrodes showed that <b>the</b> redox process <b>of</b> charged electroactive compounds greatly depended on <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> and pH <b>of</b> <b>the</b> medium.

30|$|Recently, atom {{transfer}} {{radical polymerization}} (ATRP) was applied in <b>the</b> grafting copolymerization <b>of</b> lignin. Kadla and Kim [188] prepared a thermo-responsive copolymer of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and hardwood kraft lignin in a DMF/water system. The obtained copolymer possessed {{a high degree}} of polymerization of NIPAM (> 40) and thermo-responsive characteristics, with a hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic transition at 32  °C. His group also synthesized ionic-responsive lignin-based nanofibers via <b>the</b> ATRP <b>of</b> NIPAM. NIPAM was grafted on soft wood kraft lignin nanofiber prepared by electro-spinning with a small amount <b>of</b> polyethylene oxide. <b>The</b> number-average molecular weight and polydispersity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PNIPAM <b>brushes</b> reached ca. 34  ×  105  Da and 1.22, respectively.

25|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{limitations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classic commutator DC motor {{are due to}} <b>the</b> {{need for}} <b>brushes</b> to press against the commutator. This creates friction. Sparks are created by <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> making and breaking circuits through the rotor coils as <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> cross <b>the</b> insulating gaps between commutator sections. Depending on the commutator design, this may include <b>the</b> <b>brushes</b> shorting together adjacent sections – and hence coil ends – momentarily while crossing the gaps. Furthermore, <b>the</b> inductance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotor coils causes the voltage across each to rise when its circuit is opened, increasing <b>the</b> sparking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brushes.</b> This sparking limits <b>the</b> maximum speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine, as too-rapid sparking will overheat, erode, or even melt the commutator. The current density per unit area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>brushes,</b> in combination with their resistivity, limits <b>the</b> output <b>of</b> <b>the</b> motor. The making and breaking of electric contact also generates electrical noise; sparking generates RFI. Brushes eventually wear out and require replacement, and the commutator itself is subject to wear and maintenance (on larger motors) or replacement (on small motors). The commutator assembly on a large motor is a costly element, requiring precision assembly of many parts. On small motors, the commutator is usually permanently integrated into the rotor, so replacing it usually requires replacing the whole rotor.|$|R
