5|$|The Passion of Martin Luther King was {{composed}} in 1968 following King's assassination. The Passion was first recorded in London in 1969, with Ezio Flagello, the composer's brother, as the bass baritone soloist. This performance was eventually released by Naxos American Classics in 2012. DePreist conducted the National Symphony Orchestra's first performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> at the Kennedy Center on February 19, 1974. Music critics drew comparisons to Johann Sebastian Bach's Passions, which recounts Jesus' death. The Oregon Symphony album {{was the first}} published recording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Bazemore provided bass vocals, with additional vocals by the Portland Symphonic Choir, directed by Bruce Browne. The nine sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> are performed with a brief pause in between.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recording}} of A Child of Our Time was issued in 1958, and remained the only available version for 17 years. Sir Colin Davis {{made the first}} of his three recordings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> in 1975. Tippett himself, at the age of 86, conducted a recording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in 1991.|$|E

50|$|John Vardy {{was born}} to a simple working family in Durham. His early {{training}} is obscure. His career at <b>the</b> Office <b>of</b> <b>Works,</b> which demanded most of his attention throughout his life, began in May 1736, when he was appointed Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> at Greenwich Hospital. He was Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> at Hampton Court Palace, January 1745 to 1746; Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> at Whitehall, Palace of Westminster and St James's Palace, December 1746 to 1754; Kensington Palace, July 1754 to 1761. He also served as Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Works</b> at Chelsea Hospital and as Surveyor to the Mint.|$|R

5|$|About 120 SS {{personnel}} {{were assigned to}} the gas chambers and lived on site at the crematoria. Several SS personnel oversaw the killings at each gas chamber, while the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> was done by the mostly Jewish prisoners known as Sonderkommandos (special squads). Sonderkommando responsibilities included guiding victims to the gas chambers and removing, looting, and cremating the corpses.|$|E
5|$|After scalemaker Saxton {{left the}} Mint Service in 1844, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of {{maintaining}} and modifying the sensitive balances for which Saxton was responsible fell to Peale. The Chief Coiner {{made a number}} of improvements to the scales, which he wrote up for an article in the Journal of The Franklin Institute in 1847. These balances, sensitive to , were protected by plate glass from air currents and dust.|$|E
5|$|Although Johnson was {{friends with}} actors such as David Garrick who had {{performed}} Shakespeare onstage, {{he did not}} believe that performance was vital to the plays, nor did he ever acknowledge the presence of an audience as a factor in the reception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Instead, Johnson believed that the reader of Shakespeare was the true audience of the play.|$|E

5|$|Another {{area covered}} by the work is royal finance, with the Leges setting out the rate of Danegeld, {{at a rate of}} one {{shilling}} per hide. It also covers judicial fines, setting forth a fine of 46 marks as the penalty for committing murder. The author <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> criticised the royal justices, calling them greedy. It sets out elaborate procedures for the conduct of murder cases, or murdum.|$|E
5|$|Art Connections {{underwent}} a complete renovation in 2004. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> went into installing new, high-tech activities, including a virtual canvas {{powered by a}} laser-light paintbrush and a room that turns dancers' shadows into art on the wall.|$|E
5|$|As a high {{altitude}} species with limited contact with humans until {{the development of}} mountain tourism activities, the Alpine chough has little cultural significance. It was, however, featured together with its wild mountain habitat in Olivier Messiaen’s Catalogue d'oiseaux ("Bird catalogue"), a piano piece written in 1956–58. Le chocard des alpes ("The Alpine Chough") is the opening piece of Book 1 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>works</b> {{used were}} {{unpublished}} and creative. However, since Netcom's use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> was merely to facilitate their posting to the Usenet, {{which was an}} entirely different purpose than plaintiff's use, <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> was not important to the fair use determination.|$|R

5|$|BWV Anh. 30 is a Magnificat in C major for SSAATTBB {{choir and}} orchestra, copied by Bach around 1742. The {{manuscript}} score indicates no composer, {{but according to}} a 2012 study it is a 17th-century work, composed by Pietro Torri before his 25th birthday. An earlier attribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> had been to Antonio Lotti.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{possibly}} led {{the audition}} performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> in Leipzig in the Thomaskirche on 7 February 1723, probably after the sermon. He performed the cantata {{again for the}} same occasion on 20 February 1724, this time reinforcing the voices by a brass choir in the final movement.|$|E
5|$|Baltische Öl {{consisted}} of five units (Kiviõli, Küttejõu, Kohtla-Järve, Sillamäe, and Kohtla), {{all of which}} were partially restored, previously existing industries. In addition, Baltische Öl started construction of a new mining and shale oil extraction complex in Ahtme, but it never became operational. Prisoners of war and forced labour made up about two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> force in these units.|$|E

50|$|A widely publicised rumour {{claims that}} <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> {{was to create}} a nuclear weapon storage {{facility}} in the cave.

5|$|Cage {{dedicated}} Sonatas and Interludes to Maro Ajemian, {{a pianist}} and friend. Ajemian performed the work many times since 1949, {{including one of}} the first performances of the complete cycle on January 12, 1949, in Carnegie Hall. On many other occasions in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Cage performed it himself. Critical reaction was uneven, but mostly positive, and the success of Sonatas and Interludes led to a grant from the Guggenheim Foundation, which Cage received in 1949, allowing him to make a six-month trip to Europe. There he met Olivier Messiaen, who helped organize a performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> for his students in Paris on June 7, 1949; and he befriended Pierre Boulez, who became an early admirer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and wrote a lecture about it for the June 17, 1949 performance at the salon of Suzanne Tézenas in Paris. While still living in Paris, Cage began writing String Quartet in Four Parts, yet another work influenced by Indian philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Churches {{managed to}} {{convince}} {{the commander of the}} brigade to conduct an operation to free the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> party the following day, by giving him crucial information regarding the work site and the guards. Next morning Churches and Laws returned with some hundred Partisans to await the arrival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> party by the usual train. As soon as work had begun the Partisans disarmed the eight guards and captured the four civilian overseers. In a short time the POWs, guards, and civilian overseers were being escorted south along a different route than that used by the first seven escapees the previous afternoon.|$|E
