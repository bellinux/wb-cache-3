500|$|In early 1850, Dickinson {{wrote that}} [...] "Amherst is alive with fun this winter ... Oh, {{a very great}} town this is!" [...] Her high spirits soon turned to melancholy after another death. The Amherst Academy principal, Leonard Humphrey, died {{suddenly}} of [...] "brain congestion" [...] at age 25. Two years after his death, she revealed to her friend Abiah Root the extent of her depression:some {{of my friends are}} gone, and some of my friends are sleeping– sleeping the churchyard sleep– the hour of evening is sad– it was <b>once</b> <b>my</b> study hour– my master has gone to rest, and the open leaf of the book, and the scholar at school alone, make the tears come, and I cannot brush them away; I would not if I could, for they are the only tribute I can pay the departed Humphrey.|$|E
2500|$|... at Darius' chapel in Paris in 1816 (date from script), shows Darius facing three burglars. The chief brigand stabs him {{to death}} for having no gold to steal. Out of the church, they meet MacLeod who defeats two of them. Darius, who has just revived, urges MacLeod to spare the third one, who flees. Darius is truly pained {{by the death of}} his own murderer, while MacLeod feels he has done well by ridding the world of a killer. He frustratedly admits that he is unable to follow Darius' teachings. Darius sadly realizes that MacLeod is leaving him to go to America, away from the hatred of Europe. Back in the present, MacLeod protects Paulus' life. After meeting Grayson and realizing he will not stop chasing Paulus, he fights and beheads him. Then MacLeod leaves Seacouver for Paris and meets Darius again. Learning of Grayson's death, Darius comments, [...] "He was <b>once</b> <b>my</b> closest friend on earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to Gordy's instincts, [...] "For <b>Once</b> in <b>My</b> Life" [...] was {{a highly}} {{successful}} record, peaking at number-two on both the Billboard Pop Singles and Billboard R Singles (it was held off from the number-one spot on each chart by another Motown single Gordy had originally vetoed, Marvin Gaye's [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine"). [...] "For <b>Once</b> in <b>My</b> Life", issued by Tamla with [...] "Angie Girl" [...] as its B-side, was later included as the title track on Wonder's For <b>Once</b> in <b>My</b> Life album.|$|R

2500|$|His celebrated work {{of fiction}} is Metamorphoses, by moderns {{commonly}} called The Golden Ass. A well-known work, Apuleius here created an urbane, inventive, vulgar, extravagant, mythic story, a sort of fable of the ancient world. The plot unfolds in Greece where the hero, while experimenting with the ointment of a sorceress, is changed not into an owl (as intended) but into a donkey. Thereafter his ability to speak leaves him, but he remains {{able to understand the}} talk of others. In a famous digression (one of many), the celebrated folktale of Cupid and Psyche is artfully told by a crone. Therein Cupid, son of the Roman goddess Venus, {{falls in love with a}} beautiful but mortal girl, who because of her loveliness has been jinxed by Cupid's mother; the god Jupiter resolves their dilemma. The hero as donkey listens as the story is told. After such and many adventures, in which he finds comedy, cruelty, onerous work as a beast-of-burden, circus-like exhibition, danger, and a love companion, the hero finally manages to regain his human form—by eating roses. Isis, the Egyptian goddess, in answer to his petitions, directs her priests during a procession to feed the flowers to him. [...] "At <b>once</b> <b>my</b> ugly and beastly form left me. My rugged hair thinned and fell; my huge belly sank in; my hooves separated out into fingers and toes; my hands ceased to be feet... and my tail... simply disappeared." [...] In the last few pages, the hero continues to follow the procession, entering by initiations into the religious service of Isis and Osiris of the Egyptian pantheon.|$|E
