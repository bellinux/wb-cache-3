5|$|With Ferino's quick {{movements}} to encircle him, Charles executed an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> in four columns through the Black Forest, across the Upper Danube valley, and toward Bavaria, {{trying to maintain}} consistent contact with all flanks. By mid-July, the column encamped near Stuttgart. The third column, which included the Condé’s Corps, retreated through Waldsee to Stockach, and eventually Ravensburg.

5|$|By {{the morning}} of July 25 North Korean forces had {{infiltrated}} {{the positions of the}} 1st Cavalry Division so thoroughly that they were disrupting its lines of supply, and Gay ordered the division to withdrawal and re-form its lines further south. Northwest of Yongdong, 1st Battalion executed an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> covered by the fire of the Heavy Mortar Company and the two batteries of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion. The mortar operators fought as infantry in the withdrawal. During these retreats North Korean troops disguised themselves as refugees and would form roadblocks in the UN troops' rear areas, or used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of UN concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that he {{had lost}} the initiative, was low on {{ammunition}} and food, and had more than 10,000 of his men killed, wounded, or missing, Beauregard could go no further. He withdrew beyond Shiloh Church, leaving 5,000 men under Breckinridge as a covering force, and massed Confederate batteries at the church and on the ridge south of Shiloh Branch. Confederate forces kept the Union men in position on the Corinth Road until 5 p.m., then began an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> southwest to Corinth. The exhausted Union soldiers did not pursue much farther than the original Sherman and Prentiss encampments. Lew Wallace's division crossed Shiloh Branch and advanced nearly , but received no support from other units and was recalled. They returned to Sherman's camps at dark. The battle was over.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Hampton's cavalry {{was making}} {{progress}} against Gibbon's infantry to the south, launching a surprise dismounted attack that caused many of Gibbon's men to flee or surrender. This allowed Hampton to flank Miles. Hancock ordered a counterattack, which provided time {{to allow for}} an <b>orderly</b> Union <b>withdrawal</b> to Petersburg after dark.|$|R
2500|$|To {{prevent another}} rout, the German commanders ordered the 5th Company and other {{unreliable}} units {{out of the}} bridgehead, so that troops holding firm, such as the 2nd and 6th companies, would not be affected. [...] Erich von Manstein, the XXXVIII Corps commander, was warned and rallied the personnel in Abbeville. [...] Günther von Kluge, the 4th Army commander, informed by Manstein that a [...] "rather serious crisis" [...] had developed, consented to an evacuation of the pocket, should this become unavoidable. The 2nd Motorised Infantry Division at Rue was alerted and sent out advance parties to reconnoitre. The <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawals</b> over the bridge were seen by the French and at noon, De Gaulle issued an order announcing the German abandonment of the bridgehead and that the 4e DCr should immediately exploit this by advancing towards the river.|$|R

In the expected peace agreement, Syria will get back all of the Golan Heights, and Israel will get (among other things) security for the Israeli army in Southern Lebanon: During the negotiations, Syria will curb the Hizbolla, and even fight them if necessary, and thus will enable, eventually, an <b>orderly</b> Israeli <b>withdrawal,</b> within the framework of a comprehensive peace agreement...|$|R
5|$|The Habsburg and Imperial armies were {{in danger}} of encirclement, as the French pressed hard at Rastatt. Ferino moved quickly east along the shore of the Rhine; from there, an {{approach}} from the rear might have flanked the entire force. To prevent this, Charles executed an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> in four columns through the Black Forest, across the Upper Danube valley, and toward Bavaria, trying to maintain consistent contact with all flanks as each column withdrew through the Black Forest and the Upper Danube. By mid-July, the column encamped near Stuttgart. The third column, which included the Condé's Corps, retreated through Waldsee to Stockach, and eventually Ravensburg. The fourth Austrian column, the smallest (three battalions and four squadrons), Ludwig Wolff de la Marselle, marched the length of the Bodensee's northern shore, via Überlingen, Meersburg, Buchhorn, and the Austrian city of Bregenz.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} break out of Normandy, the Allied armies {{developed}} a multi-stage operation. It started with a British and Canadian attack along the eastern battle line around Caen in Operation Goodwood on 18 July. The German Army responded by sending a large portion of its armoured reserves to defend. Then, on 25 July thousands of American bombers carpet bombed a 6000-metre hole on the western end of the German lines around Saint-Lô in Operation Cobra, allowing the Americans to push forces through this hole in the German lines. After some initial resistance, the German forces were overwhelmed and the Americans broke through. On 1 August, Lieutenant General George S. Patton was named the commanding officer of the newly recommissioned US Third Army—which included large segments of the soldiers that had broken through the German lines—and with few German reserves behind the front line, the race was on. The Third Army quickly pushed south and then east, meeting very little German resistance. Concurrently, the British and Canadian troops pushed south (Operation Bluecoat) in an attempt to keep the German armour engaged. Under the weight of this British and Canadian attack, the Germans withdrew; the <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> eventually collapsed due to lack of fuel.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Kursk, Model had {{anticipated}} {{the possibility of}} a Soviet attack into the Orel Salient, and had (without OKH's knowledge) constructed extensive defensive works to meet such an attack. Following the stalling of his advance, the Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Kutuzov, duly opened on 12 July. It involved not just Rokossovsky's Central Front, but also the Bryansk and Western Fronts, a greater concentration of forces than Model had assaulted in Operation Citadel. For the battle, Kluge placed him in command of Second Panzer Army in addition to Ninth Army—again, a larger total force than he had commanded in Citadel. The Soviet preponderance of strength was such that Stavka expected it to take only 48 hours to reach Orel, splitting the German forces into three parts; instead, the battle ended three weeks later with Model's <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the salient. An idea of the scale of the fighting compared to Citadel can be gained from the combined casualty lists for Second Panzer and Ninth Armies: from 1 to 10 July, the Germans took 21,000 casualties, and from 11 to 31 July, 62,000. Despite these losses he had inflicted similarly heavy casualties on the three Red Army Fronts, shortened the line, and avoided annihilation. His standing with Hitler thus survived the failure of Citadel.|$|E
50|$|Arz took full {{responsibility}} {{for the failure of}} the massive invasion of Italy and tendered his resignation, but the Emperor refused to accept it, even after Generaloberst Schönburg-Hartenstein had said to the Emperor's face that the army had lost all confidence in Arz. By late October 1918, Arz could see that ultimate defeat for the Imperial forces was inevitable. He had drawn up plans for an <b>orderly</b> troop <b>withdrawal</b> {{in the event of an}} armistice, so as to prevent unnecessary further bloodshed. An armistice with Italy was concluded on 3 November 1918 and was to come into effect 36 hours later, during which time thousands of Imperial troops were captured while believing themselves to be at peace, due to poor communication from Army High Command.|$|R
50|$|The Germans came {{to their}} aid by forming a new Ninth Army which {{advanced}} From German Silesia into Poland in the Battle of the Vistula River. Although initially successful, the attack eventually petered out and the Germans returned to their starting points, as they retreated destroying the Polish railways and bridges {{to make it harder}} to invade German Silesia.The Russians repaired the damage and then were poised to invade. The German Ninth Army was redeployed to the north, allowing them to put serious pressure on the Russian right flank in what developed as the Battle of Łódź in early November. The Germans failed to encircle the Russian units, and the battle ended with an <b>orderly</b> Russian <b>withdrawal</b> to the east near Warsaw, the German occupation of Łódź, {{and the end of the}} immediate threat to Silesia.|$|R
2500|$|Maj. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox's {{division}} assaulted the Union {{position at}} about 2 p.m. on August 25. Despite launching two attacks, Wilcox was driven back by Miles's division, which was manning {{the northern part}} of the earthworks. To the south, Gibbon's division was blocking the advance of Hampton's cavalry, which had swept around the Union line. Confederate reinforcements from Heth's and Mahone's divisions arrived while the Confederate artillery softened up the Union position. The final attack began around 5:30p.m. against Miles's position and it broke through the northwest corner of the Union fortifications. Hancock desperately galloped from one threatened point to the next, attempting to rally his men. As he witnessed the men of his once proud corps reluctant to retake their positions from the enemy, he remarked to a colonel, [...] "I do not care to die, but I pray God I may never leave this field." [...] By this time, Hampton's cavalry was making progress against Gibbon's infantry to the south, launching a surprise dismounted attack that caused many of Gibbon's men to flee or surrender. This allowed Hampton to flank Miles. Hancock ordered a counterattack, which provided time to allow for an <b>orderly</b> Union <b>withdrawal</b> to Petersburg after dark.|$|R
5|$|The Austro-Hungarians made {{a renewed}} {{attack against the}} 1st Army on 21 November, forcing the Serbs back {{after a series of}} brutal engagements. The Austro-Hungarians then {{advanced}} towards Mount Maljen, aiming to drive the 1st Serbian Army from its positions there. The Serbs withdrew from the mountain after three days of heavy fighting; Potiorek decided not to pursue the retreating Serb units, allowing them to make an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> The Austro-Hungarians had suffered heavy casualties and the intensity of the fighting caused them to lose cohesion. As they advanced deeper into Serbia, the terrain became increasingly difficult and exhausted the already tired Austro-Hungarian soldiers. While the Serbian 1st Army withdrew, the 2nd and 3rd armies fiercely resisted the Austro-Hungarian advance. This led Potiorek to reinforce his positions around Lazarevac, which he aimed to capture and use as a pivot from which to attack Kragujevac while his right flank pushed down the West Morava valley. Austro-Hungarian advances convinced Potiorek that his army had the upper hand. He envisaged that his forces would pursue the surviving soldiers from the Serbian 2nd and 3rd Armies and predicted that the Serbian 1st and Užice armies would be forced to manoeuvre towards Belgrade and Lazarevac, where they would be encircled and destroyed. Combat on the outskirts of Lazarevac intensified once again as a result, and the Serbian Army managed to repulse every Austro-Hungarian assault despite a lack of ammunition. The Serbs quickly began to run out of shells and Stepanović asked the Serbian Supreme Command that the artillery of the 2nd Army be redirected to its rear, as he felt that its failure to contribute to the defense of Lazarevac frustrated his troops and was bad for morale. Putnik instructed Stepanović to keep the artillery of the 2nd Army on the front and told him that the Russians had sent artillery shells for its guns. Stepanović was skeptical that the Russians had sent supplies to the Serbs, but kept the artillery of the 2nd Army on the front line as Putnik had instructed.|$|E
25|$|By 14 March, South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu {{decided to}} abandon the Central Highlands region and two {{northern}} provinces of South Vietnam and ordered a general withdrawal of ARVN forces from those areas.

25|$|On {{the evening}} of April 19, the British mounted an assault in force upon San Felipe. Three columns of {{grenadiers}} supported by Jamaicans and several British companies moved under cover of darkness, {{with the aid of}} an intense naval bombardment. The British fought their way {{to the base of the}} fort's ramparts but were unable to overcome the defence and withdrew. After comprehensively destroying the forts in their possession, the British began an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> back to Jamaica.|$|E
50|$|While a {{state can}} be suspended, {{there is no}} {{provision}} to expel a member state outright. The idea appeared in the drafting of the European Constitution and the Lisbon Treaty but failed to be included. There {{are a number of}} considerations which make such a provision impractical. Firstly, a member state leaving would require amendments to the treaties, and amendments require unanimity. Unanimity would be impossible to achieve if the state did not want to leave of its own free will. Secondly it is legally complicated, particularly with all the rights and privileges being withdrawn for both sides that would not be resolved by an <b>orderly</b> and voluntary <b>withdrawal.</b> Third, the concept of expulsion goes against the spirit of the treaties. Most available sanctions are conciliatory, not punitive; they do not punish a state for failing to live up to fellow states' demands, but encourage a state to fulfill its treaty obligations - expulsion would certainly not achieve that.|$|R
50|$|By August 1944, the Soviet Army was {{approaching}} the Balkans. In a last-minute {{attempt to create}} a buffer state against the incoming Red Army, on 29 August, the Germans attempted to establish an 'independent' Macedonian puppet state, led by Ivan Mihailov. Unlike the leftist resistance, the right wing followers of IMRO were pro-Bulgarian orientated, and did not support the existence of a future Yugoslavia. The Bulgarian interior minister was put in charge to contact Mihajlov, who at the time was an advisor to Croatia's Nazi leader Ante Pavelić. The state was to receive no military (troops or weapons) backing from Germany, because the Germans were running short on troops and weapons. Telegrams from the time indicate that an <b>orderly</b> Bulgarian-German troop <b>withdrawal</b> would precede the formation of such a puppet state. Bulgaria ordered its troops to withdraw from Macedonia on 2 September. In the evening on 3 September, Ivan Mihailov was flown in first from Zagreb to Sofia, to see what 'can be saved". Two telegrams from 5 September at 1:7 and 6 September at 2:20 relay Hitler's reorder for the establishment of such a state. Mihajlov was transported from Sofia to Skopje in the evening of 5 September. Based on German telegrams from the time, Ivan Mihailov was offered the establishment of such a state, but by 18:00 (6 pm) on 6 September, he declined for inability to gather support. The failure led to ordering German withdrawal from Greece on 6 September and appointing Senior-Field-Commandant for Greece Heinz Scheeuerlen as the new Senior-Field-Commandant for Macedonia. Germany closed its Consulate in Skopje and evacuated its staff together with Ivan Mihailov and his wife out of Macedonia. Thus, the attempt to establish a Nazi puppet state in Macedonia lasted a week: from an idea on 29 August to failure on 6 September.|$|R
25|$|The Battle of Franklin {{was fought}} on November 30, 1864, in Franklin, Tennessee, {{as part of}} the Franklin–Nashville Campaign of the American Civil War. It {{was one of the worst}} {{disasters}} of the war for the Confederate States Army. Confederate Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood's Army of Tennessee conducted numerous frontal assaults against fortified positions occupied by the Union forces under Maj. Gen. John M. Schofield and was unable to break through or to prevent Schofield from a planned, <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> to Nashville.|$|E
25|$|The day Ban Me Thuot fell, President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu {{called an}} {{emergency}} high level meeting at Cam Ranh Bay. During this meeting Thieu {{made the decision}} to attempt an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the Central Highlands around Kontum and Pleiku in order to conserve forces and regroup for a counter-attack. Unfortunately for the South Vietnamese, the commander of the region, General Phạm Văn Phú, misinterpreted this order and directed an immediately evacuation of both cities. The commander of the 6th Air Division at Pleiku was given forty-eight hours to evacuate the airfield and immediately requested UH-1s, CH-47s, and C-130s to fly VNAF personnel and their dependants out of Pleiku.|$|E
25|$|On 19 December, {{elements}} of the U.S. 741st Tank Battalion formed the rearguard to allow the Americans an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the twin villages to positions behind Wirtzfeld {{to the west and}} northwest. By that afternoon the tankers had reported destroying 27 Panzers, two Jagdpanzer IV, two armored cars, and two half-tracks while losing eight of their own tanks. At the battalion level, units reported killing 16 tanks, regimental 57mm guns claimed 19, and bazooka teams reported to have killed 17 more. While the numbers didn't line up, they indicated the ferocity of the fighting. The German Panther companies were rendered ineffective and didn't {{play a significant role in}} later fighting.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of 19/20 February 1,500 troops from the Imperial Japanese Army's 228th Regimental Group, 38th Division, XVI Army, {{under the command of}} Colonel Sadashichi Doi, began landing in Dili. Initially the Japanese ships were mistaken for vessels {{carrying}} Portuguese reinforcements, and the Allies were caught by surprise. Nevertheless, they were well-prepared, and the garrison began an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal,</b> covered by the 18-strong Australian Commando No. 2 Section stationed at the airfield. According to Australian accounts the commandos killed an estimated 200 Japanese in the first hours of the battle; the Japanese army recorded its casualties as only seven men, but native accounts of the landings support the Australian claims.|$|E
25|$|The {{area around}} Elsenborn Ridge became a {{collection}} point for ragtag groups of American troops whose units been broken and scattered {{at the start}} of the enemy offensive. With so many troops from different units arriving in every kind of condition, organizing a coherent defense was a huge task, but one that occurred with surprising speed under the circumstances. Intelligence about the attack that reached the Americans was spotty and contradictory. General Lauer, commanding officer of the 99th, ordered Col. Robertson at Wahlerscheid to stay put until at least the next morning when more orders would be forthcoming. Robertson told his men to hold and he also prepared them for an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> in the morning.|$|E
25|$|Seeing his flank turned, Gérard gave {{instructions}} for a retreat. Apparently Jarry was acting {{commander of the}} II Corps 2nd Division, because he and Rottembourg joined their divisions and made an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> after abandoning Laubressel. Their movement was supported by cavalry and artillery. Wrede chose this moment to directly assault the Guillotière Bridge with four Bavarian battalions while shifting other troops to his left. In the confusion, Duhesme missed the first orders to pull back and was nearly surrounded by enemies when Gérard sent them a second time. Hounded by the Austrian Knesevich Dragoons Nr. 3 and the Szekler Hussars Nr. 11, Duhesme's troops nevertheless fought {{their way back to}} Saint-Parres-aux-Tertres after suffering 400 casualties and losing two guns. The Crown Prince remained inactive on the left, allowing Molitor's XI Corps and Milhaud's cavalry to fall back without interference.|$|E
25|$|In {{support of}} the 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions, the 741st, along with a company of the 644th Tank Destroyer Battalion, was {{instrumental}} in helping hold the northern shoulder of the Bulge in vicious fighting in and around Rocherath-Krinkelt during the German Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge) in December 1944. By now battle-seasoned veterans, tankers from the battalion resisted repeated numerous hard-pressed attacks by spearheading elements of the SS-heavy Sixth Panzer Army from 16–19 December. Facing superior German Panther and Tiger tanks (among others) supported by infantry, the battalion fought many small unit engagements, deftly stalking the German tanks in twos and threes until they could destroy or immobilize them with shots from the flanks or rear. On 19 December, elements of the battalion were the rear guard of an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from Rocherath-Krinkelt to positions behind Wirtzfeld {{to the west and}} northwest.|$|E
25|$|The {{war began}} in December 1759 when 40,000 Burmese troops led by Alaungpaya {{and his son}} Hsinbyushin invaded down the Tenasserim coast from Martaban (Mottama). Their battle plan was {{to go around the}} heavily defended Siamese {{positions}} along shorter, more direct invasion routes. The invasion force overran relatively thin Siamese defenses in the coast, crossed the Tenasserim Hills to the shore of the Gulf of Siam, and turned north towards Ayutthaya. Taken by surprise, the Siamese scrambled to meet the Burmese in their south, and put up spirited defensive stands en route to Ayutthaya. But battle-hardened Burmese forces overcame numerically superior Siamese defenses and reached the outskirts of Siamese capital on 11 April 1760. But only five days into the siege, the Burmese king suddenly fell ill and the Burmese command decided to withdraw. An effective rearguard operation by Gen. Minkhaung Nawrahta allowed for an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first intimation {{that the}} British {{received}} that a withdrawal had begun was when British patrols probing German outposts towards Serre, found them unoccupied. They then began a slow follow-up but unreadiness, the decrepitude {{of the local}} roads and the German advantage of falling back on prepared lines behind rearguards of machine-gunners, meant that the Germans completed an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal.</b> The new defences were built on a reverse slope (Hinterhanstellung) where there were positions behind the defences, from which artillery observers could see them, experience having showed that infantry equipped with machine-guns needed a field of fire {{only a few hundred}} yards/meters deep. Unfortunately, General Ludwig von Lauter and Colonel Kramer from OHL ignored the new thinking and in much of the new line, artillery observation posts in the front line or in front of it and the front position was on forward slopes, near crests or at the rear of long reverse slopes.|$|E
25|$|The first {{shots of}} the Battle of Chancellorsville were fired at 11:20a.m. as the armies collided. McLaws's initial attack pushed back Sykes's division, but the Union general {{organized}} a counterattack that recovered the lost ground. Anderson then sent a brigade under Brig. Gen. Ambrose Wright up an unfinished railroad south of the Plank Road, around the right flank of Slocum's corps. This would normally be a serious problem, but Howard's XI Corps was advancing from the rear and could deal with Wright. Sykes's division had proceeded farther forward than Slocum on his right, leaving him in an exposed position, which forced him to conduct an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> at 2 p.m. {{to take up a}} position behind Hancock's division of the II Corps, which was ordered by Hooker to advance and help repulse the Confederate attack. Meade's other two divisions made good progress on the River Road and were approaching their objective, Banks's Ford.|$|E
25|$|According to the saga, the Scots then {{withdrew from}} the beach and {{consolidated}} atop the mound abandoned by Ogmund's men. Minor skirmishing followed in which both sides attacked each other with arrows and stones. Before nightfall, the saga maintains that the Norwegians made one last determined assault, and forced the Scots from the mound, before making an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> to their ships. On the morning of 3 October, the Norwegians returned ashore to collect their dead and burn their beached vessels. For several days, Haakon's forces laid {{off the coast of}} Arran. After rendezvousing with the returning fleet that had plundered Lennox, Haakon's entire forces made for the Hebrides. At Mull he rewarded a number of his Norse-Gaelic vassals with grants of lands. By the end of October, the Norwegian fleet reached Orkney. In mid December, the Norwegian king fell ill and died at the Bishop's Palace, and was temporarily buried in nearby St Magnus Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|On 11 April 1951, Commander-in-Chief Truman {{relieved}} {{the controversial}} General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander in Korea. There were {{several reasons for}} the dismissal. MacArthur crossed the 38th parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses. He believed that whether to use nuclear weapons should be his decision, not the President's. MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered. While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, and felt a truce and <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from Korea could be a valid solution. MacArthur {{was the subject of}} congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the U.S. Constitution. A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea, and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|As the Scots {{advanced}} {{towards the}} Norwegians, the saga indicates that Ogmund withdrew his {{troops from the}} mound to avoid being cut off from his comrades on the beach below. If the Scots had indeed marched northwards, their advance would have threatened to {{drive a wedge between}} the Norwegians on the mound and those on beach. Once the Scottish vanguard came into contact with Ogmund's men, the saga indicates that his <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> disintegrated into a chaotic scramble. On the beach below, Haakon followed the advice of his men and retired to the safety of his ships. To the men on the beach, the rapid descent of Ogmund's men towards them looked like an all-out retreat; they turned and fled. The Norwegian army was thus routed, and in the mad dash back to their ships they suffered substantial casualties. Some of the Norwegians may have used the beached vessels as makeshift fortifications, since the saga notes that a group of them made a valiant stand by their ships, out-numbered ten to one, in a fierce engagement in which a particularly valiant Scottish knight was slain. This entry confirms {{that at least some of}} the Scottish knights present were able to engage their foes on horseback.|$|E
25|$|As {{the sun was}} {{starting}} to go down, William Whiting's division achieved the breakthrough on Longstreet's front. Brig. Gen. John Bell Hood's Texas Brigade move forward swiftly and aggressively and broke {{a hole in the}} line. Four of the nine regimental commanders in Whiting's two brigades were killed or wounded, as well as Captain William Balthis, the division's chief of artillery. Pickett's brigade also succeeded in its second assault of the day. Confederate breakthroughs on their center and right could not be countered and the Union line crumbled. A total of nine Union regimental commanders were killed or mortally wounded in the battle. Most of the 4th New Jersey along with its colonel was surrounded and taken prisoner by Longstreet's division; a lieutenant colonel assumed command of the remaining men in the regiment. Sykes's regulars conducted an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from the McGehee house to Grapevine Bridge. The Union brigades of Brig. Gens. Thomas F. Meagher and William H. French arrived from the II Corps, too late to help other than as a rear guard for Porter's retreat. A battalion of the 5th U.S. Cavalry under Captain Charles J. Whiting made a desperate charge against the Texas Brigade, but were forced to surrender after heavy losses. By 4 a.m. on June 28, Porter withdrew across the Chickahominy, burning the bridges behind him. During the retreat from Gaines Mill, Brig. Gen John F. Reynolds was also captured by the Confederates while sleeping under a tree.|$|E

500|$|Task Force Smith {{managed to}} hold its lines for three hours, but at 14:30 Smith ordered the Americans to withdraw, {{suffering}} from low ammunition and a breakdown of communications. At this point North Korean forces were moving on both flanks of the American force and toward {{the rear of the}} formation. Smith ordered an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of the force one unit at a time, allowing the rest of the force to cover it as it withdrew. C Company pulled back, followed by the American medics, the headquarters, and finally B Company. 2nd Platoon, B Company, however, did not receive the withdrawal order. When the platoon discovered that it was alone, {{it was too late for}} an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> and it could not move its wounded quickly enough. The platoon left most of its equipment in its positions, which was captured by the North Koreans. Most of the survivors were able to escape captivity but a number of wounded litter-borne U.S. soldiers were left behind along with an attending medic. The American wounded were later found shot to death in their litters; the medic was never seen again. One North Korean officer later told historian John Toland that the American forces at the battle seemed [...] "too frightened to fight".|$|E
500|$|To avoid Ferino's {{flanking}} maneuver, Charles executed an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> in four columns {{through the}} Black Forest, across the Upper Danube valley, and toward Bavaria, {{trying to maintain}} consistent contact with all flanks as each column withdrew through the Black Forest and the Upper Danube. By mid-July, the column to which the Swabians were attached encamped near Stuttgart. The third column, which included the Condé’s Corps, retreated through Waldsee [...] to Stockach, and, eventually Ravensburg. The fourth Austrian column, the smallest (three battalions and four squadrons) commanded by Ludwig Wolff de la Marselle, retreated {{the length of the}} Bodensee’s northern shore, via Überlingen, Meersburg, Buchhorn, and the Austrian city of Bregenz.|$|E
500|$|Only a well-disciplined {{and coordinated}} army can execute an <b>orderly</b> <b>withdrawal</b> {{in the face}} of a {{determined}} enemy and the South Vietnamese force in Laos was neither. The retreat quickly devolved into a rout. One by one the isolated firebases were closed out or overrun by the North Vietnamese and each withdrawal was costly. On 21 March South Vietnamese Marines at FSB Delta (...) , south of Route 9, came under intense ground and artillery attacks. During an attempted extraction of the force, seven helicopters were shot down and another 50 were damaged, ending the evacuation attempt. The Marines finally broke out of the encirclement and marched to the safety of FSB Hotel, which was then hastily abandoned. During the extraction of the 2nd ARVN Regiment, 28 of the 40 helicopters participating were damaged.|$|E
500|$|This was Gazan's last field command. Gazan's pre-emptive {{withdrawal}} {{created a}} gap in French line, exposing D'Erlon's army in the center.

The Allies captured the entire supply convoy, all the baggage and took many prisoners, including Gazan's wife and children, although they later managed to rejoin him. After losing their supply train, the plight of the French army was terrible. Gazan mentioned that general officers and subordinates alike [...] "were reduced to the clothes on their backs and most of them were barefoot," [...] but the rank and file of the army also suffered enormously from hunger, exposure, and disease.
