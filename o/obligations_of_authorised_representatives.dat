The thesis is composed of seven chapters. Chapter One is introductory; it defines the term <b>authorised</b> <b>representative,</b> compares it with a proxy and analyses the problem of individual or collective character <b>of</b> an <b>authorised</b> <b>representative.</b> Chapter Two offers a brief comparison <b>of</b> <b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> in personal and stock corporations.

50|$|In the 12th century, the Ludovingians {{needed to}} place all {{responsibility}} {{for the management of}} the castle of Wartburg, particularly its security and the improvement of the fortifications, into the hands <b>of</b> an <b>authorised</b> <b>representative.</b> This person held the office of Burgrave of the Wartburg. With the appointment of the counts of Wartburg, who appear {{at the same time in}} the 13th century as the burgraves of Brandenburg at the neighbouring Brandenburg Castle, a side line of the counts of Bilstein were elevated to high status, although they were not related by blood to the Ludowingian family.|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this review}} is to explore the legal, ethical, and rights issues {{surrounding}} use of the Australian My Health Record (MyHR) by people with communication disability. Method: A narrative review of the legislation and research affecting the implementation of MyHR in populations with communication disability. Results: Use of MyHR by people with communication disability will require careful consideration in relation to: (a) capacity and consent, (b) roles <b>of</b> nominated or <b>authorised</b> <b>representatives</b> in the system, and (c) the way decisions are made in relation to use of MyHR, including supported decision-making for people with intellectual disability.
