50|$|This {{disease is}} caused by {{problems}} in the circulatory system, so when it is presented, in the beginning {{it is important to}} follow several recommendations. The person needs to keep the legs elevated as much as possible to help the return of the blood. Whenever sitting down, the person needs to keep the legs on a <b>foot</b> <b>stool.</b> At night it is advisable to sleep with a pillow under the lower legs. In the evening, t is not unusual for legs to be swollen. The volume of the lower leg can increase to up to 100ml after a long working day or up to 200ml after a long-haul flight without moving.|$|R
5000|$|The iconic {{depiction}} of Chaplin working frantically {{to keep up}} with an assembly line inspired later comedy routines including Disney's Der Fuehrer's Face (Donald Duck alternately assembling artillery shells and saluting portraits of Adolf Hitler) and an episode of I Love Lucy titled [...] "Job Switching" [...] (Lucy and Ethel trying {{to keep up with}} an ever-increasing volume of chocolate candies, eventually stuffing them in their mouths, hats, and blouses).

5000|$|The [...] "classical" [...] guitar is the {{traditional}} guitar of Spain. It is built so that the right hand falls {{at the back of}} the sound hole when it is placed on the left leg. The player sits on the front of the chair and the left foot is supported by a <b>foot</b> <b>stool</b> or some other device. The right elbow is placed on the box of the guitar so that the hand falls over the strings, with the fingers at an angle to the strings. The right foot tucks underneath the player to make room for the guitar. And the guitar is turned to the player's right so as to rest against the ribs on the player's right side.|$|R
40|$|The Sling-Back Chair {{is a new}} hammock hybrid chair. The {{chair is}} {{a cross between a}} lounge style chair and a hammock.

The design is minimalist inspired, and is easily assembled with only 6 furniture hardware bolts and nuts. The design consists of a frame with a sling extending between two ends of the frame. This results in a storage area between the sling and the chair frame. The sling can be made adjustable to provide a firm or looser feel and the sling is attached with dowels allowing it to be easily attached, removed, or replaced...|$|R

60|$|The {{next day}} at breakfast, it was {{arranged}} that we should take a drive out to Speke Hall, an old mansion, which is considered a fine specimen of ancient house architecture. So the carriage was at the door. It was a cool, breezy, April morning, {{but there was an}} abundance of wrappers and carriage blankets provided to keep us comfortable. I must say, by the by, that English housekeepers are bountiful in their provision for carriage comfort. Every household has a store of warm, loose over garments, which are offered, if needed, to the guests; and each carriage is provided with one or two blankets, manufactured and sold expressly for this use, to envelope one's feet and limbs; besides all which, should the weather be cold, comes out a long stone reservoir, made flat on both sides, and filled with hot water, for <b>foot</b> <b>stools.</b> This is an improvement on the primitive simplicity of hot bricks, and even on the tin foot stove, which has nourished in New England.|$|R
50|$|Constructed from {{fiberglass}} {{the body}} was made from 13 inner and outer panels, including a floor panel, riveted and bonded together. The whole body was designed to bolt directly to an unmodified VW bug chassis. In the first prototypes stock front seats from Ford or VW were retained and a lounge-type seat was created for {{the rear of the}} vehicle. To add to the rear seating area a <b>foot</b> <b>stool</b> / cushion was added above the fuel tank. A single sliding door on the right side was the only entrance. The radio and switches were in the door panel {{to the left of the}} driving position. Shock absorbing bumpers of composite construction were designed to look like curved wood. The spare wheel was mounted to absorb frontal crash energy. For sunny days a large removable panel was positioned in the center of the roof panel. To reduce production costs parts from other vehicles were used. Front windshield was from an AMC Javelin, tail lights from a Datsun Truck and various other parts from a Ford Pinto.|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} study {{designed}} {{to investigate the}} extent to which speeded behavioral responses following tactile stimulation are influenced by differences in neural conduction latencies at different body sites and/or by the characteristics of the compatibility between the cue and effector. The results showed that it may not be particularly desirable to present tactile cues (e. g., warning signals) to an interface <b>operator's</b> <b>feet</b> if a speeded foot response is required, for even though such an arrangement maximizes the set-level compatibility between the stimulus and the response, it turns out that response latencies are primarily determined by conduction latencies through the peripheral nervous system...|$|R
5000|$|Some film {{directors}} {{are known for}} using very long, unedited takes. Alfred Hitchcock's Rope is famous for being composed of nine uninterrupted takes, each from four to ten minutes long. This required actors to step over cables and dolly tracks while filming, and stagehands to move furniture and props out of the camera's way as it moved around the room. A camera <b>operator's</b> <b>foot</b> was broken by a heavy dolly during one intensive take, and he was gagged and hauled out of the studio so that filming could continue without interruption. [...] The eight-minute opening shot of The Player includes people discussing long takes in other movies.|$|R

A common symbolism of the slanted <b>foot</b> <b>stool</b> is The foot-rest points up, toward Heaven, on Christ’s right hand-side, and downward, to Hades, on Christ’s left.

O Christ God, glory to Thee." [...] Another Orthodox cross which is worn in gold is an outer budded cross with an inner Three Bar Cross. The inscription Jesus Christ in Greek: IC (Iesous) on the left side bar and XC (Xhristos) on the right side bar, with a sun {{on the top of the}} cross. There is also typically an inscription on the back in Church Slavonic: [...] "спаси и сохрани", [...] "Spasi i Sokhrani", [...] "Save and Protect". This cross is known as the Saint Olga Cross.|$|R

50|$|The 1907 book,“Legends of Hawaii,“ has the {{following}} account of creation involving Kane. The author {{says that there}} are several versions of this story, probably due to waves of immigration from different areas of Polynesia at different times, but generally they agree on the major points. It {{says that in the}} beginning, there was nothing but Po; the endless black chaos. Then Kane, sensing that he was separate from the Po, pulled himself free of Po by an act of sheer will. Sensing Kane's presence, Lono and then Ku also pulled themselves free of Po. Then Kane created the light to push back Po. Lono brought sound to the universe and Ku brought substance. Between them they created all the lesser Gods. Then together, the three Gods created the Menehune, the lesser spirits to be their messengers and servants. Next they created the world to be a <b>foot</b> <b>stool</b> for the Gods. Finally they gathered red clay from the four corners of the world, they mixed the clay with their spittle, and molded it into the shape of a man. Then Kane took a special magical white clay and formed it into a head. Then the three Gods breathed life into the statue and created the first man. The first man was created in the image of Kane.|$|R
