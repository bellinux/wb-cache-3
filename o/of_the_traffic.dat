5|$|Although {{the main}} canal was {{replaced}} by the railway, Kymer's dock continued to be used for the transfer of coal to coastal ships for another 50 years. Principal destinations included Laugharne, Carmarthen, St Clears and Llanstephan.

Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traffic</b> had transferred to the railway by 1914, but some coasters continued to transport coal; the last recorded sailing was in the early 1920s, and was bound for Llanstephan.|$|E

The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.|$|E

5|$|Route 41 was legislated in 1927 to {{run from}} Route 47 in Fairview, Deptford Township to Route 38 in Moorestown. Originally, the route was {{intended}} to bypass Haddonfield, however this bypass was never fully completed and Route 41 was signed along a temporary county-maintained alignment that also became County Route 573. The northern part of this bypass was completed and became Route 154 in 1953. The road has seen many changes including the replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>traffic</b> circle with Routes 38 and 73 with an interchange that involved realigning Route 41 around the original circle in 1960 and {{the replacement of the}} Ellisburg Circle at Routes 70 and 154 with a signalized intersection in the early 1990s.
