5|$|Amfleet is a {{fleet of}} single-level {{intercity}} railroad passenger cars built by the Budd Company for American company Amtrak in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Budd based the Amfleet design on its earlier Metroliner electric multiple unit. An initial order for 57 cars in 1973 to supplement the Metroliners <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> Corridor grew to two orders totaling 642 cars, sufficient to reequip all the services <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> Corridor and many other routes around the United States. The first 492 cars, known as Amfleet I and completed between 1975–1977, were designed for short-distance service. A second order of 150 cars, known as Amfleet II and completed between 1980–1983, were designed for long-distance service. They were the last intercity passenger cars built by Budd.|$|E

5|$|Based on the study, Governor William O'Neill ordered ConnDOT in October 1986 to {{initiate}} rail {{service on the}} corridor. It was established as a temporary service to newly reopened local stations between Union Station in New Haven and Old Saybrook, to alleviate traffic congestion that arose from scheduled construction work on I-95. O'Neill introduced a $50 million transportation program that included $900,000 (later reduced to $500,000) for basic stations and $4 million to refurbish 12 Budd Rail Diesel Cars for rolling stock. The RDCs {{were found to be}} insufficient and two diesel trainsets were purchased from the defunct PATrain service in 1989 instead. Testing of the equipment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northeast</b> Corridor began on December 2, 1989.|$|E

5|$|Gannett Glacier, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>northeast</b> {{slope of}} Gannett Peak, {{is the largest}} single glacier in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. It has {{reportedly}} lost over 50percent of its volume since 1920 with 25percent of that occurring between the years 1980–1999. Upper Fremont Glacier has been studied {{more than any other}} glacier in the Wind River Range. Scientist have obtained ice cores from the Upper Fremont Glacier and found that there have been measurable changes in the atmosphere over the past several hundred years. The Upper Fremont Glacier and the Quelccaya Ice Cap in the Andes of South America both show nearly identical atmospheric records, which indicate a global linkage of atmospheric conditions over time.|$|E

There was no formal inquiry but it has been recently suggested that it was mainly due to the captain not having updated charts, so that he mistook the new St John's light for the Calf light on the Isle of Man.|$|E
