50|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> is {{a device}} that {{switches}} or amplifies optical signals. Light occurring on an optical transistor’s input changes the {{intensity of light emitted}} from the transistor’s output. Output power is supplied by an additional optical source. Since the input signal intensity may be weaker than that of the source, an <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> amplifies the optical signal. The device is the optical analog of the electronic transistor that forms the basis of modern electronic devices. Optical transistors provide a means to control light using only light and has applications in optical computing and fiber-optic communication networks. Such technology has the potential to exceed the speed of electronics, while consuming less power.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} argued case for optical logic is that <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> switching times {{can be much}} faster than in conventional electronic transistors. This {{is due to the}} fact that the speed of light in an optical medium is typically much faster than the drift velocity of electrons in semiconductors.|$|E
50|$|Since photons {{inherently}} do not {{interact with}} each other, an <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> must employ an operating medium to mediate interactions. This is done without converting optical to electronic signals as an intermediate step. Implementations {{using a variety of}} operating mediums have been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. However, their ability to compete with modern electronics is currently limited.|$|E
50|$|A more {{elaborate}} application of <b>optical</b> <b>transistors</b> {{is the development}} of an optical digital computer in which components process photons rather than electrons. Further, <b>optical</b> <b>transistors</b> that operate using single photons could form an integral part of quantum information processing where they can be used to selectively address individual units of quantum information, known as qubits.|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>transistors</b> {{could be}} used to improve the {{performance}} of fiber-optic communication networks. Although fiber-optic cables are used to transfer data, tasks such as signal routing are done electronically. This requires optical-electronic-optical conversion, which form bottlenecks. In principle, all-optical digital signal processing and routing is achievable using <b>optical</b> <b>transistors</b> arranged into photonic integrated circuits. The same devices {{could be used}} to create new types of optical amplifiers to compensate for signal attenuation along transmission lines.|$|R

50|$|A further {{misconception}} is {{that since}} light can travel much faster than the drift velocity of electrons, and at frequencies measured in THz, optical transistors should be capable of extremely high frequencies. However, any electromagnetic wave must obey the transform limit, and therefore {{the rate at which}} an <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> can respond to a signal is still limited by its spectral bandwidth. However, in fiber optic communications, practical limits such as dispersion often constrain channels to bandwidths of 10s of GHz, only slightly better than many silicon transistors. Obtaining dramatically faster operation than electronic transistors would therefore require practical methods of transmitting ultrashort pulses down highly dispersive waveguides.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} {{building block}} of modern electronic computers is the transistor. To replace electronic components with optical ones, an equivalent <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> is required. This is achieved using materials with a non-linear refractive index. In particular, materials exist where {{the intensity of}} incoming light affects {{the intensity of the}} light transmitted through the material in a similar manner to the current response of a bipolar transistor. Such an 'optical transistor' can be used to create optical logic gates, which in turn are assembled into the higher level components of the computer's CPU. These will be nonlinear optical crystals used to manipulate light beams into controlling other light beams.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} advantage of optical over electronic logic is reduced power consumption. This comes from the absence of capacitance in the connections between individual logic gates. In electronics, the transmission line needs to be charged to the signal voltage. The capacitance of a transmission line is proportional to its length and it exceeds the capacitance of the transistors in a logic gate when its length is {{equal to that of}} a single gate. The charging of transmission lines {{is one of the main}} energy losses in electronic logic. This loss is avoided in optical communication where only enough energy to switch an <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> at the receiving end must be transmitted down a line. This fact has played a major role in the uptake of fiber optics for long distance communication but is yet to be exploited at the microprocessor level.|$|E
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>transistors</b> can be {{directly}} linked to fiber-optic cables whereas electronics requires coupling via photodetectors and LEDs or lasers. The more natural integration of all-optical signal processors with fiber-optics would reduce the complexity and delay in the routing and other processing of signals in optical communication networks.|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{potential}} advantages of higher speed, lower power consumption and high compatibility with optical communication systems, <b>optical</b> <b>transistors</b> must satisfy {{a set of}} benchmarks before they can compete with electronics. No single design has yet satisfied all these criteria whilst outperforming speed and power consumption of {{state of the art}} electronics.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that nonlinear wave interaction between fundamental solitons with surrounding dispersive waves in a nonlinear optical fiber leads to intermittent giant waves with all typical signatures of rogue waves. The underlying physical mechanism {{is based on}} the concept of the so-called optical event horizon and is naturally given in the supercontinuum generation process. Moreover, one can use this mechanism in a deterministic way to make an all-optical control of light pulses possible. This is a natural way to <b>optical</b> <b>transistors...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{studied the}} implementation of a quantum memory and an <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> in a system composed by a single atom trapped inside a high finesse cavity. In order to store and map the quantum state of an input pulse onto internal states of the single atom (quantum memory) we employ the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) phenomenon (which can work out as an <b>optical</b> <b>transistor)</b> where the information can be transferred to the dark state of the atom modelled by a three-level system in a Λ-type configuration. In our model we consider a suitable temporal shape for the control field that ensures the adiabaticity of the storage process and retrieval of the probe pulse. The dynamic of the field inside the cavity was obtained by master equation approach, while the outside field was calculated by input-output formalism. We have analysed two different setups: i) two-sided and ii) single-sided cavities. While the first setup is the most appropriate and commonly used to observe cavity-EIT in the transmission spectrum, thus the best configuration for the <b>optical</b> <b>transistor,</b> the maximum quantum memory efficiency can not reach reasonable values, being limited to 50...|$|E

40|$|Optical {{transistors}} {{capable of}} forming an interconnected network are fundamental for optical information processing {{but have not}} been realized on a silicon chip. To be practical, an <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> must be cascadable, provide signal gain with logic level restoration, have input/output isolation and be free from critical biasing. It {{also needs to be}} compact and compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. However, almost all previous proposals or demonstrations of optical transistors fail to meet these criteria. ^ In this work, we demonstrate an all-silicon <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> using enhanced optical nonlinearity in two 5 -micrometer-radius silicon rings which allows a small optical signal to control a large signal. While a single device can simultaneously achieve 3 ̆e 3 dB signal gain and 3 ̆e 20 dB ON/OFF ratio, a cascaded device, can yield a signal gain of 3 ̆e 7 dB. An output ON/OFF ratio over 18 dB can be achieved with an input ON/OFF ratio of merely 2 dB. It also accomplishes fundamental logic operations like NAND or NOR on a single device, which normally require multiple electronic transistors. The <b>optical</b> <b>transistor</b> demonstrated here has many characteristics of its electronic analogue and promises to be a stepping stone for future optical computing. ^ This work will also touch base on some of the early work on realizing inverse opal photonic crystals as an efficient thin film solar cell back-reflector and on fabricating photonic crystals through a scaffold of hydrogen silsesquioxane resist. ...|$|E
