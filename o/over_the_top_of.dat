5|$|A train may {{occasionally}} {{experience a}} rollback following a launch. A rollback {{occurs when the}} train fails to make it <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the tower and descends back down the side it was launched. Kingda Ka includes retractable magnetic brakes on its launch track to prevent a train from rolling back into the loading station.|$|E
5|$|In 1675, John Ogilby {{noted that}} the main {{coaching}} route from London to Southampton ran <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the down, going directly from Alresford to Twyford, avoiding Winchester. This remained the main coaching route until about 1800, when an alternative route via Winchester (now mostly the A31 and former A33) was formed. During this time, {{and up to the}} 19th century, the area was sometimes known as Morestead Down after the nearby village of Morestead.|$|E
5|$|On May 31, 1917, {{the flag}} {{was chosen as}} the state's {{official}} banner. The General Assembly made only one change to Hadley's original design: they added the word Indiana, in a crescent shape, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the torch. The state banner was later renamed the state's flag in a new statute passed in 1955 that also standardized the dimensions of the flag.|$|E

5|$|The race {{saw some}} {{incidents}} which caused riders to lose valuable time. Gu Sun-Geun (South Korea) {{lost control of}} her bike, bringing others down with her. She eventually fell into a concrete ditch {{on the side of}} the highway. Natalia Boyarskaya (Russia), who had built a lead of 59seconds <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Badaling, had to stop to see which way to choose at a poorly marked intersection.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} pirate was the Miners pirate {{radio station}} dubbed Radio Arthur by the media, which operated in the Nottinghamshire area during the 1984/1985 miners strike; downloads {{of some of}} its programmes are available on www.g0mrf.com. This station transmitted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Radio Trent on both mediumwave using 3500 watts and VHF using 800 watts or more. Mentioned in a House of Lords debate in Hansard as Radio Scargill, it was stated that it had been actively pursued and closed down by the authorities; however this was incorrect and the people involved were never caught. Other recordings of Radio Arthur are on the Pirate Archive website.|$|E
5|$|Cumulus {{supplementary}} features are most commonly {{seen with the}} species congestus. Cumulus virga clouds are cumulus clouds producing virga (precipitation that evaporates while aloft), and cumulus praecipitatio produce precipitation that reaches the Earth's surface. Cumulus pannus comprise shredded clouds that normally appear beneath the parent cumulus cloud during precipitation. Cumulus arcus clouds have a gust front, and cumulus tuba clouds have funnel clouds or tornadoes. Cumulus pileus clouds refer to cumulus clouds that have grown so rapidly as to force the formation of pileus <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cloud. Cumulus velum clouds have an ice crystal veil over the growing top of the cloud.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Uxbridge {{adopted the}} Royal Navy {{destroyer}} HMS Intrepid in 1942, to help towards the ship's costs; Intrepid {{was lost to}} enemy action the following year. The town and surrounding areas suffered bombing by the Luftwaffe. V1 flying bombs fell on the town between June 1944 and March 1945. The first recorded bombing using a V1 was on 22 June 1944 at 07:00, when the bomb passed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> a bus and hit four houses nearby. Seven {{people were killed and}} 25 injured, leaving 46 houses in the area uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested {{the ball down}} for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from deep inside his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just {{beyond the reach of}} Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Notable in Western Chalukya {{architecture}} are {{the decorative}} door panels that {{run along the}} length of the door and over on top to form a lintel. These decorations appear as bands of delicately chiseled fretwork, moulded colonettes and scrolls scribed with tiny figures. The bands are separated by deep narrow channels and grooves and run <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the door. The temple plan often included a heavy slanting cornice of double curvature, which projected outward from the roof of the open mantapa. This was intended to reduce heat from the sun, blocking the harsh sunlight and preventing rainwater from pouring in between the pillars. The underside of the cornice looks like woodwork because of the rib-work. Occasionally, a straight slabbed cornice is seen.|$|E

5|$|Only {{six minutes}} later, in the 62nd minute, Stoke had their key chance and only shot on {{target of the}} match with Kenwyne Jones in the 61st minute. A looping ball <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Manchester City defence by Matthew Etherington allowed Jones a one-on-one, but he failed to convert, firing {{straight}} at goalkeeper Joe Hart with the ball ricocheting off both striker and keeper before bobbling to safety. Doubts over Matthew Etherington's fitness resurfaced when he was taken off in the 63rd minute, with Stoke City still in the game at 0–0 as it stood.|$|E
5|$|The navigations often form a {{short cut}} for boaters between the River Nene at Peterborough and the River Great Ouse at Salters Lode Lock. The {{suggested}} route passes through Stanground Sluice, along King's Dyke to Ashline Lock, and then along Whittlesey Dike to Flood's Ferry junction. From here the route is along the old {{course of the}} River Nene, passing through the twin villages of Outwell and Upwell, where the abandoned Wisbech Canal once formed a route back to the new course of the River Nene. The final stretch to Salters Lode lock is along Well Creek, passing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Level Main Drain on Mullicourt Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Edge against Batista in a Steel Cage {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship, which could be won by pinfall, submission, or {{escaping}} the cage. During {{the first few minutes}} of the contest, Edge attempted to escape the cage many times but Batista stopped him and gained the advantage after a suplex to Edge off the top rope. Edge gained the upper hand late in the contest, performing a spear to Batista, but didn't get the pinfall. Batista regained the advantage and attempted the Batista Bomb, but Edge reversed the move. Edge climbed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the cage while Batista crawled towards the door. Edge's feet hit the arena floor first, and he was declared the winner and retained his title.|$|E

60|$|That night Mrs. Archibald {{lay awake}} on her straw mattress. Absolute {{darkness}} was about her, {{but through the}} open window she could see, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees {{on the other side of}} the lake, one little star.|$|R
5|$|Thus, {{the route}} chosen {{was a direct}} line between Saugus and Gorman, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the ridge for many miles. Due to cost and {{drainage}} concerns, {{and a desire to}} reduce altering the terrain, the road was built with 697curves, high in the mountains. Construction on the Ridge Route, officially considered to run from Castaic Junction (west of Saugus on the road to Ventura) {{to the bottom of the}} grade at Grapevine, began in 1914. The highway was one of the earliest projects completed by the California Highway Commission. To construct the road, horse-drawn scrapers were used.|$|E
5|$|With half-time fast approaching, Barcelona's {{confidence}} {{began to}} show: first, Messi attempted to flick a pass <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the United defence to Thierry Henry, which Rio Ferdinand intercepted; Iniesta then tried an ambitious back-heel that Van der Sar collected; and finally Messi sped through three Manchester United defenders towards the by-line, only for his cut-back cross to be pounced upon by Van der Sar and then cleared by Vidić. On {{the stroke of}} half-time, Iniesta himself then attempted to flick the ball through to Henry, {{but it was just}} too high for the French striker, and referee Massimo Busacca took that cue to blow the whistle for the interval.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys, with small electric motors to overcome friction. The new lift was built <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion.|$|E
60|$|The {{sun rose}} {{while they were}} {{crossing}} the moor, a dazzle <b>of</b> light <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills. The sunshine crept down the slopes into the peaceful green valleys, where little white cottages nestled in gardens and orchards.|$|R
50|$|De la Fuente's three leads <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> climbs {{earned him}} {{the lead in the}} King of the Mountains classification, while four riders, {{including}} Agritubel team leader Christophe Moreau failed to finish and Magnus Bäckstedt finished outside regulation time.|$|R

5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, flipping <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park {{near the end of}} the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1966, XB-70A No. 2 was {{in close}} {{formation}} {{with four other}} aircraft (an F-4 Phantom, an F-5, a T-38 Talon, and an F-104 Starfighter) for a photoshoot {{at the behest of}} General Electric, manufacturer of the engines of all five aircraft. After the completion of the photoshoot, the F-104 drifted into contact with the XB-70's right wing, flipped over and rolled inverted <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the Valkyrie, striking the vertical stabilizers and left wing of the bomber. The F-104 exploded, destroying the Valkyrie's rudders and damaging its left wing. With the loss of both rudders and damage to the wings, the Valkyrie entered an uncontrollable spin and crashed into the ground north of Barstow, California. NASA Chief Test Pilot Joe Walker (F-104 pilot) and Carl Cross (XB-70 co-pilot) were killed. Al White (XB-70 pilot) ejected, sustaining serious injuries, including one arm crushed by the closing clamshell-like escape crew capsule moments prior to ejection.|$|E
5|$|The Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, {{formerly}} known as the United Road stand and the North Stand, runs <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> United Road. The stand is three tiers tall, and can hold about 26,000 spectators, the most of the four stands. It can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes and hospitality suites. It opened in its current state in 1996, having previously been a single-tiered stand. As the ground's main stand, it houses many of the ground's more popular facilities, including the Red Café (a Manchester United theme restaurant/bar) and the Manchester United museum and trophy room. Originally opened in 1986 as {{the first of its kind}} in the world, the Manchester United museum was in the south-east corner of the ground until it moved to the redeveloped North Stand in 1998. The museum was opened by Pelé on 11 April 1998, since when numbers of visitors have jumped from 192,000 in 1998 to more than 300,000visitors in 2009.|$|E
