Virtua Fighter, a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan.s 3D characters have a presence that 2D sprites just can't match. The characters really do seem 'alive', whether they're throwing a punch, unleashing a special move or reeling from a blow... The Saturn version of Virtua Fighter is an exceptional game in many respects. It's arguably the first true 'next generation' console game, fusing the best aspects of combat gameplay with groundbreaking animation and gorgeous sound (CD music and clear samples). In the arcades, Virtua Fighter made people stop and look. On the Saturn, it will make many people stop, look at their bank balance and then fork out for Sega's new machine. <b>Over</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Sony. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210173015/http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/virtua-fighter-review/ |archivedate=December 10, 2014 }} The only other first-party title available on launch day was Wan Chai Connection. Sega had wanted the launch to include both Clockwork Knight and Panzer Dragoon, but the latter was not ready in time. Fueled by the popularity of Virtua Fighter, Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side-by-side, the Saturn {{proved to be the}} more popular system. Meanwhile, Sega {{released the}} 32X on November 21, 1994 in North America, December 3, 1994 in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at {{less than half of the}} Saturn's launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. 500,000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher sell-through rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day order system that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.|$|E

500|$|In March 1948 Horne {{appeared}} with Murdoch in six episodes of the BBC Television comedy series Kaleidoscope. In June that year he and Murdoch again appeared {{on television in}} a one-off sitcom, At Home, which they wrote. The following year Horne began his connection with Twenty Questions, an association that lasted, on-and-off, for 20 years. By the fourth series of Much-Binding in 1950, the listener figures had declined to a level that concerned the BBC and they decided against a fifth series. Rather than {{wait to see what}} other offers of work would come in from the Corporation, Horne and Murdoch signed the comedy to a 35-programme series on Radio Luxembourg between October 1950 and June 1951. The programme was poorly received on the commercial channel: Murdoch observed that [...] "it wasn't really a great success—even my mother said it was rotten, and she was my greatest fan". After one series, the show returned to the BBC in 1951–52, although renamed as <b>Over</b> <b>to</b> <b>You.</b> Murdoch and Horne again appeared together, in April 1952, on Desert Island Discs.|$|E
500|$|Although Sibelius {{informed}} {{his secretary}} in late August 1945 that the symphony had been burned, the matter remained a secret {{confined to the}} composer's private circle. During the remaining years of his life, Sibelius {{from time to time}} hinted that the Eighth Symphony project was still alive. In August 1945 he wrote to Basil Cameron: [...] "I have finished my eighth symphony several times, but I am still not satisfied with it. I will be delighted to hand it <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> when the time comes." [...] In fact, after the burning he had altogether abandoned creative composing; in 1951, when the Royal Philharmonic Society requested a work to mark the 1951 Festival of Britain, Sibelius declined. As late as 1953 he told his secretary Levas that he was working on the symphony [...] "in his mind"; only in 1954 did he admit, {{in a letter to the}} widow of his friend Adolf Paul, that it would never be completed. Sibelius died on 20 September 1957; the next day his daughter Eva Paloheimo announced publicly that the Eighth Symphony did not exist. The burning of the manuscript became generally known later, when Aino revealed the fact to the composer's biographer Erik W. Tawaststjerna.|$|E

2500|$|Mishnah Sheviit chapter 10 and Tosefta Sheviit 8:3–11 {{interpreted}} [...] {{to address}} debts and the Sabbatical year. The Mishnah {{held that the}} Sabbatical year cancelled loans, whether they were secured by a bond or not, but did not cancel debts to a shopkeeper or unpaid wages of a laborer, unless these debts were made into loans. When Hillel saw people refraining from lending, in transgression of [...] he ordained the prosbul (...) , which ensured the repayment of loans notwithstanding the Sabbatical year. Citing the literal meaning of [...] — [...] "this is {{the word of the}} release" [...] — the Mishnah held that a creditor could accept payment of a debt notwithstanding an intervening Sabbatical year, if the creditor had first by word told the debtor that the creditor relinquished the debt. A prosbul prevents the remission of debts in the Sabbatical year. Hillel saw that people were unwilling to lend money to one another and disregarded the precept laid down in [...] "Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand'; and your eye be evil against your needy brother, and you give him nothing," [...] and Hillel therefore decided to institute the prosbul. The text of the prosbul says: [...] "I hand <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> So-and-so, the judges in such-and-such a place, my bonds, so that I may be able to recover any money owing to me from So-and-so at any time I shall desire."
