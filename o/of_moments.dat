Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground.

40|$|Abstract. The {{existence}} <b>of</b> magnetic <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> neutrinos {{points to}} physics beyond the standard model. Given current upper limits, terrestrial measurements are difficult or completely unfeasible.

We describe the way of estimating the magnitudes <b>of</b> transition <b>moments</b> from such observations. I INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY The importance <b>of</b> measuring magnetic <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> neutrinos stems form the fact that the existence <b>of</b> such <b>moments</b> points to physics beyond the standard model. To be sure, a minimal enlargement of the standard model by means of right handed neutrinos alone leads to the existence <b>of</b> magnetic <b>moments</b> induce...|$|R
