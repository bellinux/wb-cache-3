The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground.

40|$|Abstract. The {{existence}} <b>of</b> magnetic <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> neutrinos {{points to}} physics beyond the standard model. Given current upper limits, terrestrial measurements are difficult or completely unfeasible.

We describe the way of estimating the magnitudes <b>of</b> transition <b>moments</b> from such observations. I INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY The importance <b>of</b> measuring magnetic <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> neutrinos stems form the fact that the existence <b>of</b> such <b>moments</b> points to physics beyond the standard model. To be sure, a minimal enlargement of the standard model by means of right handed neutrinos alone leads to the existence <b>of</b> magnetic <b>moments</b> induce...|$|R
