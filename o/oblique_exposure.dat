40|$|Background—Radiofrequency (RF) cardiac {{catheter}} ablation procedures {{may require}} extended fluoroscopic exposure resulting in elevated radiation risk. The {{aim of the}} present study was to accurately establish RF ablation radiation risk levels and to provide means for accurate patient risk estimation from studies performed in any electrophysiology laboratory. Methods and Results—Fluoroscopy required during cardiac ablation was classified into 4 types identified by beam orientation and irradiated tissue: (1) posteroanterior exposure during catheter advancing from the groin to the heart, (2) posteroanterior heart exposure, (3) left anterior oblique heart exposure, and (4) right anterior oblique heart exposure. The duration of each exposure was monitored in 24 patients undergoing RF cardiac ablation. Dose per minute of fluoroscopy was measured at 15 organs/tissues for each projection with the use of anthropomorphic phantom and thermolumines-cence dosimetry. The effective dose rate was 219, 144, 136, and 112 mGy/min for groin-to-heart posteroanterior, posteroanterior, left anterior oblique, and right anterior <b>oblique</b> <b>exposure,</b> respectively. A typical ablation procedure results in a total effective dose of 8. 3 mSv per hour of fluoroscopy. The average excess of fatal cancers was estimated to be 650 and 480 per million patients undergoing RF ablation requiring 1 hour of fluoroscopy for US and UK populations, respectively. The average risk for genetic defects was determined to be 1 per million births. Conclusions—Radiation risk from RF cardiac ablation is moderate compared with other complications, but it may highly exceed radiation risk from common radiological procedures. Efforts should be made toward minimization of patien...|$|E
40|$|Grating and {{photoinduced}} anisotropic modifications {{are made}} to polyimide layers to promote homogeneous and pretilted nematic liquid crystal alignment. Gratings are etched into the polyimide by irradiating a phase mask of period 1. 1 #mu#m with the output from a KrF excimer laser of wavelength 248 nm with fluences above the threshold required for ablation. Grating depths from 10 to 190 nm have been achieved using a simple pulse from the laser, and the liquid crystal azimuthal anchoring energy is determined {{as a function of}} the grating depth. Values up to 1. 3 x 10 "-" 5 Jm"-" 2 are found. Discrepancies are found when comparisons are made between experimental data and a theory based upon elastic strain energy minimisation. A modified theory taking finite polar anchoring into account shows better agreement. Polarised excimer laser radiation at normal incidence is used to induce an anisotropy which gives rise to homogeneous liquid crystal alignment. The strength of the azimuthal anchoring energy is similar to that produced by grating alignment. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that the alignment originates from the stronger depletion of polyimide chains parallel to the exposure polarisation direction. The dependence of beam fluence and exposure time on the anchoring energy is measured, and the degradation mechanism of the polyimide is investigated {{as a function of the}} exposure. We find that oxidative degradation takes place. We also use these techniques to identify the chemical composition of the polyimide material. Pretilted liquid crystal alignment has also been achieved, with pretilt angles up to 3. 7 deg. A tilted polymer distribution is generated by <b>oblique</b> <b>exposure</b> of the polyimide to an elliptically polarised beam. We measure the liquid crystal pretilt angle as a function of the angle of incidence, and exposure time and present a theoretical analysis of the polyimide chain azimuthal distribution which agrees with the experimental results. Finally, a simple and novel technique to achieve pretilted grating alignment is shown.

40|$|The article {{addresses}} the reinterpretation of the problematic {{of security in}} the messianic turn in contemporary continental political thought. I focus on Giorgio Agamben's reinterpretation of Hobbes's Leviathan in Stasis, which restores an eschatological dimension to this foundational text of modern security politics. Hobbes's commonwealth has been traditionally read as a secularized version of the katechon, a force that restrains {{the state of nature}} while drawing on its resources. Instead, Agamben argues that for Hobbes, the state is neither the analogue of God's kingdom on earth nor the katechon that delays its arrival, but the profane power that will disappear when the kingdom of God is established on earth. It is thus in principle incapable of attaining the peace and security that it claims to provide, perpetually producing insecurity and violence in the guise of protection. In Agamben's reading, it is precisely this failure of the state's security apparatuses that assists the advent of the messianic event in an <b>oblique</b> fashion. The <b>exposure</b> of this failure does not aspire to the improvement of the apparatuses of security or resign us to inescapable insecurity but only affirms the need to render the present apparatuses inoperative, bringing forth a future without them...|$|R
