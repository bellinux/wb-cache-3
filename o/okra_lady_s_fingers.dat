40|$|A phytobezoar {{is one of}} the intraluminal {{causes of}} gastric outlet obstruction, {{especially}} in patients with previous gastric surgery and/or gastric motility disorders. Before the proton pump inhibitor era, vagotomy, pyloroplasty, gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy were commonly performed procedures in peptic ulcer patients. One of the sequelae of gastrojejunostomy is phytobezoar formation. However, a bezoar causing gastric outlet obstruction is rare even with giant gastric bezoars. We report a rare case of gastric outlet obstruction due to a phytobezoar obstructing the efferent limb of the gastrojejunostomy site. This phytobezoar which consisted of a whole piece of <b>okra</b> (<b>lady</b> finger vegetable) was successfully removed by endoscopic snare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of okra bezoar-related gastrojejunostomy efferent limb obstruction reported in the literature...|$|R

Romeo agrees, and, the next night, he eagerly goes out into the ring as Masked Man M. The two proceed to fight one another, much to Masked Man M's joy. The fight progresses until <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> traps Masked Man M in a headlock, suffocating him while telling him [...] "This is what you want, right?" [...] She brings him to a near death experience while telling him that he should just remain in his fantasy world. However, the children from his orphanage are attending that night and beg Masked Man M not to give up, which spurs him to touch one of the wrestling ring ropes with his foot. This forces <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> to release him from the headlock, but she then proceeds to continually beat him. <b>Lady</b> <b>S</b> overestimates the power {{in one of her}} jumps and ends up getting knocked out by the impact when Masked Man M moves out of the way at the last minute.

40|$|<b>Okra</b> (<b>Lady’s</b> finger, Abelmoschus esculentus) fibres were {{introduced}} in a poly(lactic) acid (PLA) polymer matrix as short fibres (5 – 10 mm), in amounts variable between 10 and 30 %wt. For this purpose, both untreated and alkali treated okra fibres were used. The obtained composites, {{in view of the}} envisaged application for sustainable packaging purposes, has been tested morphologically, mechanically and subjected to chemical characterisation, while the biodegradation profile has been studied. The introduction of fibres in the polymer matrix always resulted in a higher stiffness of the obtained composite. The addition of okra fibre to PLA results in an increased ability of the PLA matrix to crystallize due to the nucleation effect of the okra fibre, and this effect was more evident in the composites produced with alkali treated fibres. The biodegradation process was accelerated by the addition of higher contents of fibres into the composites due to preferential degradation of the fibres themselves: this effect was increased when composite fibres are alkali-treated...|$|R

40|$|Haptic {{interaction}} {{has received}} increasing research interest in recent years. Currently, most commercially available haptic devices provide the user {{with a single}} point of interaction. Multi-point haptic devices present a logical progression in device design and enable the operator to experience a far wider range of haptic interactions, particularly the ability to grasp via multiple fingers. This is highly desirable for various haptically enabled applications including virtual training, telesurgery and telemanipulation. This paper presents a gripper attachment which utilises two low-cost commercially available haptic devices to facilitate multi-point haptic grasping. It provides the ability to render forces to the user 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>fingers</b> independently and using Phantom Omni haptic devices offers several benefits over more complex approaches such as low-cost, reliability, and ease of programming.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo isolate and {{evaluate}} comparatively the binding {{efficacy of the}} mucilages obtained from the plants of Hibiscus rosasinensis and Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus). MethodsExtraction of mucilages from the leaves of Hibiscus and pods of <b>Okra</b> (<b>Ladies</b> finger) {{was carried out by}} a cold maceration process. The extracted mucilages were subjected to various physicochemical properties for its suitability as an excipient in the formulation of tablet dosage form. Different concentrations (10, 8, 5, 2 and 1 % w/v) of binder solutions of Hibiscus and Okra were used for the formulation of tablets and the formulated tablets were evaluated by studying the standard parameters like diameter, thickness, weight variation, hardness, friability, disintegration and in vitro dissolution. Stability studies of the formulated tablets were conducted for four weeks. ResultsThe formulated tablets prepared using the mucilages of both Hibiscus and Okra had good appearance. The in vitro drug release profile of the tablets prepared using Okra mucilage had an optimum of 90 % at a mucilage concentration of 1 % w/v concentration mucilage itself within 4 h. ConclusionsAccording to the observations, the lower concentration levels of Okra can be used as an alternative binder to starch. The higher concentration levels of Okra mucilage show a slow and sustained release, and can be considered as an alternative natural excipient in the modified drug delivery systems. At the same time, the above natural excipient of Hibiscus mucilage {{could be used as a}} platform for prolonged release if its binder concentrations are increased...|$|R
