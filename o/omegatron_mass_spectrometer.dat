40|$|An atomic oxygen beam {{system has}} been {{designed}} and tested for the laboratory evaluation of mass spectrometers used in upper atmospheric measurements. The atomic oxygen is generated by thermal dissociation of molecular oxygen {{on the surface of}} a tungsten filament heated to 2800 K. A symmetrical bidirectional beam is produced to permit simultaneous monitoring of the particle flux in the beam while target experiments are being conducted. Flux levels of 5 × 1014 particles cm− 2 sec− 1 over a cross‐sectional area of 1 cm 2 have been produced with a relative atomic oxygen concentration of 70 %. At flux levels below 1013 particles cm− 2 sec− 1, relative atomic oxygen concentrations of more than 90 % were obtained. The oxygen beam is of high purity and free from chemically active contaminants. Strong chemical and low temperature pumping are used to reduce background gas contributions to less than 1 %. Measurements of the relative atomic concentration in the beam were made with a quadrupole spectrometer using an open flowthrough ion source. The absolute flux of molecular oxygen was determined with the aid of an enclosed <b>omegatron</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> The combined use of both instruments permitted a determination of the magnitude of the atomic oxygen flux in the beam...|$|E
40|$|An <b>Omegatron</b> type <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> {{has been}} {{investigated}} both theoretically and experimentally to determine its detailed operation and limitations. Resolution, peak height, shape and frequency have been calculated theoretically and compared experimentally. A method is given for sketching ion trajectories in the nonlinear case (e. g., with space charge). Using this method, it is shown that {{a small amount of}} space charge will seriously hamper the operation of the Omegatron in that it will limit the maximum excursion of a resonant ion and thus limit the possible resolution. It is shown that under normal operating conditions a trapping voltage is necessary to maintain ion collection efficiency, and that this trapping voltage causes a space charge sufficient in size to result in nonlinear ion trajectories and poor operation. It is concluded that in order to get good operation of the Omegatron some method will have to be found for eliminating the space charge or its effects. Several possibilities for doing this are suggested, the most intriguing one being to use a dipole type of RF electric field rather then a uniform one...|$|R
