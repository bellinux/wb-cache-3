5|$|On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{instructed}} Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (<b>OFT)</b> {{to examine}} Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market {{because of concerns}} the takeover {{may not be in}} the public interest. On 11 October, the <b>OFT</b> agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The <b>OFT</b> concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013.|$|E

The NCC's product complaint included Apple's iLife as well as Microsoft's Office for Mac, and products by Corel, Adobe, Symantec, Kaspersky, McAfee, and others.

The empirical data for the study were collected from the organic farmers of the selected villages of Tangail district in Bangladesh. The {{results of the study}} identified four factors like development of knowledge and awareness regarding environmental issues, creation of health awareness, and simplicity of the <b>OFTs</b> and availability of basic production factors as the major influential factors which can increase the extent of practice of <b>OFTs</b> by the farmers.

All hands and most of the ship's stores were saved, but the condition of the ship's timbers made it impossible to free the ship; her captain was cleared of responsibility for the ship's loss thanks to documents detailing her defects. Recently, the wreck of Agamemnon has been located, and several artefacts have been recovered, including one of her cannons.|$|E

Ground was broken in April 1968 and an <b>oft</b> behind-schedule construction plan lasted for 29months. The stadium opened on July 16, 1970, when the Pirates played their first game there. In the 1971 World Series, Three Rivers Stadium hosted the first World Series game played at night. The following year, the stadium was the site of the Immaculate Reception. The final game in the stadium was won by the Steelers on December 16, 2000. Three Rivers Stadium also hosted the Pittsburgh Maulers of the United States Football League and the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team for a single season each.|$|E

Phase 2.3 added the Electronic Warfare suite upgrade (Radar Warning Receiver, Radio Frequency Jammer) and phase 2.4 upgraded with the Target Designation System (HTDS).

5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} antics {{are another}} recurring theme in popular culture. On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial bumpers has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of Sophia Loren staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous eyebrow at the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. The photo of Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set. The meeting between Mansfield and Anton LaVey, the founder and high priest of the Church of Satan, was a much publicized and <b>oft</b> quoted event of her life, {{as well as the}} history of the Church.|$|E

Four on-farm tests (<b>OFTs)</b> were established across the dryland cropping region of Adams County, Washington, to investigate the performance of Otto in comparison to Xerpha with and without fungicide application. <b>OFTs</b> were conducted as strip-split block designs. Otto yielded 65. 4 bu/ac, significantly higher than Xerpha at only 63. 0 bu/ac.

40|$|AbstractThets 49 {{mutation}} of {{vaccinia virus}} WR was mapped by marker rescue to the E 11 gene encoding a 15 -kDa polypeptide. During synchronous infection of BSC 40 cells with wild-type virus, immunoreactive E 11 protein accumulated {{in parallel with}} the onset of late protein synthesis. Immunoblotting of extracts of wild-type virions showed that the E 11 protein was encapsidated within the virus core. A normal temporal pattern of viral protein synthesis was observed in cells infected withts 49 at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °) and normal-appearingts 49 progeny virions were observed by electron microscopy. Sequencing of the E 11 gene <b>ofts</b> 49 revealed a single amino acid substitution, Gly(66) Arg, in the mutant E 11 polypeptide. The steady-state level of E 11 protein duringts 49 infection was much lower than that observed during infection with wild-type virus. This was the case at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. We discuss two possible explanations for the thermosensitive growth <b>ofts</b> 49 : (i) that virus infectivity requires a threshold level of active E 11 protein or (ii) that E 11 function is conditionally essential...|$|R
