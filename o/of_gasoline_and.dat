5|$|Government {{officials}} and businessmen from Paraguay began negotiations in 2007 with Brazilian automakers {{in order to}} import flex cars that run on any blend <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> ethanol. If successful, Paraguay would become the first destination for Brazilian flex-fuel car exports. In May 2008, the Paraguayan government announced a plan to eliminate import taxes of flex-fuel vehicles and an incentive program for ethanol production. The plan also includes the purchase of 20,000 flex cars in 2009 for the government fleet.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} built train car interiors for {{the quarantine}} car where {{the patient was}} being kept and the sleeper cars, and floated the train sets on inner tubes to create the feeling of movement. Seven different cameras were used by director Rob Bowman when filming the train car explosion. Forty-five gallons <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> <b>and</b> 120 black-powder bombs {{were used for the}} effect. The car used had been obtained cheaply from a Vancouver-based rail company, and had been considered scrap due to being bent. After the explosion was recorded, a bell from the train was recovered some distance from the site by the physical effects supervisor Dave Gauthier, who had it polished and engraved with a message for Bowman.|$|E

5|$|Wes grabs a can <b>of</b> <b>{{gasoline}}</b> <b>and</b> pours a {{trail from}} the Jeep to the woods. They lure the Grizzly Bear {{to it and}} then set the gasoline on fire. The Jeep explodes, but the bear is unharmed. They decide to try another plan and split up. Wes climbs a tree, leaving his blood covered clothes {{on the ground to}} fool the Bear. While the Bear is sniffing at the clothes, Wes accidentally drops a tire iron, calling the bear's attention up. The bear shakes him out of the tree but he escapes and goes to the shack where Lauren has built a trap. They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape. Unfortunately, Wes stumbles and Lauren tries to get him back up, refusing to leave him behind despite his desperate insistence that she should run. The Bear catches up to them and presumably kills them both.|$|E
