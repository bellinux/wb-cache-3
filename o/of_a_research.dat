5|$|In 1957, Woodruff was {{appointed}} to the Chair of Surgical Science at the University of Edinburgh without requiring an interview. At the university, he split his time equally between his clinical and teaching responsibilities and his research. He was also allowed to appoint two assistant researchers who went on to become prominent in their own right, Donald Michie and James Howard. As a major part of his research, Woodruff served as the honorary director <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Research</b> Group on Transplantation established by the Medical Research Council.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 1929, The Capitol Theatre, a major Jasper Avenue {{competitor}} to the Princess, {{closed for}} renovations promising {{a change that}} “will please every theatre-goer in Edmonton”. Almost three months later on March 27, the theatre reopened with dual Movietone and Vitaphone sound systems. The availability of electronically indexed articles from the Edmonton Journal has caused the proliferation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>research</b> error in several local histories. These histories claim that the first talkie screened in Edmonton was The Canary Murder Case, {{and that it was}} screened at the Princess. In fact, the first talkie in Edmonton was Mother Knows Best, screened at the Capitol.|$|E

5|$|The Mount Washington Observatory {{was built}} on the summit in 1932 through a group {{interested}} in and noting the worth <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>research</b> facility at that demanding location. The observatory's weather data have accumulated a climate record since. Temperature and humidity readings have been collected using a sling psychrometer, a simple device containing two mercury thermometers. Where most unstaffed weather stations have undergone technology upgrades, consistent use of the sling psychrometer has helped provide scientific precision to the Mount Washington climate record.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} evening Djorgovski again {{observed the}} region. He compared the images from both nights but the error box contained no objects that had decreased in luminosity between May8 and May9. Metzger noticed one object that had increased in luminosity, but he {{assumed it was}} a variable star rather than the GRB afterglow. Titus Galama and Paul Groot, members <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>research</b> team in Amsterdam led by Jan van Paradijs, compared images taken by the WIYN Telescope on May8 and the William Herschel Telescope on May9. They were also unable to find any light sources which had faded during that time.|$|E
5|$|Peter Brock (Michael Bryant) is the {{selfish and}} petulant head <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>research</b> team for Ryan Electrics. His team is {{developing}} a new recording medium that will give the company an edge over its Japanese competitors. They move into a new facility at Taskerlands, an old Victorian mansion that has been renovated for their use. On arrival, they learn from estates manager Roy Collinson (Iain Cuthbertson) that the refurbishment {{of one of the}} rooms in Taskerlands remains uncompleted, the builders having refused to work in it because it is supposedly haunted. The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E

5|$|Suzuki was {{inspired}} to write a biography of a tree when he noticed a Douglas-fir with an uncharacteristic curve in its trunk and speculated what caused it to grow into that shape. Suzuki studied the topic with the help <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>research</b> assistant and solicited Grady to help write the book. Vancouver publishers Greystone Books released the book in September 2004. In the Canadian market, it peaked at number three in the Maclean's and the National Post non-fiction best seller lists and was nominated for several awards. In February 2005 {{it was published in}} Australia by Allen & Unwin. The premise and writing were well received by critics. While several reviewers found that the authors succeeded in using accessible language, others found it too technical.|$|E
5|$|Tronstad {{spent the}} first year <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>research</b> period as an {{assistant}} to Herbert Freundlich in Dahlem, Berlin. He studied the passivity of metal surfaces, and made a breakthrough when he managed to measure extremely thin oxide surface coatings, thus solving a problem dating from the time of Michael Faraday. He continued to Stockholm to study metallography under Carl Benedicks, and to elaborate further on his results from Berlin. The work was completed in 1931 and his thesis, spanning 250 pages, was published in German as Optische Untersuchungen zur Frage der Passivität des Eisens und Stahls. For it, he received the doctorate degree. He was hired at the Norwegian Institute of Technology as a lecturer in the summer of 1931, although he {{spent the first}} year at the University of Cambridge, conducting further research with a scholarship from a memorial fund of Christian Michelsen. The research at Cambridge was a continuation of his thesis work, but this time he tested his method on mercury.|$|E
