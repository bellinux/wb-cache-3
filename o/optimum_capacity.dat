The carmaker evaluated about twenty-five different battery cell chemistries and constructions from around two dozen lithium-ion battery makers around the world.

By the end of October 2007 CPI (LG Chem) delivered their finished battery pack prototypes, and A123 delivered theirs by January 2008.

New analytical approach {{have been reported to}} derive an information theoretic upper bound on the <b>optimum</b> joint decoding <b>capacity</b> of circular Wyner GCMAC. This approach is based on the approximation of the PDF of trace of composite Hadamard product matrix (G ∘ Ω) by employing the Hadamard inequality.

The proposed analytical approach has been validated by using Monte Carlo simulations for variable user-density cellular system. It has been shown that a reasonably tighter upper bound on <b>optimum</b> joint decoding <b>capacity</b> can be obtained by exploiting Hadamard inequality for realistic scenarios in cellular network. The importance of the methodology presented here {{lies in the fact that}} it allows a realistic representation of the MT's spatial arrangement.

40|$|In this thesis, {{a method}} {{based on a}} {{sensitivity}} analysis and quadratic curve-fitting technique for power loss reduction in a low-voltage distribution area is proposed. Loss sensitivity based method is used to determine some potential DG sites and least-square based curve-fitting technique is used to find out <b>optimum</b> DG <b>capacity.</b> Results obtained from the proposed method is justified using the exhaustive search method which is a computer program that searches for all alternatives by evaluating each individually. For determining the <b>optimum</b> generation <b>capacity</b> of multiple DG units, a new methodology based on an unbalanced multi-phase optimal power flow (UM-OPF) is presented in this thesis. During the formulation of the UM-OPF, an optimisation algorithm is developed in Matlab and the unbalanced multi-phase power flow is solved using the Electric Power Research Institute’s (EPRI) software OpenDSS. To ensure a global minimum loss profile, a swarm intelligence-based adaptive weight particle swarm optimisation (AW-PSO) algorithm is used which shows better convergence profile compared with basic PSO algorithm. Validation of the proposed methodologies is also conducted using an exhaustive search algorithm. The results obtained from the proposed methods show that significant loss reduction is possible using multiple optimum sized DG units. To determine the <b>optimum</b> DG <b>capacity,</b> with varying generation and load, a cost minimisation planning methodology is also proposed. During the planning process, different DG technologies (such as solar and wind) are considered.

First, we show that the optimum transmit directions of each user are the eigenvectors of its own channel covariance and mean feedback matrices, in the covariance and mean feedback models, respectively.
