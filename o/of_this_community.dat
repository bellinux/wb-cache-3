5|$|The first {{document}} {{mentioning the}} existence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community</b> {{is the town}} charter granted by Mathieu d'Alsace in 1181 to Gerard de Guelders, Count of Boulogne; Calais thus {{became part of the}} county of Boulogne. In 1189, Richard the Lionheart is documented to have landed at Calais on his journey to the Third Crusade.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Erie had a {{significant}} Russian immigrant community, many members of which worked in the shipbuilding plants along the bayfront. Unusual for a Great Lakes city, {{a substantial number of}} these Russian immigrants were priestless (Bespopovtsy) Old Believers. In 1983, most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community</b> united with the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia and became an Old Ritualist priest within the canonical Orthodox Church. Even today, the gold-domed Church of the Nativity, on the bayfront near the former heart of the Russian community, is an Old Ritualist church and home parish to the famed iconographer Fr. Theodore Jurewicz.|$|E
5|$|Members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community</b> also herd zebu {{and catch}} fish in Lake Alaotra. The work of fishing was {{traditionally}} subdivided by gender: men were only allowed {{to fish for}} eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children {{were the only ones}} allowed to fish using poles. Men and children would traditionally leave their catch on the shore for women to pick up and take back to the village.|$|E

5|$|The Mikea are hunter-gatherers (also called foragers) who {{practice}} limited farming. The Mikea label {{is applied to}} those who live this subsistence lifestyle rather than being tied to a specific ethnicity. There are numerous groups termed Mikea along the west and southwest coast of Madagascar, with the majority living {{in and around the}} spiny Mikea Forest on the southwestern coast between Morombe and Toliara, an area extending 2500 square kilometers. Historically this main concentration of Mikea may have extended as far south as the Fiherenana River and as far north as the Mangoky River; another main cluster of Mikea live to the west and southwest of Lake Ihotry. They are typically considered a subset of the Sakalava ethnic group, although there are Mikea individuals who trace their origins to other ethnic groups. Their adherence to a way of life perceived by villagers and city dwellers as ancestral has contributed to a mystique and various myths and legends about them, and many Malagasy believe they are the descendents of Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this view. The majority of Malagasy believe the existence of the Mikea to be a myth and are unaware that any Malagasy continue to live the Mikea lifestyle to the present day. The term Mikea is principally used by outsiders to label this group and is not often used by members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community</b> themselves. Most Mikea prefer to call themselves either Vezo-Mikea or Masikoro-Mikea, depending on their specific family lineages.|$|E

Although at first Messianic, they concluded that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and are now waiting to be instructed in traditional Judaism.

25|$|French Huguenots, {{who were}} Protestant, were also {{encouraged}} {{to settle in}} Ireland; they had been expelled from France after the Crown's revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Many of the Frenchmen were former soldiers, who had fought on the Williamite side in the Williamite war in Ireland. This community settled mainly in Dublin, as some had already been established as merchants in London. Their communal graveyard can still be seen off St Stephen's Green. The total population <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community</b> may have reached 10,000.|$|E
25|$|In 1341 a {{disastrous}} flood silted up {{the port of}} Cranganore, and trade shifted to a smaller port at Cochin (Kochi). Many of the Jews moved quickly, and within four years, they had built their first synagogue at the new community. The Portuguese Empire established a trading beachhead in 1500, and until 1663 remained the dominant power. They continued to discriminate against the Jews, although doing business with them. A synagogue was built at Parur in 1615, at a site that according to tradition had a synagogue built in 1165. Almost every member <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community</b> emigrated to Israel in 1954.|$|E
25|$|Since early {{settlement}} Mildura {{has been}} home to artists, writers and creative people. Organisations such as the Red Cliffs Musical Society, Eisteddfod, Mildura Ballet Guild and Mildura Country Music Festival have helped grow a reputation for home grown talent and creative community. The hub <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community</b> is the Mildura Arts Centre, which began as a gallery space at Rio Vista House in the 1950s and became fully established in 1956 with {{the building of a}} new regional art gallery and performing arts theatre. In 2012, after two years of construction, the new Mildura Arts Centre opened.|$|E

50|$|Funds for the monument's {{construction}} {{were collected}} as personal donations from Lincoln Village residents. These donations were {{as little as}} 5 cents, but the Polish community was able to raise over $13,000 which is equivalent to $344,000 in 2009 dollars. Further impressive <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community's</b> fund raising campaign is that it occurred immediately after a similar fund raising campaign {{for the construction of}} the Basilica of St. Josaphat in 1901.|$|R
25|$|Susini, {{along with}} his nephew Miguel Mugica and his friends Cesar Guerrico and Luis Romero Carranza formed part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community</b> and took part in these first {{tentative}} steps. Soon they acquired the nickname Locos de la Azotea ("the crazy people from the roof"), because their hobby involved activities - sometimes bordering on the acrobatic - on top of tall buildings, where they mounted the long wire antennas required by early-type radios. During this time, the group first played with the idea to use radio {{as a means for}} cultural dissemination, a fact that Susini himself later ascribed to their shared passion for theater and music.|$|E
25|$|Prince Louis de Condé, {{along with}} his sons Daniel and Osias, {{arranged}} with Count Ludwig von Nassau-Saarbrücken to establish a Huguenot community in present-day Saarland in 1604. The Count supported mercantilism and welcomed technically skilled immigrants into his lands, regardless of their religion. The Condés established a thriving glass-making works, which provided wealth to the principality for many years. Other founding families created enterprises based on textiles and such traditional Huguenot occupations in France. The community and its congregation remain active to this day, with descendants {{of many of the}} founding families still living in the region. Some members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community</b> emigrated to the United States in the 1890s.|$|E
25|$|Progress of the {{community}} in their Community Outcomes are to be reported at least once every three years with the first deadline having been 2009. The report <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>community</b> progress can {{be known as the}} State of the District report. Measures and indicators to this end are developed around measurement and reporting on progress to {{the community}} outcomes. A whole science is developing around where the attribution of outputs lies with regards to the outcomes being advanced. The question in the State of the District report is which part {{of the community}}'s outputs contribute to the community outcomes and by how much if any.|$|E
