50|$|Historically, Cottingham {{was noted}} for its springs: ones {{to the north of}} the town formed a north to south riverlet through the town, that drove Snuff Mill; whilst a large and {{vigorous}} gypsey existed at Keldgate. Unsustainable levels of water extraction in the area since the 1930s are though to have reduced water table levels and to have caused the disappearance of springs in the area. There is water supply infrastructure at Keldgate (reservoir, potable water treatment.), and a potable water pumping stations: at Cottingham Pumping Station (68.2 ML/d <b>extraction</b> <b>limit</b> 2004.); and at Keldgate Spring (15.9 Ml d−1 <b>extraction</b> <b>limit</b> 2004.). As of 2004 the extraction from the Cottingham and Keldgate bores, together with extraction at the nearby Springhead Pumping Station and at Dunswell (45.5 Ml d−1 each.) supplies nearly half of Kingston upon Hull's water supply.|$|R

40|$|Scrapie prion {{infectivity}} can be enriched from hamster brain homogenates {{by using}} limited proteolysis and detergent extraction. Purified fractions contain both scrapie infectivity and the protein PrP 27 - 30, which is aggregated {{in the form}} of prion rods. During purification, PrP 27 - 30 is produced from a larger membrane protein, PrPSc, by limited proteolysis with proteinase K. Brain homogenates from scrapie-infected hamsters do not contain prion rods prior to exposure to detergents and proteases. To determine whether both detergent <b>extraction</b> and <b>limited</b> proteolysis are required for the formation of prion rods, microsomal membranes were prepared from infected brains in the presence of protease inhibitors. The isolated membranes were then detergent extracted as well as protease digested to evaluate the effects of these treatments on the formation of prion rods. Neither detergent (2 % Sarkosyl) <b>extraction</b> nor <b>limited</b> proteinase K digestion of scrapie microsomes produced recognizable prion amyloid rods. Only after combining detergent <b>extraction</b> with <b>limited</b> proteolysis were numerous prion rods observed. Rod formation was influenced by the protease concentration, the specificity of the protease, and the duration of digestion. Rod formation also depended upon the detergent; some combinations of protease and detergent did not produce prion amyloid rods. Similar results were obtained with purified PrPSc fractions prepared by repeated detergent extractions in the presence of protease inhibitors. These fractions contained amorphous structures but no rods; however, prion rods were produce...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of environmental-friendly process for strategic metal <b>extraction,</b> <b>limiting</b> organic solvent use and effluent production, {{appears to be}} quite a challenging purpose. Production of pure molybdenum using supercritical CO 2 extraction process, from sulfuric solution obtained by ore or used catalyst leaching, has been evaluated. Two organic ligands, trioctylamine and 2 -ethylhexyl 2 -ethylhexylphosphonic acid, were studied to extract Mo as metal complexes solubilized in supercritical CO 2. Extraction with trioctylamine revealed to be non-efficient {{due to a lack of}} Mo-trioctylamine complex solubility in CO 2, even if extraction selectivity of molybdenum versus iron impurity was interesting. On the contrary, extraction with 2 -ethylhexyl 2 -ethylhexylphosphonic acid leads to high Mo collection efficiency (up to 90 % in 7 h). However, no selectivity was observed between molybdenum and zirconium.
