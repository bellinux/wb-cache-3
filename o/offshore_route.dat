50|$|The planned {{wind farm}} was {{approximately}} 18 km {{off the coast}} of Norfolk at Sheringham, just within the 12 nm UK territorial water boundary, and 5 km north of the sand bank known as Sheringham shoal. The wind farm would be located at water depths of 16 to 22 m and consist of somewhere between 45 and 108 turbines. Benefits of the site included low shipping and trawling intensities; lack of any dredging, dumping, oil/gas, or MoD practice areas, and of cables or pipelines; as well as low visual impact from the coast, and outside any nature conservation areas. The seabed at the windfarm and <b>offshore</b> cable <b>route</b> consisted of mainly gravely sand, overlying chalk. The electrical power export cable was to be connected to a switching station near Muckleburgh Collection, via landfall near Weybourne Hope.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{estimates}} the least cost CO 2 pipeline specifications and corresponding transport {{costs for the}} offshore CCS in South Korea by using engineering-economic model. The major design factors are diameters and thicknesses of pipeline, number of boosters, and pressure conditions. First this study sets up three transport scenarios which are divided by the combination of three CO 2 capture plants. The storage site is fixed Ulleung Basin whose storage capacity is estimated to around 5 GtCO 2. The capture rates of CO 2 at each plants {{are assumed to be}} 1 MtCO 2 /y ∼ 3 MtCO 2 /y. We calculate the pressure losses, number of boosters, thicknesses of pipeline and corresponding pipeline costs for eight diameters of pipeline in the range of 6 inch to 20 inch in 2 inch steps to comply with the standard pipe size. The pipeline diameter that shows minimum cost is selected as an optimum pipeline diameter. Scenario 1 has only one capture site, Boryeong Thermal Power Plant. The onshore and offshore transport route lengths are 470 km and 60 km, respectively. The optimum pipeline diameters at the transport rate of 1 MtCO 2 /y and 3 MtCO 2 /y are 8 inch and 14 inch, respectively. The required number of boosters at the transport rate of 1 MtCO 2 /y and 3 MtCO 2 /y are 2 and 1, respectively. The estimated transport costs at the transport rate of 1 MtCO 2 /y and 3 MtCO 2 /y are $ 23 and $ 11, respectively. The scale up effect significantly reduces the transport cost at 3 MtCO 2 /y compared to 1 MtCO 2 /y. Scenario 2 has same transport route with Scenario 1, but has additional capture plant at Hadong in the midway of route. The cost per unit CO 2 of Scenario 2 is lower than Scenario 1 due to the scale up effect. Scenario 3 has two capture plants, one is Boryeong Power Plant and the other is Samcheok Power Plant. Unlike Scenario 2, the transport route is not overlapped except the <b>offshore</b> <b>route.</b> The CO 2 transported from two power plants get together at Ulsan Harbor and are transported to offshore pipeline. Because of non-overlapping two transport routes in onshore section, the overall cost is comparable to Scenario 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{culture of}} Atlantic salmon {{is one of}} the most {{developed}} aquaculture industries in the world. The production from smolt to market size usually takes place in sea cages in open waters, and these structures tend to attract wild fish, as they do for other farmed species. For salmon farming, saithe (Pollachius virens) {{is one of the}} most-frequently observed species around sea cages. An important question is whether the large concentration of salmon farms in some areas might alter the natural behaviour and migration pattern of wild saithe. We tagged 62 wild saithe with acoustic tags and followed their movements for up to 2 years in an area in Southwestern Norway with many salmon farms. Furthermore, nearly 2000 saithe were tagged with external T-bar tags to study migration beyond the study area. The recaptures of the T-bar tagged saithe from offshore areas suggest that the <b>offshore</b> migration <b>routes</b> of saithe are similar to published results from before salmon farming became significant in the area. However, a large proportion of the saithe population appears to remain in the release area and was observed at the salmon farms for much of the time. We conclude that the aquaculture industry is influencing the local saithe distribution. Large-scale population effects are more difficult to prove, but it is possible that the dynamic relationship between the coastal and oceanic phases has been altered...|$|R
40|$|Waves are a {{key element}} of the {{maritime}} engineering. This has a great influence on the coast and therefore is determining in the coastal morphology, due so much to the erosion as the deposition of sediments. Also it is a fundamental piece in the design, the planning, the exploitation and maintenance of the maritime works, the industry <b>offshore,</b> the <b>routes</b> of navigation and the security in the sea. The action of the waves {{is one of the most}} important on the maritime works and therefore is from vital importance when designing the structures that are near the sea and can be exposed to the wave. The mentioned activities are some of those that benefit from the study of the waves, but they are not the only ones. The society in general every day claims a better knowledge of our environment and of the environment that surrounds us, in all aspects. The measures of the waves and the analysis of the obtained datum allows, day by day, to keep on improving and developing the knowledge about this subject. For all these reasons this dissertation focuses on the study of a part of the waves, the storms, and more precisely, in the study of its design storm profiles from real data obtained by the wave buoy of Cap Tortosa. So, the main purpose of this dissertation is to foresee the type profiles of the storms that allow predicting their action on the Catalan coast...|$|R

40|$|A {{major focus}} of the Western European Transmission System Operators (TSO’s) is {{reinforcing}} their crossborder power capacity for mutual support in case of emergencies and also as an beneficial good that can be traded on specialised energy markets. The Belgian TSO, Elia, is studying the use of new and emerging technologies, together with their advantages and disadvantages, for further development of the interconnections with the neighbouring countries. High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology, and especially the promising Multilevel Modular Converters (MMC) for the Voltage Sources Converters (VSC) opened {{a wide range of}} new opportunities. The NEMO project, a 1000 MW undersea link with the United Kingdom, is the object of interest for this paper. A quite similar link, technology-wise, but with other motivations and challenges, is the ALEGRO-link, with a rating of 1000 MW as well. Both installations will be connected to the meshed 400 kV-grid. The paper gives an overview of the technical choices and obstacles that are made, their motivations both for the AC/DC converter and the subsea cable. For the converter and its connection to the main grid, specifically the Belgian side, the main focus will lay on the choice of converter technology between the two concurring state-of-the-art technologies based on thyristor and IGBT topologies. The drastic reduction of the operation losses over the years, lesser footprint, absence for the need of reactive power and additional filtering, grid support in voltage and frequency, the possibility for blackstarting, and by nature the most adapted technology for meshed DC grids, made the technology decision sway {{in the direction of the}} MMC VSC configuration. The subsea power link side of the project contains a set of particular obstacles as well. First of all: the cable routing. This part of the North Sea, close to the harbours of Zeebruges, Antwerp and Rotterdam, is one of the world’s most used sea routes. The selection of the cable route needed to be chose for minimal interaction with the present maritime transport (e. g. anchor dragging, compass deviations), with existing pipe line and telecom routes, detected ship wrecks, environmental protected zones (onshore as well as offshore) and future possible development of the HV network in the sea. The paper will present the major outcomes for the cable routing: <b>offshore</b> <b>route</b> on the seabed, the necessary landfalls and the onshore route to the HVDC substation on the Belgian side. In the second subsection on the power link, the choice of the technical characteristics of the DC power cables together with their performance requirements are highlighted. An overview of the major specification will is presented together with their motivations. Again, two concurring technologies are available on the market: the mass-impregnated (MI) cables, with their higher possible voltage rating, are weighed against the synthetic XLPE cable, which, even though still lower in voltage rating, provide some exceptional long-term opportunities. The paper concludes with a listing of necessary step to be taken and technical challenges to be overcome to make this project a success. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I inquire into the Baltic Sea region. I firstly {{determine}} which countries are representing {{the area in}} this study. I focus {{on the character of}} the relations among the states in the area. In particular I aim at characterizing the peculiar social structure that is present in the Baltic Sea region. The study is framed by the constructivist understanding of the relations among states as shaped by common norms, rules and values. In order to inquire into the Baltic Sea region this study uses the set of concepts of the English School. In particular the region is defined and discussed {{with the help of the}} structural English School concept of the international society. Such a concept is used to discuss and interpret the political dynamics expressed as narratives. The thesis is designed to revolve around a study case, the Nord Stream pipeline. The construction of the Nord Stream is an offshore gas pipeline which is meant to be constructed from Russia to Germany. As for its dimensions and for its costs, related to the <b>offshore</b> <b>route,</b> the pipeline raised numerous debates. The officials of the countries belonging to the region express, via declarations or speeches about the pipeline, not only their opinions but what they share and what they don’t, with the other representatives of the countries. I develop my narrative analysis on such speeches. The theoretical framework of this study is directly drawn from Barry Buzan’s structural English School. In his variant of the English School the dynamics among political units can be summed up with a triptych whose pillars are defined on actor-hood. The pillars are the interstate domain, the transnational domain and the interhuman domain. I mainly draw from the interstate domain to characterize the interplay among the three pillars, which is described in the concept of the international society. In order to so I gather texts and declarations from the officials of the region. These declarations concern the Nord Stream pipeline and its construction. The main finding of this study is a definition of the regional dynamics of the Baltic Sea within the spectrum of pluralist and solidarist features. The determination of the unique mixture of those features is done together with a discussion about the interplay of the social forces within the legal and political set established by the states. The international society of the Baltic Sea region appears to be stronger in the primary institutions of the environment and of the market. The solidarist developments in these two institutions are though linked to other similar developments in the primary institution of the international law and energy prosperity. Surprisingly, this study points out how the main pluralist features derive from the international character of the European Union. This study contributes to the scientific debates on the Baltic Sea area for two reasons: a) it applies the set of concepts from the English School to a geographically limited area and by doing so, aims at fulfilling an analytical gap; b) it widens the set of discourses on the political dynamics of the Baltic Sea area by introducing the perspective of the structural English School.

40|$|Recruitment is a {{key process}} in the {{sustainability}} of marine fish populations. Thedynamic and complex process of recruitment is integrated over several life stages, withmany different factors affecting each stage leading to high variability in populations. Thisstudy aimed at gaining important knowledge on the early life history and the factorsaffecting recruitment of the two demersal Cape hake species Merluccius paradoxus andM. capensis in the southern Benguela upwelling system off South Africa. Eggs andlarvae were collected by stratified hauls during four cruises in two consecutive years. Early juveniles were collected on one cruise {{in the northern part}} of the study area off theOrange River. The spatial distribution patterns, growth and condition of early stages were investigatedusing a combination of classic and novel methods. Spatial distribution patterns weredescribed by species-specific vertical and horizontal abundances. Growth wasinvestigated by otolith analyses of larvae and juveniles. Larval conditions were analysedby measuring RNA:DNA ratios. Another method for estimating condition was applied toeggs and larvae by measuring the total lipid content. Fatty acid compositions wereinvestigated in order to reveal the levels of essential fatty acids, needed for growth anddevelopment. Stomach content analyses complemented the information on early lifestages as they elucidated the feeding of larvae in the study area. Distribution patterns revealed that M. paradoxus was the dominant species during thestudy periods, indicating a temporal and possibly spatial separation of spawning of thetwo Cape hake species. This difference in the spawning strategy reduces competitionduring the early life stages between the two similar species, allowing their co-existencewithin the same ecosystem. Furthermore, the distribution patterns of hake eggs and larvae indicated that asubstantial part of spawning occurs on the western Agulhas Bank. Early stages aretransported by the jet current, whereby the drift routes of the two species are separated,with M. paradoxus found further offshore than M. capensis. Complex retentionmechanisms enable larvae on the inshore drift route to reach the coastal nursery areaoff Cape Columbine, whereas larvae from the <b>offshore</b> <b>route</b> are transported furthernorth. This transport and dispersal mechanisms are important for larval connectivity. Therefore, the spawning strategies of the two hake species are adapted to the variable environment of the southern Benguela system, as spawning takes place during a time ofoptimal transport conditions for eggs and larvae towards their specific nursery areas. In addition, factors affecting the recruitment of hake were investigated by analysinggrowth and condition of early stages. Analyses indicated that the South African hakesare fast growing species. Survivors outgrow their conspecifics and cannibalism seemsto play an important role in the survival strategy of hake. Larvae were generally in goodcondition, as indicated by high RNA:DNA ratios, and they can be regarded as thesurvivors, as starving larvae with poor condition are more vulnerable to predation. RNA:DNA ratios as condition proxy and growth did not correlate in hake larvae, as theRNA:DNA ratios were well above the threshold level for growth. Furthermore, low lipidcontents were found in yolk-sac larvae of one investigated year, indicating maternaleffects by poor conditions of spawners, possibly affecting recruitment. The life historystrategy of hakes can be described as periodic with adaptations from an opportunisticstrategy. In conclusion, the interdisciplinary approach of this study provided new and importantknowledge on the early life history and the recruitment of the Southern African hakespecies, which can be transferred to other demersal, long-lived and fast-growing fishspecies. Furthermore, this information can be applied to fisheries management and itcan help to predict the consequences of climate change for M. paradoxus and M. capensis in the southern Benguela upwelling system...|$|E

40|$|CLIMATE CHANGE {{has been}} {{attributed}} to greenhouse gases with carbon dioxide (CO 2) being the major contributor. 60 - 70 % of CO 2 emissions worldwide originate from the burning of fossil fuek. Government authorities and power companies in the UK, along with oil and gasfield operators, are proposing to capture CO 2 from their power plants and either store it in depleted reservoirs or saline aquifers, or use it for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in depleted oil and gasfields. The capture of anthropogenic CO 2 will mitigate against global warming and possibly reduce the impact of climate change. The United States has over 30 years of experience in transporting CO 2, mainly from naturally-occurring CO 2 sources, and mostly for the purpose of EOR. Both the source and the function of the CO 2 pipelines in the USA have dictated a relatively-pure CO 2 stream, in comparison, the UK's proposed carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects will be focusing on anthropogenic sources from major polluters such as fossil-fuel power plants, and the CO 2 transport infrastructure will involve both on- and offshore pipelines. The fossil-fuel power plants will produce CO 2 with varying combinations of impurities depending on the capture technology used. CO 2 pipelines have never been designed for some of the impurities released from these power plants. Other key differences between the transport of CO 2 in the US and the UK relate to design codes and legislation, pipeline <b>routes,</b> <b>offshore</b> transportation and also storage. The presence of impurities has a great impact on the physical properties of the transported CO 2 that consequently affects pipeline design, compressor power, recompression distance, and pipeline capacity, and could also have implications for the prevention of fracture propagation. The effects could be either negative or positive: for example, the addition of some impurities tends to reduce compressor power while others increase the power required. These effects have direct implications for both the technical and economic feasibility of developing a CO 2 transport infrastructure on- and offshore. This paper discusses the key differences between the CO 2 transport scenarios in the US and the potential transport infrastructure in the UK and provides an understanding of these differences and the implications for designing a CO 2 -compliant pipeline. It focuses on such factors as recompression distance, flow assurance, and phase equilibrium, and present results of some initial hydraulic modelling work done using proprietary software...|$|R
