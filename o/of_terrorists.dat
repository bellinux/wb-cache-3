Seventeen minutes later, at 9:03a.m. (EDT), a second group <b>of</b> <b>terrorists</b> crashed the hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 into the southern facade of the South Tower, striking between the 77th and 85th floors.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to safety design, new security measures will be implemented. All vehicles will be screened for radioactive materials and other potentially dangerous objects before {{they enter the}} site through the underground road. Four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed {{in and around the}} site, with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD. A computer system will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as unattended bags, and retrieve images based on descriptions <b>of</b> <b>terrorists</b> or other criminal suspects. New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site.|$|E
5|$|This {{meeting was}} between NATO leaders and {{president}} of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma. NATO members expressed appreciation for Ukraine’s contributions to NATO-led and other international peace support efforts such as KFOR. Ukraine also offered to support Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean (a naval operation of NATO {{which is designed to}} prevent the movement <b>of</b> <b>terrorists</b> or weapons of mass destruction), an offer which NATO would consider. Defence cooperation between NATO and Ukraine was reviewed and the possible launching of a Partnership for Peace Trust Fund to help Ukraine destroy the surplus munitions, small arms and light weapons was discussed.|$|E

30|$|Finally, the English {{example is}} a good one in {{progress}} over the conceptualization of terrorism. On it, acts provoked in electronic means, like Internet, were included in the hall. The elevation of international organizations to the possibility of being victims <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks and the punishment for preparatory acts or the use <b>of</b> threats <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks that have not yet materialized, so important for the prevention <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> attacks, also appear as English innovations.|$|R
5|$|When a group <b>of</b> <b>terrorists</b> {{takes an}} American family hostage, Claire negotiates with their imprisoned leader, Yusuf Al Ahmadi (Farshad Farahat), who agrees {{to tell his}} {{followers}} to release the hostages. Al Ahmadi reneges on the deal, however, and tells them to kill the hostages. At the same time, journalist Tom Hammerschmidt (Boris McGiver) publishes an investigative news story detailing Frank's crimes. Claire gives Frank the idea to declare war on the terrorists and allow the public to see the hostage die in order to distract from the scandal and create an atmosphere of widespread fear that they can exploit. In the final scene, Claire finally breaks the fourth wall with Frank.|$|E
5|$|The September 11 {{attacks in}} the United States caused NATO to invoke Article5 of the NATO Charter {{for the first time}} in the organization's history. The Article says that an attack on any member shall be {{considered}} to be an attack on all. The invocation was confirmed on 4October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty. The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included Operation Eagle Assist and Operation Active Endeavour, a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea which is designed to prevent the movement <b>of</b> <b>terrorists</b> or weapons of mass destruction, as well as enhancing the security of shipping in general which began on 4October 2001.|$|E
5|$|USSOCOM's 10th Special Forces Group, {{elements}} of JSOC and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked {{up again and}} {{were the first to}} enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the termination of a substantial number <b>of</b> <b>terrorists</b> and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists {{would have been in the}} subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the Tora Bora of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.|$|E

40|$|A {{major concern}} in {{coalition}} peace-support operations is the incidence <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> activity. In this paper, we propose a generative {{model for the}} occurrence <b>of</b> the <b>terrorist</b> incidents, and illustrate that an increase in diversity, {{as measured by the}} number of different social groups to which that an individual belongs, is inversely correlated with the likelihood <b>of</b> a <b>terrorist</b> incident in the society. A generative model is one that can predict the likelihood of events in new contexts, as opposed to statistical models which are used to predict the future incidents based {{on the history of the}} incidents in an existing context. Generative models can be useful in planning for persistent Information Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) since they allow an estimation of regions in the theater <b>of</b> operation where <b>terrorist</b> incidents may arise, and thus can be used to better allocate the assignment and deployment of ISR assets. In this paper, we present a taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> incidents, identify factors related to occurrence <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> incidents, and provide a mathematical analysis calculating the likelihood <b>of</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>terrorist</b> incidents in three common real-life scenarios arising in peace-keeping operations...|$|R
