5|$|The {{clustering}} of {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown swarms of planetesimals that began with large semi-major axis orbits at random <b>orientations</b> <b>and</b> initially interacting with Neptune were sculpted into collinear groups of spatially confined orbits by a distant planet if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a highly eccentric orbit. These surviving objects were in orbits that were oriented with their long axes anti-aligned {{with respect to the}} massive planet and were roughly co-planar with it. The objects were also found to be in resonance with the massive planet. The resonances included high-order resonances, for example 27:17, and were interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that was fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales. The perihelia of these objects were also raised temporarily, producing Sedna-like orbits, before being returned to orbits more typical of typical trans-Neptunian objects after several hundred million years. Some of the eTNOs also evolved into orbits perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.|$|E

It proposed a quantitative analysis in which entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> sources of competitive advantage are key success factors of SMEs. To answer the res earch questions, two hypotheses were for mulated; (a) There is significant relationship between entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> business performance, and (b) competitive advantage mediates the relationship between entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> performance. Data were collected by means of a mail survey questionnaire completed by women owner/managers randomly selected from a sampling frame of registered SMEs. The questionnaires developed from prior research were used to measure the entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> competitive advantage of the firm while performance measurement was based on subjective evaluation involving self- reported measures. The findings revealed that significant relationships exist between entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> performance, while competitive advantage was found to partially mediate the entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> performance relationships.

This study offered empirical evidence on the relationship among market <b>orientation,</b> positioning, <b>and</b> hotel performance in Ghana’s (luxury) hotel sector. It also reports on the joint effect of market <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> positioning on hotel performance in the same sector. Design/methodology/approach: Three hypotheses were investigated {{on the relationship between}} market <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> hotel performance; positioning and hotel performance; and the joint effect of market <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> positioning on hotel performance. A survey of star rated (luxury) hotels in the capital city of Ghana was used. One hundred and five (105) responses were used in the analysis. Descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis and hierarchical regression were used to test the three (3) hypotheses. Findings: All hypotheses were accepted. Market <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> positioning jointly affect hotel performance, and the study provides hotel managers with suggestions on to enhance their performance via market <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> positioning. Research limitations/implications: Management perspectives on market <b>orientation,</b> positioning <b>and</b> hotel performance were sought to the exclusion of customers. Future studies may consider using customer perspectives as well. Practical implications: Hotels should consider adopting market oriented positioning strategies to improve on their performance. Originality/value: This study {{is one of the few}} attempts to systematically investigating the intertwined concepts of market <b>orientation,</b> positioning <b>and</b> performance in a developing economy hospitality context...|$|R

In this paper, we develop and test a model that examines the interaction effects of the three dimensions of market orientation [...] customer <b>orientation,</b> competitor <b>orientation,</b> <b>and</b> cross-functional integration [...] on generation of marketing program creativity, composed of novelty and meaningfulness dimensions. In empirically testing such effects, we illustrate how to use two-stage least squares (2 SLS) estimation.

500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{has been}} accused from time-to-time of forcing public figures out of the closet. This policy of 'outing' individuals surfaced in 1996 during {{the debate over the}} Defense of Marriage Act, when the Blade and The Advocate were going to out Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Mark Foley. Neither publication did out either politician, and both publications later denied ever intending to out the Congressmen. In recent years, these accusations have resurfaced as Kevin Naff, current editor of the Blade, has accused the Washington Post of 'straight-washing' stories about LGBT individuals. Naff wrote that [...] "When someone is described as 'flamboyant,' 'eccentric' or 'a lifelong bachelor,' we know what’s being implied... Readers of the Washington Post had better hone their gaydar skills, because in story after story, the newsgathering behemoth either ignores questions of sexual orientation or employs endless winks and nods to convey what would be better spelled out." [...] When asked why identifying and outing of individuals by publications like the Blade, staff writer Greg Marzullo wrote [...] "Why do [...] insist on mentioning someone's sexual orientation at all? Because we're a queer paper." [...] As reported in the Washington Post, former editor Chris Crain summarized the Blades editorial reasoning for the 'outings' by stating that [...] "It is 2004, not 1954, and sexual orientation in and of itself is no longer a 'private fact' beyond the pale of inquiry." [...] The Blade, he wrote, [...] "would investigate and report about whether influential Hill aides are gay if facts about their sexual orientation raise highly newsworthy questions of hypocrisy in the stands taken by anti-gay members of Congress for whom they work." [...] A former staff writer of the Washington Blade has noted objections to this perceived campaign to label individuals by their sexual <b>orientations</b> <b>and</b> has used a blog to register these objections.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFrom the resource-based perspective, {{entrepreneurial}} <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>orientation</b> are {{two separate}} but complementary strategic orientations that emphasize the business philosophy and behavior in proactively detecting industrial environment, including market information and competitors strategy, {{in order to}} innovate {{and respond to the}} customers needs timely. Empirical studies have separately discussed the variables of entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>orientation</b> in relation to firm-level innovation performance. However, there is limited research simultaneously examined the direct effect of entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>orientation</b> on innovation performance, especially individual-level innovation performance. Scholars have suggested that future research may examine strategic human resource practices to explore if organizational factors may enhance or diminish the entrepreneurial orientation on innovation. Both entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>orientation</b> still require organizational learning practices to facilitate higher-order learning and innovation. Although scholars are interested in figuring out if additional moderator variables simultaneously affect market <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> on firm performance, limited empirical studies have existed. An organization with high degree of entrepreneurial <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> market <b>orientation</b> still require learning orientation mechanism to create an environment where mutually beneficial relationships between employees and their organizations to facilitate learning and innovation.
