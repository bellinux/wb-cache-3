50|$|The wood is {{extremely}} hard, {{being one of}} the hardest woods in Northern America. It is very resistant to rot, and durable, making it prized for furniture, flooring, paneling, fence posts, and small watercraft. Wet, newly cut planks have an offensive odor which disappears with seasoning. Black locust is still in use in some rustic handrail systems. In the Netherlands and some other parts of Europe, black locust {{is one of the most}} rot-resistant local trees, and projects have started to limit the use <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>wood</b> by promoting this tree and creating plantations. Flavonoids in the heartwood allow the wood to last over 100 years in soil. As a young man, Abraham Lincoln spent much of his time splitting rails and fence posts from black locust logs.|$|E
50|$|In {{the lead}} up to the Earth Summit, social groups, NGOs and {{industries}} were also beginning to consult {{on the issue of}} deforestation. In America the consultation process that eventually lead to the establishment of the FSC was initiated in 1990 and concluded in the confirmation of support {{for the development of a}} voluntary worldwide certification and accreditation governance system that would cover all forest types. In the UK, NGO WWF began to facilitate action through the establishment of the 1995 Group, recruiting organisations that had been spurred on by instances of direct action and boycotting over the sale <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>wood</b> to form an NGO-Business partnership. Through stakeholder involvement it became apparent that a standard-setting body would be required to verify the source of wood products and define sustainable forest management. After 18 months of consultation in ten different countries, the Forest Stewardship Council was finally established in 1993.|$|E

30|$|Colour changes {{related to}} the species <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>wood,</b> the type of {{vegetable}} oil {{and the time of}} weathering in an exterior or in Xenotest were evaluated in the program STATISTICA 10 —mean values, standard deviations, Duncan’s tests; and, for ΔE* also linear correlations for modelling the natural weathering by Xenotest.|$|E
30|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>wood</b> {{species are}} usually characterised {{by a high}} {{durability}} against biodegradation agents due {{to the presence of}} specific extractive substances—flavonoids, tannins, etc. However, to the colour changes of wood exposed in exterior conditions significantly contribute not only extractives [1 – 4], but also lignin [5 – 7]. The colour changes <b>of</b> some <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> caused by weathering were observed in more scientific papers [1, 2, 8 – 10]. Generally, the colour stability <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> significantly depends not only on the wood species and the surface treatment methods, but also on the area of their exposure [10, 11]. Due to their specific properties, i.e. usually high resistance to biological agents, high density and high resistance to mechanical wear, high-dimensional stability, and good aesthetic, <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> are used as wood decking, claddings, garden constructions and furniture in various world regions, including Central Europe.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{demonstrates}} {{the effect of}} copolymer on the physical, mechanical, and thermal properties <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>wood</b> and wood polymer composites (WPCs). Mixed monomers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were effectively impregnated into the cellular structure of several types <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>wood,</b> which then underwent a catalyst-thermal process to polymerize and form WPC. The manufacturing of WPC was confirmed through Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis. The SEM observation showed that polymer converted from monomers filled up wood cell cavities and tightly interacted with wood matrix. The X-ray diffraction results reveal {{that the degree of}} crystallinity was significantly improved upon impregnation with PVA-co-MMA copolymer. The modulus of elasticity (MOE) and compressive modulus were found to be significantly higher after treatment with MMA/PVA indicating improvement of mechanical properties of the wood samples. In addition, the modified WPC had lower water absorption compared to their corresponding raw samples. It {{is interesting to note that}} thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis shows an extensive improvement in thermal properties of WPC...|$|E
30|$|The lesser {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>wood</b> {{species on}} their colour {{changes in the}} initial period of exposure was observed in more works [25, 30, 31]. Similarly, in our work, oil finish in the bangkirai shade had a more positive effect on massaranduba wood. On the other hand, more colour stable for other wood species (bangkirai, kusia, jatoba) was oil finish with the teak shade. A possible explanation for this observation is that the specific type and content of different extractives in massaranduba wood influenced the colour change of the pigment in the used oil. Effect of different species of tropical woods on their colour stability after treatment with pigmented paints was also found in other works [19, 24, 25].|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} I {{interrogate}} the complex relationship {{between nature and}} culture by examining how tropical nature and raw materials were conceptualized and displayed in the nineteenth century. I do so by discussing a display <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>wood</b> mounted by the Empire of Brazil for the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1867. The reception of this display in Europe is analysed through Karl Max’s ideas on the gendering of nature and commodity exchange, through the concept of tropicality, and through Claude Lévi-Strauss’s binaries of the raw and the cooked, which help reveal how natural materials were commodified into things themselves. Broadly, I am interested in putting ‘nature in our official past’ and bringing key concerns from environmental history studies to the fore, to bear on studies in design history...|$|E
30|$|Variance in the ΔE* values <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> {{treated with}} {{two types of}} {{pigmented}} oils were partly reduced after prolonged periods of natural weathering, and usually remained consistently lower than those in native—untreated surfaces and surfaces treated with the transparent oil (see ΔE* in Table  4; Figs.  1, 2, 3, 4). A positive effect of paints on the colour stability of treated wood exists, {{but it is not}} always clear. Valverde and Moya [32] and Williams and Feist [33] also observed an insignificant improvement of the colour stability <b>of</b> native—untreated <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> by paintings’ application. Richter et al. [34] observed the effect of wood species on the degradation intensity of paints on wooden products and on their colour stability.

Manufactured plasticized wood samples were characterized using, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and mechanical testing (modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR), static Young’s modulus (Es), decay resistance, and water absorption). MOE and MOR were calculated using a three-point bending test. Es and decay resistance were calculated using the compression parallel to grain test and the natural laboratory decay test, respectively. The manufactured PW yielded higher MOE, MOR, and Es. PW had a lower water content compared to the untreated wood and had high resistance to decay exposure, with Eugenia spp. having the highest resistance compared to the others...|$|E

30|$|Overall, it is {{possible}} to say that the finishing vegetable Woca Denmark oils stabilised the colour <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>woods</b> only during shorter exposure, and mainly if pigmented oils were used. This can be explained by a lower permeability of exotic woods, when a lower penetration of oils could not save surface layers of wood for a longer time [24]. Vegetable oils only impregnated the surface layers of wood, and result was a faster washout of oils due to the weathering. The painted surfaces of wood must be regularly renewed, and thus it {{is possible}}, mainly through pigmented treatment adjustments, to keep colour fastness in exterior exposures.|$|R

40|$|At the Baltic {{coast of}} Germany, {{approximately}} 50 groynes are replaced or newly built {{every year in}} average. Since the use <b>of</b> <b>tropical</b> <b>wood</b> was introduced, the costs for groyne piles have extremely increased.

New approaches and more scientific rules for the dimensioning of the ramming depth of wooden groyne piles are needed to save costs, if possible. This paper provides an insight into a 4 years research work on loads and holding forces of groyne piles in shallow water. Movement of piles under wave impact, resulting liquefaction effects and vertical ice loads were investigated. The basics of recommendations for the dimensioning of wooden groynes are presented. These recommendations include results of investigations of the subsoil properties and scour effects. ...|$|E

Certification issued by a government agency or an environmental non-government organization both had a favorable effect on consumer preference over a non-certified option. The most relevant implication of our findings was the negative effect that disclosing information about a product coming from tropical forests had on consumer preferences, even compared to a product of unknown origin. A decline in product preference was observed along higher price premiums as expected. The degree of sensitivity to price changes was affected by demographic characteristics.
