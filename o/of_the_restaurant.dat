40|$|Efficient {{energy use}} in {{restaurants}} Umeå Municipality wishes to combine energy issues with food control, and thus help restaurants {{to become more}} energy efficient. During March and April 2010, I visited seven restaurants and interviewed restaurant personnel about current state and application of kitchen appliances, using a checklist {{to make sure that}} the same questions were asked at all <b>restaurants.</b> <b>The</b> <b>restaurants</b> were all different sizes and offered different kinds <b>of</b> food. <b>The</b> study mostly focuses on energy efficiency by behaviour and not on location or technology. Almost every restaurant that was visited had the potential to improve in one or more areas, such as kitchen appliances, lamps and lighting fixtures, heating, cooling and ventilation. Concering <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personnel, it is always possible to be more careful with energy use. Based on a compilation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> responses from the checklist, action proposals were presented to each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restaurants.</b> <b>The</b> action proposals involve kitchen appliances, lamps and lighting fixtures, heating, cooling and ventilation. The food inspectors will hand out a newly created information sheet based on the obtained interview results to <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> in <b>the</b> municipality <b>of</b> Umeå. All restaurants can benefit from learning more about their kitchen appliances and optimize their usage. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> already had good knowledge of energy efficiency issues, but some didn’t have any knowledge at all. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restaurants</b> were really willing to improve their energy efficiency, whereas others didn’t care at all...|$|R

5|$|As the Britannia Restaurant {{takes up}} the full width of the ship on two decks, a 'tween deck, called Deck 3L, was devised to allow {{passengers}} to walk from the Grand Lobby to the Queen's Room without traversing the dining room mid-meal. The deck consists of two corridors that run beneath the upper balcony <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>restaurant</b> on Deck 3, and above the main dining area on Deck 2. This is why the balcony of the Britannia has tiers that step up towards the hull. This arrangement is illustrated on the hull {{where there is a}} stack of three rows of windows in the area where the main restaurant sits, the two upper and lower most rows illuminate the dining room, while the centre row serves Deck 3L. There is a similar arrangement through the Royal Court Theatre. As well, the passages that run on either side of Illuminations on Deck 3 ramp upwards to compensate for the change in deck elevation between the entrance to Illuminations and an elevator bank forward of the room.|$|E
