25|$|Although {{originally}} controversial, the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is {{now used}} without reservation by most mathematicians, {{and it is}} included in the standard form of axiomatic set theory, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> (ZFC). One motivation for this use is that a number of generally accepted mathematical results, such as Tychonoff's theorem, require the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> for their proofs. Contemporary set theorists also study axioms that are not compatible with the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice,</b> such as the axiom of determinacy. The axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is avoided in some varieties of constructive mathematics, although there are varieties of constructive mathematics in which the axiom <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> is embraced.|$|R

5|$|Pregnancy {{presents}} substantial health risks, even {{in developed}} countries, and despite advances in obstetrical science and practice. Maternal mortality remains {{a major problem}} in global health and is considered a sentinel event in judging the quality of health care systems. Adolescent pregnancy represents a particular problem, whether intended or unintended, and whether within marriage or a union or not. Pregnancy results in major changes in a girl's life, physically, emotionally, socially and economically and jeopardises her transition into adulthood. Adolescent pregnancy, more often than not, stems from a girl's lack <b>of</b> <b>choices.</b> or abuse. Child marriage (see below) is a major contributor worldwide, since 90% of births to girls aged 15–19 occur within marriage.|$|E

In recent years, however, more universities have opened across the country, widening the range <b>of</b> <b>choices</b> available. Legislation concerning higher education institutions was passed in 1997, which includes a definition of the term háskóli (to include universities which do not carry out research). There is also separate legislation in place for each public institution, defining their role in research and general organisation. Private and public universities both receive funding from the state.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the three classes <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> functions satisfying the three significant axioms called heredity (H), concordance (C) and outcast (O). We show that the set <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> functions satisfying {{any one of these}} axioms is a lattice, and we study the properties of these lattices. The lattice <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> functions satisfying (H) is distributive, whereas the lattice <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> functions verifying (C) is atomistic and lower bounded, and so has many properties. On the contrary, the lattice <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> functions satisfying (O) is not even ranked. Then using results of the axiomatic and metric latticial theories of consensus as well as the properties of our three lattices <b>of</b> <b>choice</b> functions, we get results to aggregate profiles <b>of</b> such <b>choice</b> functions into one (or several) collective choice function(s).

5|$|During the 18th century, {{systems of}} plant {{identification}} were developed comparable to dichotomous keys, where unidentified plants are placed into taxonomic groups (e.g. family, genus and species) {{by making a}} series <b>of</b> <b>choices</b> between pairs of characters. The choice and sequence of the characters may be artificial in keys designed purely for identification (diagnostic keys) or {{more closely related to}} the natural or phyletic order of the taxa in synoptic keys. By the 18th century, new plants for study were arriving in Europe in increasing numbers from newly discovered countries and the European colonies worldwide. In 1753 Carl von Linné (Carl Linnaeus) published his Species Plantarum, a hierarchical classification of plant species that remains the reference point for modern botanical nomenclature. This established a standardised binomial or two-part naming scheme where the first name represented the genus and the second identified the species within the genus. For the purposes of identification, Linnaeus's Systema Sexuale classified plants into 24 groups according to the number of their male sexual organs. The 24th group, Cryptogamia, included all plants with concealed reproductive parts, mosses, liverworts, ferns, algae and fungi.|$|E

The game was Atlus' first title to feature full voice acting; the team initially planned to voice event scenes in English and Chinese with Japanese subtitles, but included voice acting across the whole game due to positive feedback. A similar set of circumstances led to the wide use of stereophonic sound across the whole game when it was initially planned only for action sequences.|$|E
