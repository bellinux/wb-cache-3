5|$|Zosky was a collegiate star {{prior to}} playing professionally, {{becoming}} {{a member of}} Fresno State University's athletic Hall of Fame. He developed into a promising shortstop prospect for the Toronto Blue Jays in the early 1990s, being named their starting shortstop of the future multiple times, though injury problems and a lack <b>of</b> <b>offense</b> ended his hopes of stardom.|$|E
5|$|Alabama's defense again had {{a strong}} {{performance}} in only allowing the Rebels 141 total yards <b>of</b> <b>offense</b> (28 rushing, 113 passing). Richardson set a new career high with his 183 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. For his performance, Richardson was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week. The 52 total points were the most Alabama had scored in a SEC game since defeating Vanderbilt 59–28 in 1990. The victory was their eighth straight over Ole Miss and improved Alabama's all-time record against the Rebels 45–9–2 (49–8–2 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|At quarterback, Nebraska had Scott Frost, a {{transfer}} player from Stanford who had 1,440 passing yards, 13 passing touchdowns, three interceptions, and 578 rushing yards {{in his first}} season with the team. Frost's three interceptions were the third-least in Division I-A; only Army and Ohio University had fewer. Overall, Nebraska totaled 5,069 yards <b>of</b> <b>offense</b> and 42.7 points per game, the most in the Big 12.|$|E

5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season before the Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech's offense was ranked among the worst in Division I, 107th among 119teams. The Hokies averaged just 296yards per game during the regular season, and during the ACC Championship Game—the last Tech game before the Orange Bowl—had created a season-low 234yards <b>of</b> <b>offense.</b> Starting left guard Nick Marshman was not expected to play after becoming academically ineligible following the fall semester, and was replaced by redshirt freshman Jaymes Brooks.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Richardson set a {{new career}} high with his 203 rushing yards and tied Mark Ingram Jr. for the most 100-yard rushing games in a season with nine. The defense held Auburn to 140 total yards <b>of</b> <b>offense,</b> with only 78 yards on the ground, and zero {{offensive}} touchdowns in the victory. The victory brought Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 41–34–1.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's offense {{averaged}} 21.6points and 320total {{yards per}} game during the regular season, good enough for ninth in the Big Ten. As a whole, the Hoosiers accumulated 3,818yards <b>of</b> <b>offense</b> before the Independence Bowl. 2,156yards of this total were passing yards and came through the air, while the remaining 1,662yards were gained by Indiana's running backs and fullbacks on the ground.|$|E

5|$|It was Michigan's seventh {{straight}} loss to Ohio State, its longest {{losing streak}} to the Buckeyes in school history. Denard Robinson gained 192 yards of total offense against the Buckeyes, but left the game {{during the third}} quarter due to two dislocated fingers on his left hand. At {{the end of the}} regular season, Robinson had 1,643 rushing yards, which moved him into fifth place on U-M's all-time season rushing yardage list. He also had 2,316 passing yards for a total of 3,959 yards <b>of</b> <b>offense.</b>|$|E
5|$|On the ground, Florida State {{running back}} Greg Jones led all players with 23 carries for 120 yards. Virginia Tech running back Kevin Jones {{was second in}} overall rushing, having carried the ball 23 times for 55 yards and a touchdown. Defensively, Florida State had 12 tackles for loss, causing the Hokies negating 66 yards <b>of</b> <b>offense.</b> Virginia Tech had eight tackles for loss, {{encompassing}} 48 yards of loss. Five of Virginia Tech's tackles for loss were sacks, while four of Florida State's tackles for loss were sacks.|$|E
5|$|After a {{scoreless}} third quarter, {{a pair of}} fourth-quarter touchdowns gave Alabama the 38–10 victory. Richardson scored {{his second}} touchdown of the game with 12:25 remaining on a 36-yard run and Eddie Lacy scored the final points of the game on a 20-yard run. For the game, Alabama's defense was dominant in only allowing 222 total yards <b>of</b> <b>offense,</b> with the 15 rushing yards being the fewest ever allowed against Florida in their all-time series. Trent Richardson established a new career high for rushing yards in game with his 181 yards on 29 attempts. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Gators to 22–14 (23–14 without the NCAA vacation of the 2005 victory).|$|E

5|$|Michigan's 541 yard {{offensive}} {{performance was}} the second straight week the offense gained more than 500 yards <b>of</b> <b>offense,</b> and {{was the second}} highest total of the season, only beaten by the previous week's total of 581 yards against Minnesota. Denard Robinson's 337 yards of passing were one yard shy of his career high; he threw for 338 yards against Notre Dame on Sept. 10, 2011. Michigan started a season 6–0 {{for the first time}} since 2006. Jordan Kovacs had two solo tackles for a loss, both on fourth down. Brady Hoke's 6–0 start was the first 6–0 start by a first-year Michigan coach since Bennie Oosterbaan did so in 1948.|$|E
5|$|On September 23 at Giants Stadium, before 76,483 fans, the Giants met the Miami Dolphins for {{the first}} time since the Dolphins' undefeated 1972 season. Miami held the ball for only 19:42, and totaled only 158yards <b>of</b> <b>offense.</b> The Giants' offense set the tone by holding the ball for 10:25 on the opening drive, leading to a field goal by Raul Allegre. Holding Dan Marino to 119 total yards, and 3.6yards per passing attempt, the Giants prevailed by a score of 20–3. Parcells was criticized by the local media for playing Taylor in the final moments, despite the {{lopsided}} score, after he had injured his hamstring.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} criticized {{for a lack of}} {{production}} during the regular season and was ranked 103rd in total offense. The Hokies gained just 301 yards <b>of</b> <b>offense</b> on average during the regular season. Despite the meager statistical performance, Tech did have some standout players. Quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who had been expected to sit out the season in reserve, finished the year as the team's starter. Running back Darren Evans was named a second-team All-ACC selection, as was guard Sergio Render. Taylor's favorite passing targets were wide receivers Danny Coale and Jarrett Boykin. Coale entered the ACC Championship Game having caught 32 catches for 352 yards, while Boykin grabbed 27 passes for 407 yards.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the game, the 2009 ACC {{championship}} had a large amount <b>of</b> <b>offense.</b> Throughout the contest, neither team punted: Every offensive drive ended in a score or a turnover. Clemson scored first, a touchdown on its opening drive, and held a 7–3 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter. In the second quarter, Georgia Tech scored 13 points to Clemson's six, and the Yellow Jackets entered halftime with a 16–13 lead. They extended that lead in the third quarter, scoring 17 points to Clemson's lone touchdown and extra point. In the fourth quarter, Clemson closed the gap and took a 34–33 lead with 6:11 remaining, but Georgia Tech drove down the field and scored a touchdown with 1:20 remaining, giving the Yellow Jackets a 39–34 lead that was the game's final margin. In recognition of his significant performance despite the loss, Clemson running back C. J. Spiller was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers scored {{their first}} points, {{but were not}} able to score enough to win, despite {{statistically}} outperforming the Buffalo Bills in most phases of the game. The Buccaneers had only three Dave Green field goals to show for seven possessions inside the Bills’ 22-yard line. O.J. Simpson, who would rush for a season total of 1,503 yards, was held to only 39 yards on twenty carries. The Bills, the highest-scoring team in recent years, were 1 of 12 in third-down conversions, and were surpassed in yardage, first downs, rushing average, and number of total plays. Buffalo took the lead on Bob Chandler’s 58-yard reception of a tipped pass. The Buccaneers’ 338 yards <b>of</b> <b>offense,</b> a great improvement over their previous two games, coincided with coach McKay’s relenting to Steve Spurrier’s demands that he be able to call his own plays. Spurrier suffered a bone chip in his throwing hand that made his status questionable for the next week’s game.|$|E
5|$|The San Diego Chargers got 16 first downs, {{compared}} to 5 for the Buccaneers. Chargers {{players and coaches}} praised the Buccaneers’ defense, who held them to 9 points until the final three minutes of the game, saying that they played the equivalent of five quarters. Three Tampa Bay quarterbacks completed a combined 3 of 8 passes for −4 yards. Buccaneers receiver Bob Moore said, “We’re at rock bottom now...but if we start pointing a finger, we’ll go 0–14”. The Chargers finished with 325 yards <b>of</b> <b>offense</b> to the Buccaneers’ 125. Inconsistent blocking was blamed for the offensive problems, a situation that was not helped by the injury to tackle Dave Reavis. Mercury Morris, who had been picked up on waivers by the Chargers from the Miami Dolphins after the Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Dolphins, commented that the difference in Buccaneers’ offensive line protection between the two games was like watching two different teams. The Buccaneers’ lack of speed was also noticeable. The loss {{marked the first time}} since 1961 that a professional football team was shut out {{in the first two games}} of the season, when the Oakland Raiders were shut out by the same two teams in the same order.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} Michigan's first shutout of a Big Ten {{opponent}} since a 20–0 win at Penn State on October 6, 2001, and its first shutout of any opponent since a 38–0 win against Notre Dame on September 15, 2007. The 58–0 {{win over the}} Golden Gophers was Michigan's largest margin of victory over Minnesota in the series' history. The previous best was 51 (58–7) in 1993. The game also marked Michigan's largest margin of victory over any opponent since a 69–0 victory over Northwestern in October 1975. (Michigan also defeated Indiana by an identical 58–0 score in October 2000.) Vincent Smith became the first running back in FBS to pass for a touchdown and have touchdowns rushing and receiving since C. J. Spiller on November 14, 2009, against North Carolina State. He is the fifth Big Ten player to do so since 1996 and the first since Mike Kafka, who accomplished the feat for Northwestern on September 19, 2009. Michigan outgained Minnesota 580 to 177. Minnesota's total yardage was the lowest allowed by Michigan since the game against Minnesota in 2008. Michigan rushed for 363 yards <b>of</b> <b>offense,</b> its third straight game of rushing for more than 300 yards. This {{is the first time}} this has occurred since the 1987 season.|$|E
5|$|The high scoring game set several {{school and}} conference records: the 132-point {{combined}} score was the highest-scoring {{game of the}} year in major college football (so far), and the highest in both the 131-year history of Michigan football and {{in the history of the}} Big Ten. The Illini's 65 points were the most ever allowed by Michigan. They also established Michigan records for combined points in a half (62) and combined points in a quarter (49). Michigan's previous records in those categories were: 130 points (vs. West Virginia, 1904), 55 points (vs. Chicago, 1939) and 39 points (vs. Penn State, 2005), respectively. This game was the highest scoring FBS game since Navy and North Texas met on November 10, 2007, which Navy won 74–62. Robinson threw a career-high 305 yards, as well as a school record 262 yards in the first half. Michigan's 419 passing yards broke the previous single game record of 396 yards, which was set against Michigan State in 1999. Roy Roundtree had a school-record 246 yards receiving, breaking the previous mark of 197 yards by Jack Clancy. The two teams combined for a total of 1,237 yards <b>of</b> <b>offense,</b> breaking the record of 1,189 set against Northwestern in 2000. With the win, Michigan became bowl eligible for the first time since Rich Rodriguez began his tenure as head coach.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon, on {{the active}} roster {{for the first}} time in the season, came off the bench in the third quarter to rally the Bears past the Buccaneers. He scored a {{touchdown}} on a quarterback sneak with six minutes to go, and tied the game with a touchdown pass to Neal Anderson with 1:28 to go. The Buccaneers allowed seven sacks, but led for most of the game. The Bears were aided by the Buccaneers' poor clock management and their reliance on a conservative offense in the fourth quarter. Perkins denied accusations that they went to a prevent defense and a three-man rush, but admitted that they played too conservatively on defense at the end. Steve DeBerg threw touchdown passes to Calvin Magee and Jeff Smith on the Buccaneers' first two possessions. On the Bears' next possession, Ron Holmes' hit on Mike Tomczak forced a fumble that was recovered in the end zone by Winston Moss to give the Buccaneers a 20–0 lead. The Bears scored two quick touchdowns in the second quarter, but the Buccaneers extended their lead with two Donald Igwebuike field goals. With the Bears struggling on offense, McMahon was inserted into the game. McMahon was 12 of 14 for 144yards and led the Bears to 156yards <b>of</b> <b>offense</b> in the last two drives, compared with 142 in the first 50minutes of the game. A win would have tied the Buccaneers with the Bears for first place in the NFC Central.|$|E
