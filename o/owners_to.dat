At the next owners' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote that required a super-majority. Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the <b>owners</b> <b>to</b> permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players. However, he did reach a compromise with the <b>owners</b> <b>to</b> get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA's requests for salary standards and health benefits.|$|E

5|$|For {{eight years}} after the fire, One Meridian Plaza sat vacant and damaged—in the center of Philadelphia's {{business}} district. The building was caught in litigation between the owners and the insurance company over how much the insurers would pay the owners and how repairs or demolition would proceed. Businesses near the empty high-rise closed or moved and the city sued the <b>owners</b> <b>to</b> do something with the building. After lawsuits were settled, the building was declared a total loss and began to be dismantled in 1998. At {{the time of its}} demolition in 1999, One Meridian Plaza was the third-tallest destroyed building in the world.|$|E
