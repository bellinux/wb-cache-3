Selectivity index, an indicator of separation efficiency, {{was chosen as the}} response parameter for optimizing the quantity and evaluating a series of generically same but chemically different cationic collectors used in reverse flotation and for further optimization of other flotation process parameters. In the optimization, the main variables investigated were percent solids, collector and depressant dosage. An increase in the iron content of the concentrates is obtained with concomitant reduction in SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 levels...|$|E
40|$|Ultra fines or Slimes {{generated}} as overflow in screw classifiers in {{iron ore}} washing plants are generally {{treated in a}} single or multi-stage hydrocyclones to recover iron values. The underflow of the hydrocyclones forms the concentrate which is generally used for pellets making due to its attractive granulometry and high iron content. It is found, very often, that the performance of hydrocyclones is sub-optimum due to the frequent choking of their lower diameter spigots (cut-point being 20 µm). This affects the overall performance of the washing plant. Considering the granulometry (d 80 : 40. 5 µm) of slimes, cationic reverse flotation of these slimes {{is thought to be}} apt to recover iron values by reducing alumina and silica levels. This is supposed to improve the productivity of the washing plant. As a prelude to detailed flotation studies, four cationic collectors which are generically same but of varying chemical composition are evaluated and tested for their performance in the reverse flotation of iron ore slimes from the screw classifier overflow of an operating iron <b>ore</b> <b>washing</b> <b>plant</b> in Bellary - Hospet sector of Karnataka, India. Basically these collectors are ether amines. A stage wise flotation is conducted by adding the collector in three stages. Starch is used to depress hematite. The performance of the four collectors was evaluated based on Tests of significance, namely,‘t-test’ and ‘F-test’ and modified version of Selectivity Index derived by Douglas to select the best one among them for further investigations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{sustainable}} {{viability of}} a mineral enterprise depends on improving the concentrate quality, generating readily salable by-products, improving recovery, throughput, and reduction of unit cost rate and maximize the unit income rate and thereby unit profit rate. Closing down of iron ore mines due to environmental constraints spurred the captive iron <b>ore</b> <b>washing</b> <b>plants</b> to workon a custom plant mode and also recover the values from their slimy tails. This paper enumerates the difficulties faced by a captive iron <b>ore</b> fine <b>washing</b> <b>plant</b> [treating iron <b>ore</b> fines assaying Fe∼ 58 % yielding sands assaying Fe> 60 %] due to raw material change yielding unsalable sands {{and discuss the}} importance of process plant audit for improving the mineral processing plant performance. Based on the base line study, laboratory tests on typical samples followed by short term modifications, retrofitting of downstream slime concentrating wet high intensity magnetic separators and dewatering of products could produce readily salable sinter grade [Fe> 60 %] and pellet grade[Fe> 62. 5 %] with an overall increase of concentrate yield by 11. 5 %. Even the previous <b>wash</b> <b>plant</b> tails [which assayed Fe > 45 %] may be reprocessed in the retrofitted slime processing VPWHIMS plant. The final tails assayed 38. 60 % Fe at weight % yield of 28. 5. Efforts are on for utilizing the above tails in bricks- tiles manufacture. Also, R&D efforts to concentrate Fe values from above 38. 60 % Fe tails by Magnetizing roast followed by magnetic separations in bench scale has given encouraging results. Thus auditing not only improved the quality, quantity and rate of production of concentrate but mitigated the problem of tailing disposal. The investments were repaid {{within a year of}} operation and unit operating costs reduced by 20 % with reference to base line data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Reverse {{cationic}} {{column flotation}} technology is gaining traction in iron ore processing industry for recovering iron values from iron ore slimes/tailings. Development and selection of appropriate collector suitable {{to the material}} to be processed plays vital {{role in the development}} of the process/technology. Three cationic collectors which are vegetable oil based, biodegradable and environmental friendly were tested for their efficacy in reducing alumina and silica and improve iron content in the tailings of an operating iron <b>ore</b> <b>washing</b> <b>plant.</b> Selectivity index as defined by Douglas was used as response parameter to measure the efficiency of separation while comparing the performance of these collectors during flotation tests. Sokem 522 C proved to be better in comparison to Sokem 701 and Sokem 702 with the highest selectivity index of 20. 87. The concentrate generated analyzed 63. 30 % Fe, 2. 20 % SiO 2 and 2. 52 % Al 2 O 3 with 69. 00 % weight recovery and 79. 21 % Fe recovery from the tailings containing 55. 14 % Fe, 17. 34 % SiO 2 and 4. 04 % Al 2 O 3. The concentrate generated is suitable for pellet making due to its attractive granulometry and acceptable levels of alumina content (≤ 2. 50 %) in it. The tailings generated in this process could be utilised for cement manufacturing and tiles or pavement blocks making. The process developed is ‘zero waste ’ while mitigating the environmental issues related to managing tailings in iron ore processing plants...|$|E
