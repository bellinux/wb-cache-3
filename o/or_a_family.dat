5|$|Both were arrested, with Lennon {{pleading}} guilty to hashish possession, absolving Ono, who miscarried not long after. Lennon was fined £150 ($360). Note: in November1973, Pilcher was arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after it was alleged he had committed perjury. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} four years imprisonment. After the raid, the landlord sought an injunction against Starr on 19February1969, forbidding anyone but Starr or his family to live there, and allowing no music or instruments to be played. Starr appealed, and a compromise was offered; only Starr <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> member would live in the flat. To finally settle the case, Starr sold the lease on 28February1969.|$|E

Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.But Simonsohn suspected that, likeWalt Disney working for Disney, many people work for companies named after themselves <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.|$|E
5|$|The {{rooms on}} {{the north and east}} sides of the third floor were {{accessed}} via the private staircase. The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber. The larger one had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> room.

5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350–550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650–1000 mg/dL are typical of homozygous FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E

25|$|Many {{distinct}} organizations {{provide health}} care in the US. Facilities are largely owned and operated by private sector businesses. Health insurance for public sector employees is primarily provided by the government. 60–65% of healthcare provision and spending comes from programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Tricare, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and the Veterans Health Administration. Most of the population under 65 is insured by their <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> member's employer, some buy health insurance on their own, and the remainder are uninsured. On March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) became law, providing for major changes in health insurance.|$|E

Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms {{in the absence of}} worrisome features. Worrisome features include onset at greater than 50 years of age, weight loss, blood in the stool, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> history of inflammatory bowel disease. Other conditions that may present similarly include celiac disease, microscopic colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, bile acid malabsorption, and colon cancer.|$|E
25|$|The paid firemen had no days off, {{were not}} allowed to leave their post except for one meal, and were seldom allowed to leave the firehouse unless on fire {{business}} <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> emergency. An ordinance in 1859 made it illegal to give firemen alcoholic beverages. Their clothes were irregular; uniforms were not worn until 1874, with a regulation uniform established in 1928. Firemen had to buy their own uniforms until 1943, when a $60 clothing allowance was established. An attempt to remove politics from the fire department was not very successful; it was necessary to mandate that the department staff be half Republican and half Democrat, and the role of fire chief was based on political affiliation and family contacts.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, {{crime rates}} in New York City were peaking after rising since 1966. Between 1966 and 1981, violent crime {{rates in the}} city had more than tripled from 325 to 1100 violent crimes per 100,000 people annually. By mid-decade, the city had a {{reported}} crime rate over 70% higher {{than the rest of}} the United States. In 1984, there were 2 homicides, 18 violent crimes, and 65 property thefts reported per 10,000 people. The subway became a symbol of the city's inability to control crime. In an opinion poll of New York City residents taken the month after the shootings, more than half of those surveyed said crime was the worst thing about living in the city; about a quarter said they <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> member had been a victim of crime in the last year; and two-thirds said they would be willing to pay for private security for their building or block.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S, the National Report Card on Adherence rates Americans {{with chronic}} medical {{conditions}} with a grade C+ on adherence to their medication and this contributes {{to an estimated}} cost of $290 Billion annually. Increase in patient medication cost share {{was found to be}} associated with low adherence to medication. The United States is among the countries with the highest prices of prescription drugs which is one of factors leading to the high healthcare costs. This is mainly attributed to the government's lack of ability to negotiate lower prices with monopolies in the pharmaceutical industry especially with the brand name drugs. In order to manage the medication costs, many patients on long term therapies fail to fill their prescription or skip or reduce doses. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2015, approximately three quarters (73%) of the public think the drug prices are unreasonable and blame pharmaceutical companies for setting prices so high. In the same report, half of the public reported that they are taking prescription drugs and “quarter (25%) of those currently taking prescription medicine report they <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> member have not filled a prescription in the past 12 months due to cost, and 18 percent report cutting pills in half or skipping doses”. In comparison to Canada, only 8% of adults reported to have skipped their doses or not filling their prescriptions due to the cost of their prescribed medications.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} those who have a high degree of {{cognitive}} impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of those around them, but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment. One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population. It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo. An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is family involvement where possible, this can be a biological family <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> created in a group home or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how those around them handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are ok and normal.|$|E
