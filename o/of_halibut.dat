25|$|Young halibut {{are highly}} migratory and {{generally}} migrate in a clockwise direction {{east and south}} throughout the Gulf of Alaska. Halibut in older age classes {{tend to be less}} migratory, but continue to move predominately on a clockwise direction. Mature fish are also involved in winter spawning migrations towards deeper waters, migrating across several areas in some instances. Research has indicated small, localized spawning populations may occur in deep waters such as in Chatham Straight in northern Southeast Alaska. However, because of the free-floating nature of larvae and subsequent mixing of juvenile halibut from throughout the Gulf of Alaska, only one genetic stock <b>of</b> <b>halibut</b> is known in the northern Pacific.|$|E

[...] Sportsmen’s effort and interest in catching these delicious fish is increasing each year. In southeast Alaska, halibut are second only to king salmon in sport angler preference. Fishing for Pacific halibut is regulated by the International Pacific Halibut Commission.

The management <b>of</b> <b>halibut</b> fishing by this commission is intended to allow a sustainable yield.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} issues facing developing Arctic fisheries {{is a lack of}} scientific knowledge available to inform management. This thesis develops two key ideas essential to establishing a sustainable harvest <b>of</b> Greenland <b>Halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) within Scott Inlet, Baffin Island: inshore/offshore connectivity <b>of</b> Greenland <b>Halibut</b> stocks, and capture induced stress <b>of</b> Greenland <b>Halibut</b> and Greenland Shark (Somniosus microcephalus). The majority <b>of</b> Greenland <b>Halibut</b> only utilised the inshore environment during the summer, ice-free, season spending about 27 ± 14 days within the system before exiting offshore. A small resident portion of fish, spent on average 261 ± 79 days within Scott Inlet throughout the year. Capture stress indicated that undersized Greenland Halibut do not express greater physiological perturbations, yet Greenland Sharks captured at greater depths had higher lactate values (300 - 600 m: 1. 6 ± 0. 5 mmol/L and 700 - 900 m: 3. 7 ± 1. 2 mmol/L).

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the biology <b>of</b> the Greenland <b>halibut</b> stock in the Newfoundland-Labrador area were investigated. The {{distribution}} <b>of</b> Greenland <b>halibut</b> in relation to depth and temperature is described for several areas. The largest concentrations {{were found to be}} in depths of 150 and 325 fathoms and temperatures from 1 ° to 3 °C. [...] The food <b>of</b> Greenland <b>halibut</b> is discussed in relation to half-monthly periods, depth and fish length. Capelin is the major food <b>of</b> Greenland <b>halibut</b> larger than 20 cm with euphausiids being the major food below 20 cm. [...] The age and growth patterns, and length-weight relationships for several areas are described as well as evidence supporting the validity of the otolith ageing technique. The growth rate <b>of</b> Greenland <b>halibut</b> decreases from south to north possibly because of the cold Labrador Current in the northern areas. The growth rate <b>of</b> Greenland <b>halibut</b> in Trinity Bay has increased since 1953 possibly because of an increase in temperature in this area and also because of a decrease in numbers resulting from the high fishing intensity in Trinity Bay during 1964 - 68. [...] Estimates of total and annual mortality rates are calculated for each area under consideration. Sufficient time had not elapsed since the increase in effort in Trinity Bay for the expected increase in total mortality to be reflected in the catch curves at the time of sampling...|$|R

The sequenced part of the RNA 2 <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>halibut</b> nodavirus (strain AH 95 NorA) was highly similar in organisation {{to that of the}} RNA 2 of striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), and comprised features common to all nodaviruses. These characteristics confirmed that the virus that causes viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER) in Atlantic halibut is a nodavirus. The nucleotide sequence of the 1349 nucleotide fragment <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>halibut</b> nodavirus RNA 2 was 80 % identical to the RNA 2 of SJNNV. The T 2 region (830 nucleotides) of the RNA 2 <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>halibut</b> nodavirus shared 98 % of the nucleotide sequence when compared with the homologous region of barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus (BFNNV), while the nucleotide sequence identity to SJNNV in this region was 76 %. Phylogenetic analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of the T 4 region (421 nucleotides) <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>halibut</b> nodavirus and <b>of</b> other fish nodaviruses revealed a close relationship to the nodaviruses of the barfin flounder clad that have been found in other cold-water species (Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus and barfin flounder Verasper mosen). The nucleotide sequence of the RNA 2 <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>halibut</b> nodavirus included some features that differ from that of SJNNV. The ORF of the RNA 2 <b>of</b> Atlantic <b>halibut</b> nodavirus lacked 6 nucleotides through a slngle deletion and a 5 -nucleotide deletion, separated by 4 nucleotides. The 3 '-non-encoding region contained a 21 nucleotide insert and a 3 nucleotide deletion when compared with SJNNV. In comparison with the RNA 2 of SJNNV, the 3 '-non-encoding region showed a nucleotide sequence identity of 84. 5 %. A primer set based on the Atlantic halibut nodavirus nucleotide sequence was employed in order to design an optimal RT-PCR. The detection limit of the PCR was 10 to 100 copies of plasrnid, while the detection limit of the RT-PCR assay was 100 to 1000 copies of in vitro transcribed viral RNA...|$|R
