5|$|It is {{possible}} that settlements have existed {{in the area around}} Rivington since the Bronze Age. Arrowheads, a flint knife, scrapers and the remains of cremations were excavated from a Bronze Age cairn at Noon Hill in 1958 and 1963–64. It {{is possible}} that the name Coblowe on the eastern bank of the Lower Rivington Reservoir derives from the Old English hlaw, a hill, which denoted an ancient barrow or burial place. Evidence for the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> here in Anglo-Saxon times is found in the Rivington and Coblowe names.|$|E

5|$|Cabeza de Vaca {{is thought}} to have been the first European to sight the bay in the early 16th century, {{evidenced}} by the descriptions in his logs that match the detail of the area. In 1766, Spaniard Diego Ortiz Parrilla {{is believed to be the}} first European to explore the bay. He named it Santo Domingo (Saint Dominic), but it was later changed to Copano, after the port of Copano was officially opened in 1785 on the northwestern shore. The port later served as a strategically important locale during the Texas Revolution and the American Civil War, and was the site <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> that is now completely abandoned. The town of St. Mary's of Aransas was founded southwest of Copano and thrived as a port and wood mart, until numerous shipwrecks caused by the bay's hidden reefs concluded its use in 1875. Like Copano, it is now abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement,</b> Louis {{remained}} in London with his remaining forces, {{hoping for the}} arrival of reinforcements from France. When the expected fleet did arrive in August, it was intercepted and defeated by loyalists at the Battle of Sandwich. Louis entered into fresh peace negotiations, and the factions came to agreement on the final Treaty of Lambeth, also known as the Treaty of Kingston, on 12 and 13 September 1217. The treaty was similar to the first peace offer, but excluded the rebel clergy, whose lands and appointments remained forfeit; it included a promise, however, that Louis' followers would be allowed to enjoy their traditional liberties and customs, referring back to the Charter of 1216. Louis left England as agreed and joined the Albigensian Crusade in the south of France, bringing the war to an end.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Lincoln, the loyalist campaign stalled and only recommenced in late June when the victors had arranged the ransoming of their prisoners. Meanwhile, support for Louis's campaign was diminishing in France and he concluded {{that the war in}} England was lost. The French prince negotiated terms with Cardinal Guala, under which he would renounce his claim to the English throne; in return, his followers would be given back their lands, any sentences of excommunication would be lifted and Henry's government would promise to enforce the Magna Carta. The proposed agreement soon began to unravel amid claims from some loyalists that it was too generous towards the rebels, particularly the clergy who had joined the rebellion. In the absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement,</b> Louis remained in London with his remaining forces.|$|E
5|$|Like most of {{this part}} of Borneo, this area was once {{under the control of the}} Bruneian Empire in the 15th century before being ceded to the Sultanate of Sulu between the 17th and 18th centuries as a gift for helping the Bruneian forces during a civil war in Brunei. The name Tawao was used on {{nautical}} charts by 1857, and there is evidence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> by 1879. The East India Company had established a trading post in Borneo, though there was no significant activity by the Dutch on the east coast. In 1846, Netherlands signed a treaty with the Sultan of Bulungan, where the latter assured the Dutch control of the area. When the Dutch began to operate in 1867, the Sultan married his son to the daughter of the Sultan of Tarakan. Around this time, the Dutch sphere of influence reached Tawao. They controlled the area north of Tawao, overlapping an area controlled by the Sultan of Sulu.|$|E
5|$|Several {{political}} changes preceded {{the passage of}} the settlement act. First, Senator Edmund Muskie (D-ME)who previously seemed supportive <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement,</b> but was gaining national prominence on the issue of fiscal responsibility prior to the 1980 Democratic primarygave up his seat as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to accept President Carter's nomination for Secretary of State. Second, Governor Brennan's choice to replace Muskie (and thus inherit his predecessor's committee assignments) was George Mitchell (D-ME)who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge. Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the fear that, if Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he would veto any settlement favorable toward the tribes.|$|E

5|$|Spanish Hill is a hill {{located in}} the borough of South Waverly, Pennsylvania. The hill is {{controversial}} among historians and archaeologists; opinions regarding the origin of structures found on the site vary from embankments created by early farmers, to {{the remnants of a}} Native American village and battlements, due to the site's similarity to the description found in the account of Étienne Brûlé <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>settlement</b> called Carantouan. The area in the hill's vicinity was previously occupied by Susquehannock Native Americans. It was a common site for both amateur and professional archaeology, as well as relic hunting. The source of the name remains unknown, but various theories have been proposed as to its origin.|$|E

The area now known as Briarcliff Manor had seen human occupation since at least the Archaic period, but significant growth in the settlements that are now incorporated into the village did not occur until the Industrial Revolution. The village, which was incorporated with one square mile in 1902, has expanded primarily through annexation: of Scarborough in 1906 and from the town of Mount Pleasant in 1927.|$|E
