5|$|The Michiganensian {{described}} the defeat as follows:"There had been {{every reason to}} expect a victory from Chicago. Michigan had played strong and consistent foot ball throughout her schedule – Chicago had been erratic and unsteady. But there is certainly no sport more full <b>of</b> <b>surprises</b> than foot-ball, and the Thanksgiving Day contest of '96 furnished as sensational a surprise in as exciting a contest as had ever come off on a western gridiron. There was one great difference {{in the character of}} the play of the two teams. Michigan was playing her stock game of football, hard and steady, the game she could have been depended on to play at any time. Chicago seemed to have been trained and nerved to this one game. There could have been little doubt what the result of a series of contests would have been. But this one game, Chicago won by good generalship, by the most advantageous use of her greatest resource – a magnificent player in a telling place.|$|E

Another surprise was that no officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were elected as full members. However, Phạm Bình Minh, the Director of the International Organizations Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was elected as an alternate member. None of the 34 self-nominated candidates at the congress were elected to the 10th Central Committee. It is unknown whether any of the self-nominees for alternate membership in the 10th Central Committee were elected. There was an increase in Central Committee officials working in the central government, the provinces, military and defence officials, public security officials and officials from mass organizations, but there was a decrease in officials from the sectors of information, social and cultural affairs, economics, business and financial affairs, and others.|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{studies found}} a {{discrepancy}} between the display and feeling <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> Therefore, we assessed what factors influence the display <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> in children <b>of</b> two age groups: 8 - and 11 -year-olds. We manipulated the social setting (children either competed or collaborated), and the cause <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> (a surprisingly positive or negative event). We found that children used more features to express negatively caused surprise, compared to positively caused surprise and that 11 -year-olds used more facial features than 8 -year-olds. In a subsequent perception study, adults judged video clips with surprised and neutral reactions, for the degree <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> that was displayed. We found higher ratings <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> for negatively vs. positively surprised children, competing vs. collaborating children, and 11 -year-olds vs. 8 -year-olds. These results confirm {{that in addition to}} the feeling <b>of</b> <b>surprise,</b> its cause, the social setting, and age also affect the display <b>of</b> <b>surprise...</b>|$|R

25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full <b>of</b> <b>surprises</b> for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

More recent research shows that rasing of the eyebrows does provide facial feedback to disbelief but not to the startle.|$|R

40|$|The {{expression}} of surprise—at something unexpected—is a key form of emotional display. Focusing on displays <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> performed {{by means of}} reaction tokens (akin to Goffman’s “response cries”), such as wow, gosh, oh my god, ooh!, phew, we use an ethnomethodological, conversation-analytic approach to analyze surprise in talk-in-interaction. Our key contribution is to detach the psychology <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> from its social expression by showing how co-conversationalists collaborate to bring off an interactionally achieved performance <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> Far from being a visceral eruption of emotion, the production <b>of</b> a <b>surprise</b> token is often prepared for several turns in advance. We also show how surprise can be recycled on an occasion subsequent to its initial production, and how surprise displays may be delayed by silence, ritualized disbelief, and other repair initiations. Finally, we consider some of the uses <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> as an interactional resource, including {{its role in the}} reflection and reproduction of culture.

40|$|While {{surprise}} {{is a common}} emotion in everyday life, some of its fundamental characteristics are still unclear. For example, what does surprise feel like, positive or negative? The emotion literature has been somewhat unclear about the experiential valence <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> Surprise has been depicted as a pre-affective state, or as an emotion that can be both positive and negative, depending on the goal conduciveness of the surprising event. Based on recent work on cognitive consistency and neuroscientific/psychophysiological studies on surprise, we explored the possibility that surprise may be a (mildly) negative emotion {{in a study of}} autobiographical recall of unexpected and surprising events (Experiment 1) and in two studies of facial expressions <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> (Experiments 2 and 3 a/b). The studies show that experience <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> and the perception <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> in others may indeed be initially negative.

40|$|International audienceThis paper re-examines the {{well-established}} {{distinction between}} expression and description of emotion as regards surprise. First, the authors {{show that the}} expression <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> does not involve the use <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> lexemes, but rather mirative utterances and specific syntactic constructions (while the description <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> involves surprise lexemes). Second, {{the investigation of the}} corpus data indicates that surprise lexemes – namely the noun surprise and the adjective surprised – differ from other emotion lexemes in that they do not systematically refer to the emotional state of an experiencer. The noun surprise can have such a state reading but can also evaluate a source seen as a salient unexpected referent. As for the adjective surprised, it may serve various argumentative strategies. These uses reflect the epistemic rather than emotional nature <b>of</b> <b>surprise,</b> which sets it apart from other emotions...|$|R
40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effects of stimuli discrepant with schemata of varying strength on three surprise components: The interruption of ongoing activities (indexed by response time increase), the focusing of attention on the schema-discrepant stimulus (indexed by memory performance), and the feeling <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> (indexed by self-reports). Response times were consistently found to increase with schema strength. This effect was attributed to the increasing difficulty of schema revision. In contrast, memory for the schemadiscrepant stimulus was not affected by schema strength, supporting the hypothesis that schema-discrepant stimuli are stored in memory with a distinct tag. Finally, self-reports <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> intensity varied with schema strength only if they were made immediately after the surprising event without any intervening questions, suggesting that self-reports <b>of</b> <b>surprise</b> are highly susceptible to memory distortions. Surprise and Schema Strength 3 The purpose of the experiments {{described in this article}} is to contribute to the empirical investigation of the emotion <b>of</b> <b>surprise.</b> More precisely, the aim {{of the present study was}} to examine {{the effects of}} the strength of the cognitive structure or schema from which the surprise-eliciting event deviates, on three components <b>of</b> the <b>surprise</b> syndrome, namely the subjective feeling <b>of</b> <b>surprise,</b> the interruption <b>of</b> ongoing activities and the focusing of attention on the surprise-eliciting event.
