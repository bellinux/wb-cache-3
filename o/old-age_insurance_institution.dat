40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> policy {{provision for}} Chinese internal migrant workers. In recent years, the government’s <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> {{policy has been}} redesigned to include migrant workers in the current insurance scheme and to offer them better protection. However, the participation rate is still extremely low and numbers of migrant workers are increasingly high, making it imperative to investigate the reasons for such low participation. To this end, this thesis employs a three-dimensional analysis framework of <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> policy for migrant workers: individual perceptions, policy analysis of <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> policies and documents, and the linkage between {{the economic and political}} environment and social security/old-age insurance reform. However, the prevailing framework of State economic development goals creates deeply embedded institutional obstacles for these workers, and more significantly, because of their confined capabilities in relation to the resources they possess, migrant workers are severely limited in their access to <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance.</b> There are a number of insurmountable constraints stemming from the poor real-world situation they are in, notably their lack of access to information about <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance,</b> the lack of guarantee provided for future benefits, and their well-founded fear of making demands on their employers. The institutional obstacles exclude migrant workers from participating; the <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> policy inherently has discouraging factors which negatively influence migrant workers; and the national goal of economic development has led to massive economic and social consequences, which effectively marginalise rural populations, including migrant workers, and restrict their access to equitable social welfare provision. In this thesis I argue that since the economic reform of 1978, the mechanisms formed under powerful new economic and social imperatives have defined migrant workers as cheap, unprotected labour. In this context, in order to secure their own interests, provincial governments have developed a collusive relationship with profit-seeking enterprises. Thus rather than strictly implementing the <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> policy for their workers, they have sided with capital over labour. Finally, as an interest group, migrant workers are greatly disadvantaged in contention with the other powerful groups, especially provincial governments and profit-seeking enterprises, and their interests are marginalised. Compared to these powerful interest groups, migrant workers command very limited resources; they are often powerless and their <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> interests are infringed. The Chinese migrant workers’ <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> policy is well-intentioned and equitably conceived. However, under the prevailing economic development imperative, the government’s implementation is stymied by the lack of support from powerful interest groups caught up in the lust for capital. Effective government policy needs to be implemented to resolve the current situation. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, School of Social Sciences, 201...|$|R

40|$|As the {{publicly}} financed pay-as-you-go pension {{systems in}} Europe come under increasing pressure, workers and politicians rediscover private savings for retirement in Europe – {{the provision of}} self-financed rather than state-financed <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance.</b> This paper summarizes our knowledge about the retirement savings motive, and particularly the willingness of individuals to participate in voluntary and/or mandatory private saving schemes for retirement. We also review our knowledge of crowding-out effects, that is, to which extent state-financed <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> substitutes for self-provided <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance,</b> and to which extent retirement saving crowd out other saving. The {{state of the art}} is less than satisfactory. We have little reliable evidence on life-cycle saving patterns and its policy determinants. Moreover, while we have some convincing evidence that there is substitution between public and private <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance,</b> the extent of potential crowding out is still very much disputed. One of the main reasons is lack of suitable data. The paper points to specific strategies that enable our governments to base current and future pension reform decisions on a more solid foundation. ...|$|R

40|$|Most {{people in}} rural China {{have no plans}} for {{retirement}} other than the ingrained Chinese tradition that children care for old parents. Actually there are also no sources of social support such as social <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> to rely on in rural people’ old age {{for a long time}} in China. In 1992, a social <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> program, rural pension program, was initiated by the Chinese government to firstly establish a social security system in China’s rural area. The rural pension program experienced rapid development in the beginning years but grounded to halt after 1998. Since either children or pension program provides support for elderly, we expected that these two can be viewed as substitutes to some extent. Using data from China’s 2005 mini-census, we find that rural people who have at least one son are less likely to participate in pension program and each additional son and daughter both decreases their participation rate. Moreover, the effect of an additional son is much larger than that of an additional daughter. In addition, both evidence from mini-census and China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study show that peasants accessing to pension are less likely to rely on their children for support in old age. These findings suggest that demand for children, especially for sons are partly driven by concerns relating to care in old age; children and formal social <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> are substitutes for support in old age. We then expect that implementation of social <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> may mitigate rural people’ demand for children, especially sons and thus correct China’s severe sex ratio bias to some extent. We test this hypothesis using the difference-in-differences strategy, and find that increase of sex ratio at the region level slowed down after the implementation of the rural pension program. Overall, our empirical analysis in this paper implies that sex ratio bias is partly due to demanding for sons for support in old age and carrying out social <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> in rural China are helpful in mitigating demand for children and correcting sex ratio bias. ...|$|R

Indeed, monthly benefit payments, under the original Act, were not scheduled to begin until 1942.

40|$|The {{concept of}} "migrant workers" {{derives from the}} {{household}} registration system of China's planned economy period. The continued existence of that system conflicts {{with the development of}} an integrated labour market. The current social security system, based on household registration and a large number of local pools, discriminates against migrant workers because of their mobility and the lack of mechanisms to transfer benefits between pools. As a result, migrants have made major contributions to China's economic development but do not get the same benefits as urban residents. Faced with this challenge, China's government has begun to introduce policy reforms to improve social security for migrants. This article explores this development through a focus on <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance.</b> It analyses the special needs of migrants, the obstacles facing policy development and the proposed solutions. It argues that social justice and social equity require the development of a system that treats all citizens equally, and that the logic of an integrated labour market will ultimately require a unified national system of <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since {{increasing}} {{attention is}} paid to consider the macroeconomic effects of the increasing longevity, we build on an overlapping generations model with endogenous population to investigate under changing longevity the steady-state and dynamical (under myopic expectations) effects of two historical alternatives as a means of <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance,</b> namely, voluntary intra-family transfers from young to old members versus pay-as-you-go public pensions. It is shown that the shift from a private system of <b>old-age</b> <b>insurance</b> to a public system of social security has favoured the rise in capital accumulation while also reducing the risk of cyclical instability in countries where longevity is large enough. In contrast, when adult mortality is high such a shift makes an economy with public PAYG pensions more prone to instability, and with a steady state stock of capital and GDP per worker lower in the long run. Moreover since an old age insurance motive seems prevalent also in highly developed as well long-lived countries as Italy, our results may also be of interest for pension policies...|$|R
