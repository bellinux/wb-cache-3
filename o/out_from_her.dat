5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried to her waist in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the sand and let it slips <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Björk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E

500|$|Hilda {{was born}} in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in in 1886. She moved to London in 1911, where she {{played a central role}} within the then {{emerging}} Imagist movement. A charismatic figure, she was championed by the modernist poet Ezra Pound, who was instrumental in building and furthering her career. From 1916–17, she acted as the literary editor of the Egoist journal, while her poetry appeared in the English Review and the Transatlantic Review. During the First World War, H.D. suffered the death of her brother and the breakup of her marriage to the poet Richard Aldington, and these events weighed heavily on her later poetry. Imagist authority Glenn Hughes wrote that 'her loneliness cries <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> poems'. [...] She had a deep interest in Ancient Greek literature, and her poetry often borrowed from Greek mythology and classical poets. Her work is noted for its incorporation of natural scenes and objects, which are often used to emote a particular feeling or mood.|$|E
500|$|A {{paramedic}} tried inserting an intravenous {{needle into}} Selena, but her veins had collapsed {{because of the}} massive blood loss and low (or no) blood pressure, making the insertion extremely difficult. Local police closed off Navigation Boulevard.

Doctors were able to establish an [...] "erratic heartbeat" [...] long enough to transfer her to the trauma room. Doctors began blood transfusions in an attempt to re-establish blood circulation after opening Selena's chest and finding massive internal bleeding. Selena's right lung was damaged, her collarbone was shattered, and her veins were emptied of blood. Doctors widened her chest opening, administered drugs into her heart, and applied pressure to her wounds. Dr. Louis Elkins said a [...] "pencil-size artery leading from the heart had been cut in two by the hollow-point bullet" [...] and that six units of blood from the transfusion had spilled <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> circulatory system.

500|$|A {{group of}} reformers, led by Mrs. Bowers, moves {{to have the}} red light {{district}} closed and force the girls out. District Attorney Osborne, believes that it will turn out poorly for the town and tries to persuade the reforms {{that it would be}} like scattering smallpox. He fails to persuade them and the law is passed. The film focuses on one of the prostitutes, Hattie Fenshaw, who is forced <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> place of vice. According to H. D. Fretz's review, Fenshaw is determined to let those at a prominent hotel know that [...] "women such as she had better be left alone", but is quickly recognized and evicted. At the hotel, Fenshaw makes an acquaintance of Bryant Harding who decides to keep her as his mistress and pays Fenshaw's rent in an apartment next door to one of the reformers, Mrs. Osborne. Fenshaw also charms Dudley Carleton, who breaks off his engagement to Betty Hamlin, the daughter of Harding, who uses her divorced mother's maiden name. Hamlin and Fenshaw meet through an introduction with Mrs. Bowers, and Hamlin, unaware of Fenshaw's character is telephoned by Fenshaw to come and sew for her to earn some money. Hal Harding, a college student with a desire to see the city, is introduced to Fenshaw during his father's absence. The cast assembles at Fenshaw's apartment when Hamlin arrives and interrupts Fenshaw's party with her ex-fiance and her brother, Hal. She is then introduced to her brother under and assumed name and is in the apartment when Bryant Harding returns. A fight breaks out and Harding nearly kills Carleton and knocks Fenshaw unconscious and shoots at his daughter, but misses. Alerted by the shot, the District Attorney, Mrs. Bowers and her reformer friends arrive and learn of Hattie Fenshaw's vice. Shorey's film review concludes with the presumption that Fenshaw returns to a place of [...] "legalized vice" [...] with Mrs. Bowers' permission.|$|E
