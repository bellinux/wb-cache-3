25|$|The {{position}} of Irish Catholics is a cruel one. We are enslaved by a Protestant power. The penal laws against <b>our</b> <b>religion</b> {{are not yet}} abolished in full. The injurious social and economic results of these anti-Catholic laws will not be overcome for generations. To the present day we suffer political injury {{inside and outside of}} Ireland, simply and solely because we are practising Catholics. Sons of martyrs, we are known in every Masonic lodge and every anti-Catholic country as 'Papists', and par-excellence, the most devoted of all the children of the Holy See.|$|E

500|$|Die Another Day was {{controversial}} in the Korean Peninsula. The North Korean government disliked {{the portrayal of}} their state as brutal and war-hungry. The South Koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 December 2002, as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland, and by a lovemaking scene near a statue of the Buddha. The Jogye Buddhist Order issued a statement that the film was [...] "disrespectful to <b>our</b> <b>religion</b> and does not reflect our values and ethics". The Washington Post reported growing resentment in the nation towards the United States. An official of the South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that Die Another Day was [...] "the wrong film at the wrong time." ...|$|E

[...] That is what the West is expecting [...] us - to bring the killers of our brothers, to bring those who cut the noses of the Afghan women, to bring those who do suicide bombings in our wedding parties, to put them {{on the other side of}} the table and say, 'Brother, you represent <b>our</b> <b>religion</b> and I have lost my direction.

50|$|What {{underlies}} talk of virginity is {{a profound}} and often hidden moral angst about purity and pollution - and therefore also sentiments of temptation and desire.

500|$|The report {{described}} the Communist system in Russia as [...] "a {{reign of terror}} unparalleled {{in the history of}} modern civilization". It concluded that instituting Marxism-Leninism in the United States would result in [...] "the destruction of life and property", the deprivation [...] "of the right to participate in affairs of government", and the [...] "further suppress" [...] of a [...] "substantial rural portion of the population." [...] Furthermore, there would be an [...] "opening of the doors of all prisons and penitentiaries". It would result in the [...] "seizure and confiscation of the 22,896 newspapers and periodicals in the United States" [...] and [...] "complete control of all banking institutions and their assets". [...] "One of the most appalling and far reaching consequences... would be found in the confiscation and liquidation of... life insurance companies." [...] The report also criticized [...] "the atheism that permeates the whole Russian dictatorship"; [...] "they have denounced <b>our</b> <b>religion</b> and our God as 'lies'." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, 21st Century Breakdown {{is similar}} to the punk rock style of American Idiot, but many critics have claimed that Green Day's {{traditional}} sound has evolved in the five years since their last release to incorporate new influences such as heavier, louder pop rock and stadium rock on an epic scale. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone indicated that the album sports ballads that are Green Day's most polished; he claimed that the band [...] "combine punk thrash with their newfound love of classic-rock grandiosity". MTV compared the material to that of classic rockers like The Who, while Spin called the title track [...] "Green Day's most epic song yet". Cool has remarked: [...] "It's important to us that we're still looked at as a punk band. It was <b>our</b> <b>religion,</b> our higher education". However, he also noted that Armstrong had delved into the past in writing 21st Century Breakdown, gleaning inspiration from the artists who shaped rock music. Armstrong himself has stated: [...] "Ground zero for me is still punk rock. I like painting an ugly picture. I get something uplifting out of singing some of the most horrifying shit you can sing about. It's just my DNA." ...|$|E

50|$|The Prophet Muhammad (P.B.H.) sayings that “Allah creates no disease without {{creating}} {{a cure for}} it as well” and “{{the superiority of the}} learned over the mere pins is like the superiority of the moon when it is full over all other stars and the ink of the sailors is more previous than the Good of the martyrs” direct us towards reaching for unknown cures and medical research is thus <b>our</b> <b>religions</b> duty.|$|R
50|$|Some {{comparatively}} new {{belief systems}} and books portray God as extraterrestrial life.

2500|$|Archer took {{a degree}} of Master of Arts and {{returned}} to Ireland in March 1577.

2500|$|This is {{particularly}} {{evident in the}} feminist journal L'Egyptienne published by the EFU. Written and published in French, the journal was only accessible to the French speaking Egyptians who were mostly members of the upper classes. However the issues discussed in the magazine included Turkish reforms regarding women, which had influenced Egyptian women and Islam. The journal editor Ceza Nebarawi stated in 1927 that [...] "we the Egyptian Feminists, have a great respect for <b>our</b> <b>religion.</b> In wanting to see it practised in its true spirit". Another journal, published 1937, was called el-Masreyyah (The Egyptian Woman).|$|E
