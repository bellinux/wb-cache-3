5|$|By 7:00a.m. Central Daylight Time, CAPE values began {{exceeding}} 4,000 j/kg, a {{level that}} climatologically favors the development <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> thunderstorms. Despite conflicting model data on the specified area where thunderstorms would develop, the newly available information that denoted a more favorable severe thunderstorm setup {{in that part of}} the state prompted the SPC to upgrade the forecasted threat <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> weather to a moderate risk for south-central Kansas, much of the western two-thirds of Oklahoma, and the northwestern and north-central portions Texas at 11:15a.m. CDT that morning, which now indicated an elevated threat of strong tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Headquartered at the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma, the Storm Prediction Center is {{tasked with}} {{forecasting}} the risk <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> thunderstorms and tornadoes in the contiguous United States. It issues convective outlooks, mesoscale discussions, and watches {{as a part}} of this process. Convective outlooks are issued for the following eight days (issued separately for Day1, Day2, Day3, and Days 4–8), and detail the risk <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> thunderstorms and tornadoes during the given forecast period, although tornado, hail and wind details are only available for Day 1. Days 2 and 3, as well as 4–8 use a probabilistic scale, determining the probability for a severe weather event in percentage categories.|$|E

40|$|The {{mesoscale}} {{nature of}} the forcing and evolution of these storms was investigated, with emphasis on techniques {{to aid in the}} early detection <b>of</b> such <b>severe</b> events. In the pre-storm environment (t- 4 to t- 2 hours), the satellite wind fields were combined with moisture parameters to derive horizontal moisture flux information. Low level moisture convergence was indicative of regions <b>of</b> subsequent <b>severe</b> storm genesis. Dynamic parameters such as boundary layer vorticity production and relative vorticity were also useful prognosticators <b>of</b> subsequent <b>severe</b> activity...|$|R

5|$|Mesoscale {{discussions are}} issued to provide {{information}} on certain individual regions where severe weather is becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive for the development <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated severe weather when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters are confident that severe weather will occur, and usually precede the onset <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> weather by one hour, although this sometimes varies depending on certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.|$|E
5|$|On February 5 at 6:39am CST (1239 UTC), the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) {{issued a}} high risk <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> storms for most of Arkansas, the first in February since 1998. At 10:16 am CST (1616 UTC), the high risk area was {{extended}} farther northeast to include western Kentucky, northwestern Mississippi, the Missouri Bootheel, West Tennessee, and Southern Illinois. A moderate risk <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> weather was issued for northwestern Alabama, the rest of Arkansas, the rest of southern Illinois, southern Indiana, {{most of the rest}} of Kentucky, northern Louisiana, central Mississippi, parts of southeastern Missouri, southwestern Ohio, eastern Oklahoma, middle Tennessee and northeastern Texas. A total of fifteen watches were issued by the SPC during the outbreak, including thirteen tornado watches (two of which were PDS watches) and two severe thunderstorm watches.|$|E

5|$|Severe and {{complicated}} malaria {{are almost always}} caused by infection with P. falciparum. The other species usually cause only febrile disease. Severe {{and complicated}} malaria are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high (10% to 50%).

5|$|The {{conditions}} on Sunday, 29 November were extremely unsettled.

5|$|A {{high risk}} <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> weather was issued for April 26 for {{portions}} of Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas along {{and near the}} Interstate 30 corridor as conditions became even more favorable for extreme weather. A large PDS tornado watch with very high tornado probabilities was issued that afternoon for that same area. Widespread tornado warnings were issued in that area later that evening.|$|E
5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the severe weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> weather advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. Severe weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderate}} risk <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> storms {{was issued}} by the Storm Prediction Center for February28 across parts of the central Plains. The first tornadoes developed {{early in the evening}} of February28 in Kansas as the dry line pushed eastward and was lifted by the cold front. In total, 12 tornadoes formed that evening across Kansas and Missouri, of which 11 were weak. However, one of the tornadoes was an EF4, the first such tornado recorded and the first violent tornado since September22, 2006. No one was injured that evening. Farther south, expected activity in Oklahoma and Arkansas did not take place as the atmospheric cap held up.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} area <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> weather {{also developed}} that afternoon and evening along the Interstate 81 corridor from central and northern Virginia northward through Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New York, continuing into early April 28. Many tornadoes touched {{down in this}} area as well. Most of these tornadoes were weak, though an EF2 tornado touched down {{near the town of}} Halifax, Virginia, and caused severe damage to homes in the area, resulting in one death. Tornado alerts were issued for Southern Ontario as far north as Ottawa as well; one tornado was later confirmed in Fergus, Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Acute cholangitis {{carries a}} {{significant}} risk of death, {{the leading cause}} being irreversible shock with multiple organ failure (a possible complication <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> infections). Improvements in diagnosis and treatment {{have led to a}} reduction in mortality: before 1980, the mortality rate was greater than 50%, but after 1980 it was 10–30%. Patients with signs of multiple organ failure are likely to die unless they undergo early biliary drainage and treatment with systemic antibiotics. Other causes of death following severe cholangitis include heart failure and pneumonia.|$|E

In 1996, Transport Scotland set up a number of vehicle activated warning signs alerting drivers attention to nearby deer. Four of these signs are on the A82 between Tyndrum and Glencoe.|$|E
5|$|Analgesics may {{be needed}} for the {{abdominal}} and joint pains. It is uncertain as to whether HSP needs treatment beyond controlling the symptoms. Most patients do not receive therapy {{because of the high}} spontaneous recovery rate. Steroids are generally avoided. However, if they are given early in the disease episode, the duration of symptoms may be shortened, and abdominal pain can improve significantly. Moreover, the chance <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> kidney problems may be reduced. A systematic review of randomized clinical trials did not find any evidence that steroid treatment (prednisone) is effective at decreasing the likelihood of developing long-term kidney disease.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) <b>of</b> <b>severe</b> acute anxiety.|$|E
