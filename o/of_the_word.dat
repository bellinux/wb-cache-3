5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} French word kilo, a {{shortening}} of kilogramme, was imported into the English language {{where it has}} been used to mean both kilogram and kilometre. While kilo is acceptable in many generalist texts, for example The Economist, its use is typically considered inappropriate in certain applications including scientific, technical and legal writing, where authors should adhere strictly to SI nomenclature. When the United States Congress gave the metric system legal status in 1866, it permitted the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> kilo {{as an alternative to the}} word kilogram, but in 1990 revoked the status <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> kilo.|$|E
5|$|John Calvin was {{influenced}} by Martin Luther's idea of baptism as God's promises to the baptized person attached to the outward sign of washing with water. Calvin maintained Zwingli's idea of baptism as a public pledge, but insisted that it was secondary to baptism's meaning {{as a sign of}} God's promise to forgive sin. He maintained that sacraments were effective instruments in bringing about the promises they represent, however he also maintained that the promises could be refused by the baptized, and would have no effect in that case. Calvin carefully distinguished between the outward sign of the washing of water with the promises that baptism signifies while maintaining that they were inseparable. Calvin's baptismal theology is very similar to that of Luther. It differs in the way Calvin subordinated sacraments to the preaching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of God. While Luther placed preaching and sacraments on the same level, Calvin saw sacraments as confirmation which is added to the preaching <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of God.|$|E

5|$|The {{first record}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> grope {{being used in}} the indecent sense of sexual {{touching}} appears in 1380; cunt has been used to describe the vulva since at least 1230, and corresponds to the Old Norse kunta, although its precise etymology is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The full {{etymology}} is unknown. The oldest known usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> {{is in the}} 794 text Shin'yaku Kegonkyō Ongi Shiki. Other old sources include Nihon Ryōiki (810–824) and Wamyō Ruijushō (c. 934). These oldest {{sources are}} written in Man'yōgana which clearly identifies the historical spelling as ki1tune. Following several diachronic phonological changes, this becomes kitsune.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> a {{study on}} information extraction from unrestricted Turkish text using statistical language processing methods. In languages like English, {{there is a very}} small number of possible word forms with a given root word. However, languages like Turkish have very productive agglutinative morphology. Thus, it is an issue to build statistical models for specific tasks using <b>the</b> surface forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> mainly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data sparseness problem. In order to alleviate this problem, we used additional syntactic information, i. e. <b>the</b> morphological structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> We have successfully applied statistical methods using both the lexical and morphological information to sentence segmentation, topic segmentation, and name tagging tasks. For sentence segmentation, we have modeled the final inflectional groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> and combined it with the lexical model, and decreased the error rate to 4. 34 %, which is 21 % better than the result obtained using only <b>the</b> surface forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> For topic segmentation, stems <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> (especially nouns) have been found to be more e#ective than using <b>the</b> surface forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> and we have achieved 10. 90 % segmentation error rate on our test set according to the weighted TDT- 2 segmentation cost metric. This is 32 % better than the word-based baseline model. For name tagging, we used four di#erent information sources to model names. Our first information source is based on <b>the</b> surface forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words.</b> Then we combined the contextual cues with the lexical model, and obtained some improvement. After this, we modeled <b>the</b> morphological analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>words,</b> and finally we modeled the tag sequence, and reached an F-Measure of 91. 56 %, according to the MUC evaluation criteria.
