She says that she feels as if her life is {{flashing}} before her eyes, and then realises what is happening. Christine sits {{in a car wreck}} as emergency services attempt to free her. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> & window screen, there are broken eggs from a shopping bag and the Stranger is explaining to the police that he stepped into the road causing the crash, and, though he could free Jack he could not reach Christine. At the dinner table, Jack enters dressed as a Nativity angel. Marion says it is time for Christine to move on. Christine says a final goodbye.|$|E
25|$|The key {{evidence}} supporting this allegation was the jumpsuit, {{as well as}} a highly contentious forensic report claiming to have found evidence of foetal haemoglobin in stains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of the Chamberlains' 1977 Torana hatchback. Foetal haemoglobin is present in infants six months and younger; Azaria was nine weeks old {{at the time of her}} disappearance.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Sullivan {{was working}} inside a ranger station in Shenandoah National Park when another strike occurred. It set his hair on fire; {{he tried to}} smother the flames with his jacket. He then rushed to the restroom, but couldn't fit under the water tap and so used a wet towel instead. Although he never was a fearful man, after the fourth strike he began to believe that some force was trying to destroy him and he {{acquired}} a fear of death. For months, whenever he {{was caught in a}} storm while driving his truck, he would pull over and lie down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> until the storm passed. He also began to believe that he would somehow attract lightning even if he stood in a crowd of people, and carried a can of water with him in case his hair was set on fire.|$|E

500|$|John A. Williams {{wrote in}} his 1965 book, This Is My Country Too, {{that he did not}} believe [...] "white {{travelers}} have any idea of how much nerve and courage it requires for a Negro to drive coast to coast in America." [...] He achieved it with [...] "nerve, courage, {{and a great deal of}} luck," [...] supplemented by [...] "a rifle and shotgun, a road atlas, and Travelguide, a listing of places in America where Negroes can stay without being embarrassed, insulted, or worse." [...] He noted that black drivers needed to be particularly cautious in the South, where they were advised to wear a chauffeur's cap or have one visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> and pretend they were delivering a car for a white person. Along the way, he had to endure a stream of [...] "insults of clerks, bellboys, attendants, cops, and strangers in passing cars." [...] There was a constant need to keep his mind on the danger he faced; as he was well aware, [...] " [...] people have a way of disappearing on the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 15 July 2004, The Indian Express, The Times of India, Rediff.com, Outlook carried {{news reports}} that [...] "the Lahore-based Ghazwa Times, {{mouthpiece}} of the Lashkar-e-Taiba" [...] had acknowledged Ishrat Jahan as a Lashkar-e-Taiba operative. [...] According to these news reports, the Ghazwa Times had {{published an article}} on the [...] "Jamat-ul-Dawa" [...] (sic) website stating that [...] "the veil of Ishrat Jahan, a woman activist of LeT, was removed by Indian police and her body was kept with other mujahideens (terrorists) on the ground", and that [...] "Ishrat was with her husband, sitting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of the car" [...] [...] In June 2007, the Business Standard reported that the [...] "global terror group Lashkar-e-Taiyba" [...] had apologised to Indian muslims on 2 May 2007 on the Jamaat-ud-Dawah's website [...] "for causing them problems due to an inadvertent mistake", with the article implying that mistake in question was the claim that [...] "Ishrat Jehan Reza had been a Lashkar operative". These media reports were subsequently used by the Government of India in its 2009 affidavit as evidence of Ishrat Jahan's links with the Lashkar-e-Taiba.|$|E
2500|$|On November 27, 1978, Washington, D.C. police detectives {{received}} {{a tip from}} a reliable source describing a man known as [...] "Bandit" [...] who was selling illegal narcotics stored {{in the trunk of}} his car. The informant gave the location of the car and a description of both car and driver. The detectives discovered the parked car, and called for a computer check on the car, which confirmed that the car's owner matched the description and used the alias [...] "Bandit". Shortly thereafter they observed the car being driven by a man matching the description. They stopped the car and ordered the driver out. After noticing a bullet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat,</b> they searched the glove compartment and discovered a pistol, at which point they arrested the driver, identified as Albert Ross. A detective then opened the trunk and discovered a closed brown paper bag. He opened the bag and found numerous bags containing white powder, which were later identified as heroin. During a later search, they also found and opened a zippered red leather pouch, which contained $3,200 in cash. No warrant was obtained for these searches.|$|E

2500|$|The series {{developed}} a cult following partially {{due to the}} large number of in-jokes it contains, most of which are aimed at [...] "nerds". In commentary on the DVD releases, David X. Cohen points out and sometimes explains his [...] "nerdiest joke". These included mathematical jokes— such as [...] "Loew's -plex" [...] (aleph-null-plex) movie theater,— as well as various forms of science humor— for example, Professor Farnsworth, at a racetrack, complains about the use of a quantum finish to decide the winner, exclaiming [...] "No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it", a reference to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. In the season six episode [...] "Law and Oracle", Fry and the robot peace officer URL track down a traffic violator who turns out to be Erwin Schrödinger, the 20th-century quantum physicist. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat</b> of the car is a box, and when questioned about the contents, Schrödinger replies [...] "A cat, some poison, and a cesium atom". Fry asks if the cat is alive or dead, and Schrödinger answers [...] "It's a superposition of both states until you open the box and collapse the wave function." [...] When Fry opens the box, the cat jumps out and attacks him. The run is a reference to the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment of quantum mechanics. The series makes passing references to quantum chromodynamics (the appearance of Strong Force-brand glue), computer science (two separate books in a closet labeled P and NP respectively, referring to the possibility that P and NP-complete problem classes are distinct), electronics (an X-ray— or more accurately, an [...] "F-ray"— of Bender's head reveals a 6502 microprocessor), and genetics (a mention of Bender's [...] "robo- or R-NA"). The show often features subtle references to classic science fiction. These are most often to Star Trek— many soundbites are used in homage— but also include the reference to the origin of the word robot made {{in the name of the}} robot-dominated planet Chapek 9, and the black rectangular monolith labeled [...] "Out of Order" [...] in orbit around Jupiter (a reference to Arthur C. Clarke's Space Odyssey series). Bender and Fry sometimes watch a television show called The Scary Door, a humorous parody of The Twilight Zone.|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seat.</b> Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

Unique elements such as the Dark Cherry Metallic paint, 40th Anniversary badges, and Ruby Red and Graphite interior trim with the 40th Anniversary logo embroidered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> and floormats differentiated this option package from the previous year's offering.|$|R
50|$|The BIS is {{a three-point}} harness with the {{shoulder}} belt {{attached to the}} seat itself, {{rather than to the}} vehicle structure. The first car using this system was the Range Rover Classic. Fitment was standard <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats</b> from 1970. Some cars like the Renault Vel Satis use this system for <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>seats.</b> A General Motors assessment concluded seat-mounted 3-point belts offer better protection especially to smaller vehicle occupants, though GM did not find a safety performance improvement in vehicles with seat-mounted belts versus body-mounted belts.|$|R
