5|$|This {{force was}} to be <b>organised</b> <b>into</b> brigades, with no divisional {{headquarters}} raised, although it was envisioned that up to six divisions could be formed if required. The infantry was planned to be <b>organised</b> <b>into</b> 21 brigades (later 23) of four battalions each, while the light horse would initially form seven brigades (later eight). The field artillery would be <b>organised</b> <b>into</b> 14 brigades, while eight of the field batteries would {{be attached to the}} light horse brigades, and the howitizer batteries would not be brigaded. A small permanent force of 3,200 men would operate in support. The new scheme also entailed reorganisation of the military districts, with the 1st Military District based on Queensland, the 2nd on New South Wales, the 3rd on Victoria, the 4th on South Australia, the 5th on Western Australia and the 6th on Tasmania. The Northern Territory and New Guinea were initially unalloted, but were later incorporated into the 1st Military District.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the platform economy, industrial relations and social dialogue, as portrayed in the literature. It provides strong evidence that workers in the platform economy are <b>organising</b> <b>into</b> new employee associations (unions) and are also being brought into existing employees associations. None of the evidence surveyed indicates that platforms are <b>organising</b> <b>into</b> employer associations or being incorporated into existing employer associations. Anecdotal evidence suggests that actors in the platform economy are engaging in tripartite dialogue. The authors conclude that i) no overarching framework exists for governing or facilitating social dialogue between the parties involved in the platform economy, and ii) even if the existing framework is applied to parties in the platform economy, it offers a poor fit due to differences between platform workers and employees, and platforms and employers...|$|R
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of corporate}} enterprises became {{common in the}} 11th century. Almost all arts and crafts were <b>organised</b> <b>into</b> guilds and work was done on a corporate basis; records do not mention individual artists, sculptors and craftsman. Only in the regions ruled by the Hoysala did individual sculptors etched their names below their creations.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{transfer}} of forces in March 1901, further progress was slow as administrative and legislative instruments {{took time to}} develop. Indeed, {{it was not until}} 1 March 1904 that the Defence Act 1903 was proclaimed, providing the Commonwealth Military Forces a statutory framework within which they could operate. Amidst a background of political manoeuvring and personal agendas, the military forces were eventually reorganised into a more or less unified command structure. As a part of this, state-based mounted units were reformed into light horse regiments, supplemented by the transfer of men from a number of superfluous infantry units, while the remaining infantry were <b>organised</b> <b>into</b> battalions of the Australian Infantry Regiment and engineers and artillery were <b>organised</b> <b>into</b> field companies and garrison artillery batteries. Due to the provisions of the Defence Act which did not provide {{for the establishment of a}} regular infantry force, the notion that the Commonwealth Military Forces would be largely based on a part-time militia was set out in legislation.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had a nominal strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks. Larger than a conventional infantry company, it was <b>organised</b> <b>into</b> three platoons, each of three sections, each of which contained two subsections. It had considerable firepower. Each subsection had a Bren light machine gun. The gunner's two assistants carried rifles and extra 30-round Bren magazines. A sniper also carried a rifle, as did one man equipped with rifle grenades. The remaining four or five men carried Owen submachine guns. Each platoon also had a section of 2-inch mortars.|$|E

5|$|During Albin's episcopate, the {{incorporation}} of the Céli Dé ("vassal of God") into the cathedral chapter was probably brought near to completion. The Céli Dé were the Scottish monks who formed {{the base of the}} pre-Reform, pre-13th century monastery of Brechin before it was <b>organised</b> <b>into</b> a bishopric in the 12th century. A bull of Pope Innocent IV of 18 February 1250 stated that: These Céli Dé had been proclaimed as part of the secular cathedral by an act of Bishop Gregory, Albin's predecessor.|$|E

However no Northern Irish athletes took part in the Winter Paralympics for either team until 2010 in Vancouver.

No Japanese opposition was encountered initially, allowing the Chindits to cross the Chindwin River and advance into Burma unimpeded.|$|E
