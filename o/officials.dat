5|$|After {{students}} {{passed the}} often difficult, bureaucratic, and heavily demanding Imperial Exams, as they became <b>officials,</b> {{they did not}} always {{see eye to eye}} with others that had passed the same examination. Even though they were fully-fledged graduates ready for government service, there was always the factor of competition with other <b>officials.</b> Promotion to a higher post, higher salary, additional honors, and selection for choice assignment responsibilities were often uncertain, as young new <b>officials</b> often needed higher-ranking <b>officials</b> to recommend them for service. Once an official would rise to the upper echelons of central administration based in the capital, they would often compete with others over influence of the emperor's official adoption of state policies. <b>Officials</b> with different opinions on how to approach administrative affairs often sought out other <b>officials</b> for support, leading to pacts of rivaling <b>officials</b> lining up political allies at court to sway the emperor against the faction they disagreed with.|$|E

5|$|Colorado held several {{meetings}} to convince reluctant Utah <b>officials</b> they {{would benefit from}} a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah <b>officials</b> expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link {{would be difficult to}} build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado <b>officials</b> persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using the corridors of US40, US6 and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US50/US285/US24. In March 1955, Colorado <b>officials</b> succeeded in convincing Utah <b>officials</b> with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to the U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish Fork, Utah, linking the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas.|$|E
