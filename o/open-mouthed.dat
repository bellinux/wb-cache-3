5|$|With prey often {{scarce in}} its oceanic environment, the silky shark is a swift, inquisitive, and {{persistent}} hunter. It feeds mainly on bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and has been}} known to drive them into compacted schools before launching <b>open-mouthed,</b> slashing attacks. This species often trails schools of tuna, a favored prey. Its sense of hearing is extremely acute, allowing it to localize the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The silky shark is viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. Significant geographical variation is seen in its life history details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the Gulf of Mexico, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the outer continental shelf, growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.|$|E

25|$|A 9th or 10th century Gosforth Cross in Cumbria, England {{depicts a}} figure holding a horn and a sword {{standing}} defiantly before two <b>open-mouthed</b> beasts. This figure has been oft theorized as depicting Heimdallr with Gjallarhorn.|$|E
25|$|The {{common name}} {{alludes to the}} {{supposed}} ability these snakes have to launch themselves at an attacker during a strike, thereby bridging a distance that is {{equal to or greater}} than the length of the body. Mehrtens (1987) states that they live up to their name, striking at their assailants with such force that they actually leave the ground. Campbell and Lamar (2004), on the other hand, describe this as greatly exaggerated, saying that actually these snakes are only able to strike about half of their own body length. In addition, they describe them as slow moving and non-aggressive. However, when provoked all species will put on a rather dramatic <b>open-mouthed</b> threat display.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that Eakins first saw Cook perform at the Art Students League of Philadelphia on February 22, 1889, and was inspired to paint The Concert Singer after seeing a photograph of Jules Massenet at an organ, with his wife <b>open-mouthed,</b> singing. Though anonymous female (and angel) singers were often shown with their mouths open in medieval and Renaissance art—as well as in later works such as Degas's Singer with a Glove, 1878—named singing artists were nearly always painted and photographed with their mouths closed at this period. So, like many Eakins portraits, The Concert Singer had an element of daring in its composition, although the mouth is not shown fully open.|$|E
500|$|Some {{complain}} that the sculpture does not depict Jordan's well-known <b>open-mouthed</b> tongue wag. Chicago Tribune art critic Alan G. Artner says the inscription at the base that reads [...] "The best there ever was. The best there ever will be." [...] refers only to the subject and not the sculpture. [...] Following the Bulls' second three-peat after Jordan's return, the statue became a sports mecca for fans to gather and take photographs. ESPN The Magazine listed the sculpture {{as one of the}} ten greatest sports photo opportunities in 1998.|$|E
500|$|Actress Georgia Taylor {{was cast}} as Toyah {{and the role}} marked her acting debut. Taylor was {{studying}} for her A-levels when she originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall. She was unsuccessful, so she then auditioned for Toyah and won the role. Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I just sat there <b>open-mouthed,</b> hugging my best friend. I could barely believe it. It is all very different than being on stage – it's not quite so intense because your audience isn't {{right there in front}} of you. But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time." [...] At the time of her casting, Taylor was two years older than the character she portrayed.|$|E
500|$|Although Fischer {{had ended}} his formal {{education}} at age 16, {{dropping out of}} Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals. According to Latvian chess master Alexander Koblencs, even he and Tal could not match the commitment that Fischer had made to chess. Recalling a conversation from the tournament: Tell me, Bobby,' Tal continued, 'what {{do you think of}} the playing style of Larissa Volpert?' 'She's too cautious. But you have another girl, Dmitrieva. Her games do appeal to me!' Here we were left literally <b>open-mouthed</b> in astonishment. Misha and I have looked at thousands of games, but it never even occurred to us to study the games of our women players. How could we find the time for this?! Yet Bobby, it turns out, had found the time! ...|$|E
500|$|The {{silky shark}} is an {{opportunistic}} predator, feeding mainly on bony fishes from {{all levels of}} the water column, including tuna, mackerel, sardines, mullets, groupers, snappers, mackerel scads, sea chubs, sea catfish, eels, lanternfishes, filefishes, triggerfishes, and porcupinefishes. It may also take squid, paper nautilus, and swimming crabs, and fossil evidence indicates it scavenged on whale carcasses. Good feeding opportunities can draw silky sharks in large numbers; one such feeding aggregation in the Pacific has been documented [...] "herding" [...] a school of small fishes into a compact mass (a bait ball) and trapping it against the surface, whereupon the sharks consumed the entire school. When attacking tightly packed fish, silky sharks charge through the ball and slash <b>open-mouthed,</b> catching the prey fish at the corners of their jaws. Although multiple individuals may feed at once, each launches its attack independently.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "hunch" [...] threat {{display of}} the grey reef shark is the most {{pronounced}} and well-known agonistic display (a display directed towards competitors or threats) of any shark. Investigations of this behavior have {{been focused on the}} reaction of sharks to approaching divers, some of which have culminated in attacks. The display consists of the shark raising its snout, dropping its pectoral fins, arching its back, and curving its body laterally. While holding this posture, the shark swims with a stiff, exaggerated side-to-side motion, sometimes combined with rolls or figure-8 loops. The intensity of the display increases if the shark is more closely approached or if obstacles are blocking its escape routes, such as landmarks or other sharks. If the diver persists, the shark will either retreat or launch a rapid <b>open-mouthed</b> attack, slashing with its upper teeth.|$|E
500|$|The Wembley Ware {{range of}} [...] "fancy ware" [...] was {{produced}} between 1945 and 1961 by HL Brisbane and Wunderlich Ltd/Bristile in Subiaco. The Wembley Ware range typified {{the spirit of}} post-war buoyancy in Western Australia during the 1950s, with art ceramics specifically for a local market using emblems of local Westralian identity. The majority of the works were decorative rather than functional to escape high taxes on purely decorative ceramics at this time and exploited highly coloured glazes and overtly Australian content in their designs. The majority of Wembley Ware was created with an apparent intended purpose such as vases, ashtrays or lamps, but these were usually superfluous to the designs. Some of the most sought-after and eccentric designs included the <b>open-mouthed</b> dhufish vase and black swan ashtray. A variety of swan-shaped ashtrays and vases were produced {{in a range of}} sizes, colours and glazes.|$|E
500|$|He holds court {{before a}} circle of {{crouched}} and mostly terrified women, accepted by art historians as a coven of witches. Some bow their heads in fear, others look towards him in <b>open-mouthed</b> and rapt awe. Describing the women, art historian Brian McQuade writes that the [...] "sub-humanity of the gathered group is underlined by their bestial features and moronic stares". Satan's absolute power over the women {{has been compared to}} that of the king in Goya's 1815 The Junta of the Philippines, where authority is gained not from respect or personal charisma, but through fear and domination. The women are a mixture of old and young, and have similar twisted features; all but one are scowling, nervous and obsequious. Goya's use of tone to create atmosphere is reminiscent of both Velázquez and Jusepe de Ribera. The latter was an admirer of Caravaggio and utilised tenebrism and chiaroscuro. Goya learned from these sources, and from Rembrandt, some of whose prints he owned.|$|E
500|$|The PC port {{was also}} well-received. Lee Buchanan of PC Gamer US praised [...] "the {{spectacular}} visuals that bring to life the most jarring collisions I've {{seen on a}} computer", and he noted that [...] " [...] damage is depicted beautifully". Like Lucas, he wrote that the player [...] "can't just mindlessly smash into other cars; this is thinking man's destruction". Although he found the game too easy [...] "even at the toughest difficulty level", he found {{this to be a}} minor issue that did not detract from the experience. He considered the game's online play to be a high point, and he finished, [...] "Destruction Derby is a blast, and a welcome change of pace from high-end driving simulations." [...] Peter Olafson of Computer Gaming World called the game [...] "a great simulation" [...] of demolition derbies, and he wrote that the wrecks are [...] "convulsive and realistic". He believed that the game [...] "has never-before-seen quality that will instantly make it a showpiece game to demonstrate to <b>open-mouthed</b> friends and relatives", and he considered the car damage to be [...] "especially marvelous—and unprecedented for this sort of game". However, he found that its [...] "useful life span is surprisingly short" [...] and he hoped for a track editor in its sequel. He summarised, [...] "Despite its limitations, this is a great game, but it has a lot more potential." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that while the game is a straight port of the PlayStation version, it is an impeccably accurate one. He applauded the authentic modelling of vehicle crashes, multiple modes, smoothness of gameplay, and inclusion of both network and modem options, and found the game's only downside is that the camera zooms out so little that {{it can be difficult to}} see nearby cars.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} by another study using {{finite element analysis}} on an Allosaurus skull. According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 2,148N, less than the values for alligators (13,000N), lions (4,167N), and leopards (2,268N), but the skull could withstand nearly 55,500N of vertical force against the tooth row. The authors suggested that Allosaurus used its skull like a hatchet against prey, attacking <b>open-mouthed,</b> slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without splintering bones, unlike Tyrannosaurus, which {{is thought to have}} been capable of damaging bones. They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods. Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey. The original authors noted that Allosaurus itself has no modern equivalent, that the tooth row is well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the palate and lessen stress. Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like Allosaurus were [...] "flesh grazers" [...] which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright. This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later. An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea. This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey. Studies done by Stephen Lautenschager et al. from the University of Bristol also indicate Allosaurus could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force. When compared with Tyrannosaurus and the therizinosaurid Erlikosaurus in the same study, it was found that Allosaurus had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 79 degree angle. The findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs, like modern carnivores, had wider jaw gapes than herbivores.|$|E

2500|$|Film and {{television}} director Richard Lester recalls that the television series A Show Called Fred was broadcast live. [...] "I've seen very {{few moments of}} genius in my life but I witnessed one with Spike after the first show. He had brought around a silent cartoon" [...] and asked Lester if his P.A. took shorthand. [...] "She said she did. 'Good, this needs a commentary.' It was a ten-minute cartoon and Spike could have seen it only once, if that. He ad-libbed the commentary for {{it and it was}} perfect. I was <b>open-mouthed</b> at the raw comedy creation in front of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In modern Persian, {{the word}} mate depicts {{a person who}} is frozen, <b>open-mouthed,</b> staring, {{confused}} and unresponsive. [...] The words stupefied or stunned bear close correlation. [...] So a possible alternative would be to interpret mate as unable to respond. [...] A king is mate (shah-mate) then means, a king is unable to respond which would correspond to there being no response that a player's king can make to their opponent's final move. [...] This interpretation is much closer to the original intent of the game being not to kill a king but to leave him with no viable response other than surrender which, better matches the origin story detailed in the Shahnameh.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990 Hirst, {{along with}} his friend Carl Freedman and Billee Sellman, curated two enterprising [...] "warehouse" [...] shows, Modern Medicine and Gambler, in a Bermondsey former Peek Freans biscuit factory they {{designated}} [...] "Building One". Saatchi arrived at the second show in a green Rolls Royce and, according to Freedman, stood <b>open-mouthed</b> with astonishment in front of (and then bought) Hirst's first major [...] "animal" [...] installation, A Thousand Years, consisting of a large glass case containing maggots and flies feeding on a rotting cow's head. They also staged Michael Landy's Market. At this time, Hirst said, [...] "I can’t wait {{to get into a}} position to make really bad art and get away with it. At the moment if I did certain things people would look at it, consider it and then say 'f off'. But after a while {{you can get away with}} things." ...|$|E
