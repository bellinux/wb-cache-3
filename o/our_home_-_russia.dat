5000|$|<b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> <b>-</b> <b>Russia</b> {{was founded}} in 1995 by then Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. It was a liberal, centrist {{political}} movement, founded {{for the purpose of}} rallying more technocratic-reformist (right-wing) government supporters. At the time of its founding, Chernomyrdin had the backing of Russian president Boris Yeltsin along with numerous large financial institutions such as Association of Russian Banks, and major companies such as Gazprom, of which he was formerly the chairman. The movement attracted the sympathies and interests of many prominent members of the ruling elite of Russia, and NDR was thus nicknamed [...] "the party of power". It was also known as the party of the Oligarchs, the position previously identified with another political party, Russia's Choice. Two other parties were interested in cooperating with NDR after its foundation: parts of the Agrarian Party of Russia and Democratic Choice of Russia. Together their platform would promote [...] "freedom, property, and legality", and would favor such policies as reducing the state's role in the economy, support for small businesses, privatization of agriculture, and military cutbacks. However, after Chernomyrdin's candidacy for a second term as Prime Minister was in 1998 rejected by the Duma, <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> <b>-</b> <b>Russia</b> declined the other parties' bid for cooperation. Although it was critical of the war in Chechnya, Viktor Chernomyrdin and NDR {{played a central role in}} supporting Yeltsin in his 1996 bid for re-election as President of the Russian Federation. [...] "To sum up why <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> <b>-</b> <b>Russia</b> is for Yeltsin, I can say only one thing--because we are for reforms, for the constitution of Russia, for peace in Chechnya, for a normal life in Russia," [...] Chernomyrdin told Itar-Tass news agency in 1996.|$|E

50|$|Following his {{retirement}} in 1995, Rokhlin {{was elected to the}} Russian parliament Duma (as a member of a pro-Boris Yeltsin party <b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> <b>-</b> <b>Russia,</b> which he later quit). Rokhlin chaired Duma's Defense Committee until President Yeltsin went into a rare agreement with the Communist Party to strip him out of the post. In 1997, Rokhlin formed his own movement called In Defense of the Army, which blamed Yeltsin for the war in Chechnya and for low morale in the military, unsuccessfully seeking to organize the serving and retired servicemen into a political force that could force Yeltsin from office.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Alpha {{veterans}} became {{active in}} legitimate businesses (such as the private security company Alpha-B, co-founded by Col.

Gen. Karpukhin, who resigned from the service following the 1991 coup attempt, became chief of security to Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, after which he worked with private security companies in Moscow, and ran unsuccessfully for the Duma {{as a member of the}} Union of Patriots in 1995.|$|E

50|$|<b>Our</b> <b>Home</b> <b>-</b> <b>Russia</b> had weightier {{resources}} and soon acquired the nicknameof “party of power” for {{its reliance on}} elite political and economic officeholders. It was {{also referred to as}} “Our Home Is Gazprom” for its close ties toGazprom’s substantial financial resources. Most of the cabinet ministers joinedthe bloc, and a number of business leaders and regional political elites affiliatedwith it. However, almost no other parties entered it, and many SMD candidateswho had initially affiliated with the party soon left it. One of the early partiesto enter the bloc, Sergei Shakhrai’s Party of Russian Unity and Accord, alsodeserted it in August. In the election, the OurHome Is Russia bloc took 10.1% of the vote, enough to form a faction in theDuma but not enough to serve as a dominant or pivotal force in parliament orin the regions. At its peak, the party claimed the membership of around onethird of Russia’s governors. However, both the center and regional elites madeonly ephemeral commitments to Our Home is Russia.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper set out {{to uncover}} the advice {{available}} to help people take effective action within <b>our</b> <b>home</b> to improve mental health. The literature and professions are virtually silent on the issue. The professional advice is often the opposite suggesting we {{should get out of}} <b>our</b> <b>homes</b> <b>-</b> go for a walk, exercise, play sport, go to the cinema, meet friends, socialise and don’t isolate yourself. There is nary any advice about {{what we can do to}} <b>our</b> <b>homes</b> to help maintain our mental health. <b>Our</b> <b>home</b> <b>-</b> the physical space where we spend large amounts of energy and time is largely an empty shell for the mental health industry. The message currently presented appears to be "remember to close the door as you leave … to get better". Safe and secure housing is a fundamental pillar of an inclusive and productive society. Yet we don 2 ̆ 7 t know for sure what safe, secure, or good housing looks like. Approach: This paper will begin that dialogue with a comprehensive literature review. The approach adopted to investigate this literature focussed on thinking about what a policy official might experience if they were tasked to develop guidance on steps to improve housings’ impact on mental health. Such an individual would not necessarily be aware of the extent of the literature, or of academic disciplines. This approach both made the literature review problematic, but also in some ways also produces a useful insight. Key findings: The paper concludes that there are three issues that should shape future research: first is the need for transdisciplinary translational research; second is to focus initially on the needs of the resident before the bricks and mortar; third is to endeavour to include the social pillar of sustainable development alongside the economic and environmental. Originality: This paper is original as it seeks to start a conversation about what self-help measures people can adopt within their homes to protect or enhance their mental wellbein...|$|R

Although this concept only has consolidated in a recent period, humankind has been worried, more or less consciously, with the care of its body, during the development of civilization. The changes occurred in the area of personal hygiene suffered a long journey, regarding to the amendment of hygienic habits and the evolution of architectural spaces used for this purpose. Today, hygiene and body care are increasingly linked to an individual and technical space in <b>our</b> <b>homes</b> <b>-</b> the bathroom - as well as the equipments that fill in it. During a long period of time, rudimentary body care were linked to elementary spaces, even primitive, with no connection to equipment or any objects. Only later, with the changing times, the humankind felt the need to create and introduce new artifacts, with greater or lesser complexity, to suppress their basic needs in order to improve his lifestyle and well-being. With the privatization and progressive specification of the divisions of the house, a sense of intimacy, emerged increasingly, and a whole range of innovative materials has invaded our daily lives. Now, we have a technical space in our houses, as the objects and equipment that allow us to have rituals of personal hygiene.

40|$|The University of Texas at El Paso’s field-based {{program of}} studies for future {{teachers}} provides opportunities for powerful learning through a dialectical union of reflection and action. Methods courses in academic disciplines are linked with seminars and coursework on community partnerships, dual language education and culturally responsive education. This article illustrates {{the processes of}} planning, implementation and evaluation of this approach, highlighting the impacts of forging connections among schools, communities and university personnel to improve education on the U. S. /Mexico border and in communities with culturally/linguistically diverse student populations. Parents, students and future teachers interact in bilingual workshops that center on pupil achievement and conceptually correct science education. Preliminary outcomes indicate that two-way dual language (TWDL) bilingual programs (i. e., validating native language literacy along with English language acquisition) with a strong parental engagement component provide a strong framework for teaching/learning that can help improve educational outcomes for ELL/immigrant children and deepen future teachers’ skills and knowledge. Focusing on academic enrichment for all students, these field-based experiences enable future teachers to learn strategies that integrate students’ and families’ linguistic and cultural experiences {{as a resource for}} learning.
