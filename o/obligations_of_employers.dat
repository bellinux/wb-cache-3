This study explored the effects of casual employment on a group of university students using the psychological contract as an interpretative framework. Qualitative data indicated that while these employees adopted a transactional work orientation, they expressed concern over the relational <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>employers.</b> These findings were substantiated with quantitative research, which revealed low job satisfaction and problems with the psychological contract. Although respondents thought that the transactional dimension was satisfied, the relational contract remained mostly unfulfilled. In particular they felt exploited and treated less fairly than fulltime employees. This suggests management should {{pay more attention to the}} relational needs of all their employees...|$|E

30|$|The {{introduction}} of unemployment insurance savings accounts (UISA) in October 2002 changed labor market conditions for formal private sector workers in Chile. UISA are individual savings accounts to which employer and employee {{transfer a share}} of the worker’s salary for possible unemployment spells. Before the introduction, unemployment protection was practically limited to severance pay in case of job termination due to economic necessities of the firm. Additionally, high opportunity costs were involved in job change, and employers had to deal with rigid labor market regulations. After the {{introduction of}} UISA, the access to and amount of benefits transferred to workers in case of unemployment or inactivity increased, and opportunity costs of workers changing employment decreased, while ad-hoc <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>employers</b> to lay off workforce were reduced.|$|E

40|$|Accounting for {{pensions}} {{has been}} a problem for standard setters for over 30 years. Early attempts to develop accounting standards were based on a cost orientation and reflected funding considerations. More recently, a balance sheet focus has led to issues over identification and measurement of pension liabilities and assets. Accounting standards that permit enterprises to ignore, spread or segregate elements of pension cost, or to create artificial cost measures, are open to criticism and are gradually disappearing. The aim of a principle-based pension accounting will be to ‘tell it as it is’, fairly reflecting the rights and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>employers,</b> employees and funding vehicles. Moreover, complex pension arrangements cannot be reported simplistically – if users wish to minimise surprises relating to pensions, then enterprises must disclose a rich set of information...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} note {{is based}} on a study carried out in 2007 for the Victorian Office of the Workplace Rights Advocate, updated to reflect more recent developments including the passage of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth). The note analyses how the regulation of economic dismissals under Australian law compares with Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. The six countries&# 039; laws are &# 039;benchmarked&# 039; against the following criteria: coverage of unfair dismissal protection; tests for determining the fairness of economic dismissals; procedural fairness requirements; employee rights to severance payments; and notice, information and consultation <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>employers.</b> The note finds that under the Coalition Government&# 039;s Work Choices legislation, Australia provided employees with weaker protection against economic dismissals than all of the other countries examined, except for the USA. However, the Labor Government&# 039;s changes to economic dismissals regulation mean that Australian law now ranks towards the stronger end of the spectrum of protection...|$|E
40|$|While {{technology}} has significantly increased productivity and efficiency in the workplace, concerns about workplace privacy {{have never been}} greater. Whereas in the past surveillance or monitoring of employees normally involved some type of physical observation, new technologies have provided employers with an unprecedented ability to observe {{almost every aspect of}} an employee’s work. In addition, given the changing nature of the workplace itself, it is possible in some cases for employers to monitor workers’ activities outside of the workplace. The difficult issue of balancing <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>employers</b> and their right to regulate the use of facilities in the workplace against an employee’s expectation of privacy in the workplace is considered in this paper. Underlying policy considerations are examined before an analysis of the existing legislative and common law protections in Australia. It will be argued that the existing law is not adequate and changes should be made to the law to ensure an appropriate level of protection for both parties in the employment relationship.

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} Bachelor Thesis comprehensively illustrates the status and representation of persons with disabilities (PWD) on the current labour market in the Czech Republic. In a general manner, the Thesis looks at the employment policy as well; especially its legislative basis in the legal framework of the Czech Republic and selected EU countries. Furthermore, the legal <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>employers</b> of PWD and the possibilities of fulfilling the mandatory share of PWD employment are stated. Findings of two qualitative employment studies are presented showing that PWD enter the labour market equipped with specialized competencies, which {{they are willing to}} complete by retraining programmes in case of need. The employers perceive the employment of PWD mainly as a financial profit, granted to them by the state; and the legislative conditions are a sufficient incentive for them. The questionnaire survey pointed out that the weakness in the employment of PWD is the lack of part-time jobs, which are highly demanded among them. Therefore the Thesis presents a solution, which could be the creation of shared work positions...|$|E
