25|$|Emerson Radio and Phonograph paid $6 {{million to}} {{purchase}} the consumer products division of DuMont Laboratories in 1958. With this acquisition, a higher-priced line of television sets, phonographs and high-fidelity and stereo instruments, along with the DuMont trademark was added to Emerson's products. However, by this time, the US television market was saturated, and many customers who were in need of another set were waiting for color television instead <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> replacement. Sales fell from $87.4 million in fiscal 1955 to $73.9 million in fiscal 1956, when the company earned only $84,852.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s {{private housing}} was {{developed}} in Docklands which with some minor exceptions {{were the first to}} be built in the area. Soon many people from outside the area saw the opportunity <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> house close to the city at what appeared to be cheap prices. On many of the developments, local council tenants were given first opportunities to buy at discounted prices, but this led to a number of abuses. Then again in the late 1990s, London had a huge house-price boom. By encouraging the development of attractive waterside apartments along the River Thames and the old docks, the LDDC brought new, middle-class residents into the area, closely followed by shops, restaurants and bars.|$|E
25|$|However, {{one of the}} {{sticking}} points was {{the lack}} of reliability from the railmotor fleet; by mid 1982 none of the DRC railcars were in good condition, and the DERM fleet was only achieving 38% availability; this required 'scratch' sets of between 2 and 4 older wooden carriages hauled by locomotives as replacements. VicRail looked into the costs <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> new fleet of railmotors and found the cost for a 2-carriage airconditioned railmotor to be in the range of $1.6-2.5million each. An alternative, cheaper proposal was to rebuild the DRC's electrical systems, and to replace other railmotor rosters with T class locomotives and refurbished Harris carriages. The proposed consist at the time was H-H-T-H-H, with the outer H carriages fitted with driving controls and all cars fitted with multiple-unit cabling.|$|E

25|$|Likewise, {{while the}} {{preservation}} of historic shophouses have suffered substantially in heavily developed states like Kuala Lumpur, Johor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan and Selangor, shophouses in Penang and Malacca (which state capitals, George Town and Malacca Town, have been gazetted as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2008) received more care and attention due to emerging historical preservation movements in both states, experiencing similar levels of rejuvenations as in Singapore. However, the gentrification of both cities has led to older tenants of shophouses driven out by the rising costs of renting or buying properties within historical districts. In 2012, the cost <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> pre-World War II shophouse in George Town reached RM2,000 per square foot (US$660), equivalent {{to the price of}} the most expensive Kuala Lumpur city centre condominium units.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Bracken became {{close to}} Lord Camrose, the {{proprietor}} since 1919 of the Financial Times. The two privately agreed {{to raise their}} advertising rates to protect their finances, and eventually agreed that the other would have first refusal if one wanted to sell. Towards {{the end of the}} war, Camrose decided to sell the Financial Times, and arrangements for a merger were put in place. The financial deal was a complex one: the Financial News raised the cost <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> controlling interest in the Financial Times by selling its own offices and investments, and by a share issue, but could only make up the full amount by simultaneously selling to the Financial Times the copyright and goodwill of the Financial News. Camrose himself bought some Financial News shares to help the deal along.|$|E

In a solo trial prior to the 1929 English Greyhound Derby on 25 July, Mick broke the track record, reducing his odds from an initial 25–1 to becoming the 4–7 favorite to win {{by the time of}} the final, despite still being new off the board from Ireland. He was housed at the kennels of Paddy McEllistrim for the duration of the Derby. In the first round, Mick pulled away down the back straight, beating Captured Half by eight lengths and setting a time of 29.82, a new world record over that length. Father Browne sold Mick for £800, plus any prize money that the dog would win on the night, which at the time was more than the cost <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> house in nearby Shepherd's Bush. By 8:45pm, when the final took place, some 40,000 spectators were in the ground. The lineup was four dogs; in trap one was Beadsman at 20–1; trap two was Palatinus at 3–1; trap three was Entomb at 9–2, and finally Mick the Miller in trap four, wearing the black jacket. Palatinus made the best start, at the first bend both Mick and Entomb attempted to move inside to the rail, but Beadsman collided with both of them, sending all three dogs sprawling. The no–race klaxon went off, and the race had to be restarted. None of the dogs was allowed to leave the track with until the race was re–run at 9:15pm, the only comfort given to Mick on a particularly hot summer's evening was a handkerchief soaked in cold water.|$|E

500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of reborn customers are older women. The process <b>of</b> <b>buying</b> <b>a</b> reborn {{can be done to}} simulate an adoption process, rather than a prosaic sale of a product. As part of this, the dolls often come with fake birth certificates or adoption certificates. Many women collect reborns as they would a non-reborn doll, whilst others purchase them to fill a void of a lost child and may treat reborns as living babies. Media features and public receptions have used such adjectives as [...] "creepy" [...] to describe the reborns. This {{can be explained by the}} uncanny valley hypothesis. This states that as objects become more lifelike they gain an increasing empathetic response, until a certain point at which the response changes to repulsion. Department stores have refused to stock the dolls because of this reaction, claiming they are too lifelike.|$|E
