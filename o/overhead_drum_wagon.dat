5000|$|The {{tradition}} {{dates from}} the 1866 Battle of Königgrätz, where troops of the Prussian 43rd Infantry Regiment ("Duke Karl of Mecklenburg-Strelitz") overran the <b>drum</b> <b>wagon</b> of the Austrian 77th Infantry Regiment ("Karl Salvator of Tuscany"), whose dog, a Saint Bernard named [...] "Sultan", had been shot. The East Prussian soldiers took the <b>drum</b> <b>wagon</b> back on their victorious return to Königsberg, where it received much attention. There dogs {{were assigned to the}} regiment. As part of the musical corps, the dogs, named either [...] "Sultan" [...] or [...] "Pasha" [...] in honor of their Austrian predecessor, participated in parades and the procession of the castle guard until after the First World War.|$|R

Such a large number of toys were made in Winchendon that it became known as Toy Town.|$|R
50|$|Morrow {{appeared}} in {{such films as}} The Price of Fear, The Wrong Man and It Happened in Athens, and in such television series as Star Trek, Gunsmoke, Jefferson <b>Drum,</b> <b>Wagon</b> Train, The Farmer's Daughter, Hazel, and The Perry Como Show and in the Broadway play Red Gloves. On the ABC prime-time soap opera Peyton Place, she {{appeared in}} nineteen episodes from 1965 to 1966 as Mrs. Chernak, the Harrington family housekeeper.|$|R
5000|$|Minutemen, {{seeking to}} be as {{economical}} as possible in recording their first album, recorded The Punch Line during one late-night session (when studio time was the cheapest), recorded on previously used tape, and recorded the songs exactly in {{the order in which}} they appeared on the record. Overdubs were minimal if anything; Hurley's vocal on [...] "Ruins" [...] was actually cut during the basic track stages and picked up by the <b>overhead</b> <b>drum</b> mics.|$|R
5000|$|Drummer Kenny Buttrey {{has said}} that he had a {{difficult}} time coming up with a drum part for the song. Dylan had suggested bongos, while producer Bob Johnson said cowbells. In order to [...] "show them how bad their ideas were", Buttrey used both instruments together. Kristofferson, who was working as a janitor in the studio at the time, was enlisted to hold the bongos in one hand and the cowbell in the other. Buttrey moved the sole <b>overhead</b> <b>drum</b> mic over to these new instruments. When he switches back to the drums for the choruses the drumset sounds distant due to not being directly mic'd. The take heard on the album is the first take and is one of Buttrey's own favorite performances.|$|R
5000|$|D19c - dynamic {{cardioid}} mic. Often used by Norman Smith and Geoff Emerick as <b>drum</b> <b>overheads</b> on Ringo Starr's drums on Beatles recording sessions (1964-1967) ...|$|R
5000|$|In a 1994 interview, Steve Albini {{said that}} [...] "if he owned one mic, {{this would be}} it". Albini has also commented that [...] "really nothing beats them as an <b>overhead</b> on a <b>drum</b> kit".|$|R
5000|$|Launched in 1973, the P76 was nicknamed [...] "the wedge", {{on account}} of its shape, with a large boot, able to easily hold a 44 gallon <b>drum.</b> Although station <b>wagon</b> and [...] "Force 7" [...] coupé {{versions}} were designed, these never went into mass production.|$|R
5|$|Though {{sometimes}} productive, no {{nineteenth century}} iron mine on the Brendon Hills was profitable and the venture {{as a whole}} was financially ruinous. Furthermore, the industry {{as a whole was}} prone to boom and bust, with a sharp decline from the early 1880s. The railway continued in operation after the end of mining, although it had lost its primary traffic. A second-hand Robey semi-portable steam engine was installed {{at the head of the}} incline to power the <b>drums,</b> hauling <b>wagons</b> up in the absence of a regular downhill flow.|$|R
50|$|In the UK, a {{self-acting}} incline {{is one in}} which the loaded wagons going down pull, via a cable and <b>drum,</b> the empty <b>wagons</b> going up. There might be two separate tracks, or a single track with a passing loop. This system was widely used on slate railways in Wales.|$|R
500|$|The {{reaction}} {{requires a}} catalyst. [...] As introduced by Deacon, early catalysts {{were based on}} copper. [...] Commercial processes, such as the Mitsui MT-Chlorine Process, have switched to chromium and ruthenium-based catalysts. The chlorine produced is available in cylinders from sizes ranging from 450g to 70kg, as well as <b>drums</b> (865kg), tank <b>wagons</b> (15tonnes on roads; 27–90tonnes by rail), and barges (600–1200tonnes).|$|R
5000|$|Other <b>drum</b> <b>overhead</b> {{positions}} {{include the}} Recorderman Technique (where {{the distance between}} both microphones and the snare drum is equal, as is the distance between both microphones and the bass drum) and Glyn Johns' method (where one [...] "overhead" [...] is placed to the drummer's right, aiming across the floor tom to {{the centre of the}} kit).|$|R
5000|$|In {{recording}} environments, the 4038 {{is often}} used as <b>drum</b> <b>overheads</b> and on brass instruments. The microphone became a favourite of British recording engineers in the 1950s and 60s, but did not receive widespread use in the United States. The microphone was described as recording sounds [...] "bigger thanlife" [...] - [...] such as drums or amplified guitars [...] - [...] some Beatles and Led Zeppelin recordings featured 4038s as overhead microphones on the drum kit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{architect}} of the modern church was the Italian Antonio Barluzzi. The church {{is set in a}} cruciform pattern and stands over the east end of the older churches. [...] "Its walls are almost hermetically sealed and windowless. The dome is solidly incorporated into octagonal <b>drum</b> <b>overhead.</b> All this suggests a subterranean vault, lonely as a grave... The soaring higher elements, crowned by the dome with its flood of light, suggests the joy of intense hope and optimism.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{multiple}} arrangements for <b>drum</b> <b>overheads,</b> {{which are often}} based on personal preference of the musician, engineer, or producer. These include [...] "A-B" [...] spaced pairs (where two directional microphones are suspended above {{the left and right}} clusters of cymbals), [...] "X-Y" [...] coincident pairs, where the two directional microphones are centred on the drum kit with their capsule are very close without touching, and angled across each other at 90°. Coincident placement give a wider stereo image than spaced pairs, and some engineers prefer it for this reason.|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} on what microphone technique {{to use in}} recording situations is commonly based on technical characteristics of the technique and there is often little time to experiment. This {{is a problem for}} many engineers since the quality of the recorded source material has become the biggest factor of sound quality and the microphone technique used has a big influence on the attributes of the reproduced sound. In this study the most commonly used stereo microphone techniques used in the industry were compared. A group of trained engineers rated sonic attributes rather than what they know about the stereo techniques, with the aim of predicting the most suited technique for use in <b>drum</b> <b>overhead</b> applications in the musical genres of Funk, Pop/Rock and Jazz. The stimuli used for the test was simultaneous recordings of X/Y, Blumlein, ORTF and A/B microphone setups in the three genres, both upbeat and downbeat. Analysis of the results provides a guide in making the {{decision on}} what stereo technique to use for <b>drum</b> <b>overhead</b> recordings in different musical genres. The results show that A/B is the most popular stereo technique overall and also seems to be the most all-round techniques. In some cases however, it is beneficial to use one of the other stereo techniques. X/Y seems to be the least suited stereo technique for use in this type of recording. The results show that not only the musical genre must be taken in to account when choosing stereo technique, tempo is also a factor to consider. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
50|$|Sessions were {{conducted}} {{at all three}} studio spaces at Ocean Way Recording, Hollywood {{over a period of}} about a year-and-a-half. Senior staff engineer Wesley Seidman worked with Wilson in the studio, who preferred tracking band performances on ProTools while using vintage equipment. Accordingly, a batch of new super-high-fidelity C0-100K Sanken microphones were brought out for sessions, being used for <b>drum</b> <b>overheads,</b> orchestra and horn rooms, a mandolin, and acoustic lap steel guitar. In August 2014, Wilson said that recording was done and that he had reached the album's mixing process. Some portions of the album were recorded or mixed at other California, Tennessee, and Illinois studios. On November 6, 2014, the album was reported finished. He later said that his wife Melinda Ledbetter contributed to the production.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, {{exterior}} sheetmetal for all large Chryslers was new, with concave side cove {{as a key}} design element. Interiors were {{updated with}} a new instrument panel, perfectly symmetrical in shape and featuring an inverted fan style speedometer. Chassis dimensions and the greenhouses for 4-door sedans and wagons carried over unchanged. A single Town & Country model {{in two or three}} seat versions was offered. The exterior and interior trim matched the Newport series, and featured a standard all vinyl notchback bench seat with folding center armrest. A new seating option was Chrysler’s 50/50 3-in-1 split bench seat, shared with the Newport Custom sedan. Standard and optional powertrains remained the same. Sales literature for 1967 showed front disc brakes as standard equipment on Town & Country, along with the requisite 15” wheels, 8.45x15 extra load tires, and restyled “disc brake” wheel covers. However, many ‘67 had 14” wheels and Newport wheel covers because they had <b>drum</b> brakes. These <b>wagons</b> wore size 8.85x14 tires.|$|R
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} February 2006, {{under the supervision}} of the 3D cinematographer Peter Anderson; two shows were filmed in Mexico City to capture medium shots during a practice run for the crew to learn the choreography of U2's performances. The crew captured additional medium shots using two camera setups at the two São Paulo concerts, and captured <b>overhead</b> footage of <b>drummer</b> Larry Mullen, Jr. using a single camera setup at the show in Santiago. During preparations for the Buenos Aires concerts, U2 performed a 10-song set without an audience, so that the crew could capture close-up footage using a wide-angle lens; doing so in-concert would have interfered with the show. Owens dubbed the session the [...] "phantom shoot". During the Buenos Aires shows, all nine camera setups were used, capturing shots of U2 from the B-stages. The Buenos Aires shoot was the largest of the project, requiring a crew of 140people.|$|R
50|$|The widely praised Opening Ceremony Directed by avant garde {{choreographer}} Dimitris Papaioannou and Produced by Jack Morton Worldwide led by Project Director David Zolkwer {{was held}} on 13 August 2004. It began with a twenty eight (the number of the Olympiads up to then) second countdown paced by the sounds of an amplified heartbeat. As the countdown was completed, fireworks rumbled and illuminated the skies <b>overhead.</b> After a <b>drum</b> corps and bouzouki players joined in an opening march, the video screen showed images of flight, crossing southwest from Athens over the Greek countryside to ancient Olympia. Then, a single drummer in the ancient stadium joined in a drum duet with a single drummer in the main stadium in Athens, joining the original ancient Olympic games with the modern ones in symbolism. At {{the end of the}} drum duet, a single flaming arrow was launched from the video screen (symbolically from ancient Olympia) and into the reflecting pool, which resulted in fire erupting {{in the middle of the}} stadium creating a burning image of the Olympic rings rising from the pool. The Opening Ceremony was a pageant of traditional Greek culture and history hearkening back to its mythological beginnings. The program began as a young Greek boy sailed into the stadium on a 'paper-ship' waving the host nation's flag to aethereal music by Hadjidakis and then a centaur appeared, followed by a gigantic head of a cycladic figurine which eventually broke into many pieces symbolising the Greek islands. Underneath the cycladic head was a Hellenistic representation of the human body, reflecting the concept and belief in perfection reflected in Greek art. A man was seen balancing on a hovering cube symbolising man's eternal 'split' between passion and reason followed by a couple of young lovers playfully chasing each other while the god Eros was hovering above them. There followed a very colourful float parade chronicling Greek history from the ancient Minoan civilization to modern times.|$|R
40|$|LectureDelayed coking is a {{refining}} process {{that consists of}} the upgrading of petroleum residues into lighter and more valuable hydrocarbon fractions by promoting thermal cracking on the residue stream. Petroleum coke is a by-product of this process and depending on its morphology {{it can be used}} as fuel for steam generation, cement calcination or as feed stock for the manufacturing of aluminum and steel. Delayed cokers are very complex systems and require a considerable amount of hardware such as fired heaters, coke drums, a main fractionator and a hydraulic decoking system. In a typical delayed coker petroleum residues are passed through fired heaters before they are charged, in an alternating fashion, into large drums as boiling product. In the drums some of this effluent thermally cracks into lighter fractions (vapors) and these are removed from the <b>drum</b> <b>overhead</b> and returned to the coker fractionator before they are sent to a gas plant for further refining. The heavier product that stays behind slowly forms into coke and it is allowed to fill the drum over time. This time is takes to do this is usually referred to as the coking cycle. Once the drum is full and the feed is switched to start filling an empty drum, a series of activities such as sludging, quenching and steam-outs are performed on the full drum prior to removing the ocke. Very high pressure water is used to cut this solid coke out and after some preparations this drum is empty and ready for a new coking cycle to begin again. As stated above, delayed coking is thus a combination of a continuous process through the fractionation tower and furnace and a batch process in the drums. As a result of this configuration the high pressure decoking pump only needs to operate a portion of the total cycle time. Regardless of its ?part-time? operation the water jet coke cutting pump is still a very important component of the hydraulic decoking system because it not only provides the required cutting pressure necessary to cut the coke but also contributes to the quality of coke removed and the duration fo the decoking cycle. Recent history shows that the majority of new hydraulic decoking installations use electric motor drived with fixed speed operation. The pump generally requires on operating speed to produce the necessary pressure to cut the coke and its flow, pressurization, and depressurization duties are controlled by a decoking control valve. During noncutting cycles operators typically shut off the motor to minimize power consumption of the system or they keep the motor running (rarely done), depressurize the line and operate this valve on bypass to recirculate the water through a holding tank until the coke cutting is resumed. Both operating alternatives have their disadvantages with regard reliability (the first) and energy consumption (the second). This paper explores the use of a hydrodynamic variable speed drive (HVSD) with an electric motor-driven pump as a way to increase the flexibility and reliability of the hydraulic decoking system. The HVSD or variable speed coupling (VSC) is able to seamlessly vary the speed of the pump and accomplish the following: Keep the motor running and operate the pump at minimum idle speed during noncutting cycles, avoiding periodic motor shutdowns and start ups; Eliminate the need for soft starter or special motor design considerations to handle periodic start ups; Reduce work and extend life of the decoking control valve by helping with depressurization duties during noncutting cycles and cutting tool mode shifting; Efficiently adjust cutting pressures depending on feed stock quality to avoid coke pulverization. This paper also describes the function of the variable speed coupling and how its unique design features are suited for the start up and intermittent operation of the water jet coke cutting pump. Field data and operator experience from two existing installations are collected and evaluated and the advantages of variable speed operation over fixed speed operation of the decoking pump are highlighted...|$|R
