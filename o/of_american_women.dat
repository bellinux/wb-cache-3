5|$|The most {{extensive}} early study of female homosexuality {{was provided by}} the Institute for Sex Research, who published an in-depth report of the sexual experiences <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> in 1953. More than 8,000 women were interviewed by Alfred Kinsey and the staff of the Institute for Sex Research in a book titled Sexual Behavior in the Human Female, popularly known as part of the Kinsey Report. The Kinsey Report's dispassionate discussion of homosexuality as a form of human sexual behavior was revolutionary. Up to this study, only physicians and psychiatrists studied sexual behavior, and almost always the results were interpreted with a moral view.|$|E

25|$|A new {{consciousness}} of the inequality <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> began sweeping the nation, starting with the 1963 publication of Betty Friedan's best-seller, The Feminine Mystique, which explained how many housewives felt trapped and unfulfilled, assaulted American culture for its creation {{of the notion that}} women could only find fulfillment through their roles as wives, mothers, and keepers of the home, and argued that women were just as able as men to do every type of job. In 1966 Friedan and others established the National Organization for Women, or NOW, to act for women as the NAACP did for African Americans.|$|E
25|$|The old anti-suffragist {{argument}} that only men could fight a war, and therefore only men deserve {{the right to}} vote, was refuted by the enthusiastic participation {{of tens of thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> on the home front in World War I. Across the world, grateful nations gave women the right to vote. Furthermore, most of the Western states had already given the women the right to vote in state and national elections, and the representatives from those states, including the first woman Jeannette Rankin of Montana, demonstrated that woman suffrage was a success. The main resistance came from the south, where white leaders were worried about the threat of black women voting. Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment in 1919, and women could vote in 1920.|$|E

25|$|During WWI (1914-1918), {{large numbers}} of women were {{recruited}} into jobs that had either been vacated by men {{who had gone to}} fight in the war, or had been created as part of the war effort. The high demand for weapons and the overall wartime situation resulted in munitions factories collectively becoming the largest employer <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> by 1918. While there was initial resistance to hiring women for jobs traditionally held by men, the war made the need for labor so urgent that women were hired in large numbers and the government even actively promoted the employment of women in war-related industries through recruitment drives. As a result, women not only began working in heavy industry, but also took other jobs traditionally reserved solely for men, such as railway guards, ticket collectors, bus and tram conductors, postal workers, police officers, firefighters, and clerks.|$|E
25|$|By 1400, most English {{and some}} Scottish people used {{surnames}}, but many Scottish and Welsh {{people did not}} adopt surnames until the 17th century, or even later. Henry VIII (ruled 1509–1547) ordered that marital births be recorded under the surname of the father. In England and cultures derived from there, there {{has long been a}} tradition for a woman to change her surname upon marriage from her birth name to her husband's family name. (See Maiden and married names.) The first known instance in the United States of a woman insisting on the use of her birth name was that of Lucy Stone in 1855; {{and there has been a}} general increase in the rate of women using their birth name. This has gone through periods of flux, however, and the 1990s saw a decline in the percentage of name retention among women. As of 2006, more than 80% <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> adopted the husband's family name after marriage.|$|E
25|$|HBO's first {{successful}} documentary aired in 1979, the six-part series Time Was, which featured host Dick Cavett being inserted into seminal events occurring between the 1920s and the 1970s. 1981's She's Nobody's Baby, produced by Ms. magazine, was another well-known documentary tracing the {{evolution in the}} societal role <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>women</b> during the 20th Century; the special earned HBO the first Peabody Award won by a pay television service. Since then, the network has brought home numerous Peabody Awards for its documentary films. HBO had also broadcast informational documentaries produced in partnership with Consumer Reports starting in 1980, focusing on subjects from product safety to finance to health. One such documentary, AIDS: Everything You and Your Family Need to Know…But Were Afraid to Ask, which aired in 1987 {{at the height of}} the AIDS epidemic in the U.S., provided factual information on AIDS and HIV and was hosted by then-Surgeon General C.
