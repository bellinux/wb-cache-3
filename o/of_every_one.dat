A long trail, a hard trail, maybe; but the call comes to us, and we have to go.

25|$|João das Regras became {{notable for}} {{supporting}} {{the claims of the}} grand-master of the Order of Aviz, João I to the throne of Portugal during the 1383–1385 Crisis, a period of civil war and anomie in the Portuguese history that began with the death of king Fernando I of Portugal — who left no male heirs — and ended with the accession to the throne of João I. During that period, several pretenders to the Portuguese throne arose and das Regras became notable for refuting the arguments <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of them without mentioning the name of João I at the Cortes of Coimbra.|$|E
25|$|Although CJD is {{the most}} common human prion disease, it is still {{believed}} to be rare, estimated to occur in about one out <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> million people every year, however, an autopsy study published in 1989 and others suggest that between 3-13% of people diagnosed with Alzheimer's were actually misdiagnosed, and instead had CJD, not Alzheimer's. Presumably the people became infected through prion contaminated beef from cattle with subclinical atypical BSE, which has a very long incubation period. CJD usually affects people aged 45–75, most commonly appearing in people between the ages of 60–65. The exception to this is the more recently recognised 'variant' CJD (vCJD), which occurs in younger people.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy.

500|$|Like {{many other}} areas of American law, the Fourth Amendment finds its roots in English legal doctrine. Sir Edward Coke, in Semayne's case (1604), famously stated: [...] "The house <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> is to him as his castle and fortress, as well for his defence against injury and {{violence}} as for his repose." [...] Semayne's Case acknowledged that the King did not have unbridled authority to intrude on his subjects' dwellings but recognized that government agents were permitted to conduct searches and seizures under certain conditions when their purpose was lawful and a warrant had been obtained.|$|E

500|$|The {{two ships}} then moved further {{up the river}} {{until they reached the}} town itself. All along the way they were harassed by musket and cannon fire from the shore, as the militia and their Indian allies {{positioned}} themselves to dispute possible landing sites. When darkness set in, the Indians reportedly began chanting and shouting in an attempt to magnify their numbers. At this point, [...] "To the great Surprise and Astonishment <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> in Less than half an Hour after Coming to an Anchor, the Brig & Sloop Both Gote under way without firing a Gun" [...] and [...] "made down the River against the Tide of flood." [...] The Hope, however, ran aground while making its way downstream in the twilight. The militia hauled a swivel gun to a nearby shore, and peppered her with shot the next morning before she was refloated by the tide and made her way into Machias Bay.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the 1901 season, team captain Hugh White gave head coach Fielding Yost and trainer Keene Fitzpatrick substantial credit for the performance of the 1901 team. He credited the coach with [...] "inoculating into the men some of Mr. Yost's own spirit, impulsiveness and optimism," [...] and with having the [...] "faculty of adapting his plays to the material at hand so that he got the best there was out <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of the eleven men." [...] With respect to the trainer, White noted:"An equally strong element, and one many are apt to overlook, was the work of Keene Fitzpatrick. Consider a team training nearly four months, without a man going stale, and but one injured so that he had to be taken out of the game! Then in addition a trip of nearly 3000 miles, from a climate where the thermometer registered 10 degrees below zero, into one of summer weather, and eleven men playing through an entire game and finishing it with faster and stronger play than at the beginning! Such were the results achieved by our trainer. ... Too much praise cannot be given him." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "If {{nature has}} made {{any one thing}} less {{susceptible}} than all others of exclusive property, it is {{the action of the}} thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>one,</b> and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bly's {{mother died}} from ovarian cancer.

[...] "Romance is read primarily by women, and ovarian cancer is a women’s disease.

2500|$|In London, The Graphic {{opined that}} [...] "Of the guilt <b>of</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> of them, both Frenchmen and Italians, {{there was no}} doubt whatever, and nobody, it is stated, was more {{astonished}} at the verdict than the rioters themselves. But because the greater number of the victims of the rioting last August were Italians the jury felt it incumbent on themselves to demonstrate their patriotism by practically declaring that for a French workman to kill an Italian competitor is no crime at all." [...] The paper went on to exonerate the French government: [...] "All that could be done to secure a fair trial was done by changing the venue to a district undisturbed by local jealousy of foreign labour, and for indicting the prisoners for unlawfully wounding {{as well as on the}} graver charge, so that the jury might at least have inflicted a mitigated punishment upon them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 1896, Febert was {{unanimously}} {{selected as}} the captain of Michigan's 1897 football team.

He began playing on the varsity in '93 at end, but in the Purdue game of that year, on account of an injury to one of the regular backs, Ferbert was put in back of the line, and no one has been able to run him out of his position. During a majority of the time he has played on the team he has acted as field captain, and his splendid judgment has been largely instrumental in Michigan's success on the gridiron." ...|$|E
