5000|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was filmed on 19 May 2016 in both singers' hometowns - Shakira's Barranquilla, Colombia and Vives's Santa Marta. It was {{directed}} by Spanish director and photographer Jaume de Laiguana. Some of the locations where it was filmed included Pescaíto and Shakira's college. The concept behind it was to follow the song's lyrics and allow Vives to take Shakira for a ride in the most important places where they grew up. The duo also wanted to show Colombian culture to its viewers, including [...] "unforgettable places", beaches, football fields. Various images were uploaded by both artists on their respective Instagram accounts prior to the clip's release. Prior to its release, Vives and Shakira shared numerous images showing them riding bicycles and being surrounded by fans. During {{an interview with the}} Associated Press, Vives described the shooting as both fun and emotional for the singers as they felt like [...] "kids again". He further elaborated, [...] "The work was intense but also delightful. Both for Shaki and for me, being back in our territory, plus the emotional load that this had for us, it was wonderful. We were really happy riding <b>our</b> <b>bikes,</b> singing on <b>our</b> <b>bikes.</b> We wanted to do everything barefoot. We strolled happily to several places... And watching Shaki contented, happy, reuniting with her friends, with her people, I think that the video registered a very, very special energy." ...|$|E

40|$|Bike sharing systems {{facilitate}} {{and promote}} biking {{as a public}} transportation alternative, providing benefits {{to the health and}} the environment. Contemporary bike sharing systems are automated and robust, but still have drawbacks. These are, for example, dependence on immovable stations with limited capacity and availability of service, only present in selected cities. Moreover, currently there are no solutions for automated bike sharing for private and corporate use. In this thesis, we introduce a bike sharing system designed as a service for company employees. This system allows using the bikes for short trips or commuting. The focus of the thesis is on creating a smart bike lock, which is a device that enables automated bike access management. Currently, there are no smart bike locks available commercially off-the-shelf. However with <b>our</b> <b>bike</b> management system, relying on a custom-made smart bike lock, the companies can offer their employees shared bikes with minimal management effort. The system has been tested in a controlled environment, and the device has been evaluated. The results are positive: the device fulfils the core requirements of the system and can be used as part of the service. The current smart bike lock is still a prototype. Further work is necessary to improve the design and add features such as short range wireless...|$|R

Cone began teaching pre-school {{while he was in}} college, often telling the students superhero stories. He invented Biker Boy originally as an external character, but the students thought he was talking about himself, hence Cone eventually assuming the role of Biker Boy himself. Cone states on the development of his character, [...] "Six months ago I drove cross-country with some friends. We brought <b>our</b> <b>bikes</b> so we could ride as much as possible.

25|$|Due to {{equipment}} {{rotation and}} maintenance concerns, Caltrain said in 2009 {{that it could}} not dedicate cars with higher bike capacity on trains with high bike demand. Many of you have written to ask a series of questions about this new effort: Why can’t we provide two bike cars on every train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on my train? Why can’t we provide two bike cars on the most heavily used trains? Why is there only one bike car on trains that are supposed to have two bike cars? The simplest answer to most of these questions is that we don’t have enough bike cars to put two on every train, or even on every peak train, and, in doing all we can to expand service for our cycling customers, we have to be mindful of the impact of these changes on our entire system and all of our customers, particularly on on-time performance. All of our cars, not just <b>our</b> <b>bike</b> cars, serve <b>our</b> entire schedule throughout our entire day, which means they rotate through the schedule, and also must be rotated out of service for fueling, washing, maintenance and federally mandated safety and operational inspections. A train set that starts its day in San Jose may finish its day in Millbrae and be cycled to San Francisco for its daily maintenance and to begin the next day at the San Francisco station. Because of this rotation – because of the demands of our entire service schedule – we can’t guarantee that a specific stop on the schedule will have a specific train.}} Eventually, two bike cars were added to every train consist by 2011, and in 2016, a third bike car was added to Bombardier consists.|$|R

Roozbeh and I were both scared, so we got on our motorcycles to flee, and just as we got on <b>our</b> <b>bikes,</b> I {{saw one of the}} men on the ground bleeding." [...] No source has reported what independent witnesses said about the encounter. The Etemaad news story also reports {{that at the time of}} the attack, Fatehi was a runaway who was disowned by her family; however, a phone interview with Fatehi's mother is reported to have shown that her mother displayed great concern about her daughter's fate, and that she tearfully pleaded for her daughter's life. In the same interview, Nazanin's mother reportedly confirmed that she had asked the mother of the deceased man for pardon, but that she had been refused.|$|E

40|$|I {{find myself}} waiting in traffic once again. I left my house almost two hours early because traffic {{was to be}} expected. The large expanse of {{highways}} all over America causes millions of headaches every day. Why do we deal with this? It’s almost as if we waste half our life in our cars to go to work, school, grocery store, or even {{down the street to}} a friend’s house. I never really understood why we do this or how the design of cities and buildings could influence the way we live in them. We need to design a city that pulls us out of our cars and into a much more experiential environment - a city that gives us the ability to walk or ride <b>our</b> <b>bike.</b> This is the issue I decided to explore further in a doctoral thesis. Urban sprawl, as Merriam-Webster defines it, is “the spreading of urban developments (as houses and shopping centers) on undeveloped land near a city. ” We can find examples of urban sprawl all over America as well as components or evidence of its effects on other areas. As I learned more about this issue, it became evident that there was more to it than simply designing cities from scratch. We find that new development that claims to be better, mixed use, and walkable are still located outside city boundaries and in essence is sprawling out. The evidence of urban sprawl in Hawaii is a major occurrence in Hawaii, partly due to the geographical nature of an island’s land mass. The goal of this research paper is to further understand the issue of urban sprawl in the context of Hawaii’s developing suburban communities. Known housing types that are related to sprawl’s wide range of problems and forms will be modified to implement ideas from smart growth, Jane Jacobs, and Clarence Perry. Studies will then explore further the impact of different development types on a site located in Kapolei, Hawaii. We {{will be able to use}} the study to determine if using known housing types and increasing the quality of life through relieving specific issues related to sprawl, can we redensify a city...|$|R

On a daily basis I remember the pungent smell of the soy sauce they produced in a factory in their backyard. We also shopped at a small neighbourhood supermarket called Shinohara.

From the perfect {{circular}} wheels on <b>our</b> <b>bikes</b> and cars that deliver an enjoyable ride, to the error-correction protocols that keep e-mails from turning into junk; it's literally all around us. It's also symmetry that dictates the laws of nature. On the small scale the symmetry group of the Standard Model controls the interactions in molecules, atoms, and nuclei. On the large scale gravity is governed by Einstein's symmetry principle of our space-time. This thesis deals with a certain class of symmetries known as Kac-Moody algebras. In contrast to the symmetries of the Standard Model and gravity, Kac-Moody algebras are infinite. They appear {{in the context of}} M-theory, an as of yet unknown theory that might both describe the Standard Model and gravity. In this thesis we will show how Kac-Moody algebras unify all the low-energy limits of M-theory, which are known as supergravities. Moreover, the Kac-Moody algebras contain information that corresponds exactly to all the known gauge deformations of these supergravities. We will demonstrate how to obtain the field content of the various gauged supergravities from Kac-Moody algebras, and attempt to relate the equations of motion of both sides to each other. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{cities and}} {{universities}} {{around the world}} are considering bike share and bike library programs in their sustainability plans. In such programs bikes are made available for participants to check out from a designated location and use for an allocated amount of time. As seniors we realized how heavily we have relied on <b>our</b> <b>bikes</b> these past four years. Overall, biking is very popular on campus, and a program that allows students to check out bikes for very low costs allows our campus to implement sustainable practices and encourages biking. During this project we studied bike share programs in the United States and around the world. We researched aspects of bike share programs including size, costs, and overall benefits. Cities have reported benefits including improved fitness of residents, decreased CO 2 emissions, decreased need for vehicular parking, and increased pressure to improve bike infrastructure. In addition, this program offers a sustainable solution to some of the challenges ESF will face in the future such as parking constraints. In order to create a successful program at SUNY ESF we conducted surveys, made general observations about bike transportation, and talked to various administrators. In the end, we developed a bike library program to fit the needs and constraints of SUNY ESF. In doing so, we hope to increase accessibility and connectivity between the campus and other areas of interest such as grocery stores, cultural points, and the city. We expect our program to expand as ridership increases, spreading to the rest of university hill and beyond...|$|E

40|$|Muscular {{exertion}} rate of {{the bike}} riders is an indicator of their fatigue. Monitoring this phenomena and letting it know to the bikers or other concerned, bike designers will help in modifying the design of bike that causes low muscular exertion of the biker and hence low fatigue. To send such data to a remote monitoring state {{where they can be}} analyzed.

This thesis focused mainly on the comparative study of ZigBee, ANT and BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy). The Idea is to collect the muscular exertion data with relevant sensor, send it to the mobile and then using an appropriate short range wireless transmission technique send it to the concerned remote monitoring centre. The criterion to find the solution is based on transmission rate and powerconsumption by that technology.

40|$|For a {{few days}} there {{it seemed that the}} {{successful}} student march of May 4 would be the last of the big demos and soon everyone would be back on campus attending classes again. Railing against this rather pleasant and natural inclination, strident wall posters at Shida and Beida called for continuing the student strike. One of the more florid campus wall posters that I managed to snap a photo of was a florid eulogy to the Great Hall of the People as a symbol of representative rule. The dark message, written on May 5, 1989 was at odds with the general euphoria {{in the wake of the}} May 4 March, for it predicted an outcome with blood flowing down Chang’an Boulevard. Brushed in ink on a large sheet of paper, written with such literary flourish that I needed help to decipher it, the poem was signed by an anonymous author who went by the name, “The Wild One. ” “*Drawing blood on Chang’an Jie until the dawn dawns red, smashing to bits the bona fide dream of the people*. ” On the morning of May 10, the student-rigged loudspeakers at the center of the Beijing University campus started crackling with a call to action. A Beida physics student explained they were calling on other schools to join Beida students in a new form of protest with Chinese characteristics: the bicycle demonstration! We sat on <b>our</b> <b>bikes</b> under a tree near the front gate of Beida to observe the hatching of this new and unusual type of protest. The “marchers” rolled in from all directions, mostly walking their bicycles due to the utter congestion. Like earlier protests, which used patriotic anthems as a cover for covert political action, the demo on wheels could hide in plain sight in a city of a million tinkling bicycles. The tree-lined road leading to the main gate on campus was by now attracting black bicycles like crows, watching and waiting for a sign to take flight en masse...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{generating}} electricity while exercising on a stationary <b>bike.</b> <b>Our</b> {{objective is to}} utilize the lost power in gym`s bikes to supply commonly used electronic devises on campus. Mechanical energy produced by workout {{will be used to}} charge students’ laptops, tablets, cellphone, and other small electrical devices. This project will be helpful to reduce the usage of electricity and also to people who are in need for electrical power. The focus of this paper is the drive train part of the project. Timing pulleys and a timing belt were used to transmit the angular movement of the tire of the bike to the DC motor that would be charging the 12 V battery. The first pulley is attached to a 3 in rubber tire, which is making contact with the tire of the bike. Therefore, it will rotate when the tire of bike is rotating. Then, the angular movement of the tire will be transmitted by the timing belt to the pulley that is attached to the motor. This system will make the motor rotates at 2256 RPM when someone pedaling the bike at 44 RPM. With that being said, the motor will supply. 88 amps at 2256 RPM. Therefore, the motor takes 7 hours to give the battery a full charge when it is empty. The battery can charge about 5. 3 iPhones at 7 AH capacity before it is need to be recharged...|$|R
