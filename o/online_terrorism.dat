5000|$|The {{creation}} of a general set of guidelines between {{the private and public}} sectors when managing online terrorist threats. This project’s objective is not to set a strict legislative statement on <b>online</b> <b>terrorism</b> but to provide a set of guidelines and notions for both the government and the private corporations on <b>online</b> <b>terrorism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{initiation}} {{of a public}} and private dialogue regarding illegal activities on the internet, especially focused on terrorist activities. The objective is to consider {{both the public and}} private interests of the Clean IT project so that both parties would have the proper motivation when engaging in it. Additionally, this aims to set a clear and shared understanding of what <b>online</b> <b>terrorism</b> is and the categories that it entails through a public and private dialogue.|$|E
5000|$|The Clean IT Project is {{an online}} project {{initiated}} by the European Union, aiming to reduce or discourage <b>online</b> <b>terrorism</b> and further illegal activities via the internet. They aim to create a document that commits the internet industry to help governments discover content that incites acts of terrorism. The main facilitators that undertook this project were the Netherlands, Germany, United Kingdom, Belgium, and Spain. There are many more supporting EU members such as Hungary, Romania, and recently, Italy, but the main countries that have started the project are the 5 listed above.|$|E
30|$|The first {{paper in}} this special issue by Torok (Developing an {{explanatory}} model for the process of <b>online</b> radicalization and <b>terrorism)</b> proposes a model for understanding the mechanisms and power relations that underlie the use of Internet services such as Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter for <b>online</b> radicalization and <b>terrorism.</b> The model is based on previous work by Foucault on psychiatric power [3].|$|R

5000|$|The Encyclopædia Britannica <b>Online</b> defines <b>terrorism</b> {{generally}} as [...] "the systematic use {{of violence}} to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby {{to bring about a}} particular political objective", and states that [...] "terrorism is not legally defined in all jurisdictions." [...] The encyclopedia adds that [...] "establishment terrorism, often called state or state-sponsored terrorism, is employed by governments - or more often by factions within governments - against that government's citizens, against factions within the government, or against foreign governments or groups." ...|$|R
50|$|Cyberterrorism is a {{controversial}} term. Some authors choose {{a very narrow}} definition, relating to deployments, by known terrorist organizations, of disruption attacks against information systems for {{the primary purpose of}} creating alarm and panic. Some other authors choose a much too broad definition which tends to falsely include cybercrime when in reality, cyberterrorism and cybercrime are two very different issues and must be defined separately. Terrorism online should be considered cyberterrorism when there has been fear inflicted on a group of people, whereas cybercrime is the act of committing a felony or crime online typically without the use of fear. By these narrow and broad definitions, it is difficult to identify which instances of <b>online</b> <b>terrorism</b> are cyberterrorism or cybercrime.|$|E
50|$|This {{project was}} drafted {{through an open}} {{dialogue}} between the private corporations and government agencies which started in June 2011 and had concluded in March 2013. This process involved 6 meetings in Amsterdam, Madrid, Brussels, Berlin, Utrecht, and Vienna, where a project team facilitated the conversation for Clean IT. This dialogue involved over 110 participants: representatives from both the government and private corporations as well as experts and academics in the related fields. Once a revision had been made on the document after every meeting, the document was released {{to the general public}} in order to consider their opinion as well. The final version of the document was released on 21 January 2013, which included a detailed analysis of online terrorist activities and nine general guidelines that suggest the best practices or ways to reduce <b>online</b> <b>terrorism.</b>|$|E
5000|$|European Digital Rights is a {{group that}} was created to defend {{the civil rights of}} the people in the {{information}} society. This group has actively spoken out against the Clean IT project by not only saying that the project itself is a violation of privacy but they highlight a very key aspect in the final published version of the Clean IT project document that there is a huge amount of censorship power that involves the interest of the private filtering companies. The whole dialogue that was created by the Clean IT project was not a government centered dialogue but it was a government with a few multi corporate companies to counter <b>online</b> <b>terrorism.</b> However, during the process, EDRi suggests that the private companies’ personal interests had been readily involved in the project document itself. The fact the document does not specify the term for what contents to block implies that the censored content depends on the reliability of the companies that provide the internet content. Also EDRi points out that the term [...] "block" [...] in the document is also used very vaguely in the sense that some customers will be limited and others will not be which suggests an unequal exposure to certain content. These two principles imply, EDRi suggests that the private companies have a considerable influence on the project itself and the disclosure of information.|$|E

The development of these courses is overseen by the Terrorism Studies Programme Board.|$|R
30|$|Having {{generated}} preliminary hypothesis {{and then}} further investigated aspects covering the normalization of radicalization and terrorism, {{it was confirmed that}} Foucault’s analytic utilizing concepts of psychiatric power was an invaluable guiding framework for developing an explanatory model of <b>online</b> radicalization and <b>terrorism.</b> Consequently, this section will outline in detail this newly applied model {{in addition to}} some of its original theoretical foundations.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{individuals}} {{fear that}} the actions of this project {{will continue to grow}} and possibly restrict use of the Internet. The project would require Internet users to use their real name in all online communication and punish individual for linking to [...] "terrorist content", making no distinction between searching for educational or malicious purposes. Many activist groups and individuals are deeply concerned regarding the scope of the government's capabilities of {{keeping an eye on the}} general public. If the past is an indicator, the Clean IT project will see opposition if the Internet community bands together with a worldwide protest, such as one that was successfully able to kill ACTA. [...] A recently leaked document has raised the concern that the initiative has drifted away from its initial aims of fighting the illegal activities and <b>online</b> <b>terrorism.</b> Their broad, vague and widespread approach to online security has arisen concern for internet freedom in addition to the project’s dedication to defending the law. The leaked document reveals measures that would allow the removal of lawful content and several other factors including the implementation of blocking systems. There is also the issue of private corporations being involved in the equation of this agreement in the Clean IT project where their personal interests are also intervening with the issue.|$|E

30|$|Security {{policy has}} always been a {{national}} government prerogative. However, private transnational corporations and city-regions are an increasingly important site in the political and physical space of security policies. Firstly, privately owned technologies are both a source of insecurity (e.g. cyber attacks, <b>online</b> abuse, extremism, <b>terrorism)</b> as well as a tool of enforcement of security policies (e.g. filtering, censorship, and surveillance of users’ data). Furthermore, global cities and citizens have become the real target and crucial node of contemporary security issues (Tebaldi 2016).|$|R
5000|$|In August 2004 Yarmuk {{announced}} {{the beginning of}} military operations in the republic. Their <b>online</b> manifesto rejected <b>terrorism,</b> referring to alleged government responsibility for the 1999 Russian apartment bombings ("We are not fighting against women or children, like Russian invaders are doing in Ichkeria. We are not blowing up sleeping people, like FSB of the Russian Federation does"). The manifesto noted {{the corruption of the}} [...] "mafia clans" [...] that led the republic ("These mere apologies for rulers, who sold themselves to the invaders, have made drug addiction, prostitution, poverty, crime, depravity, drunkenness and unemployment prosper in our Republic").|$|R
30|$|Another {{issue in}} {{exploring}} the online institution {{is the way}} that individuals interact with it. In exploring the link between internet use and depression with terrorism, it is difficult to make generalized comments. However, cases do exist that link emotional issues, <b>online</b> use and <b>terrorism.</b> The most notable being Nidal Hasan whose profile reveals that he was disturbed through his dealing with veterans [15]. Similarly, Mohamed Mohamud (Portland bomb plot) harbored high levels of anger and resentment towards his family [19]. While, there has not been any formal diagnosis of depression, these cases clearly show that the perpetrators were disaffected and harbored emotional issues.|$|R
30|$|The {{recent case}} of Arid Uka reveals a {{disturbing}} new trend in <b>online</b> <b>terrorism,</b> {{that of the}} loner, with no clear organizational affiliations or connections [8]. It marks a shift away from training camps and small group affiliations towards the online institution [9]. In other words, ‘The terrorists we should fear most are self-recruited wannabes who find purpose in terror and comrades on the Web.’ [9], p. 37]. So the key question is, what drives this new breed of recruit? It is not poverty, not even necessarily religion, but a sense of marginalization and a search for significance [9]. What is most concerning is that the internet has become an online institution for gathering and coordinating these marginalized individuals.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} problem of {{deception}} in <b>online</b> <b>terrorism</b> research. While conducting research into the growing phenomenon of female migration to Islamic State-held territory by Western females, we began following a Twitter account exhibiting suspicious activity. The account owner – {{believed to be a}} Canadian teenage female – indicated interest in learning more about joining the IS. We tracked this account for three weeks in order to discover more information about its activities and thus to develop a set of key indicators that might help predict future migration risk. We subsequently learned it was a fake account (‘sock puppet’) established to fool IS recruiters. The operation of such ruses and the problems they create is discussed here...|$|E
2500|$|That day, the government, after delay {{caused by}} the shootings, {{introduced}} a bill to broaden {{the powers of the}} Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS). Among other powers, it would allow the agency to operate internationally and introduce a program to revoke Canadian citizenship of dual nationals who are convicted of terrorism. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association urged the government to not over-react: [...] "before we take steps to expand existing police and intelligence power, we need answers about why the power that we have were not used, or were insufficient, to prevent or avoid recent tragedies." [...] On October 29, Minister of Justice Peter MacKay said the government would work to prevent the promotion of <b>terrorism</b> <b>online.</b>|$|R
500|$|In December 2004, M.I.A. {{independently}} {{released a}} mixtape titled Piracy Funds Terrorism, produced by M.I.A. and Diplo, as a [...] "teaser" [...] for the album. The release featured rough mixes of tracks from Arular mashed up with songs by other artists, and was promoted by word-of-mouth. In early 2005, {{after the release}} of Arular, an extensive collection of fan-made remixes of M.I.A.'s work was uploaded, expanded and made available as an [...] "online mixtape" [...] on XL's official website, under the banner <b>Online</b> Piracy Funds <b>Terrorism.</b> M.I.A. toured extensively during 2005 to promote the album. The Arular Tour included concerts in North America supporting LCD Soundsystem and appearances at music festivals in Europe, Japan and South America.

40|$|Graphs are {{widespread}} data structures used {{to model}} {{a wide variety}} of problems. The sheer amount of data to be processed has prompted the creation of a myriad of systems that help us cope with massive scale graphs. The pressure to deliver fast responses to queries on the graph is higher than ever before, as it is demanded by many applications (e. g. <b>online</b> recommendations, auctions, <b>terrorism</b> protection, etc.). In addition, graphs change continuously (so do the real world entities that typically represent). Systems must be ready for both: near real-time and dynamic massive graphs. We survey systems taking their scalability, real-time potential and capability to support dynamic changes to the graph as driving guidelines. The main techniques and limitations are distilled and categorised. The algorithms run on top of graph systems are not ready for prime time dynamism either. Therefore,a short overview on dynamic graph algorithms has also been included...|$|R
40|$|Writers {{interested}} in the theme of terrorism because disturbed by {{an issue that is}} circulating in the media when Islam is imaged as if the religion of the terrorists. Particularly in the online media that is currently accessible by anyone, anytime, and anywhere. Moving on from the inconvenience of this, the authors decided to take the research that motivated ghirah as a Muslim. But still based on objectivity by reason and conception can be justified scientifically. In this study, the author uses descriptive quantitative research methods to determine the issue of terrorism is there any influence spread across the internet through reports in Islampos. com and Viva. co. id against Islamic activists at the Sebelas Maret University. As well as to determine the response of Islamic activist at the Sebelas Maret University regarding the news about terrorism in Islampos. com and Viva. co. id. Both of these issues into the primary root of the discussion in the present study. The results show the relevance of the issue of terrorism which is spreading in online media does not have significant influence to Islamic activists at the Sebelas Maret University. It is inseparable from the meaning of the term terrorism equation itself is described {{at the beginning of the}} questionnaire items. What they do is contrary to the activities of the terrorists. Islampos. com received more positive responses then the Viva. co. id. Based on the results for using Internet, the majority of Islamic activists Sebelas Maret University is not too often and not too infrequently for accessing information and news on the Internet.

40|$|This book {{investigates the}} {{intersection}} of terrorism, digital technologies and cyberspace. Recent years have witnessed a small, but growing, collection of book length publications dealing with cyber-terrorism or cognate issues. These existing books mostly take a single perspective: technological, political, or sociological. In contrast, <b>Terrorism</b> <b>Online</b> utilises a multi-disciplinary framework to provide a borader introduction to debates and developments that have largely been conducted in isolation to date. Drawing together a range of key academics in the field, this edited volume is organised around three broad themes. First, how – and why – do terrorists engage with the Internet, digital technologies and cyberspace? Second, what threat do these various activities pose, and to whom? And, third, how might these activities be prevented, deterred or responded to? Exploring these themes, the book engages {{with a range of}} contemporary case studies and different forms of terrorism: from lone-actor to state-based. The book’s engagement with questions of law, politics, technology and beyond is intended to offer a holistic approach to this subject matter, and provides the unique selling point of the book. This book will be of interest to students of cyberterrorism, security studies and IR in general...|$|R
