40|$|The paper {{presents}} an innovative approach based on digital data and computer tools to optimize lower limb socket prosthesis design. The kernel {{of the approach}} is a stump’s detailed geometric model, with external surface and inner bones. To obtain this model, we integrated RE laser scanning and two medical imaging technologies, Computer Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The model obtained can not be directly used to build the socket by using Rapid Manufacturing technologies. We demonstrate this assertion by comparing digital model of the limb with the positive plaster cast acquired by an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>technician</b> during the traditional manual manufacturing process. The comparison evidences some differences concentrated on critical zones, whose deformations strictly depend on technician’s manipulation. The analyses {{of the causes of}} the mentioned differences can furnish guidelines for physics-based simulations able to reproduce effects obtained by the technician...|$|E

40|$|As is well known, {{users can}} make {{significant}} contributions to innovations, including innovating themselves. However, much work on user innovation has focussed on developed countries. The question remains whether and how users innovate in a developing country setting. Bodies of literature that explicitly consider innovations in such settings emphasise the influence of limitations. This thesis therefore investigates how limitations shape the creation and sharing of innovations by users. This issue is analysed for medical technologies, because these can have different user groups, including patients, who have been little focussed on, even in developed countries. In this setting, a focus on innovation as defined relatively inclusively is most suitable, and therefore the term 'changes' is often used rather than 'innovations' to express this inclusiveness. By comparing the changes made to {{the same kind of}} technology by different groups of users in different settings with different limitations, the influence of these limitations can be analysed. Therefore, data were collected on changes made by patients as well as <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>technicians</b> to lower limb prostheses in two orthopaedic centres in Malawi. First, observations were conducted of the production process for prostheses, followed by semi-structured interviews with <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>technicians</b> and patients, and with additional experts to understand the broader context. It was found that patients and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>technicians</b> did make many changes. Three kinds of limitations were identified, that influence these changes by users. Like users in developed countries, patients and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>technicians</b> make these changes to fulfil their needs because available products and services are not satisfactory. Limitations both restrict what products and services are available to users, and also influence the characteristics of the creation and sharing of changes by users. Many users reported on efforts to share their changes with others despite the limitations, often due to a sense of professional collegiality and solidarity. In summary, limitations help to explain how changes by users occur in developing countries, but also how any accumulation of such changes users make is restricted. Improving this situation could help less developed countries in making better use of any user innovations that do occur, and thus contribute to their development more generally...|$|R

40|$|Conservative {{treatment}} of spinal disorders, especially scoliosis {{has been accomplished}} with plastic or plastic-metal corsets for decades. However, corsets are tailored to the individual’s body, the exact distances and action between {{the patient and the}} corset are not known. The raw piece is fabricated on the body’s exact model, which is made in at least three steps. First, the upper body of a patient set in a predefined posture is plastered, then after drying the plaster is removed. The second step is the preparation of the torso’s model that is made of plastic foam covered with plaster. After that the corset is formed according to the desired objectives, namely the <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>technician</b> forms the corset on the torso model and makes the necessary adjustments to achieve the desired spine compensation. The corset is then fitted on the patient and eventually minor corrections are made. New methods have been developed to replace plastering, namely 3 D body scanners working with different measurement principles. Traditional corset forming has also been changed to utilize the 3 D body mode...|$|E

ObjectivesA clinical prospective observational study was carried out to assess the effectiveness of lipofilling to improve the functional recovery of the injured foot. MethodsFour patients with anatomical–functional impairment following repair of post-traumatic soft tissue loss of the foot {{were involved in the}} study. All of the patients complained of pain in the repaired plantar weight bearing area, skin instability, recurrent ulcerations and were walking on crutches. A combined plastic surgery and technical orthopaedic assessment identified the plantar areas requiring anatomical changes for load redistribution. Two selective sequential lipofillings with a 12 weeks’ time interval were performed. Manufacturing of custom-made plantar insoles and/or shoes followed each surgical procedure. ResultsAfter the treatment all of the patients progressively recovered both a better plantar load distribution and a local soft tissue stability, referred the remission of chronic pain and discontinued the use of crutches. ConclusionLipofilling proved to be an effective and versatile surgical technique for both reconstructive and regenerative purposes. The interaction between the Plastic Surgery staff and the <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>Technician</b> outlined a successful multidisciplinary approach model for the rehabilitation of the injured foot...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{affected}} by serious foot pathologies often require special orthotics {{to stand and}} walk correctly. Skilled operators obtain such insoles {{on the basis of}} manual procedures and following the prescriptions of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>technicians.</b> The process is handicraft and time consuming. The paper presents a virtual prototyping approach which is based on dedicated foot scanners, CAD-based design tool and milling machines to obtain the bespoke footwear orthotics. The major contribution is a geometric procedure to design complex insole shapes starting from the foot scan and highly customized shoe lasts which are required in case of important deformities. The approach has been tested on several patients thanks to the collaboration with a partner insole producer and some orthopaedic centres. Patients have generally reported positive feedbacks on the comfort and functionality of the insoles...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the association between}} patients' expectations and the actual use of custom-made orthopaedic shoes. Design: A prospective cohort study with internal comparison. Setting: Twelve orthopaedic shoe companies. Patients: During six months, consecutive patients who were provided with their first ever pair of orthopaedic shoes and aged 16 years or older were recruited. A total of 339 patients with different pathologies were included (response 67 %). Mean (SD) age of the patients was 63 (15) years, and 129 patients (38 %) were male. Main measures: A practical and reproducible questionnaire, measuring: frequency of use of orthopaedic shoes, patients' expectations and experiences of aspects of the usability of orthopaedic shoes, and communication about patients' expectations. Results: Patients' expectations were not {{associated with the use}} of orthopaedic shoes (P-values range: 0. 106 to 0. 607), but the difference between expectations and experiences was (P-values range: < 0. 001 to 0. 012). The expectations of patients who frequently used their orthopaedic shoes were in concordance with their experiences, whereas the expectations of patients who did not use their orthopaedic shoes were much higher than their experiences. There was no communication of patients' expectations with the medical specialist or <b>orthopaedic</b> shoe <b>technician</b> in 34 % and 25 % of the patients respectively.

40|$|Objective In {{response}} to {{a request for a}} medicolegal opinion from an <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>technician</b> with pacinian neuroma of the hand, we conducted a systematic review of reported cases designed to assess whether this rare disease could be considered to be work-related. Methods We used Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, Google, and a manual search to identify reports of histologically confirmed pacinian neuroma of the hand manifesting after 15 years of age. Cases with available information (from article/authors) on personal history were considered eligible. We tabulated information on age/gender; localization and histopathologic features; signs/symptoms; history of local trauma; occupation, sports/hobbies or other physical exposures; right- or left-handedness; and outcome. Results We found 44 eligible cases (including the present referral). Of these, 21 (48 %) followed a trauma [< 6 months from onset/presentation (N= 7); 0. 5 – 2 years from onset (N= 6); ≥ 2 years from onset (N= 7); and timing unknown (N= 1) ] involving the same anatomic site. Three of these 21 traumas definitely occurred at work, and a further 2 cases occurred at the site of definite work-related repetitive microtrauma. Conclusions The results reinforce the concept that pacinian neuroma of the hand can follow local trauma or repetitive microtrauma. Implicated traumas were either recent or remote, and they sometimes occurred while performing manual tasks at work. We concluded that the referred case could plausibly be considered work-related...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Different bracing {{concepts}} are used {{today for the}} treatment of scoliosis. The plaster cast method worldwide seems to be the most practiced technique at the moment. CAD (Computer Aided Design) systems are on the market which allow brace adjustments without plaster. The latest development however, is the use of the ScoliOlogiC™ off the shelf system enabling the <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>technician</b> to construct a light brace for scoliosis correction from a variety of pattern specific shells to be connected to an anterior and a posterior upright. This „Chêneau light" brace, developed according to the Chêneau principle, promises a reduced impediment of quality of life in the brace. However, material reduction should not result in reduced effectiveness. Therefore the primary correction effect in the „Chêneau light" brace has been evaluated and compared with that of other braces used today. Methods The correction effects of the first 81 patients (main diagnosis Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) [n = 64] or Early Onset Scoliosis (EOS) [n = 15]), treated according to the principle of the „Chêneau light" brace were evaluated after an average treatment time of 6 weeks by a full-body X-ray made in the standing position whilst wearing the brace and compared with the last X-ray before bracing. The average curvature angle of the whole group was 35, 6 °, the average age was 12, 9 years (SD 1, 9), average Risser sign was 1, 3 (SD 1, 5), average Tanner rating 2, 75 (SD 0, 7). Results The Cobb angle in the whole group was reduced by an average of 16, 4 °, which corresponds to a correction effect of 51 %. The differences were highly significant in the T-test (T = 17, 4; p Conclusion The use of the „Chêneau light" brace leads to correction effects above average when compared to the correction effects of other braces described in literature. The reduction of material seems to affect the desired correction in a positive way. </p...|$|E

40|$|Bone {{drilling}} is {{an important}} and the most frequent operation in orthopaedics and other bone surgical procedures. Prediction and control of drilling force and torque are critical to safe and efficient surgeries. This paper studies the drilling force and torque arising from bone drilling process. Drilling parameters such as drilling speed, feed rate, drill size and drill condition (sharp and worn) were changed to measure the force and torque {{in the direction of}} the drill penetration. Experimental results demonstrated lower drilling force using a sharp drill compared to a worn drill for similar drilling conditions. Contrary to the drilling force, lower torque was measured using a worn drill compared to a sharp drill. The drilling force was found to decrease with increase in drill speed and increased with rise in the feed rate using both types of drills. A linear drop in drilling torque was measured with increase in drilling speed. This study provided scientific information to <b>orthopaedic</b> surgeons and <b>technicians</b> to use appropriate surgical drill and cutting parameters to avoid overstressing of the bone tissue and drill breakage during drilling operations...|$|R
