25|$|In {{addition}} to the Grijalva, there are <b>other</b> <b>flows</b> {{of water in the}} area in and around the canyon, many of which are seasonal. These consist of streams, some of which form waterfalls on the canyon’s sides, and underground movements which have created caves and karst formations. The last important water formation in the area is the manmade reservoir of the Chicoasén Dam.|$|E
500|$|The {{main river}} in West Bengal is the Ganges, which divides into two branches. One branch enters Bangladesh as the Padma, or Pôdda, while the <b>other</b> <b>flows</b> through West Bengal as the Bhagirathi River and Hooghly River. The Farakka barrage over the Ganges feeds the Hooghly {{branch of the}} river by a feeder canal, and its water flow {{management}} {{has been a source}} of lingering dispute between India and Bangladesh. The Teesta, Torsa, Jaldhaka, and Mahananda rivers are in the northern hilly region. The western plateau region has rivers such as the Damodar, Ajay, and Kangsabati. The Ganges delta and the Sundarbans area have numerous rivers and creeks. Pollution of the Ganges from indiscriminate waste dumped into the river is a major problem. Damodar, another tributary of the Ganges and once known as the [...] "Sorrow of Bengal" [...] (due to its frequent floods), has several dams under the Damodar Valley Project. At least nine districts in the state suffer from arsenic contamination of groundwater, and, as of 2006, an estimated 8.7million people drink water containing arsenic above the World Health Organisation recommended limit of 10µg/L.|$|E

500|$|Kīlauea's eruptive {{history has}} been a long and active one; its name means [...] "spewing" [...] or [...] "much spreading" [...] in the Hawaiian language, {{referring}} to its frequent outpouring of lava. The earliest lavas from the volcano date back to its submarine preshield stage, samples having been recovered by remotely operated underwater vehicles from its submerged slopes; samples of <b>other</b> <b>flows</b> have been recovered as core samples. Lavas younger than 1,000 years cover 90 percent of the volcano's surface. The oldest exposed lavas date back 2,800 years. The first well-documented eruption of Kīlauea occurred in 1823 (Western contact and written history began in 1778), and since that time the volcano has erupted repeatedly. Most historical eruptions have occurred at the volcano's summit or its eastern rift zone, and are prolonged and effusive in character. The geological record shows, however, that violent explosive activity predating European contact was extremely common, and in 1790 one such eruption killed over 80 warriors; should explosive activity start anew the volcano would become much more of a danger to humans. Kīlauea's current eruption dates back to January 3, 1983, and is by far its longest-duration historical period of activity, as well as one of the longest-duration eruptions in the world; as of January 2011, the eruption has produced [...] of lava and resurfaced [...] of land.|$|E
