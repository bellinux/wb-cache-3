Prolonged mouth opening (hyper-extension) is also suggested as a possible cause. It is thought that this leads to microtrauma and subsequent muscular hyperactivity.

40|$|SUMMARYIntroductionAmong {{the various}} devices {{available}} for airway management, {{one of them}} stands out: the retromolar Bonfils fiberscope. The Bonfils {{has proven to be}} effective and easy to use, besides being non-traumatic and useful in patients in whom direct laryngoscopy is unsuccessful, in patients with cervical trauma, limitation of mouth opening and intubation with the patient awake. MethodologyThis case report describes the <b>oral</b> Bonfils-guided nasotracheal <b>intubation</b> technique, successfully accomplished in 19 patients. ConclusionsThe experience obtained with this device in over 300 <b>oral</b> <b>intubations</b> leads us to believe that the Bonfils retromolar fiberscope is ideal and superior to the conventional laryngoscope for the routine management of the airway...|$|R

In a 40 -yr-old male patient with left Le Fort′s III fracture with nasal bone and symphysis menti fracture, we successfully carried out <b>oral</b> endotracheal <b>intubation</b> which was then modified to submandibular approach to provide adequate surgical field.

50|$|Newer {{methods of}} pre {{oxygenation}} {{include the use}} of a nasal cannula placed on the patient at 15 LPM at least 5 minutes prior to the administration of the sedation and paralytic drugs. High flow nasal oxygen has been shown to flush the nasopharynx with oxygen, and then when patients inspire they inhale a higher percentage of inspired oxygen. Small changes in FiO2 create dramatic changes in the availability of oxygen at the alveolus, and these increases result in marked expansion of the oxygen reservoir in the lungs prior to the induction of apnea. After apnea created by RSI the same high flow nasal cannula will help maintain, or even increase, oxygen saturation during efforts securing the tube (<b>oral</b> <b>intubation).</b> The use of nasal oxygen during pre-oxygenation and continued during apnea can prevent hypoxia before and during intubation, even in extreme clinical cases.|$|E

40|$|Background: The study evaluates whether facial {{landmarks}} {{can be used}} {{to estimate}} an appropriate laryngoscope blade length for <b>oral</b> endotracheal <b>intubation</b> in children. We tested the hypothesis that the laryngoscope blade measuring 10 mm or less distal or proximal to the angle of the mandible (when the flat portion of the blade follows the facial contour from the upper incisor teeth to the angle of the mandible) will demonstrate greater success and ease of <b>oral</b> tracheal <b>intubation.</b> Methods: In an observational and prospective study, 60 children 8 years old or younger were undergoing direct laryngoscopy for <b>oral</b> endotracheal <b>intubation</b> in the operating room, were enrolled in the study. Intubation at first time considered successful and intubation with more than one attempt considered unsuccessful. Ease and success of <b>oral</b> tracheal <b>intubation</b> were compared with distance measurements from the angle of the mandible to the tip of the laryngoscope blade. Blade lengths considered too short (blade lengths > 10 mm proximal to the angle of the mandible) and too long extending longer than 10 mm past the angle of the mandible. Finding: Only 66 % of the intubations using the shorter blade were performed on the first attempt as compared with 88. 3 % of the intubations using the recommended length or 81. 2 % of the intubations using blades extending longer than 10 mm past the angle of the mandible (Chi-square, p= 0. 02). Fisher exact test showed that recommended blade was more successful than longer blade (p= 0. 048). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that facial landmarks seem to be excellent clinical criteria for laryngoscope blade length selection for pediatric intubations. When the blade is placed at the upper midline incisor teeth and the tip is located within 1 cm proximal or distal to the angle of the mandible, <b>oral</b> tracheal <b>intubations</b> can be accomplished on the first attempt...|$|R

40|$|The use of fiberoptic scopes {{to assist}} in endotracheal {{intubation}} dates back to 1967, when a choledocoscope was used to intubate a patient with Still’s disease [1]. The first case series {{of the use of}} fiberscopes for intubation was published in 1972 [2]. Their use in anesthesia greatly expanded after the publication of the ASA Guidelines on Difficult Airway Management [3]. Current uses include nasal and <b>oral</b> <b>intubations</b> (either in the awake or anesthetized patient), evaluation of the airway, verification of accurate placement of single-or double-lumen endo-tracheal tubes and laryngeal mask airways (LMA), endotracheal tube exchange, and placement of bronchial blocker devices.

Poly-chlorinated derivatives of dibenzo-^>-dioxin were prepared either by chlorination of dibenzo-£-dioxin or by pyrolysis of 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetrachlorophenol and pentachlorophenol. The com-pounds prepared were administered to chicks by either oral feedings, <b>oral</b> <b>intubation</b> or intra-abdominal injection. Results of the feeding studies indicated that the hexachloro de-rivatives of dibenzo-£-dioxin most readily elicited the edema aspect of the chick edema disease but had low lethality, whereas the derivatives containing 3 and 4 chlorine atoms per molecule also caused edema but were the most lethal of the compounds tested. Hepta-and octachloro-dioxins, although capable of producing evidence of disease, were less toxic than the other polychlorinated derivatives. The pyrolytic product of 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetrachloro-phenol, a mixture of predominantly hexa- and heptachlorodibenzo-/> dioxins, was toxic when administered in single doses by way of <b>oral</b> <b>intubation</b> or by intra-abdominal injection...|$|E

Aspartame was administered orally to the MTX treated animals and was studied along with controls and MTX treated controls. <b>Oral</b> <b>intubations</b> of FDA approved 40  mg/kg b. wt aspartame were given daily for 90 days.

Animal studies using chronic nicotine, the major psychoactive tobacco ingredient, have shown conflicting results, questioning the role of nicotine in growth retardation. To evaluate the direct effects of nicotine during a period equivalent to the human third trimester, we developed an <b>oral</b> gastric <b>intubation</b> model using neonatal rat pups. Nicotine (6 mg/kg/day) was dissolve in milk-formula and delivered during three feedings daily from postnatal day (P) 1 to P 7. Nicotine immediately and significantly [P < 0. 05] decreased weight gain per day (WGD) by 13. 5 % (T) 1 day after onset of treatment in both genders and throughout the treatment period. This resulted in significantly lower body weight at P 4 and P 5 in male and female pups, respectively. After nicotine withdrawal, WGD returned to control level within 1 day, whereas total body weight recovered by P 18. There were no long-term consequences on body weight or growth pattern in either gender. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist dihydro-h-erythroidine (DHhE) reversed nicotine’s effects on WGD suggesting an involvement of heteromeric a 4 h 2, whereas methyllycaconitine (MLA) an antagonist for the homomeric a 7 -type receptor was ineffective.
