5|$|Instead he used guerrilla filmmaking techniques, which {{sometimes}} call for using locations without getting permission. Escape from Tomorrow {{is not the}} first film made in whole, or part, this way at the Disney parks. In 2010, the British street artist Banksy shot a scene for Exit Through the Gift Shop in one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> with his collaborator Mr. Brainwash. They managed to smuggle the footage out after being detained and questioned by park security. The following year, a viral found footage short, Missing in the Mansion, filmed in the Haunted Mansion, was distributed online without interference from Disney.|$|E

5|$|On August 24, 2004, four senior {{current and}} former {{employees}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parks</b> Department, Becky Kelley (former Parks Department Director), Michael Bryant (a Deputy Director of Revenue Management and Support), John Drake (an Assistant Director), and Herbert Lowe (former Deputy Director of Strategic Management and Development), filed suit against DeKalb County, Vernon Jones (as CEO of the county) and three of Jones' subordinates (Marilyn Boyd Drew, Richard Stogner, and Morris Williams) alleging either racial discrimination, {{or in the case}} of Lowe, retaliation for refusing to assist in racial discrimination. Kelly, Bryant, and Drake were white; Lowe was African-American.|$|E
5|$|The {{comedy series}} focuses on Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), the deputy {{director}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. The season consisted of six 22-minute episodes, all of which aired at 8:30p.m. on Thursdays. Daniels and Schur conceived the show when NBC officials asked Daniels to produce a spin-off of his comedy series The Office, on which Schur was a writer. During development, the creators decided the new show would be a stand-alone series, though it would share the mockumentary style of The Office. Like that show, Parks and Recreation encouraged improvisation among its cast members.|$|E
5|$|The town's main {{districts are}} Ashton upon Mersey in the northwest, Sale Moor in the southeast, and Brooklands in the southwest. The main {{commercial}} area is Sale town centre, {{in the central}} northern area of the town, but smaller commercial centres are also found in Ashton upon Mersey and Sale Moor. Brooklands is the most densely populated area. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks,</b> including Worthington and Walton, are in the central and southern areas, leaving Ashton upon Mersey and Sale Moor with a shortage of accessible green space.|$|E
50|$|Claude Monet {{painted a}} series of three {{paintings}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> in <b>the</b> spring <b>of</b> 1876. He painted two further paintings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> in 1878. Hector Berlioz was also fond <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Bergensbanen railway line {{runs along}} <b>the</b> {{southern}} boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> There is no road access to <b>the</b> southern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> so Finse Station, {{a stop on}} the railway line, is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few ways that people can access this part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> <b>The</b> Norwegian County Road 50 runs near <b>the</b> northern boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>park</b> {{is named}} after the nearby Saint-Maurice River to <b>the</b> east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> <b>The</b> Matawin River flows along the west and north borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
5|$|There was an {{important}} link between the Raglan Castle and the surrounding parkland, in particular the Home Park and the Red Deer Park. Historian Robert Liddiard suggests that {{on the basis of}} the views from the castle at this time, the structured nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> would have contrasted with the wilderness of the mountain peaks framing the scene beyond, making {{an important}} statement about the refinement and cultured nature of the castle lord. In the 15th century there were also extensive orchards and fish ponds surrounding the castle, favourably commented upon by contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|A {{principal}} cast of six actors received star billing in the show's first season. Poehler {{portrayed the}} lead character, Leslie Knope, the naive but well-meaning, eager-to-please deputy director <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> and recreation {{department of the}} fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. Also among the cast were Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, a sarcastic parks department employee, and Rashida Jones as Ann Perkins, a nurse who befriends Leslie and tries to help her turn a giant construction pit into a park. Daniels and Schur intended to cast Ansari and Jones (who previously appeared in The Office as Karen Filippelli) from the series' earliest stages of development, but the ultimate Parks and Recreation concept did not coalesce until they learned Poehler {{would be available to}} star. After her recruitment, the general concept of the series was established and the script for the pilot episode was written.|$|E
5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the West Park Commission was riddled with {{political}} graft, and the three parks became dilapidated. As part of a reform effort in 1905, Jens Jensen was appointed as General Superintendent and Chief Landscape Architect for the entire West Park System. Jensen, now recognized as dean of the prairie style of landscape architecture, improved deteriorating sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> and added new features. Among Jensen's improvements were a semi-circular entryway at Marshall Boulevard, and a formal garden at the corner of Ogden Avenue and Sacramento Drive. By the time Jensen designed the garden, Ogden Avenue, a diagonal roadway with a major streetcar thoroughfare that would later become part of Route 66, had already been constructed. The road divided the park into two separate landscapes, creating a busy intersection at the junction of Ogden and Sacramento Avenues. Jensen's solution was a long axial garden on the southeast side of the intersection, providing a buffer between Ogden Avenue and playing fields to the south. Jensen demolished the conservatories in each of the West Park System parks in favor of one grand conservatory at Garfield Park.|$|E
50|$|A {{book from}} Arcadia Publishing {{entitled}} Willow Grove Park (2005) includes over 200 photos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> and is <b>the</b> only comprehensive history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> <b>The</b> thoroughly researched book also corrects many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> historical inaccuracies {{that have grown}} up surrounding <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>park</b> covers several {{ecological}} zones, {{the dominant}} {{is that of}} savannah, consisting of woodland and bushland. A smaller area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> consists <b>of</b> riparian forests along the Niger and Mafou Rivers. Around five percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> is agricultural, along <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> <b>The</b> <b>park</b> is subject to frequent fires during the dry season.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> largest feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> is Shobu Pond, {{located near}} <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R
5|$|Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) arrives {{to report}} on the festival and is {{determined}} to find a negative story, although she does show excitement over Li'l Sebastian. She initially fails to find a scandal, but then overhears Leslie and Ben discussing the curse. It becomes the focus of her story, especially after Tom (Aziz Ansari) tells Leslie that Li'l Sebastian escaped his pen. Tom blames Jerry (Jim O'Heir), although it was entirely Tom's fault. The Pawnee media swarms the festival to cover the curse, endangering its opening the next day with the bad press, with one reporter likening Ben's past as a failed teen mayor with the curse. Now believing himself to be the curse, Ben leaves the festival. As Leslie reassures the reporters there is no curse, the power generator blows out, leaving the festival dark and stranding most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> department on a Ferris wheel. Using the blackout as an excuse, Ann takes Donna's advice to make out with Kiley (Joey Russo), her dumb but attractive patient.|$|E
5|$|Mervyn Cowie {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of several of Kenya's national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya's primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into the establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks.</b> Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya's wildlife {{is not good for}} them. In 1948 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city's population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city's growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park's boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park's northern boundary contaminate the park's surface and ground water systems.|$|E
5|$|Mobile {{has more}} than 45 public parks within its limits, with some that are of special note. Bienville Square is a {{historic}} park in the Lower Dauphin Street Historic District. It assumed its current form in 1850 and is named for Mobile's founder, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville. It was once a principal gathering place for {{the citizens of the}} city and remains popular today. Cathedral Square is a one-block performing arts park, also in the Lower Dauphin Street Historic District, that is overlooked by the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception. Fort Conde is a reconstruction of the city's original Fort CondÃ©, built on the original fort's footprint. It serves as the official welcome center and colonial-era living history museum. Spanish Plaza is a downtown park that honors the Spanish phase of the city between 1780 and 1813. It features the Arches of Friendship, a fountain presented to Mobile by the city of MÃ¡laga, Spain. Langan Park, the largest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> at , features lakes, natural spaces, and contains the Mobile Museum of Art, Azalea City Golf Course, Mobile Botanical Gardens and Playhouse in the Park.|$|E
50|$|After {{two decades}} of {{planning}} and construction, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> remains incomplete. Half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> was complete by 2009, and as of 2015 70 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> has been finished, {{at a cost of}} nearly $500 million.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> eastern {{boundary}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> generally follows <b>the</b> Dalton Highway at {{a distance}} of a few miles, with <b>the</b> westernmost part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Arctic National Wildlife Refuge 10 mi farther east. Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge is near <b>the</b> <b>park's</b> southeast boundary. Noatak National Preserve adjoins the western boundary, and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska adjoins <b>the</b> northwest corner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> Almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> is designated as wilderness, with <b>the</b> exception <b>of</b> areas around Anaktuvuk Pass. A detached portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> surrounds <b>the</b> outlying Fortress Mountain and Castle Mountain to <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b>|$|R

5|$|Peter Melbourne {{was made}} {{keeper of the}} Melbourne estate in 1377 with an annual income of Â£10. He was granted another 66s8d in 1386, and 10marks (Â£613s4d) in 1395. The last award was {{conditional}} on his not meddling with the offices of constable and keeper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks,</b> which had passed on to his son, also called Peter. The younger Peter Melbourne {{was involved in the}} upbringing of the future Henry IV during the reign of Richard II. He was again appointed constable and steward of the Derbyshire manor in March 1399, although he gave up his office in April in return for an annuity from King Richard, who had confiscated the Lancastrian estates when John of Gaunt died earlier that year. Upon Henry's seizure of the throne, Peter was confirmed as constable, and in October 1399 his annuity was increased from Â£10 to 100marks (Â£668s); in the following year he was awarded land in Derbyshire confiscated from Thomas Merke, Bishop of Carlisle, co-leader of plot against the King.|$|E
5|$|Restoring the {{primitive}} scene {{is not done}} easily nor can it be done completely. Some species are extinct. Given time, an eastern hardwood forest can be regrown to maturity but the chestnut will be missing and so will the roar of pigeon wings. The colorful drapanid finches {{are not to be}} heard again in the lowland forests of Hawaii, nor will the jack-hammer of the ivory-bill ring in southern swamps. The wolf and grizzly bear cannot readily be reintroduced into ranching communities, and the factor of human use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> is subject only to regulation, not elimination. Exotic plants, animals, and diseases are here to stay. All these limitations we fully realize. Yet, if the goal cannot be fully achieved it can be approached. A reasonable illusion of primitive America could be recreated, using the utmost in skill, judgment, and ecologic sensitivity. This in our opinion should be the objective of every national park and monument.|$|E
5|$|The deleted scenes {{included}} on the DVD were originally featured on the official Parks and Recreation website after the episode aired. In the first, a minute-long clip, Ron tries {{to take a job}} offer that was previously offered to him at an Internet flower company web site, but when he finds the business is doing so poorly, he sadly realizes he will be in his government job for a long time. In a second minute-long clip, Leslie talks about her very detailed life plan, which involves eventually becoming head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> department, then governor of Indiana, then U.S. vice president and then getting married at age 84. The deleted clips were featured on the Parks and Recreation official website within a week of the episode's original production date.|$|E
