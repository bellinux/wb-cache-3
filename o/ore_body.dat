5|$|The Hohokam {{were the}} first people known to have lived and farmed near Jerome from 700 to 1125 BCE. Later, long {{before the arrival of}} Europeans, it is likely that other native peoples mined the United Verde <b>ore</b> <b>body</b> for the {{colorful}} copper-bearing minerals malachite and azurite. The top of the <b>ore</b> <b>body</b> was accessible because it was visible on the surface. In 1585, Spanish explorers made note of the ore but did not mine it because their government had sent them to find gold, not copper.|$|E
5|$|Partial capping (covering) of the site: The <b>ore</b> <b>body</b> in Iron Mountain was {{determined}} to be shallow, so this alternative was considered. However, the recurring high occurrence of fractures in the mountain made this inefficient, so it was also never implemented.|$|E
5|$|Palladium can {{be found}} as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinum-group metals in placer {{deposits}} of the Ural Mountains, Australia, Ethiopia, North and South America. For the production of palladium, these deposits play only a minor role. The most important commercial sources are nickel-copper deposits found in the Sudbury Basin, Ontario, and the Norilsk–Talnakh deposits in Siberia. The other large deposit is the Merensky Reef platinum group metals deposit within the Bushveld Igneous Complex South Africa. The Stillwater igneous complex of Montana and the Roby zone <b>ore</b> <b>body</b> of the Lac des Îles igneous complex of Ontario are the two other sources of palladium in Canada and the United States.

40|$|Abstract: Fe-Ti <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> {{occur in}} the western part of the Sancheong anorthosites around Banggok-ri, Sancheong, Korea. Within <b>ore</b> <b>bodies,</b> a several centimetric size of anorthositic breccia are {{enclaved}} by ore-bearing mafic part and deformed strongly as a sigmoidal form by ductile shearing. The <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> have a general N-S trending foliations with westward dipping directions. The foliation developed in the <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> cut the foliation in anorthosites. The stretching lineations are well developed in the foliated plane of the <b>ore</b> <b>bodies,</b> showing ENE-trending with gentle plunging angle to the ESE direction. The sigmoidal patterns of anorthositic breccia in the <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> indicates the top-to-the-eastnortheastward shearing. Thus, in this study area the relationship between the geometric pattern and the ductile deformation is an important fact to understand the Sancheong Fe-Ti mineralized zone, Korea...|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} mining from {{discovery}} of an <b>ore</b> <b>body</b> through {{extraction of minerals}} and finally to returning the land to its natural state consists of several distinct steps. The first is discovery of the <b>ore</b> <b>body,</b> which is carried out through prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent, location and value of the <b>ore</b> <b>body.</b> This leads to a mathematical resource estimation to estimate the size and grade of the deposit.|$|E

30|$|Ore {{deposits}} are {{the second}} {{main source of}} arsenic. For example, in New Zealand, arsenic released from arsenic-bearing marcasite found in hydrothermal ore deposits formed 5  Ma causes groundwater concentrations of >[*] 100  μg/L (Craw et al. 2000). Although the distribution of naturally occurring arsenic contamination around <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> is generally localized, anthropogenic materials associated with the mining of <b>ore</b> <b>bodies,</b> such as tailings and sludge, expand the area of contamination into the hydrosphere and pedosphere of the surrounding area. The excavated <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> and the ensuing chemical weathering produce sediments highly contaminated with arsenic that then become sources of potential arsenic contamination.|$|R
40|$|Recently contact metasomatic {{zone and}} massive <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> {{were found in}} the {{manganese}} epithermal deposits of the Jokoku mine. Various kinds of contact minerals occur in the contact metasomatic zone which is formed by replacement of the Palaeozoic limestone. The massive <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> also formed by replacement of the limestone. These <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> are made up of carbonate ore consisting predominantly of rhodochrosite, associated with dolomite, calcite, kutnahorite and small amount of sulphide minerals. The parts of the Jokoku mine studied here belong to the metasomatic deposit type, which has been influenced by early hydrothermal solution...|$|R
25|$|Type I Contact Ores: Ores {{along the}} basal contact are {{normally}} localized in footwall embayments, {{most of which}} have been deformed by superimposed deformation, but which in less-deformed areas range from broad shallow embayments (e.g., Alexo, Ontario) and shallow re-entrant embayments (e.g., many Kambalda <b>ore</b> <b>bodies)</b> to subcircular depressions (e.g., some Kamblada <b>ore</b> <b>bodies,</b> Raglan, Quebec).|$|R

25|$|Once the {{analysis}} determines a given <b>ore</b> <b>body</b> is worth recovering, development begins to create {{access to the}} <b>ore</b> <b>body.</b> The mine buildings and processing plants are built, and any necessary equipment is obtained. The operation of the mine to recover the ore begins and continues {{as long as the}} company operating the mine finds it economical to do so. Once all the ore that the mine can produce profitably is recovered, reclamation begins to make the land used by the mine suitable for future use.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, Edison visited an {{industrial}} exhibition in the Sudbury area in Ontario, Canada and thought nickel and cobalt deposits {{there could be}} used in his production of electrical equipment.

25|$|In {{open pit}} mining, {{overburden}} is removed by drilling and blasting {{to expose the}} <b>ore</b> <b>body,</b> which is then mined by blasting and excavation using loaders and dump trucks. Workers spend much time in enclosed cabins thus limiting exposure to radiation. Water is extensively used to suppress airborne dust levels.|$|E
50|$|Migrating fluids {{originate}} from the sediments of the foreland basin and migrate {{in response to}} deformation. As a result, brine can migrate over great distances. Evidence of long-range migration includes: 1) Correlation of petroleum to distant source rocks 2) <b>Ore</b> <b>bodies</b> deposited from metal-bearing brines, 3) Anomalous thermal histories for shallow sediments, 4) Regional potassium metasomatism, 5) Epigenetic dolomite cements in <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> and deep aquifers (Bethke & Marshak 1990).|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, {{production}} from the Mount Isa original Mount Isa <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> began to drop, with copper ore production {{from the upper}} <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> falling from five million tonnes in 1994 to approximately 3.5 million t/y by 2000 because of increased dependence on pillar extraction sequences and increased reliance on truck haulage.

30|$|To summarize, the self-potential method {{can detect}} {{hydrothermal}} <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> more directly than magnetic and plume methods can. The self-potential detects signals from <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> directly, whereas the magnetic method detects {{the degree of}} alteration caused by ore-forming hydrothermal fluids. The plume method detects hydrothermal fluids that are sometimes spread by the ambient ocean current. No single geophysical method can specify all properties of ore deposits, but combining various methods can elucidate ore deposits better.|$|R

25|$|To {{gain access}} to the mineral deposit within an area it is often {{necessary}} to mine through or remove waste material which is not of immediate interest to the miner. The total movement of ore and waste constitutes the mining process. Often more waste than ore is mined during the life of a mine, depending on the nature and location of the <b>ore</b> <b>body.</b> Waste removal and placement is a major cost to the mining operator, so a detailed characterization of the waste material forms {{an essential part of the}} geological exploration program for a mining operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{ability of}} natural {{geologic}} barriers to isolate radioactive waste {{is demonstrated by}} the natural nuclear fission reactors at Oklo, Africa. During their long reaction period about 5.4 tonnes of fission products as well as 1.5 tonnes of plutonium together with other transuranic elements were generated in the uranium <b>ore</b> <b>body.</b> This plutonium and the other transuranics remained immobile until the present day, a span of almost 2 billion years. This is quite remarkable {{in view of the}} fact that ground water had ready access to the deposits and they were not in a chemically inert form, such as glass.|$|E
25|$|A {{possible}} {{sequence of}} events in prehistory involves considering the structure of copper ore deposits, which are mostly sulphides. The surface minerals would contain some native copper and oxidised minerals, {{but much of the}} copper and other minerals would have been washed further into the <b>ore</b> <b>body</b> forming a secondary enrichment zone. This includes many minerals such as tennantite, with their arsenic, copper and iron. So the surface deposits would be used first, and with some work deeper sulphidic ores would have been uncovered and worked, {{and it would have been}} discovered that the material from this level had better properties.|$|E
5|$|These <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> {{formed in}} {{different}} places along a ring fault in the caldera. About 50 million years after they were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part collided with another small plate {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff {{in such a way that}} the two <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> ended up on opposite sides of a fold called the Jerome anticline.|$|R

The ore occurs in sulfide replacement deposits of three types: 1) thin-bedded deposits in the Sawatch Quartzite, (2) highly elongated <b>ore</b> <b>bodies</b> in the Leadville Limestone (here completely dolomitized), and (3) vertical pipes or chimneys cutting across the various formations. The ore minerals {{in order of}} decreasing abundance are sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and galena. The non-ore minerals pyrite and siderite are also abundant in the <b>ore</b> <b>bodies.</b>|$|R
