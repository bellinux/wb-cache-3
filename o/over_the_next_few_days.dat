5|$|On August11, a {{tropical}} cyclone appeared east of Luzon. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> it {{moved across the}} Philippines, passing near the island of Mindoro on August13. The system moved across the South China Sea, intensifying into a typhoon as it approached Vietnam. Although it paralleled the coast, the system dissipated over the Gulf of Tonkin on August17.|$|E
5|$|The remnant low drifted south {{towards the}} Gulf of Mexico before being absorbed by a cold front (which also picked {{remnants}} of Subtropical Depression Twenty-two), and moving northeast.

5|$|A rogue unit of insurgents {{headed by}} Algirdas Klimaitis and {{encouraged}} by Germans from the Sicherheitspolizei and Sicherheitsdienst, started anti-Jewish pogroms in Kaunas (Kovno) {{on the night}} of 25–26 June 1941. Over a thousand Jews perished <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> in what was the first pogrom in Nazi-occupied Lithuania. Different sources give different figures, one being 1,500 and another 3,800, with additional victims in other towns of the region.|$|E

5|$|During 26 December, the Fiji Meteorological Service {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression that had developed within the Intertropical Convergence Zone, about 575km (355mi) to the south-east of Nauru. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> the depression gradually developed and organised further, {{as it moved}} towards the west-southwest {{under the influence of}} a north-easterly steering flow. During 28 December, the JTWC classified the depression as Tropical Cyclone 05P, before the FMS named it Rewa as it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the system gradually intensified under the influence of favourable upper-level winds while it moved towards the south-southwest, passing through the Solomon Islands on 29December and affecting the southeastern islands of Papua New Guinea. As it moved through the Solomon Islands, Rewa moved out of the South Pacific basin and into the Australian region, where the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) took the primary warning responsibility for the system.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June a {{group of}} rebels reached Thetford, and from there the revolt spread over {{south-western}} Norfolk towards the Fens. At {{the same time the}} rebels, led by Geoffrey Litster, moved across the north-eastern part of the county and tried to raise support throughout the local area. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the rebels converged on Norwich, Lynn and Swaffham.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April The Observer (the Guardians sister paper) {{published}} the first photograph of Tomlinson {{lying on the}} ground next to riot police. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> the IPCC told reporters that Tomlinson's family were not surprised that he had had a heart attack.

5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the {{battalion}} dug {{in on the}} first and second ridges under heavy fire from the Turks.

At this stage, the battalion was 450-strong. By 1 May, 30 officers and 940 other ranks from the battalion had landed.|$|E
5|$|The {{impactor}} returned {{images as}} late as three seconds before impact.

5|$|In late July 1861, Lowe {{inflated}} {{a balloon}} in Washington with hopes of providing aerial {{coverage for the}} impending Battle of Bull Run, but a violent storm buffeted the inflated balloon and delayed Lowe until word of the Union defeat reached him on the road.

5|$|Kinkaid next became Executive Officer of , {{one of the}} navy's newest battleships, in February 1933.

He sent medical and relief supplies ashore from Colorado.|$|E
5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387 was a {{gravitational}} microlensing event {{detected by}} the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics collaboration on July 24, 2009, which searches and documents chance and brief alignments of stars with other stars or objects; such alignments cause a gravitational lens effect, which bends light and causes distorted, but magnified, images {{that can be}} interpreted. The detection of two caustics were logged <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> by the South African Astronomical Observatory, the Perth Observatory, and the Canopus Hill Observatory in Tasmania, with a separation of about seven days between caustic events.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June, the French {{suffered}} a defeat at the Battle of Trebbia, and consequently the Austrians {{were able to}} move more decisively against Mantua. On 4 July the siege entered a new stage, with Austrian reinforcements arriving, and the besieging force growing from 8,000 to 40,000. The Austrians were commanded by Hungarian general Baron Pal von Kray, an artillery expert. Artillery bombardment was constant. On 24-25 July the assault begun; and the Austrians slowly advanced <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b> On 27 July Foissac-Latour began negotiating surrender terms.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} several days, Bilis moved {{generally}} northwestward toward Taiwan, slowly strengthening over open waters. Bilis was designated a severe tropical storm by the JMA on July 11, but the storm did not strengthen much further <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> due to a marginal upper-air environment and dry air entrainment. PAGASA upgraded the system to typhoon status on July 12, but the JMA never officially recognized the system as such in its advisories. Bilis reached its official peak intensity of 60knots (110km/h, 70mph) later that day.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 Oman cyclone (also {{known as}} Cyclone 02A) was a {{tenacious}} and deadly system that caused historic flooding {{in the southern}} Arabian Peninsula. It originated from a disturbance in the Gulf of Aden, the first such tropical cyclogenesis on record. After moving eastward, the system interacted with the monsoon trough and became a tropical storm on June11. Later that day, it turned toward Oman and struck the country's southeast coast. It weakened over land, dissipating on June12, although it continued to produce rainfall – heavy at times – <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} {{the west coast}} of Africa on October3. It tracked westward, reaching the Caribbean Sea on October10. By October13, a large area of convection persisted from Hispaniola southwestward through Panama, and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days</b> the convection organized and concentrated in the northwestern Caribbean Sea. An anticyclone became established near Jamaica on October15, which created a favorable upper-level environment for the system by reducing wind shear. Around the same time, a low-level trough emerged from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, heading north off the coast of Nicaragua. Early on October 16, the system developed into a broad tropical depression about halfway between Central America and Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Around May6, {{the monsoon}} trough {{extended}} across the southern Bay of Bengal, producing a vast field of thunderstorm activity. A broad low-pressure area {{formed by the}} next day and remained nearly stationary. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> the convection varied in intensity until becoming more organized around the nascent surface low on May10. At 03:00UTC on May10, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported the formation of a depression about 535km (330mi) west of Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Within nine hours, the depression further intensified into a deep depression. Around the same time, the system was classified as Tropical Cyclone 01B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the reactor}} itself {{commenced}} in February 1944. Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>days,</b> 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began {{to withdraw the}} control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.|$|E
