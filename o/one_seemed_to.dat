5|$|While lions do {{not usually}} hunt people, some (usually males) seem {{to seek out}} human prey; one well-publicised case {{includes}} the Tsavo maneaters, where 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Kenya-Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during {{the construction of a}} bridge over the Tsavo River in Kenya in 1898. The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour. The lions were larger than normal, lacked manes, and <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.|$|E
25|$|At school, {{as well as}} in church, Francisco's claimed paranormal power {{constantly}} {{would put}} him into trouble. Once, while in his fourth year of primary school, he claimed to have seen a man who had dictated all his school essays, but no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have given him any credits; and not even the teacher seemed to have cared about it. One of his memorial school compositions on the centenary of the independence of Brazil won an honorable mention in a state contest. In 1922 he faced skepticism from colleagues and friends, who accused him of plagiarism, such accusation lasted all his life. Challenged to prove his gifts, Francisco was submitted to the challenge of improvising an essay (with the help of a spirit) about sand grain, the topic was chosen at that very moment, in which, he succeeded.|$|E

2500|$|The pair began asserting their {{perceived}} immunity from normal restrictions with acts of petty theft and vandalism. Breaking into a fraternity {{house at the}} university, they stole penknives, a camera, and a typewriter [...] that they later used to type their ransom note.

2500|$|Other reasons {{include the}} passage not being {{something}} a devout Jew such as Josephus would write (especially, [...] "if it be lawful {{to call him}} a man" [...] and [...] "doer of incredible deeds"), as his writing was usually sophisticated and would have explained {{anything out of the}} ordinary to his Gentile audience, such as explaining what the word [...] "Christ" [...] means, why Jesus was called that and further explanations such as how he won over many Jews and Greeks, as he did for every other group (see [...] ), or why he would mention Jesus [...] "appearing" [...] in the [...] "third day"—a Christian creed—without explaining it and how no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> notice this passage until the 4th century, not even Origen who quotes Josephus extensively in his works, thus leading mythicists to think that the Testimonium Flavianum is a forgery of the 4th century, perhaps written by Eusebius in order to provide an outside Jewish authority for the life of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930, Mencken married Sara Haardt, a German American {{professor}} of English at Goucher College in Baltimore and an author eighteen years his junior. Haardt had led efforts in Alabama {{to ratify the}} 19th Amendment. The two met in 1923, after Mencken delivered a lecture at Goucher; a seven-year courtship ensued. The marriage made national headlines, and many were surprised that Mencken, who once called marriage [...] "the end of hope" [...] and who was well known for mocking relations between the sexes, {{had gone to the}} altar. [...] "The Holy Spirit informed and inspired me," [...] Mencken said. [...] "Like all other infidels, I am superstitious and always follow hunches: this <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be a superb one." [...] Even more startling, he was marrying an Alabama native, despite his having written scathing essays about the American South. Haardt was in poor health from tuberculosis throughout their marriage and died in 1935 of meningitis, leaving Mencken grief-stricken. He had always championed her writing and, after her death, had a collection of her short stories published under the title Southern Album.|$|E

2500|$|It is, however, {{said that}} Plato once {{disclosed}} this {{knowledge to the}} public in his lecture On the Good (Περὶ τἀγαθοῦ), in which the Good (τὸ ἀγαθόν) is identified with the One (the Unity, τὸ ἕν), the fundamental ontological principle. The content of this lecture has been transmitted by several witnesses. Aristoxenus describes the event in the following words: [...] "Each came expecting to learn something about the things that are generally considered good for men, such as wealth, good health, physical strength, and altogether a kind of wonderful happiness. But when the mathematical demonstrations came, including numbers, geometrical figures and astronomy, and finally the statement Good is <b>One</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> them, I imagine, utterly unexpected and strange; hence some belittled the matter, while others rejected it." [...] Simplicius quotes Alexander of Aphrodisias, who states that [...] "according to Plato, the first principles of everything, including the Forms themselves are One and Indefinite Duality (ἡ ἀόριστος δυάς), which he called Large and Small (τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρόν)", and Simplicius reports as well that [...] "one might also learn this from Speusippus and Xenocrates and the others who were present at Plato's lecture on the Good".|$|E
2500|$|The lead {{character}} of Dan Waziri posed a challenge; a Northerner {{is needed to}} play the role, and Afolayan stated {{that there is a}} particular [...] "look" [...] that has been associated with people of the sixties. He also pointed out that he needed an actor who could not only speak Hausa, but would represent the ethnic group as well.

However, his whereabouts were not known at the time as {{the last time he had}} been seen was in the 1998 Mahmood Ali-Balogun's short film A Place Called Home, produced by MNet Eventually, Afolayan was able to find a recent interview he granted, thereby getting connected to Daba through the interviewer. Sadiq Daba was prepared for Waziri's character for a period of 8 months before filming commenced. On a day of shoot, a serious disagreement occurred between Daba and Afolayan that Daba walked out on set; the dispute however was eventually settled and shooting was resumed. Daba in an interview expressed enthusiastically that Kunle Afolayan is a filmmaker he was glad to be associated with.|$|E

It became a staple part in the {{repertory}} of the theatre, reaching its hundredth performance there on 25January 1913. In 1908, Maggie Teyte took {{over the role of}} Mélisande from Mary Garden. She described Debussy's reaction on learning her nationality: [...] "Une autre anglaiseMon Dieu" [...] ("Another Englishwomanmy God"). Teyte also wrote about the composer's perfectionist character and his relations with the cast:As a teacher he was pedanticthat's the only word. Really pedantic [...] There was a core of anger and bitterness in himI often think he was rather like Golaud in Pelléas and yet he wasn't. He wasit's in all his musica very sensual man.

However, he did supervise the first foreign production of the opera, which appeared at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, Brussels on 9 January 1907. This was followed by foreign premieres in Frankfurt on 19 April of the same year, New York City at the Manhattan Opera House on 19February 1908, and at La Scala, Milan with Arturo Toscanini conducting on 2 April 1908. It first appeared in the United Kingdom at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 21 May 1909.|$|E

2500|$|Ryun {{participated in}} the 1964, 1968, and 1972 Summer Olympics. At age 17 years, 137 days in 1964, he remains the {{youngest}} American male track athlete to ever qualify for the Olympics. In 1968, he won the silver medal in the 1,500 meters in Mexico City, losing to Kip Keino from Kenya, whose remarkable race remained the Olympic 1,500-meter record for 16 years. Before the race, Ryun had thought that a time of 3:39 would {{be good enough to}} win in the high altitude of Mexico City. He ended up running faster than that with a 3:37.8, but Keino's 3:34.9 was too tough to beat at that altitude. Keino moved into the first position with two laps to go (800 meters) at world record pace. Ryun continued to move up during the last two laps from eighth to second but was never closer than about 30 yards from Keino. Years later, in 1981, he told Tex Maule in an interview for The Runner magazine, [...] "We had thought that 3:39 would win and I ran under that. I considered it like winning a gold medal; I had done my very best and I still believe I would have won at sea level." [...] Ryun was attacked by some writers who believed he had let his nation down. [...] "Some even said I had let down the whole world. I didn't get any credit for running my best and no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> realize that Keino had performed brilliantly." [...] In the 1972 Munich, Germany, Games, he was tripped and fell down during a 1,500-meter qualifying heat. Although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) acknowledged that a foul had occurred, U.S. appeals to have Ryun reinstated in the competition were denied by the IOC.|$|E
2500|$|Orbison {{continued}} recording albums in the 1970s, {{but none}} of them sold {{more than a handful of}} copies, and by 1976, he had gone an entire decade without a charting album. Aside from a few minor hits in Australia, he also failed to produce any charting singles after the '60s. His fortunes sank so low that he began to doubt his own talents and several of his '70s albums were not released internationally due to low US sales. He left MGM Records in 1973 and signed a one-album deal with Mercury Records. Author Peter Lehman would later observe that his absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: [...] "Since it was never clear where he had come from, no <b>one</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone." [...] His influence was apparent, however, as several artists released covers of his songs, which proved popular. Orbison's version of [...] "Love Hurts", a song composed by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and first recorded by the Everly Brothers, was remade by Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, again by hard rock band Nazareth, and by blues adept Jim Capaldi. Sonny James sent [...] "Only the Lonely" [...] to No. 1 on the country music charts. Bruce Springsteen ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and Glen Campbell had a minor hit with a remake of [...] "Dream Baby". A compilation of Orbison's greatest hits went to No. 1 in the UK in January 1976. The same year, he began to open concerts for the Eagles, who started as Linda Ronstadt's backup band. Ronstadt herself covered [...] "Blue Bayou" [...] in 1977, her version reaching No. 3 on the Billboard charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career. He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded [...] "Regeneration" [...] with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.|$|E
