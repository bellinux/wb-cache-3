25|$|In {{addition}} to ethanol and water, most alcoholic drinks also contain congeners, either as flavoring or as {{a by-product of}} fermentation and the wine aging process. While ethanol is by itself sufficient to produce most hangover effects, congeners may potentially aggravate hangover and <b>other</b> <b>residual</b> effects to some extent. Congeners include substances such as amines, amides, acetones, acetaldehydes, polyphenols, methanol, histamines, fusel oil, esters, furfural, and tannins, many {{but not all of}} which are toxic. One study in mice indicates that fusel oil may have a mitigating effect on hangover symptoms, while some whiskey congeners such as butanol protect the stomach against gastric mucosal damage in the rat. Different types of alcoholic beverages contain different amounts of congeners. In general, dark liquors have a higher concentration while clear liquors have a lower concentration. Whereas vodka has virtually no more congeners than pure ethanol, bourbon has a total congener content 37 times higher than that found in vodka.|$|E

[...] Heavy equipment assisted ground crews as they prepared areas for future burnout operations. [...] During the day, the fire remained active all along its west side, moving slowly through the wilderness toward Route 242. [...] In the northwest, the fire continued to burn on the northern slope of Black Crater; and in the southwest, it moved into the lighter fuels that have grown up in the area burned by the 2012 Pole Creek Fire. [...] On the northeast and southeast sides of the fire, crews patrolled the fire lines and prepared to begin mop-up operations while state fire marshal teams spent the day at the Black Butte Ranch and <b>other</b> <b>residual</b> areas helping homeowners make their property more fire resistant. [...] By the end of the day, the fire covered [...] and was 32 percent contained with 673 firefighters on station. On August 24, fire behavior was moderate with flames slowly burning ground cover and occasionally torching taller trees as the fire moves through the wilderness toward Route 242. [...] The fire continued to burn on the north and west slopes of Black Crater out of reach of firefighters. [...] During the day, a cold front moved through the area, clearing out the smoke and slowing the fire's progress. [...] The clear skies allowed air support to be resumed.

50|$|Most of the {{facilities}} which historically burned No. 6 or <b>other</b> <b>residual</b> oils were industrial plants and similar facilities constructed in the early or mid 20th century, or which had switched from coal to oil fuel {{during the same time}} period. In either case, residual oil was seen as a good prospect because it was cheap and readily available. Most of these facilities have subsequently been closed and demolished, or have replaced their fuel supplies with a simpler one such as gas or No. 2 oil. The high sulfur content of No. 6 oil—up to 3% by weight in some extreme cases—had a corrosive effect on many heating systems (which were usually designed without adequate corrosion protection in mind), shortening their lifespans and increasing the polluting effects. This was particularly the case in furnaces that were regularly shut down and allowed to go cold, since the internal condensation produced sulfuric acid.|$|E
40|$|Beta {{regression}} {{is often}} used to model the relationship between a dependent variable that assumes values on the open interval (0, 1) and a set of predictor variables. An important challenge in beta regression is to find residuals whose distribution is well approximated by the standard normal distribution. Two previous works compared residuals in beta regression, but the authors did not include the quantile residual. Using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, this paper studies the behavior of certain residuals in beta regression in several scenarios. Overall, the results suggest that the distribution of the quantile residual is better approximated by the standard normal distribution than that of the <b>other</b> <b>residuals</b> in most scenarios.

The stress-strain compression curves obtained are compared with those corresponding to as compacted samples.

The former has skewed distribution and the latter has negative mean, specially when the variance of the response variable is high. In this work, we introduce the adjusted quantile residual for generalized linear models.
