40|$|This thesis {{develops}} an algorithm to fuse {{redundant observations}} due to multiple sensor (type and location) coverage {{in order to}} provide a significant reduction in duplicate track information provided to Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) operator displays. The design of the algorithm allows acceptance of inputs from any type of sensor (radar, acoustic, OPS, system generated and manual tracks) as long as the basic decision criteria elements are provided. The result of this effort is a computationally efficient and cost effective software solution to a significant system deficiency that impacts greatly on <b>overall</b> <b>waterway</b> safety. The algorithm is tested with real data collected from the VTS system at Puget Sound in September 1996. The results indicate that the algorithm correctly fuses redundant sensor observations on the same vessel resulting in a significant reduction in the amount of unnecessary information presented to the VTS operator.

40|$|Understanding the {{characteristics}} of vessel traffic flow is crucial in maintaining navigation safety, efficiency, and <b>overall</b> <b>waterway</b> transportation management. Factors influencing vessel traffic flow possess diverse features such as hierarchy, uncertainty, nonlinearity, complexity, and interdependency. To reveal the impact mechanism of the factors influencing vessel traffic flow, a hierarchical model and a coupling model are proposed in this study based on the interpretative structural modeling method. The hierarchical model explains the hierarchies and relationships of the factors using a graph. The coupling model provides a quantitative method that explores interaction effects of factors using a coupling coefficient. The coupling coefficient is obtained by determining the quantitative indicators of the factors and their weights. Thereafter, the data obtained from Port of Tianjin is used to verify the proposed coupling model. The {{results show that the}} hierarchical model of the factors influencing vessel traffic flow can explain the level, structure, and interaction effect of the factors; the coupling model is efficient in analyzing factors influencing traffic volumes. The proposed method can be used for analyzing increases in vessel traffic flow in waterway transportation system...|$|E
30|$|The <b>overall</b> <b>waterway</b> {{transport}} (sea, river, lake) and its organization, combined {{particularly with}} {{the location of the}} relating activities, have a strong impact, perhaps more than other modes of transport, in the location patterns of the productive activities and the evolution of spatial organization. Before the great advances in the field of transport, production activities were characterized by dispersion in space, which dominated until about the mid- 19 th century [1]. During this period, key location factor was the existence of raw materials such as minerals, wool, etc., energy resources such as wood, wind, water, etc. and natural ways of communication, such as natural ports, waterways etc. [2]. Although transport has not yet developed largely in conjunction with the physical characteristics of regions, it {{play an important role in}} the location of activities and the distribution of settlements, particularly through the opportunities provided by the waterways and the relevant means [3]. The production units which rely upon specialized local manpower and the needs for the organization of the relevant activities combined with the morphological characteristics of the regions, determined the socioeconomic organization, the every day life, the form of residence, models of exchange and communication [4].|$|E
500|$|Although the {{aqueduct}} was [...] wide <b>overall,</b> the <b>waterway</b> {{it carried}} {{was only half}} that width. The Bridgewater Canal had been built to accommodate the Mersey flat boats then in common use, which had a beam of about , making two-way traffic impossible. A signalling system was therefore installed to control access to the aqueduct. A pole [...] high in {{the centre of the}} arch at the Stretford bank supported a semaphore system with two arms on each side, operated by levers at ground level.|$|R
5000|$|The Unified Deep Water System of European Russia (Единая глубоководная система Европейской части Российской Федерации) or UDWS (ЕГС) is {{a system}} of inland {{waterways}} in Russia linking the White Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Volga River, Moscow, the Caspian Sea and—via the Sea of Azov—the Black Sea. In 2010, UDWS carried 70 million tons of cargo and 12 million passengers, making up two-thirds of <b>overall</b> inland <b>waterway</b> traffic volume in Russia. There are 60 common-use ports and quays on UDWS, including 3 international ports (2 in Moscow and 1 in Dmitrov, Moscow Oblast). Owing to UDWS, Moscow is sometimes called [...] "the port of the five seas".|$|R
50|$|Canalisation from Cambrai down to Valenciennes was {{completed}} in 1788. Napoleon saw the benefits of linking Paris to Belgium and accelerated completion of the Canal de Saint-Quentin to the south. The locks were deepened and doubled, as coal became the essential commodity of the industrial revolution. Upgrading downstream from Bouchain was started in the 1960s in both France and Flanders, but the waterway is still not fully compliant with European standards. All the locks on the high-capacity section are being doubled by European Class Vb size locks, 185m by 12m, {{as part of the}} <b>overall</b> European Seine-Scheldt <b>waterway</b> project The Pont des Trous, a listed fortified bridge in Tournai that has already been substantially modified, will again be raised to provide the necessary dimensions, including an air draught of 7.10m.|$|R
40|$|Coastal areas {{across the}} world are {{experiencing}} rapid population growth. One of the main drivers of this growth is the aesthetic value of coastal regions, which is based at least partly on good environmental quality. However, {{in the absence of}} good management, this population growth has the potential to degrade environmental quality. Changes in coastal condition are not only important in terms of environmental impacts, but are also likely to affect {{the quality of life of}} people living in the coastal zone. Information on potential social implications of resource management actions is increasingly required before management decisions are made. However, there are few tools available to assess the impacts of changes in environmental resource condition on people. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a system dynamics model that can be used to assess the potential impacts of changes in the condition of coastal waterways on human quality of life. The model is based on the Pumicestone catchment in south-east Queensland. It consists of three sub-models; environmental condition, human health, and social wellbeing. The environmental sub-model is very simple, and includes population growth and management actions driving decreases and increases in waterway condition respectively. Waterway condition is made up of water quality, vegetation and biota. The health model is driven by changes in the environmental sub-model. Enterococci concentrations (a water quality indicator) are positively related to the risk of coming down with gastrointestinal illness; bacterial and heavy metal contamination of oysters (biota indicator) leads to increased health risk and the potential closure of oyster aquaculture farms; and increased iron concentrations in the water promote summer blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula (vegetation indicator), which can cause dermatitis in swimmers. Perceived waterway condition is driven by <b>overall</b> <b>waterway</b> condition (comprising water quality, vegetation and biota) and affects the frequency and duration of recreational visits made to coastal waterways. Recreational visits result in greater amounts of exercise, and also contribute to overall mental and physical health. In terms of social impacts, recreational visits are related to attachment to place and social interaction, which in turn lead to wider social networks and the sense of belonging to the place, significant determinants of quality of life. Place attachment is also related to willingness to contribute to an area and rates of volunteerism, both of which have positive contributions to waterway management. Results from three scenarios show that social and health aspects of wellbeing deteriorate as a result of population growth in the absence of management, but improve if management efforts are sufficient to offset the negative impacts from population growth. However, the positive effects are diminished, and in some cases do not occur within the model timescale, when management efforts are delayed relative to population growth. Dynamic models offer a potentially very useful tool for integrated impact assessment. The integrated quality of life assessment framework described here can be easily generalised to other places and situations, including other types of natural resource management, and offers a potentially valuable tool for natural resource managers...|$|E
