5|$|When the Spanish–American War broke out, Savage {{volunteered to}} lead men in battle. Instead, {{he was given}} command of an {{engineering}} unit which then built a complete base in Havana. Returning to New York, he wrote more books and corresponded with his wife who traveled often to the Russian Empire to visit their daughter and her Russian husband. Four years after mustering out of the Army, Savage was knocked down and mortally wounded {{at the age of}} 57 by a horse and carriage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York.|$|E
5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York, {{is walking}} towards the hotel. As {{she begins to}} notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting {{back to the hotel}} while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E

25|$|After being paroled, he took {{political}} science classes at Baruch College in New York City for two semesters {{at the behest}} of his father, who allowed Coronel to live with him on the condition that he goes to school. Honing his rapping skills in jail, and unable to find decent wage-paying employment after his release, he began selling his music <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York and battling with MCs. This, coupled with his victories in numerous freestyle rap competitions of the New York underground hip hop scene such as Rocksteady Anniversary and Braggin Rites, led to his reputation as a ferocious Battle MC.|$|E
25|$|Cooper felt Creelman's {{final draft}} was slow-paced, {{too full of}} flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition, and written {{on a scale that}} would have been prohibitively {{expensive}} to film. Writer Ruth Rose (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled Kong for production. Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner, who Carey has previously worked with on other music videos. Throughout the video, Carey plays both herself and {{the character of the}} male stalker, dressed in a bellhop uniform, as well as a gray hoodie and sweatpants. Two videos were shot for [...] "Obsessed", one for the original version, and one for the remixed version, which features rapper Gucci Mane. The video was shot predominantly at the Plaza Hotel, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York City. After several photographs of Carey dressed as the stalker were leaked, tabloids immediately compared Carey's costume to Eminem's usual attire. Carey performed the song live on the fourth season of America's Got Talent, The Today Show, and throughout her Angels Advocate Tour (2009–10). Both the song and video have many references about 2004 film Mean Girls.|$|E
500|$|When Kirk and Spock are {{traveling}} {{on a public}} bus, they encounter a punk rocker blaring his music on a boom box, to the discomfort of everyone around him. Spock takes matters {{into his own hands}} and performs a Vulcan nerve pinch. Part of the inspiration for the scene came from Nimoy's personal experiences with a similar character <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York; [...] " [...] by the arrogance of it, the aggressiveness of it, and I thought if I was Spock I'd pinch his brains out!" [...] On learning about the scene, Kirk Thatcher, an associate producer on the film, convinced Nimoy to let him play the role; Thatcher shaved his hair into a mohawk and bought clothes to complete the part. Credited as [...] "punk on bus", Thatcher (along with sound designer Mark Mangini) also wrote and recorded [...] "I Hate You", the song in the scene, and it was his idea to have the punk—rendered unconscious by the pinch—hit the stereo and turn it off with his face.|$|E

500|$|That week {{produced}} the film's famous opening number New York, New York. Away from both studio interference and sound stage constrictions, Donen and cinematographer Harold Rosson shot a scene <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York City that pioneered many cinematic techniques {{that would not}} be used again until they were popularized by the French New Wave ten years later. These techniques included spatial jump cuts, 360-degree pans, hidden cameras, abrupt changes of screen direction and non-professional actors. Donen's biographer Joseph A. Casper stated that the scene avoids being gratuitous or amateurish, while still [...] "developing plot, describing the setting while conveying its galvanizing atmosphere and manic mood, introducing and delineating character." [...] Casper also said that [...] "Today the film is regarded as a turning point: the first bona fide musical that moved dance, as well as the musical genre, out of the theater and captured it with and for film rather than on film; the first to make the city an important character; and the first to abandon the chorus." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Brett Ratner, who had previously worked with Carey on six other music videos, and was shot from June 28 to 29, 2009. Throughout the video, Carey plays herself and a male stalker, dressed as both a bellhop and {{a man wearing a}} gray hoodie and sweatpants. Two videos were shot for [...] "Obsessed", one for the original version, and one for the remixed version, which features Gucci Mane. The video was shot predominantly at the Plaza Hotel, and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York City. After several photographs of Carey dressed as the stalker were leaked, critics and bloggers immediately compared Carey's costume to Eminem's usual attire, and many wrote that aside from the goatee, the pair looked alike. Carey tweeted [...] "I am not at any point in the video playing a specific person. I'm dressed as a 'stalker' in 3 different ensembles." [...] Carey also revealed that the music video would reference several of her favorite films, such as Mean Girls (2004), with the line [...] "Why are you so obsessed with me?", as well as The Devil Wears Prada (2006).|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} 1974. The budget was $1.5 million. Pre-production lasted one week, including casting. Grittier sequences were shot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York City, while less serious locations were shot on Warner Bros.' sound stages in Los Angeles. According to Bakshi, [...] "What I {{would do is}} dress guys up, live-action guys. Very strange dudes! The weirdest guys I could find. Having them talk to animated characters in front of candy stores, discussing girlfriends and such. It was very surrealistic." [...] Yaphet Kotto and the glam punk band New York Dolls were cast in the live action sequences, with the New York Dolls playing homosexuals. Mean Streets actors Richard Romanus and David Proval were cast as the voices of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro. Much of the shooting of live action sequences and recording of animated dialogue involved improvisation, with Bakshi setting up {{the premise of the}} scene and allowing his actors to create their own dialogue. During the [...] "rumble" [...] sequence, the actors playing the Chaplains were filmed popping and performing styles of dance which later evolved into breakdancing, dance styles which were unheard of in the 1970s studio system.|$|E

500|$|Foley {{accepted}} {{the failure of}} the film saying, [...] "I knew it was doomed before even filming started. The day before the first shoot, I sat in my hotel and looked to the script thinking, 'Damn, wish I could re-write this whole thing.' After the film released, my dad called me up saying 'you know The New York Times are calling it the worst film of the year." [...] He recalled that both he and Madonna chose to overlook {{the failure of the}} film, and remembered one incident when he met Madonna at a hotel lobby. [...] "She just looked to me once and said, 'So it's a flop right?' That's the only time she ever mentioned the film. Even Sean also never mentioned it in front of her." [...] In another article in The New York Times, Vincent Canby noted that Madonna's real personality is of a [...] "knowing, shrewd, pragmatic young woman, a performer of invigorating energy who still looks a lot like Marilyn Monroe, even with short hair, but who has much more in common with the enthusiastic, unembarrassed, comic tartness of Jean Harlow, somehow let loose <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York in the 80's." [...] However, he felt that Who's That Girl failed to portray that image, leading to its failure. The first half of the film showed a different personality of Madonna, trying to be comical, which was not accepted by the public.|$|E
