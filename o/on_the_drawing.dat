In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and Nord Aviation, as well as Dassault. All three returned designs based on Küchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a ramjet powered design flying at Mach 3, {{the other two were}} jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board.|$|E
5|$|Nansen was now {{considered}} an oracle by all would-be explorers {{of the north}} and south polar regions. Abruzzi had consulted him, as had the Belgian Adrien de Gerlache, each of whom took expeditions to the Antarctic. Although Nansen refused to meet his own countryman and fellow-explorer Carsten Borchgrevink (whom he considered a fraud), he gave advice to Robert Falcon Scott on polar equipment and transport, prior to the 1901–04 Discovery Expedition. At one point Nansen seriously considered leading a South Pole expedition himself, and asked Colin Archer to design two ships. However, these plans remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board.|$|E

So the Luftwaffe settled on the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft, with the Fw 190F becoming the ground-attack version.

5|$|A highway roughly {{parallel}} to the modern I-275 was included in early planning maps for the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. As plans developed through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, the freeway was to run from I-75 near Newport north to Novi and connect back to I-75 near Davisburg. Some plans in the 1970s had the northern Novi–Davisburg section numbered as a state highway M-275. The southern half of I-275 was built in segments that were completed in January 1977. Later that month, the state canceled the northern section because of local opposition. A later attempt to revive the proposal failed in 1979. Additional plans to complete M-275 through Oakland County were kept <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> boards through the 1980s, but failed to materialize. M-5 (Haggerty Connector) opened along part of the former I-275/M-275 right-of-way between 1994 and 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous step forward and a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{new method}} for {{predicting}} {{the position of}} the galling generation in square cup drawing is proposed based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fact that galling at a drawn cup occurs at the position subjected to the maximum temperature and at the moment that the position is just sliding out from the die. Three kinds of blank shape, square, octagon, and tricontadigon are used to change <b>the</b> galling position <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawn</b> cup. FEM simulation shows that galling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drawn</b> cup occurs {{at the top of the}} boundary between <b>the</b> <b>drawn</b> area and <b>the</b> bent area for the square blank and at the top of the middle of <b>the</b> <b>drawn</b> zone for <b>the</b> octagon or tricontadigon blank.
