A civilization that sees itself {{on the brink of}} decline might use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy, with its cultures, values, religions, sciences, technologies, and laws, so that they may not die along with their civilization.|$|E
5|$|Einstein was {{now without}} a {{permanent}} home, unsure {{where he would}} live and work, and equally worried about the fate <b>of</b> <b>countless</b> other scientists still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander Oliver Locker-Lampson, who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein, Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside London, with photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding Einstein, published in the Daily Herald on 24 July 1933.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long {{military}} campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy <b>of</b> <b>countless</b> farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus {{into the ranks of}} the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E

5|$|The Abbey of Saint Mary de Pratis, more {{commonly}} known as Leicester Abbey, was an Augustinian religious house {{in the city of}} Leicester, in the English Midlands. The abbey was founded in the 12th century by the Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester, and grew to become the wealthiest religious establishment within Leicestershire. Through patronage and donations the abbey gained the advowsons <b>of</b> <b>countless</b> churches throughout England, and acquired a considerable amount of land, and several manorial lordships. Leicester Abbey also maintained a cell (a small dependent daughter house) at Cockerham Priory, in Lancashire. The Abbey's prosperity was boosted though the passage of special privileges by both the English Kings and the Pope. These included an exemption from sending representatives to parliament and from paying tithe on certain land and livestock. Despite its privileges and sizeable landed estates, from the late 14th century the abbey began to suffer financially and was forced to lease out its estates. The worsening financial situation was exacerbated throughout the 15th century and early 16th century by a series of incompetent, corrupt and extravagant abbots. By 1535 the abbey's considerable income was exceeded by even more considerable debts.|$|E

It is governed exclusively neither by causality, nor by intentionality. In this space of in-betweenness phenomenology can overcome its inaugural opposition to naturalism.|$|E

25|$|Fermat's last theorem {{was first}} conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637, famously {{in the margin}} of a copy of Arithmetica where he claimed he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. No {{successful}} proof was published until 1995 despite the efforts <b>of</b> <b>countless</b> mathematicians during the 358 intervening years.
