5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the mating season, adult females move from the periphery towards the central male territories where they become part of short-term ‘harems’ that consist of a male and an unstable group of up to five females. Centrally located males are polygamous, while males on the periphery are monogamous or single. The mating system of the grey-headed flying fox is best described as a lek because males do not provide any essential resources to females and are chosen on the basis <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> location within the roost, which correlates with male quality.|$|E
5|$|Training {{began in}} early October in Wales and was {{designed}} to be extremely arduous, not only to ensure that those who took part were at the peak <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> and mental fitness, but also to eliminate any men unable to cope with the long marches and difficult terrain that would be encountered during the operation. When this portion of the training had been completed, the sappers were then transferred to the area around Fort William in Scotland, where they were familiarised with a hydroelectric plant similar in design to the one in Norway, and received training on {{the most efficient way to}} plant explosives in the Norsk Hydro plant to cause maximum damage.|$|E
5|$|Twins were {{subjected}} to weekly examinations and measurements <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> attributes by Mengele {{or one of his}} assistants. Experiments performed by Mengele on twins included unnecessary amputation of limbs, intentionally infecting one twin with typhus or other diseases, and transfusing the blood of one twin into the other. Many of the victims died while undergoing these procedures. After an experiment was over, the twins were sometimes killed and their bodies dissected. Nyiszli recalled one occasion where Mengele personally killed fourteen twins in one night via a chloroform injection to the heart. If one twin died of disease, Mengele killed the other so that comparative post-mortem reports could be prepared.|$|E

25|$|A minor-planet moon is {{an astronomical}} object that orbits a minor planet as its natural satellite.

25|$|The Foundation Pit (Russian: Котлован, kotlovan) is {{a gloomy}} {{symbolic}} and semi-satirical novel by Andrei Platonov. The {{plot of the}} novel concerns a group of workers living in the early Soviet Union.

The workers dig each day but slowly cease to understand the meaning of their work. The enormous foundation pit sucks out all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> and mental energy.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{dysphoria}} {{or gender}} identity disorder (GID) {{occurs when the}} child identifies himself or herself as the opposite sex. GID, previously known as transsexualism, occurs when a person has {{a strong desire to}} be the opposite sex because they feel uncomfortable in their own body. This may lead to cross-dressing or the desire to rid <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> characteristic. GID is accompanied with a distress that the individual cannot change their sex and a strong rejection for sex-typical behaviours. Onset of most of these behaviors occurs as early as two to four years of age.|$|E

25|$|It is {{stated that}} if a student is {{successful}} in awakening consciousness, {{he or she will}} eventually experience a continuous state of vigilance not only during the day but also while the physical body is sleeping, and most importantly after death. This is significant because Aun Weor states that those who have a sleeping consciousness are not aware of their postmortem condition, just as they are not aware when they are physically sleeping. The awakening of consciousness allows a student to continue to work regardless <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> state.|$|E
25|$|The river's {{upper reaches}} are diverse in terms <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> nature and their {{ecological}} importance. They include {{an area of}} wet woodland providing a rich habitat for many species. Water quality is sufficient to support various fish species. The river above Welbeck Lake provides habitat for a significant population of wild brown trout. The size of the lakes results in water moving much more slowly and supports populations of cyprinids, pike and eels, which thrive in water which is relatively static. The lower reaches of the river are used for spawning by fish which inhabit the River Idle.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} {{showed that}} {{there was no need for}} a life force in order to prepare organic substances. This idea, however, was initially met with a high degree of skepticism, and only 20 years later, with the synthesis of acetic acid from carbon by Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe, was the idea accepted. Organic chemistry has since developed into an independent area of research dedicated to the study of carbon-containing compounds, since that element in common was detected in a variety of nature-derived substances. An important factor in the characterization of organic materials was on the basis <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>physical</b> properties (such as melting point, boiling point, solubility, crystallinity, or color).|$|E
