5|$|After the {{suggestion}} {{by the head}} of the Ministry of War Transport Cyril Hurcomb to conduct a joint local hearing chaired by an outsider was turned down by the Government due to much greater means being needed, the Government agreed that a public inquiry should be opened. A public inquiry into the plans was opened in December 1944, with the hearing lasting for three days. The Ministry of Town and Country Planning appointed Hurcomb as the chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry.</b> The Electricity Commissioners appointed George Pepler and C.G. Morley New. The key opponents of the scheme were the City of Durham Preservation Society, chaired by Cyril Alington.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Hurcomb {{put forward}} at a ministerial meeting a {{solution}} whereby the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> would inform NESCo that on purely technical grounds {{they would have}} approved the scheme, but due to the opposition of Morrison, they {{had decided not to}} proceed to a decision. Although NESCo were initially hostile, in June 1945 they agreed to drop the scheme on condition that they received a letter from Morrison agreeing that they had satisfied the commissioners on technical grounds, thus entitling them to compenstation. The Government thought the site was open to well founded objections, and even if the scheme had proceeded past the inquiry stage, they would have refused consent anyway.|$|E
5|$|Friends {{and others}} {{sympathetic}} to the family attended, and when word of it reached Roger Nowell, he decided to investigate. On 27 April 1612, an inquiry was held before Nowell and another magistrate, Nicholas Bannister, to determine {{the purpose of the}} meeting at Malkin Tower, who had attended, and what had happened there. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry,</b> eight more people were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial: Elizabeth Device, James Device, Alice Nutter, Katherine Hewitt, John Bulcock, Jane Bulcock, Alice Grey and Jennet Preston. Preston lived across the border in Yorkshire, so she was sent for trial at York Assizes; the others were sent to Lancaster Gaol, to join the four already imprisoned there.|$|E
25|$|Blainey was deputy {{chairman}} in 1974 and 1975 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Whitlam government's <b>Inquiry</b> into Museums and National Collections, whose report {{ultimately led to}} the completion in Canberra, in 2001, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Museum <b>of</b> Australia {{with its emphasis on}} indigenous history.

25|$|In 1984, two newspapers– the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star– {{obtained}} documents {{related to}} <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> and reported that <b>the</b> likely cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disaster was <b>the</b> detonation <b>of</b> a torpedo while the Scorpions own crew attempted to disarm it. The U.S. Navy declassified many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry's</b> documents in 1993.|$|R
50|$|As an MP, de Wit was {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{parliamentary}} <b>inquiry</b> on construction, a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Presidium and former chairman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standing committee for social affairs and employment.

5|$|In {{the early}} days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry,</b> the Portuguese police searched through images seized from {{paedophile}} investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and {{died of cancer in}} Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Inquiry</b> one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E
5|$|The inquiry was {{launched}} on 31 May 2001, and was {{split into two}} phases: phase one and phase two. Phase one investigated the involvement of people and agencies in Climbié's death, {{in the form of}} hearings. Two hundred and seventy witnesses were involved. The phase one hearings began on 26 September 2001 and finished on 31 July 2002; it was originally supposed to end on 4 February 2002 but late documents caused delays. Phase two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry,</b> taking place between 15 March 2002 and 26 April 2002, took the form of five seminars, which looked at the child protection system in general. It was chaired by Garnham and brought together experts in all aspects of child protection.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately, the {{decision}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> went against NESCo {{and those in}} support of the station, and the company dropped their plans. NESCo received an ex gratia payment of £6,650 from the Ministry of Town and Country Planning for the expenditure incurred to that point. The site itself was inherited by the nationalised British Electricity Authority in 1948 and they eventually sold it. On 9 October 1945, Minister of Town and Country Planning Lewis Silkin made clear in the House of Commons that NESCo had begun extending their existing power stations by installing additional generating plant at sites other than Kepier, sufficing the demand for electricity, and meaning no station was needed at Kepier.|$|E
5|$|When both phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> were completed, Laming {{began writing}} the final report. The Laming report, {{published}} on 28 January 2003, {{found that the}} agencies involved in her care had failed to protect her, and that on at least twelve occasions, workers involved in her case could have prevented her death, particularly condemning the senior managers involved. On {{the day of the}} launch of the report, Climbié's mother sang her daughter's favourite song as a tribute.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{influence was}} the speech made by President Ronald Reagan on 23 March 1983 announcing the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) which, using ground-based and space-based systems, proposed protecting the United States from attack by nuclear missiles. One of {{the supporters of}} SDI was one-time US presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche, on whom Kennedy Martin based the character of Jerry Grogan, owner of the Fusion Corporation of Kansas. Kennedy Martin was also influenced by the culture of secrecy surrounding the UK's policy regarding nuclear power in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> into {{the construction of the}} Sizewell B nuclear power station and the concerns about the safety record of the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant; this led him to conceive International Irradiated Fuels and its chief executive Robert Bennett.|$|E

25|$|This {{discussion}} {{was held in}} the meeting called congregatio rotalis {{from the fact that it}} was only judges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Rota who voted.

25|$|Indeed, <b>the</b> conduct <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new {{government}} after the Somalia affair {{and the search}} for documents now absorbed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry's</b> attention, as reflected in its report. <b>The</b> <b>inquiry</b> had run long over its allotted timeframe and budget. The decision to end <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> received visible media attention and may have contributed to <b>the</b> defeat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Defence Minister Doug Young in the 1997 election. <b>The</b> <b>inquiry</b> was never able to examine top level governmental decision-making, nor did it actually examine the alleged events in Somalia.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the inquiry}} opened, a poll was {{conducted}} in Tunstall where ratepayers of the town showed themselves to be in favour of federation. As the council itself had voted against federation, it decided not to oppose or support federation but instead to achieve the best deal it could for the town. The three-day inquiry opened on 8 January 1908 and was chaired by Major Norton, {{an officer of the}} Local Government Board. Norton's appointment itself caused controversy with the delegation from Burslem walking out on the first day protesting that Norton had already declared himself in favour of federation. The walkout did not disrupt the hearing but left only Fenton and Staffordshire County Council opposed to the plan, with Tunstall neutral and Hanley, Stoke and Longton in favour. The bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> examined rating schemes based largely on the Owen or Geen proposals from the previous federation attempt.|$|E
5|$|During the hearing, Hurcomb {{pointed out}} a letter {{published}} in The Times in July 1944, in which the Bishop and Dean of Durham, and Warden of the Durham Colleges, had given the misleading impression that the proposed station would ruin views from the railway line, an idea compounded by the publication {{a few days later}} of a photograph taken from the proposed site. He acknowledged that a number of views from parts of the river would be ruined, and that the station would be visible from the Cathedral and church, Hurcomb emphasised {{that the majority of the}} beautiful views around the city would remain. Pepler also found that from the railway station, the power station and the Cathedral could not be viewed simultaneously. The members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> initially concluded that the station should be given the go-ahead, based on the grounds that a more suitable site could not be decided upon.|$|E
5|$|Following the defeat, the Chief of the German General Staff, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg, {{ordered the}} Supreme Army Command {{to conduct a}} court of enquiry into the {{defensive}} collapse of the Arras sector. The court concluded that the Sixth Army headquarters had disregarded frontline commander reports, noting a possible imminent attack and as a result, reserve units were kept too far back to execute a timely and effective counterattack. The court concluded that Sixth Army commander General Ludwig von Falkenhausen failed to apply an elastic defence properly as espoused by German defensive doctrine of the time. Instead, the defensive system {{was a series of}} unmoving strong points and static lines of resistance, which the Allied artillery ultimately isolated and destroyed. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry,</b> Hindenburg removed Falkenhausen from his command and transferred him to Belgium where he served the remainder of the war as that country's Governor General.|$|E

40|$|Ethnic {{and gender}} {{discrimination}} {{in a variety}} of housing markets is documented in several populations. We conducted an online field experiment to examine ethnic and gender discrimination in the private rental housing market in Finland. We sent 1459 inquiries regarding 800 apartments. We compared responses to standardized apartment inquiries including fictive Arabic-sounding, Finnish-sounding or Swedish-sounding female or male names. We found evidence of discrimination against Arabic-sounding names and against male names. Inquiries including Arabic-sounding male names had <b>the</b> lowest probability <b>of</b> receiving a response, receiving a response to about 16 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiries</b> made, while Finnish-sounding female names received a response to 42 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiries.</b> We did not find any evidence of landlords’ gender moderating the observed discrimination pattern. The findings suggest that both ethnic and gender discrimination occur in the private rental housing market in Finland...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{integration}} of southern Vietnam into the central administration, newly appointed imperial officials arrived in Saigon. The new mandarins carried out a detailed inquiry into Duyệt's rule and claimed that widespread corruption and abuse of power took place. Bạch Xuân Nguyên, the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry,</b> called for Duyet's posthumous prosecution, which resulted in 100 lashes being applied to his grave. Many of Duyệt's subordinates were arrested and 16 of his family members were executed. This action prompted the Duyệt's officials—fearful of their positions and security under the central system—to launch a revolt {{under the leadership of}} his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi. Historical opinion is divided with scholars contesting whether the humiliation of Duyệt or the loss of southern autonomy was the main catalyst.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{high-profile}} Senate committee inquiries was the Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident, which in 2002 investigated {{what became known as}} the Children Overboard Affair. The events and subsequent Senate committee inquiries were widely reported, and the transcripts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>inquiry</b> formed the basis of a play, A Certain Maritime Incident. Other high-profile inquiries included the Community Affairs committee's inquiry into Children in Institutional Care, which brought to wide public notice the experiences of children who had been placed in care in sometimes inhumane circumstances and was directly responsible for state governments and churches making public apologies to the victims of abuse or neglect; the Select Committee on Mental Health, which contributed to widespread discussion of mental health issues and to a major funding boost for services in 2006; and the 2006 inquiry into the Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill, which contributed to a government decision not to proceed with controversial migration legislation.|$|E
