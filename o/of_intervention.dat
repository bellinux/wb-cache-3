He was also uncomfortable with {{the way in which}} Bean and the AWM's acting {{director}} Arthur Bazley were running the Memorial in his absence, and sought to intervene in its management. This degree <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> frustrated Bazley, and led to increasing conflict between the two men who had worked together since 1917. Their relationship worsened in 1945, and the Memorial's board was eventually forced to make a ruling on what Bazley and Treloar's responsibilities were. In 1946, Bazley left the Memorial to take a job in the Department of Immigration due to continuing tensions with Treloar.|$|E

The Dominicans soon came into conflict with the established colonists. Colonial opposition to the Dominicans was such that the Dominicans were forced to flee Ciudad Real in fear of their lives. They established themselves nearby in two indigenous villages, the old site of Villa Real de Chiapa and Cinacantlán. From Villa Real, Bartolomé de las Casas and his companions prepared for the evangelisation of all the territory that fell within the Bishopric of Chiapa. The Dominicans promoted the veneration of Santiago Matamoros (St. James the Moor-slayer) as a readily identifiable image of Spanish military superiority. The Dominicans soon saw the need to reestablish themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real was placed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 1877–78 Russo-Turkish War, Khrimian led the Armenian delegation at the Congress of Berlin. The delegation's mission was to present a memorandum to the great powers concerning the implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces of the Ottoman Empire. The delegation's main goal was to secure substantial reforms in the Armenian provinces that would be supervised by European powers—which meant Russia in reality, as its troops where stationed in parts of Armenia. Armenians hoped that Russian pressure (and threat <b>of</b> <b>intervention)</b> would force the Ottoman government to improve conditions in the Armenian provinces. The Armenian delegation furthermore demanded some form of autonomy for the Armenian provinces, similar to the Maronite autonomy in Mount Lebanon, but did not advocate breakup of the Ottoman Empire or annexation of the Armenian provinces into Russia.|$|E

5|$|Parma {{was more}} than willing to help. The Electorate, {{strategically}} important to Spain, offered another land route by which to approach the rebellious northern Provinces of the Netherlands. Although the Spanish road from Spain's holdings on the Mediterranean shores led to its territories in what is today Belgium, it was a long, arduous march, complicated by the provisioning of troops and the potentially hostile populations of the territories through which it passed. An alternative route on the Rhine promised better access to the Habsburg Netherlands. Furthermore, the presence of a Calvinist electorate almost on the Dutch border could delay their efforts to bring the rebellious Dutch back to the Spanish rule and the Catholic confession. Philip II and his generals could be convinced to support Ernst's cause for such considerations. Indeed, the process <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> had started earlier. In 1581, Philip's forces, paid for by papal gold, had taken Aachen, which Protestants had seized; by the mid–1580s, the Duke of Parma's forces, encouraged by the Wittelsbachs and the Catholics in Cologne, had secured garrisons throughout the northern territories of the Electorate. By 1590, these garrisons gave Spain access to the northern provinces and Philip felt comfortable enough with his military access to the provinces, and with their isolation from possible support by German Protestants, to direct more of his attention to France, and less to his problems with the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject {{when compared to the}} normal course of events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds <b>of</b> <b>intervention</b> was whether performing or not performing the requested action was more or less preferable {{than it would have been}} were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{introduction}} to the special section on “Governing Agriculture-Forest Landscapes to Achieve Climate Change Mitigation” reviews external interventions to improve forest conditions and reduce deforestation, and by extension, influence carbon storage in agriculture-forest landscapes. The review {{is based on a}} careful survey of 123 cases of project-based and policy interventions to influence land use and forest cover outcomes. We propose that outcomes <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> can be explained in terms of rights, incentives, and technologies related to land use and apply this framework to examine 12 types <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> in agriculture-forest landscapes. The analysis of the identified 123 cases raises concerns about consistency of data and comparability of cases. Our preliminary evidence suggests limited association between the stated objective <b>of</b> an <b>intervention</b> and its success. This evidence also suggests that smaller scale and effective enforcement may be positively associated with improved forest outcomes. But the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> across different agriculture-forest landscapes varies and available evidence does not permit easy generalizations. The variable effects <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> across different agriculture-forest landscapes point to the need to better understand the forms and functions <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> and to problems associated with assessing their relative efficacy...|$|R

5|$|Thus, Palmer {{argues that}} humans are not {{normally}} required to aid wild animals in need. The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic <b>of</b> <b>intervention,</b> challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, {{he says that the}} difference between our obligations to domestic and wild animals in Palmer's thought experiments could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests that just as a utilitarian approach to wild animal suffering may demand too much, Palmer's contextual approach may permit too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between utilitarian and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of what is and is not valuable. The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account by pointing to the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have obligations to help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{examined}} the inequities in coverage <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries in India. METHODS: Data {{collected by the}} WHO World Health Survey in 6 Indian states in 2003 were used to estimate the coverage <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> for NCDs and injuries. Coverage {{was defined as the}} proportion of individuals who reported receiving the intervention among those in need of it. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess inequities in coverage <b>of</b> <b>interventions.</b> Composite coverage was calculated for each state and assessed against expenditure on health. RESULTS: The composite coverage <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> for NCDs and injuries for all states combined was 43. 9 % (95 % CI 43. 0 %- 44. 8 %), and was higher in urban than in rural areas. Lower wealth quintiles had higher odds of being in need <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> but lower odds of being covered. Overall, the highest quintile had composite coverage of 54. 5 %, compared with 34. 1 % for the lowest quintile. The states with lower coverage <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> had a higher proportion of households reporting selling items or borrowing money to cover health expenditure; this proportion was highest (58. 8 %) in Rajasthan state that had the lowest composite coverage (36. 6 %). CONCLUSION: The higher need for and lower coverage <b>of</b> <b>interventions</b> for NCDs and injuries in the poor, and the associated high risk of further adverse economic impact due to health spending, suggest that the public health system of India should improve access to these interventions at no cost for the economically disadvantaged. 7 page(s...|$|R
