5|$|The {{outcomes}} of the confirmation <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> hearings were announced on 23 January 2012. Despite the ICC regulations requiring the Pre-Trial Chamber to normally issue a verdict on confirmation <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> within sixty days of the hearings taking place the chamber issued a ruling on 26 October 2011 to vary this time limit to allow both the results in both cases to be announced simultaneously.|$|E

50|$|Current is the {{movement}} <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b> The continuity equation {{says that if}} charge is moving out of a differential volume (i.e. divergence of current density is positive) then the amount <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> within that volume is going to decrease, so the rate <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> density is negative. Therefore, the continuity equation amounts to a conservation <b>of</b> <b>charge.</b>|$|R
50|$|Charge {{conservation}} {{is a physical}} law that states that {{the change in the}} amount <b>of</b> electric <b>charge</b> in any volume of space is exactly equal to the amount <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> flowing into the volume minus the amount <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> flowing out <b>of</b> the volume. In essence, charge {{conservation is}} an accounting relationship between the amount <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> in a region and the flow <b>of</b> <b>charge</b> into and out of that region.|$|R

De la Rúa was indicted alongside seven politicians from both the UCR and the PJ. In 2013, they were all cleared <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> by a unanimous resolution, and Pontaquarto was removed from the witness protection program.|$|E

Peter must wear an ankle monitor and cannot leave the apartment or communicate with the outside world. Alicia is uncomfortable about Peter's return because of his infidelity, which was exposed {{at the time of}} his conviction.|$|E

The three {{defendants}} had all filed applications challenging the jurisdiction of the court which were rejected by the chamber. Although the defence teams had initially proposed calling 43 witnesses to the confirmation <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> hearings the chamber instructed them to present just two witnesses each at the confirmation hearings, which they did. Ruto and Sang additionally made unsworn statements in person.|$|E

After the company's bankruptcy on 23 June, the police undertook a seven-year investigation of the company.

Tjøntveit was acquitted <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> of deceit in 1978.|$|E

5|$|After eight years, Soeprapto was honourably {{dismissed}} on 1 April 1959. {{the dismissal}} {{has been reported}} in several sources {{to be related to the}} acquittal of/dropping <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> against two foreigners, Junschlager and Schmidt, who had been accused of undermining the government; Junschlager died in prison, and Schmidt was freed on basis of time served in a high court decision which the prosecution did not appeal. As he had not been given prior warning he was unable to go to Merdeka Palace for the related formalities; at the time he was visiting his parents in Yogyakarta. His wife later noted that this led to him becoming disillusioned in President Sukarno's regime.|$|E

After Lois expresses her {{hope for the}} restaurant to be successful, Stewie sarcastically states {{that it will be}} just as successful as Liza Minnelli's Playboy photoshoot. Returning home from the restaurant, Peter and Lois decide to watch an episode of Maude, but the length of the opening theme song causes Peter to become fatigued by the show. Once the restaurant begins hemorrhaging money, Peter decides to shoot a commercial parodying M. Night Shyamalan's 1999 film The Sixth Sense. After Joe's handicapped friends take over the restaurant, Peter expresses his discomfort about the restaurant's coolness to Lois by retrieving a picture of American actor Mark Harmon and showing it to Lois in an attempt to make her understand his concern.|$|E
5|$|As a result, Alfonsín {{sponsored}} the Trial of the Juntas, in which, {{for the first}} time, the leaders of a military coup in Argentina were on trial. The first hearings began at the Supreme Court in April 1985 and lasted {{for the remainder of}} the year. In December, the tribunal handed down life sentences for Jorge Videla and former Navy Chief Emilio Massera, as well as 17-year sentences for Roberto Eduardo Viola. President Leopoldo Galtieri was acquitted <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> related to the repression, but he was court-martialed in May 1986 for malfeasance during the Falklands War. Ramón Camps received a 25-year sentence. The trials did not focus only on the military: Mario Firmenich was captured in Brazil in 1984 and extradited to Argentina. José López Rega was extradited from Miami in 1986, because of his links with the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{the defence}} {{argued that the}} {{proceedings}} were invalid as Knight had been granted immunity by the Attorney-General's Chambers in 1991 from further charges arising from his corruption investigations, in exchange for him to plead guilty in the earlier trial. They argued that the latest set <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> stemmed from that investigation and thus were subject to the immunity clause. The CPIB revealed {{that it had been}} tipped off about the misappropriation of money only in 1997 by an unnamed informant. The court ruled that the proceedings could continue because the 1991 probe into Knight's dealings did not investigate his misappropriation of money. Eventually the court found him guilty of two charges of misappropriation and sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and another day in jail.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> {{being laid}} against his son, Atherton's father approached Member of Parliament and King's Counsel John Diefenbaker in December 1950 {{and sought to}} retain him as defence counsel. The Athertons were Diefenbaker's constituents; their hometown, Zealandia, Saskatchewan, was in his riding, Lake Centre. Diefenbaker declined the case, stating that Parliament had first call on his time, that his wife Edna was seriously ill with leukemia, {{and that he was}} not admitted as a lawyer in British Columbia. As Edna Diefenbaker was well known as an influence over her husband, in desperation Alfred Atherton Sr. talked his way into her Saskatoon hospital room.|$|E
5|$|Many {{executives}} at Enron were indicted {{for a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>charges</b> and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license to audit public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost {{the majority of its}} customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.|$|E
