5|$|Birds are now {{recognized}} {{as being the}} sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants {{of members of the}} group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopod fossils show great {{diversity}} in the morphology of the shells and lophophore, while the modern genera show less diversity but provide soft-bodied characteristics. Both fossils and extant species have limitations that {{make it difficult to}} produce a comprehensive classification of brachiopods based on morphology. The phylum also has experienced significant convergent evolution and reversals (in which a more recent group seems to have lost a characteristic that is seen in an intermediate group, reverting to a characteristic last seen in an older group). Hence some brachiopod taxonomists believe it is premature to define higher levels <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> such as order, and recommend instead a bottom-up approach that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups.|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{introduction}} of rough sets by Pawlak as a model to capture uncertainty, it has drawn much attention from both theoretical and application point <b>of</b> view. <b>Classifications</b> <b>of</b> universes play very important roles in several fields of study. The study of rough definability <b>of</b> <b>classifications</b> was initiated by Busse. The properties <b>of</b> approximations <b>of</b> <b>classifications</b> were established {{in the form of}} four theorems and were used to define the types <b>of</b> <b>classifications.</b> These results were generalised to develop two theorems of necessary and sufficient type were established by Tripathy et al, from which several results including the four theorems of Busse could be derived as corollaries. Recently, rough sets based on Multigranulation were introduced and studied by Qian et al. Also, it has been extended to include incomplete information systems. Many of these results are extended to the multigranular cases. In this paper, we extend the properties <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>classifications</b> to the multigranular context. Also, we introduce some parameters like the accuracy of approximation and the quality <b>of</b> approximation <b>of</b> <b>classifications</b> with respect to Multigranulations. We have obtained interesting criteria under which both types of Multigranulations reduce to single granulation. Also, some algebraic properties of Multigranulations are derived...|$|R

5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals in the same class must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|While {{equality}} jurisprudence primarily centres {{around a}} pledge of {{the protection of}} equal laws, laws frequently classify individuals out of necessity.

The necessity of differentiation is even more paramount in modern society with its increasingly complicated problems. Joseph Tussman and Jacobus tenBroek have proposed the doctrine of reasonable classification as the solution, whereby the legislation defines the class that includes all who are similarly situated {{for the purpose of}} the law and none who are not.|$|E

Younger appellations like the Cabardes and subregions like Minervois la Livinière, Corbières-Boutenac and St-Chinian-Berlou are much smaller in scope.

5|$|Any {{pretense of}} cordiality between Cope and Marsh ended in 1872, and by spring 1873 open hostility ensued. At the same time, Leidy, Cope and Marsh were making great discoveries of ancient {{reptiles}} and mammals in the Western bone beds. The paleontologists {{had a habit}} of making hasty telegrams eastward describing their finds, only publishing fuller accounts after returning from trips. Among the new specimens described by the men were Uintatherium, Loxolophodon, Eobasileus, Dinoceras, and Tinoceras. The problem was that many of these finds were not uniquely different from each other; in fact, Cope and Marsh knew that some of the fossils they were collecting had already been found by the others. As it turned out, many of Marsh's names were valid, while none of Cope's were. Marsh also placed the new species into a new order of mammals, Cinocerea. Cope was humiliated and powerless to stop his rival's changes. Instead, he published a broad analytical study where he proposed a new plan <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> for the Eocene mammals, in which he discarded Marsh's genera in favor of his own. Marsh remained steadfast and continued to claim that all of Cope's names for Dinocerata were incorrect.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
5|$|Gould never embraced cladistics as {{a method}} of {{investigating}} evolutionary lineages and process, possibly because he was concerned that such investigations would lead to neglect of the details in historical biology, which he considered all-important.

Around this time cladistics rapidly became the dominant method <b>of</b> <b>classification</b> in evolutionary biology. Inexpensive but increasingly powerful personal computers made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics. Around the same time the development of effective polymerase chain reaction techniques made it possible to apply cladistic methods of analysis to biochemical and genetic features as well.|$|E
