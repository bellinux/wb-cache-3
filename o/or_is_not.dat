5|$|Basic SQL {{comparison}} operators always return Unknown {{when comparing}} anything with Null, so the SQL standard provides for two special Null-specific comparison predicates. The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates (which use a postfix syntax) test whether data is, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> Null.|$|E
5|$|No {{subsidiary}} legislation made under an Act of Parliament may be {{inconsistent with the}} provisions of any Act. This means that any {{subsidiary legislation}} that was made ultra vires its parent Act (that is, the Act did not confer power on the agency to make the subsidiary legislation) <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> consistent with any other statute is void {{to the extent of}} the inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaii {{football}} team normally receives an automatic bid {{to the game}} unless the team is selected {{to participate in a}} BCS game <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> bowl eligible. If either of those events happen, the WAC selects its next-highest ranked team to compete in the game. In 2007, Hawaii was selected to play on January 1, 2008 in the Sugar Bowl against Georgia, marking just the second time since the creation of the Hawaii Bowl that Hawaii would not participate. The only previous time that Hawaii failed to make an appearance was in 2005, when the Warriors finished their season with a 5–7 record and were not eligible for a bowl game.|$|E

5|$|Uncertainty {{comes in}} four categories: {{conceptual}} uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. Conceptual uncertainty arises when {{the language is}} unclear, {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found, and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a beneficiary.|$|E

25|$|In ring theory, {{a branch}} of {{abstract}} algebra, a commutative ring is a ring in which the multiplication operation is commutative. The study of commutative rings is called commutative algebra. Complementarily, noncommutative algebra {{is the study of}} noncommutative rings where multiplication is not <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> required to be commutative.|$|E

25|$|The first {{decision}} {{to be made in}} managing prostate cancer is whether treatment is needed. Prostate cancer, especially low-grade forms found in elderly men, often grows so slowly that no treatment is required.

25|$|According to the {{traditional}} Rabbinic view, which is maintained by all branches of Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism, and some branches of Reform Judaism, only halakha can define who is <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a Jew when a question of Jewish identity, lineage, or parentage arises about any person seeking to define themselves or claim that they are Jewish.|$|E

25|$|Evangelicals {{agree with}} the Protestant {{orthodox}} of theology that Satan is a real, created being given entirely over to evil and that evil is whatever opposes God <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> willed by God. Evangelicals emphasize the power and involvement of Satan in history in varying degrees; some virtually ignore Satan and others revel in speculation about spiritual warfare against that personal power of darkness.|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} with severe risk factors, prescription medication may be appropriate. This {{may be considered}} in patients for whom lifestyle therapy has failed, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> sustainable, and who are at high-risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Metformin and acarbose help prevent the development of frank diabetes, and also have a good safety profile. Evidence also supports thiazolidinediones but there are safety concerns, and data on newer agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP4 inhibitors or meglitinides are lacking.|$|E
25|$|The {{reliability}} of decoding can be low since {{the degree of}} freedom is not increased by signal relaying. There is no increase in the diversity order since this scheme exploits only the relayed signal and the direct signal from the source node is either not available <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> accounted for. When we {{can take advantage of}} such a signal and increase in diversity order results. Thus, in the following we consider the cooperative scheme which decodes the combined signal of both the direct and relayed signals.|$|E

25|$|As {{well as the}} sovereign, the Commonwealth realms share {{a single}} royal family. The family is {{frequently}} referred to informally as the British Royal Family, sometimes in conflict with official national titles, {{such as those in}} Canada. Though there is no strict legal or formal definition of who is <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a member of the Royal Family, the group is loosely defined as the extended family of the monarch, and these persons constitute the apex of a modern royal court.|$|E
25|$|Stu Lies - It {{has been}} well {{documented}} throughout the show's history that Stugotz has both a propensity both for stretching the truth and believing his own lies, and starting in 2016 an entire summer show has been spent testing exactly what Stu says is <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the truth. Retired Miami-Dade police officer (and licensed polygraph operator) Joe Harper will hook Stugotz up to a lie-detector, ask him if statements he made actually happened, and then announce the result, often with hilarious results.|$|E
25|$|The Canadian Royal Family is a {{group of}} people related to the country's monarch and, as such, {{belonging}} to the House of Windsor. There is no legal definition of who is <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a member of the group, though the Government of Canada maintains a list of immediate members, and stipulates that those in the direct line of succession who bear the style of Royal Highness (Altesse Royale) are subjects of, and owe their allegiance specifically to, the reigning king or queen of Canada.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the SWIF might extend past its intersection with the RMFZ (with only peripheral strands turning to join the RMFZ) to cross the Cascades and eventually merge with or cross the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament; a study of regional features suggests such a pattern. But detailed mapping just past the intersection shows only a complex and confused pattern of faulting, with no indication that there is, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> through-going faulting. Mapping of areas further east that might clarify the pattern is not currently planned.|$|E

It is also a term used in Article five of the third Geneva Convention.

25|$|However, in some communities, the ketubah {{is either}} {{displayed}} in a very private section of the home <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> displayed at all.

Historically, the ketubah specified whether the bride was a virgin. In Sephardic communities, it still specifies the actual contributions of the family to the new household and the divorce settlement; Ashkenazi communities have adopted the custom of having set amounts for all weddings.|$|E
