5|$|Lohan {{visits the}} Sanlaap centre, a women's and children's shelter in Kolkata. The centre offers dance therapy {{as part of}} their {{treatment}} and a group of girls perform a dance they have rehearsed. She talks to girls who had been held at a brothel and they describe being raped and drugged. The director of the Sanlaap centre describes how Lohan taking an interest in trafficking might inspire <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> to get involved in counteracting exploitation. Bharti Ali, director of the Non-governmental organization Centre for Child Rights, criticizes the government for not prioritizing child protection. Returning home, Lohan and the film crew are chased by paparazzi photographers at the airport. Two months later, Lohan is in London, England talking to Kate Redman, from Save the Children UK, who describes how one of the issues with government intervention is that only sex and drug trafficking is illegal. She also advocates raising awareness of the issues with trafficking.|$|E

25|$|The {{chairman}} of the congress stopped Elbegdorj's speech and warned him not to say such things. It was 1989 and Mongolia had been a communist country for 68 years. At that time, it was alleged that every other person was an unofficial communist party spy who would report people who expressed opinions other than socialism and communism. During the break of the congress, two young individuals met Elbegdorj and the three agreed to found a democratic movement and to secretly spread the news to <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> Later the three met and united with ten other individuals and they are known as the Thirteen Leaders of Mongolia's Democratic Revolution. On his return from the congress, his boss at the newspaper Ulaan Od warned Elbegdorj {{that he would be}} fired if he participated further in any activities out of work or engaged in any conduct inconsistent with communist and socialist ideology. Despite the warning, Elbegdorj and his friends met secretly with <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> in the circle auditorium of the National University of Mongolia and discussed democracy, free market economic policy, and other prohibited subjects of the time, and began to draft a plan to organize a democratic movement. They met many times and brought new friends and new supporters to join them secretly. One night they placed ads of their open demonstration in streets.|$|E

During the WCDRR, Princess Margriet of The Netherlands stated that “The next generations are priceless for us in disasters […] investing in them and their environment equals a safer future” (Francisca, Princess Margriet 2015). <b>Young</b> <b>people</b> must be innovative about how they approach financing and partnerships; for example, requesting not only financial support but also in-kind contributions {{from the private sector}} and universities. The impact of youth projects must be measured and reported with actual evidence to stimulate further support, build trust, spread awareness, and motivate <b>others.</b> <b>Young</b> <b>people</b> call on donors to support youth innovations and partnerships to {{give them a chance to}} develop their ideas in a sustainable way.|$|R
25|$|Hebard {{made her}} way west in 1882 to Cheyenne, eight years before Wyoming became a state in 1890. Hebard arrived at the future capital city {{in the company of}} her mother and brothers; Fred, Lockwood, and her sister, Alice. She became part of the social scene with <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> at the newly {{constructed}} Cheyenne Club, where cattle barons, often wealthy Europeans, held sway over Cheyenne. Yet general violence and roughness were still common. Rowdy cowhands wearing guns in the saloons and prostitutes openly plying their trade in brothels made for a sometimes raucous downtown. Citizens were known to hand out their own form of retribution, however, if things got out of hand. For example, in 1883 a crowd lynched an accused murderer, leaving him hanging from a Cheyenne telephone pole.|$|E

500|$|Carla Garrity, a fourteen-year-old {{girl from}} Burbank, California, objected to Cole's {{invitation}} to the inauguration {{on the ground that}} Cole had done nothing to deserve it. In a letter to her congressman, Ed Reinecke, Garrity stated she had worked very hard for Nixon and other Republican candidates, [...] "Therefore, I am very much against that 13-year old girl in Ohio who held up the sign 'Bring us Together' being invited to the inaugural. She didn't even read or write it!" [...] Reinecke forwarded the letter to Nixon aide John Ehrlichman with the comment, [...] "I suspect that Carla's reaction may be shared by <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> who worked in the Nixon campaign". Nixon assistant Charles E. Stuart replied to Reinecke, stating, [...] "Vicki Lynne has been invited to the inauguration not because she carried the sign, or even because she made the sign, but rather because the sign which she did carry proved to be an inspiration to Mr. Nixon" [...] and expressed his confidence the invitation would be well received by other young Nixon partisans.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with other}} sexual practices, people without sound {{knowledge}} about the sexual risks involved are susceptible to STIs. Because of the view that anal sex is not [...] "real sex" [...] and therefore does not result in virginity loss, or pregnancy, teenagers and <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> may consider vaginal intercourse riskier than anal intercourse and believe that a STI can only result from vaginal intercourse. It may be because of these views that condom use with anal sex is often reported to be low and inconsistent across all groups in various countries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{processes}} of attribution by <b>others</b> to <b>young</b> <b>people</b> {{as well as}} processes of self-attribution by the latter. It first examines the attribution by others by looking at Zurich’s youth-policy and its underlying conception of public space. In a second step, it zooms in on an urban square where a conflict of interests has to be solved {{within the framework of}} the civic policy, i. e. as a process of negotiation. It thereby examines the relation between the attribution by <b>others</b> to <b>young</b> <b>people</b> and the meaning attributed to the square. The analysis reveals considerable differences regarding the perception of conflicts about the use of the square, the meaning attributed to it, the attributions to <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> as well as differences between scales (city vs. square). It is argued that a concept of a relational space helps to grasp the complexity of conflicts about the use of space, since it allows examining different perspectives simultaneously...|$|R

At first, though, they really clash and Heather thinks that Zsa Zsa's complete trouble - which she is! Elsewhere on the Square, there's a lot of story between the <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> on the Square. Zsa Zsa definitely gets stuck in". Kenny also said about Zsa Zsa's second side: [...] "It's quite interesting because I know when Zsa Zsa comes in, people will just hate her because she's a real bitch.

2500|$|Monroe's {{fortunes}} {{began to}} improve during the [...] "folk revival" [...] {{of the early}} 1960s. Many college students and <b>other</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> were beginning to discover Monroe, associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the country-and-western genre with which it had previously been identified. The word [...] "bluegrass" [...] first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers, Reno and Smiley, Jim and Jesse, and the Osborne Brothers. While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized {{the potential for a}} lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North, Monroe was slower to respond. Under the influence of Ralph Rinzler, a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroe's manager in 1963, Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuit. Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine Sing Out! that first publicly referred to Monroe as the [...] "father" [...] of bluegrass. Accordingly, at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at Roanoke, Virginia in 1965, Bill Monroe was the central figure.|$|E
