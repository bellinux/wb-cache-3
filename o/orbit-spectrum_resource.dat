40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the effect of}} three emerging satellite technologies on the use and regulation {{of what might be}} called Earth Orbital Space. The three new technologies, Direct Broadcasting Satellites (DBS), Global Mobile Personal Communication Services (GMPCS), and Global Navigation Satellite Services (GNSS), are being implemented in or planned for different portions of Earth Orbital Space: the geostationary orbit, low earth orbits, and medium earth orbits, respectively. Each technology creates different challenges for the International Telecommunication Union which is the organization charged with their regulation. DBS services were regulated in the 1970 s and early 1980 s prior to their practical use. That early regulation appears, today, to be overly restrictive in many ways. GMPCS, on the other hand, is now becoming a reality but lacks a solid legal structure to ensure that its potential for global wireless communication can be achieved. GNSS provides yet a different challenge: that of providing for the civil utilization of military navigation systems. The deployment of these new technologies add to the increasing problem of congestion in the <b>orbit-spectrum</b> <b>resource.</b> The final chapter details a number of different proposals aimed at increasing both equity and efficiency in the management of the <b>orbit-spectrum</b> <b>resource...</b>|$|E
40|$|Communication {{satellites}} and technology transfer {{are discussed in}} seven individual reports. Topics cover: (1) NASA'S technological alternatives assuming that the <b>orbit-spectrum</b> <b>resource</b> {{will continue to be}} allocated to communication satellite service providers at zero price; (2) the economic aspects of orbit-spectrum allocation; (3) the cost structure of local distribution systems for satellite communication; (4) the economic basis for national science and technology policy; (5) the economics of the household economy; (6) government patent policy; and (7) screening and evaluation in information dissemination...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{domestic}} satellite systems and technological improvements in both space and ground equipment makes {{the use of}} small aperture earth stations economically feasible and attractive for broadcast satellite applications. With increasing use of the orbit spectrum, there is some concern that broadcast satellite systems {{may not be able}} to obtain satisfactory allocations of this <b>orbit-spectrum</b> <b>resource</b> because of interference considerations. Specifically, interference calculations based on the present envelope result in comparatively large orbit spacings for broadcast satellites. Theoretical and experimental investigations of simple sidelobe suppression techniques, plus an analysis of experimental data on small aperture antennas, indicate that much better sidelobe performance can be obtained with a very small cost or performance penalty...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{identifies}} and evaluates {{strategies for}} sharing the geostationary orbit {{in the band}} 11. 7 to 12. 2 GHz between domestic systems in the fixed-satellite and broadcasting-satellite services. The effectiveness of two distinct types of sharing strategies, referred to as spectrum division and orbit division, is determined for various deployments of selected baseline systems representing the two services and for various combinations of sharing tactics such as frequency interleaving, crossed-polarization operation, and crossed-beam operation. Effectiveness {{is measured by the}} 'utilization factor', defined as the number of channels provided by the baseline systems when using an assigned share of the <b>orbit-spectrum</b> <b>resource,</b> relative to what they could provide if given the entire resource. Computer simulation is used to verify the intra- and interservice interference compatibility of the assumed deployments. It is concluded that total utilization factors close to 100 percent can be achieved with both spectrum-division and properly-chosen orbit-division strategies...|$|E
