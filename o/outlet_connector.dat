40|$|Thermally induced {{two-phase}} instabilities in non-uniformly heated boiling charmers in RBMK- 1000 reactor {{have been}} analyzed using RELAP 5 /MOD 3 code. The RELAP 5 {{model of a}} RBMK- 1000 reactor was developed to investigate low flow in a distribution group header (DGH) supplying 44 fuel pressure tubes. The model was evaluated against experimental data. The results of the calculations indicate that the period of oscillation for the high power tube varied from 3. 1 s to 2. 6 s, over the power range of 2. 0 MW to 3. 0 MW, respectively. The amplitude of the flow oscillation for the high powered tube varied from + 100 % to {minus} 150 % of the tube average flow. Reverse flow did not occur in the lower power tubes. The amplitude of oscillation in the subcooled region at the inlet to the fuel region is {{higher than in the}} saturated region at the outlet. In the upper fuel region and <b>outlet</b> <b>connectors</b> the flow oscillations are dissipated. The threshold of flow instability for the high powered tubes of a RBMK reactor is compared to Japanese data and appears to be in good agreement...|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{cigarette}} lighter socket was originally designed only to heat a cigarette lighter, repurposing these sockets as generic power connectors {{can lead to}} many problems. In addition to the issues with partially-compatible physical dimensions, the plugs can vibrate out of the socket under normal driving conditions, owing to poor retention. Also, {{there have been reports}} of melted plug tips due to poor contact and heat generation from ohmic resistance. [...] Non-vehicular use in stationary settings may avoid vibration problems when used as an alternative to 120 volt AC <b>outlets,</b> but low-quality <b>connectors</b> may still develop high resistance or intermittent contact.|$|R
5000|$|Cathay Pacific {{introduced}} a Premium Economy Class in March 2012. The seat pitch will be 38 inches - six inches more than Economy Class - and the seat itself will be wider {{and have a}} bigger recline. It will have a large meal table, cocktail table, footrest, a 10.6-inch personal television, an in-seat power <b>outlet,</b> a multi-port <b>connector</b> for personal devices, and extra personal stowage space. The Premium Economy Class seat offers {{a higher level of}} comfort with more living space in a separate cabin before the Economy Class zone. Passengers will also receive an [...] "environmentally friendly" [...] amenity kit with dental kit, socks and eyeshade for use during the journey. Larger pillows and noise-cancelling headsets will be provided. The new Premium Economy cabin will be installed on most Cathay Pacific long-haul aircraft. The first Boeing 777-300ER and Airbus A330-300 featuring Premium Economy Class has entered into service in March (substituting for regional aircraft) and scheduled service in April.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Microreactor {{design for}} ammonia {{synthesis}} with electromagnetic (EM) induction is reported. The Y-shape reactor with dimension of 50 mm by 120 mm has 5 mixing channels. This microreactor was designed using 2 D AUTOCAD software. It was fabricated using MAZAK milling machine that operates using a numerical control functionality computer which was interfaced with MASTERCAM software. Aluminum metal plate with 2 mm thickness {{was used as}} the microreactor. It was milled for 30 minutes with 0. 5 mm width of the channel. After the milling process was done two inlets and one <b>outlet</b> with pipe <b>connectors</b> were assembled. To reduce the leakage, a gasket paper was placed between the two plates. Hydrogen and nitrogen gas were mixed and flowed (1. 2 bar) into the inlet with 0. 05 g manganese based ferrite used as the nano-catalyst. The reaction was done in ambient condition. The microreactor was placed in a Helmholtz Coils to induced strong EM field. We used Kejldahl method to calculate the 24. 9 % ammonia yield...|$|R
40|$|Blood-contacting {{devices have}} contributed to {{improving}} the treatment of patients. However, thrombus formation at the interface between a connector and tube is still a potential source of thrombus-related complications that induce stroke or myocardial infarction. We aimed to develop a non-blood-contacting real-time method for visualizing thrombus formation, and to experimentally investigate the time-dependent phenomenon of thrombus formation at the interface between a connector and a tube in a medical device. An optical coherence tomography device with a center wavelength of 1330 nm was used to visualize thrombus formation during porcine blood circulation for 50 min in a closed 50 -mL circulation system isolated from ambient air. The thrombus formation sites at the interface between a tube and connector were visualized. The area of the thrombus formation at the interface between the inlet of the connector and the tube {{was found to be}} 0. 012 ± 0. 011 mm 2. Conversely, at the interface between the <b>outlet</b> of the <b>connector</b> and the tube, the area was found to be 0. 637 ± 0. 306 mm 2. Thus, significantly larger amounts of thrombus were formed at the outlet interface (p < 0. 01). The thrombus formation area at the outlet interface increased over time. Conversely, the area of thrombus formation showed repeated increasing and decreasing behavior at the inlet interface. Flow visualization with particle image velocimetry showed the presence of a flow separated area in the minimal flow phase at the inlet interface and a large recirculating slow flow region at the outlet interface in the minimal flow phase. These data suggested that the recirculating stagnant flow region contributed to thrombus growth. The method presented here was effective in quantitatively assessing time-dependent phenomena of thrombus formation at the connector-tube interface. The method may contribute to the assessment of thrombogenicity of a novel design of connector...|$|R
