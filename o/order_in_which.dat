5|$|Biostratigraphy, {{the use of}} fossils to {{work out}} the chronological <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> rocks were formed, is useful to both paleontologists and geologists. Biogeography studies the spatial {{distribution}} of organisms, and is also linked to geology, which explains how Earth's geography has changed over time.|$|E

5|$|Fold order. Determining the <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{different}} parts of a protein fold is challenging due to the extremely fast time scales involved.

50|$|Of {{the three}} {{possible}} word <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the subject comes before the object (VSO, SVO, and SOV), the VSO is less common {{because of the}} verb-object bonding principle, which states that objects {{tend to be more}} closely tied to verbs than subjects are (which is supported by phenomena such as object incorporation being found in many languages). Because of this principle, the two <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the object and verb are placed next to each other (SVO and SOV) are more common than VSO.|$|R

50|$|For example, in {{a service}} that uses locking to protect {{concurrently}} updated data, the messaging system can be instructed to use an inexpensive form of message <b>ordering,</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the messaging system respects the <b>ordering</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> individual senders send messages (FIFO guarantee) but does not attempt to impose an agreed order if messages are sent concurrently by different senders. Provided that the sender indeed held locks on the data, it can be shown that FIFO ordering suffices for correctness. The benefit is that FIFO ordering is much less costly to implement than total ordering for concurrent messages.|$|R
5|$|The exact <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the French {{lined up}} as they exited the bay is also uncertain. Larrabee notes that many {{observers}} wrote up different sequences when the line was finally formed, and that Bougainville recorded several different configurations.|$|E

Some stations also board passengers onto Greyhound Express buses using numbers printed on tickets. This number is assigned in the <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the ticket was purchased, which means that passengers who bought their tickets earlier get to board the bus and choose their seats earlier.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 Mark Wallinger, {{an artist}} {{associated}} with the YBA movement, was invited to produce an artwork to mark the 150th anniversary of the London Underground. He devised a scheme which in which panels with designs of labyrinths in vitreous enamel were installed on all 270 Underground stations. The works are numbered according to the <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> their stations were visited in a particular record-breaking journey of 2009, which took in every station on the network. In all there 32 works in the series in the City of Westminster, one for every station except Paddington, where there are two panels.|$|E
50|$|These {{orders are}} the <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the tense {{morpheme}} {{is closer to}} the root than the aspect morpheme. Since Aspect is merged before Tense and morpheme order still reflects hierarchical order, such a configuration is predicted to be impossible.|$|R

The placement of No. 3 in this sequence is problematic because he worked on it for over a decade, starting sketches for it soon after beginning work on No. 5, but completing it after both Nos. 5 and 4.|$|E
