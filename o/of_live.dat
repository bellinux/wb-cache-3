5|$|As {{well as the}} {{television}} show, Live and Kicking launched a music CD, composed of the best music that artists had sung live on the programme. A video game called Live and Kicking: Showmaker was also created, where the user could combine elements of the show {{to create their own}} television production on a small scale. A monthly magazine was also produced, though towards the end <b>of</b> <b>Live</b> & Kickings production, the sales of the magazine dropped significantly, reflecting its loss of viewers.|$|E

5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League {{has led to an}} increase in the value of broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost <b>of</b> <b>live</b> rights is partly a reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to have more than one holder.|$|E
5|$|Channel 4 {{was also}} accused of showing too many studio {{segments}} {{during the first}} few days of the Games rather than live events, and for missing several notable events involving British athletes, including a swimming heat where Eleanor Simmonds set a new personal best and almost beat the world record, Sarah Storey winning her eleventh Paralympic medal, and Great Britain's opening wheelchair basketball game against Germany. Channel 4 noted that time was needed {{during the first few}} days to explain Paralympic events and the classification system to viewers, and that it was operating three additional channels' worth <b>of</b> <b>live</b> coverage throughout the Games. The broadcaster also stated that it had to make editorial decisions on which events to air during periods where a large number of events were in progress. The amount <b>of</b> <b>live</b> coverage was also affected by Olympic Broadcasting Services, who did not send cameras or provide official television coverage for sports such as cycling, the marathon, and shooting. Channel 4's news department did send its own cameramen to film the affected events for highlights, but was unable to broadcast them live.|$|E

Hamilton told Llewelyn to inject humour into the character, thus beginning the friendly antagonism between Q and Bond {{that became a}} hallmark of the series. He had already appeared in the previous Bond film From Russia With Love and, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>Live</b> and Let Die, would continue to play Q in the next 16 Bond films.|$|E

50|$|In the 10th century, a Byzantine monk Simeon Metaphrastes was {{the first}} one to change the genre <b>of</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> the saints into {{something}} different, giving it a moralizing and panegyrical character. His catalog <b>of</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> the saints became the standard for all of the Western and Eastern hagiographers, who would create relative biographies and images of the ideal saints by gradually departing from the real facts <b>of</b> their <b>lives.</b> Over the years, the genre <b>of</b> <b>lives</b> <b>of</b> the saints had absorbed a number of narrative plots and poetic images (often, of pre-Christian origin, such as dragon fighting etc.), mediaeval parables, short stories and anecdotes.|$|R

Similar figures for Limousin meat yield are reported in other sources.|$|E
5|$|Friendship {{is another}} {{prominent}} element <b>of</b> <b>Live</b> and Let Die, where {{the importance of}} male friends and allies shows through in Bond's relationships with Leiter and Quarrel. The more complete characters profiles in the novel clearly showed the strong relationship between Bond and Leiter. In turn this provides a strengthened motive for Bond to chase Mr Big as revenge for the shark attack on Leiter.|$|E

50|$|The number <b>of</b> <b>lives</b> {{a player}} is granted varies per game type. A finite number <b>of</b> <b>lives</b> became a common feature in arcade games during the 1980s and {{mechanics}} such as checkpoints and power-ups made the managing <b>of</b> <b>lives</b> a more strategic experience for players over time. Lives give novice players more chances {{to learn the}} mechanics of a video game, while allowing more advanced players to take more risks.|$|R

Following relentless touring {{to support the}} recordings, including headline slots on the 1994 Lollapalooza tour and at Reading Festival in 1995, the band took time off to write the follow-up album.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the live}} album Still Dangerous was released, which {{features}} {{material from the}} 20 October 1977 gig at Philadelphia that was used for some <b>of</b> <b>Live</b> and Dangerous.
