40|$|Introduction Gene {{expression}} unavoidably bears noise {{because of}} the single molecular nature of DNA and {{the small number of}} each kind of proteins in the cell [1, 3]. Thus, systematic analyses of the stochastic dynamics are most desired to understand the design principle of the gene network and to interpret experimental expression data quantitatively. Here, we theoretically examine a simple genetic oscillator composed of three genes [2] to examine how the noise a#ects the oscillatory behavior of the circuit. 2 Methods and Results 2. 1 The Network Motif and the Model The repressilator is a network composed of three genes in which proteins synthesized by one gene repress the expression of the other gene (Fig. 1 a). We model the expression process at each gene as in fig 1 b. Proteins which will act on the other gene as repressors are synthesized with the rate g when the gene is active (S = 1) but with a negligibly small rate when inactive (S = 0).

40|$|Familial adenomatous {{polyposis}} (FAP) is an {{autosomal dominant}} inherited form of colorectal cancer, caused mostly by mutations in the APC gene (OMIM# 175100). Due {{to the wide}} variety of mutations found and the large size of the APC gene, several methods of mutation detection are used, which can be time consuming and costly. Here we demonstrate a new method of mutation detection in the APC gene using an array-based approach termed combinatorial sequencing by hybridization (cSBH). In cSBH, a universal probe set is attached to a support and a second one is in solution. Two-probe ligation occurs when a DNA strand from the target PCR product consecutively anneals to both unlabeled array-bound and solution-phase, dye-labeled probe, creating all target-complementary long labeled probes attached to the surface. A standard array reader scores fluorescent signals at each array position. Cell lines and patient DNA with known APC gene mutations were analyzed using cSBH based HyChipTM product. Results show this universal 6 -mer chip can successfully detect a range of mutations. Results are very robust for a continuous readout of 3. 6 kb from a PCR target, with 99. 97 % accuracy on a single HyChipTM slide. cSBH is a fast, cost-efficient method for first stage mutation screening in the APC or any <b>other</b> <b>gen...</b>|$|R

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track I: Power GenerationNatural convection is {{an important}} phenomenon for many engineering systems including nuclear reactors. Present day nuclear reactors rely on the phenomenon for decay heat removal. While advanced CANDU-X would incorporate natural circulation for enhanced passive heat removals system to ensure safety, while <b>other</b> <b>GEN</b> IV designs also use natural convection as their main mode of heat removal. For this reason, transient analysis of natural convection has been an area of significant interest. As {{a part of our}} larger project to enhance transport phenomenon at the micro-scale using radiation, we studied the phenomenon of natural convection. Using experimental techniques and numerical simulation (FLUENT code) transient response of a natural convection system was investigated. An Integrator Circuit analogy was proposed for natural convection system. Experimental investigation with three different fluids indicated that the characteristic time constant of the system is related to the Prandtl number of fluid. Moreover, effect of gravity and fluid viscosity were also investigated. Simulations results suggest that natural convection system acts as a “Low Pass” filter. Transmission characteristics of natural convection system were found to be a function of both fluid properties and the flow characteristics. Transmission factor was found to be a strong function of temperature oscillation frequency. Our numerical simulations also suggested that in additional to the thermal energy stored in the system, for natural convection energy is also stored in the form of kinetic energy of the fluid set in motion due to buoyancy. This energy is found to be related to system's Rayleigh number...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{the first round of}} R&D roadmap {{activities}} of the Generation IV (Gen IV) Technical Working Group (TWG) 3, on liquid metal-cooled reactors. Liquid metal coolants give rise to fast spectrum systems, and thus the reactor systems considered in this TWG are all fast reactors. Gas-cooled fast reactors are considered in the context of TWG 2. As is noted in <b>other</b> <b>Gen</b> IV papers, this first round activity is termed ''screening for potential'', and includes collecting the most complete set of liquid metal reactor/fuel cycle system concepts possible and evaluating the concepts against the Gen IV principles and goals. Those concepts or concept groups that meet the Gen IV principles and which are deemed to have reasonable potential to meet the Gen IV goals will pass to the next round of evaluation. Although we sometimes use the terms ''reactor'' or ''reactor system'' by themselves, the scope of the investigation by TWG 3 includes not only the reactor systems, but very importantly the closed fuel recycle system inevitably required by fast reactors. The response to the DOE Request for Information (RFI) on liquid metal reactor/fuel cycle systems from principal investigators, laboratories, corporations, and other institutions, was robust and gratifying. Thirty three liquid metal concept descriptions, from eight different countries, were ultimately received. The variation in the scope, depth, and completeness of the responses created a significant challenge for the group, but the TWG made a very significant effort not to screen out concepts early in the process...|$|R

5000|$|The Jewish Encyclopedia (1906) {{calls it}} {{certain that the}} blessing of Moses is of later date than the kernel of Jacob's blessing. While in the latter Simeon and Levi (compare Genesis 34) are censured on account of their sin and are {{threatened}} with dispersion in Israel (Gen. 44:5-7), the blessing of Moses does not mention Simeon at all; and in it Levi appears as the tribe of priests, although not yet assured of the sacerdotal office, nor respected for holding it. Rather he meets with persecutions, and these probably from the persons who dispute his right to the priesthood (Deuteronomy 33:8ff). While in Jacob's blessing Reuben is threatened {{with the loss of}} his birthright, the wish is expressed in the other blessing: [...] "May Reuben live, and not die; and may not his men be few." [...] This is a clear indication that Reuben before this time had sunk into a state of absolute insignificance. And while again the passage on Joseph in the one designates a period in which this tribe successfully defended itself against its enemies, the corresponding passage in the <b>other</b> (<b>Gen.</b> 49:22ff) points to a time when Ephraim maintained his power undiminished and defeated his enemies on all sides: [...] "His Joseph's glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together {{to the ends of the}} earth" [...] (Deut. 33:17). This verse certainly refers to a later time than the Syrian wars under Ahab. It more probably refers to the time of Jeroboam II, who was more successful than any of his predecessors in defeating Israel's enemies. It is likely that the passage on Gad alludes to the same period, in which this tribe successfully withstood the Syrians.|$|R
