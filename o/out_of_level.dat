60|$|It was Sunday {{afternoon}} in the farmhouse, on the thirteenth of February. Dinner being over, Bathsheba, {{for want of a}} better companion, had asked Liddy to come and sit with her. The mouldy pile was dreary in winter-time before the candles were lighted and the shutters closed; the atmosphere of the place seemed as old as the walls; every nook behind the furniture had a temperature of its own, for the fire was not kindled in this part of the house early in the day; and Bathsheba's new piano, which was an old one in other annals, looked particularly sloping and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>level</b> on the warped floor before night threw a shade over its less prominent angles and hid the unpleasantness.

A few chairs and a table were the chief articles of furniture in the third-floor back room which they occupied. A roll of baby-linen lay on the floor; beside it a pap-clogged spoon and an overturned tin pap-cup. Against the wall a Dutch clock was fixed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>level,</b> and ticked wildly in longs and shorts, its entrails hanging down beneath its white face and wiry hands, like the faeces of a Harpy ('foedissima ventris proluvies, uncaeque manus, et pallida semper ora'). A baby was crying against every chair-leg, the whole family of six or seven being small enough to be covered by a washing-tub. Mrs. Higgins sat helpless, clothed in a dress which had hooks and eyes in plenty, but never one opposite the other, thereby rendering the dress almost useless as a screen to the bosom. No workbox was visible anywhere.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of a miss in the cache, the purpose of using such a {{structure}} will be rendered useless and we will ultimately have to go to main memory to fetch the required data.

The general trend is to keep L1 cache small and at a distance of 1-2 CPU clock cycles from the processor with the lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> caches increasing in the size to store more data than L1 and hence have lower miss rate.

This <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>level</b> testing method proved to be so successful in identifying intellectual talent and furthering the education of youths {{in ways that were}} deemed not to detract from social and emotional development, that the program continued with great achievement. Eventually verbal capabilities were added to the searches (SAT-V) and the program expanded to other universities (Duke, Northwestern, Iowa, and Denver). The program was also deemed to have predictive validity, reasons for which this type of testing has now become a standardized method of identifying early intellectually precocious youth, both within the United States and internationally. To date, the program has identified and provided acceleration for millions of gifted youth. At Johns Hopkins University, the program is now called the Julian C. Stanley Study of Exceptional Talent (SET). The Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) continues at Vanderbilt University today, with former colleagues of Stanley working to complete a fifty-year longitudinal study of gifted individuals. Currently there are 5000 previous students involved who are now nearing mid-life.|$|E

This model created by J. C.

Far from being an American model, in this paper we show, and this is the second objective, through data from several years of implementation of the model in Spain, that it can be considered a universal model, based among others in the principle of above or <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>level</b> measurement. Using this above level measurement, we can adequately discriminate the diverse ability of the students tested, that when measured alone with in level testing, is masked due to lack difficulty and discrimination of the tests used.

40|$|Pressure vessel towers {{used in the}} {{petrochemical}} {{and chemical}} industry are designed to accommodate numbers of internals including trays and beds resulting in tall vertical structures. Transportation of tall towers from the fabrication shop to the construction site presents challenges that can result in high transportation costs or a logistically impossible task of moving the vessel. One of the solutions to this problem is to shorten the tower for transport by cutting part of the tower skirt and welding it in the field. Depending on the location, welding on site can be expensive, labour intensive and may cause problems {{in the quality of}} the weld and the tower being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>level.</b> Using a flanged skirt connection will reduce the field labour spent on connecting the bottom part of the skirt {{to the rest of the}} vessel. The challenge that lies in front of designers is that the current codes and available literature do not give a specific design and calculation guidance for implementing such a solution. This paper looks at different analytical methods to be used for the design of a skirt splice. Methods provided by Jawad and Farr, the Canadian Institute of Steel Construction, the American Institute of Steel Construction, and the Peterson Method from the European Commission’s High-Strength Tower in Steel for Wind Turbines (HISTWIN) are analyzed.

40|$|Characterizing {{the waste}} in {{underground}} storage tanks at the Hanford Site {{is accomplished by}} obtaining a representative core sample for analysis. Core sampling {{is one of the}} numerous techniques that have been developed for use given the environmental and field conditions at the Hanford Site. Core sampling is currently accomplished using either Push Mode Core Sample Truck No. 1 or; Rotary Mode Core Sample Trucks No. 2, 3 or 4. Past analysis (WHC 1994) has indicated that the Core Sample Truck (CST) leveling jacks are structurally inadequate when lateral loads are applied. WHC 1994 identifies many areas where failure could occur. All these failures are based on exceeding the allowable stresses listed in the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) code. The mode of failure is for the outrigger attachments to the truck frame to fail resulting in dropping of the CST and possible overturning (Ref. Ziada and Hundal, 1996). <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>level</b> deployment of the truck can exceed the code allowable stresses in the structure. Calculations have been performed to establish limits for maintaining the truck level when lifting. The calculations and the associated limits are included in appendix A. The need for future operations of the CSTS is limited. Sampling is expected to be complete in FY- 2001. Since there is limited time at risk for continued use of the CSTS with the leveling controls without correcting the structural problems, there are several design changes that could give incremental improvements to the operational safety of the CSTS with limited impact on available operating time. The improvements focus on making the truck easier to control during lifting and leveling. Not all of the tasks identified in this ETP need to be performed. Each task alone can improve the safety. This engineering task plan is the management plan document for implementing the necessary additional structural analysis.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} whether wall growth during aneurysm development spares the aortic wall between the intercostal or lumbar arteries or, alternatively, is uniform around the circumference. MethodsComputed tomography scans of 155 patients with aortic aneurysms (40 thoracic, 50 thoracoabdominal, and 65 abdominal) {{in a single}} hospital of a large academic institution were retrospectively inspected. Computed tomography studies of 100 control subjects (40 thoracic and 60 abdominal) were also reviewed. In all 255 patients, {{the ratio of the}} arc length between the origins of the intercostal or lumbar arteries (interbranch arc length) to the remainder of the aortic residual circumference was calculated. These ratios were compared between all subjects with aneurysms and the controls at each vertebral body level and between those with thoracic or thoracoabdominal or abdominal aneurysms and controls at each vertebral body level. ResultsInterbranch arc lengths and residual aortic circumferences were larger in aneurysm patients than in control subjects, but the differences were statistically significant only at T 4 and from T 8 to L 4 (P =. 009 to P <. 001) and from T 4 to L 4 (P <. 001), respectively. The ratio of interbranch arc length to residual circumference in aneurysmal aortas was significantly smaller than that in controls at 12 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 13 <b>levels</b> from T 4 to L 4 (P =. 004 to P <. 001). There was a statistically significant smaller ratio at 8 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 9 <b>levels</b> for thoracic aneurysms (P =. 006 to P <. 001), 12 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 13 <b>levels</b> for thoracoabdominal aneurysms (P =. 008 to P <. 001), and 3 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 4 <b>levels</b> for abdominal aneurysms compared with controls (P =. 006 to P <. 001).
