Both lunar and solar eclipses presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of atmospheric refraction applied to all astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as Astronomiae Pars Optica (The <b>Optical</b> <b>Part</b> of Astronomy). In it, Kepler described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of pinhole cameras, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. He also extended his study of optics to the human eye, and is generally considered by neuroscientists {{to be the first to}} recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the eye's lens onto the retina. The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics, although he did suggest that the image was later corrected [...] "in the hollows of the brain" [...] due to the [...] "activity of the Soul." [...] Today, Astronomiae Pars Optica is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the law of refraction is conspicuously absent). With respect to the beginnings of projective geometry, Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work. He argued that if a focus of a conic section were allowed to move along the line joining the foci, the geometric form would morph or degenerate, one into another. In this way, an ellipse becomes a parabola when a focus moves toward infinity, and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another, a circle is formed. As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another, the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines. He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single point at infinity, thus having the properties of a large circle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The use of aspherical <b>optical</b> <b>parts</b> {{has become}} common as optical {{instruments}} are becoming smaller with and are achieving higher resolution. Nano-order roughness and high-precision shapes are simultaneously {{required for the}} surface of aspherical <b>optical</b> <b>parts.</b> At present, form accuracy of the aspherical lens becomes less than 50 nm, and the maximum height roughness becomes less than 20 nm. These values of form accuracy and maximum height roughness satisfy the requirement for most precision <b>optical</b> <b>parts.</b> However, nano-topography, which causes grinding marks and deteriorates accuracy of <b>optical</b> <b>parts,</b> is generated on the ground surface. Conventional evaluation criteria such as form accuracy and surface roughness cannot estimate the nano-topography. In the present paper, the cross sectional profile of the axisymmetric ground surface is calculated in order to estimate {{the distribution of the}} nano-topography. As a result, the possibility of control of the nano-topography distribution is confirmed. In addition, controlling the amplitude of nano-topography is easier than controlling the distribution of nano-topography...|$|R

50|$|A {{selenium}} meter is a light-measuring instrument {{based on}} the photoelectric properties of selenium. The most common use of such light meters is measuring the exposure value for photography. The electric part of such a meter is an electromagnetic measuring instrument which {{is connected to the}} anode and cathode of a selenium photo cell that produces more or less electric power when exposed to more or less light. The <b>optical</b> <b>part</b> of such a meter is a window in front of the photo cell's light-sensitive side. The window's surface is usually structured like a honeycomb made of convex lenses. This type of window helps to bundle the light coming from the direction in which the photo cell is pointed. The mechanical part of a selenium meter is an analog calculator which accepts exposure value and film speed as input parameters for showing the possible aperture and shutter-speed combinations for correct exposure.|$|E

5000|$|The Serpens-Aquila Rift (also {{known as}} the Aquila Rift) is a region of the sky in the constellations Aquila, Serpens Cauda, and eastern Ophiuchus {{containing}} dark interstellar clouds. The region forms part of the Great Rift, a dark band that passes {{through the middle of}} the plane of the Milky Way Galaxy. The clouds that form this structure are called [...] "molecular clouds", constituting a phase of the interstellar medium which is cold and dense enough for molecules to form, particularly molecular hydrogen (H2). These clouds are opaque to light in the <b>optical</b> <b>part</b> of the spectrum due to the presence of interstellar dust grains mixed with the gaseous component of the clouds. Therefore, the clouds in the Serpens-Aquila Rift block light from background stars in the disk of the Galaxy, forming the dark rift. The complex is located in a direction towards the inner Galaxy, where molecular clouds are common, so it is possible that not all components of the rift are at the same distance and physically associated with each other.|$|E

50|$|The DOT {{is an open}} telescope, {{which means}} that the {{structure}} is physically open, and the wind can blow through. Because the wind blows along the mirror the air has a more or less constant temperature, and this prevents seeing. Conventional telescope designs have the problem that hot air from the ground (which is hotter due to solar heating) is blown up along the tower, and this causes air with different temperatures to blow along the telescope, which degrades the image.A drawback of this open structure is that the skeleton has to be very rigid (do not confuse with strong), to prevent the structure from moving in the wind. Normally a solid tower takes care of this (as is done with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST), for example), or the telescope is placed inside a dome. The DOT does not have this and thus has to be very rigid. The <b>optical</b> <b>part</b> of the telescope is mounted 2 meters in front of the main mirror, and to prevent blurred images, the cameras are mounted very rigidly and can move with a precision of micrometres.|$|E

30|$|An {{optical fiber}} gas sensor mainly {{consists}} of two parts: <b>optical</b> <b>part</b> and detection circuit. In the debugging for the detection circuit, the <b>optical</b> <b>part</b> usually serves as a signal source. However, in the debugging condition, the <b>optical</b> <b>part</b> can be easily influenced by many factors, such as the fluctuation of ambient temperature or driving current resulting in instability of the wavelength and intensity for the laser; for dual-beam sensor, the different bends and stresses of the optical fiber {{will lead to the}} fluctuation of the intensity and phase; the intensity noise from the collimator, coupler, and other optical devices in the system will also result in the impurity of the <b>optical</b> <b>part</b> based signal source. In order to dramatically improve the debugging efficiency of the detection circuit and shorten the period of research and development, this paper describes an analog signal source, consisting of a single chip microcomputer (SCM), an amplifier circuit, and a voltage-to-current conversion circuit.
