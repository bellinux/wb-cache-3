500|$|Though {{the film}} was {{expected}} to pull in {{a significant number of}} the late teenage/young adult audience, particularly males aged 17 and older, while Cody hoped for a large female turnout, it earned a [...] "disappointing" [...] $2.8million on its <b>opening</b> <b>Friday</b> and $6.8million its opening weekend at the North American box office; the film placed #5, while 3D animated film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs placed #1 with $30.1million. Produced for $16million, Jennifer's Body did manage to attract the sizable female audience Cody wanted; 51% were female, with 70% of patrons under age 25. The film had been expected to benefit somewhat from its heavily marketed lesbian kissing scene between Fox and Seyfried, which, in addition to Fox being in the film, was thought to entice and successfully attract male viewers. Critic Jim Vejvoda at IGN stated that such a scene is not as shocking as it was in past decades and cannot be expected to significantly pull in an audience.

Box Office Mojo called it an [...] "abnormally large drop," [...] close to the second weekend decline for Green Lantern.|$|E
