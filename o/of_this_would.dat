5|$|An {{exception}} to all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be the Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind {{was created to}} control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of}} the main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of what he}} did in the Senate can be {{described}} as the typical sponsorship of legislation that would benefit his state. With his sponsorship, the Senate passed a bill that would aid railroads in Florida, and another that would sell off some of the live oak reservations maintained by the Federal government for the Navy; both bills failed in the House of Representatives. He was more successful with bills aimed at prosecuting the ongoing campaign against the Seminole Indians, although the problem seems to have been overstated. His bills would provide compensation for persons who had suffered from the depredations of Indian raids, and would further the process of removing the aborigines from the state. He also introduced bills that provided for marine hospitals in port cities in Florida. None <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> have been considered exceptional for the era.|$|E
5|$|The Energy Savings Trust has {{estimated}} that micro-generation could provide a significantly increased proportion of the UK's electricity demand by 2050 although only a fraction <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> come from renewable sources. The current Scottish output is negligible. In May 2006 the then Communities Minister Malcolm Chisholm launched a Planning Advice Note aimed at promoting micro-renewables. Small-scale 'wind2heat' projects, which use wind turbines to power electrical storage heaters directly, {{have proven to be}} successful in remoter rural areas; as have various other local schemes such as air source heat pumps.|$|E

5|$|There are {{alternative}} uses of {{food power}} as well. An importer can refuse to continue import unless political concessions are made. This {{would have the}} same effects that an exporter refusing to export would have. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be American reduction of the Cuban sugar quota. In simple terms, the demand concentration (one importer being the dominant buyer) and supply dispersion (several exporters competing to sell the same product) an importer can try to use this exchange politically to their favor; this is especially effective if the exporter has little else so export (low action independence).|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well integrated into a social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I {{the units}} that had been raised {{as part of the}} AIF were disbanded, and the focus of Australian defence {{planning}} returned once more to the maintenance of the Citizens Forces. To this end, a review of defence requirements in 1920 established the need for Australia to be able to field a force of approximately 270,000 men {{in the event of a}} war, of which half <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be maintained in peacetime through compulsory enlistment. It was also decided that the Citizens Force would be re-organised along the lines of the AIF, adopting the divisional structure of the AIF units and maintaining their battle honours. The AIF officially ceased to exist on 1 April 1921 and the new organisation of the Citizens Forces was adopted a month later; this saw the reorganisation of the 88 infantry battalions and five pioneer regiments that had been established under the 1918 scheme, the abolition of infantry regiments and the re-establishment of the 60 infantry battalions that had existed within the AIF, as well as various other units, such as light horse regiments, as well.|$|E

5|$|Not all early roguelikes were readily {{classified}} as Hack or Moria descendants. Larn (1986), developed by Noah Morgan, borrowed concepts from both Hack (in {{that there are}} persistent and fixed levels) and Moria (in {{the availability of a}} shop level and general difficulty increasing with dungeon level), but while these two games have spiraled in size to take multiple play sessions to complete, Larn was aimed to be completed in a single session. Larn also uses a fixed-time feature, in that the player had only so many turns to complete a goal, though there were ways to jump back in time as to extend play. Omega, developed by the Laurence Brothers in the late 1980s, is credited with introducing an overworld concept to the roguelike genre, prior to the feature's appearance in ADOM. Omega was often remembered for its odd inventory approach in which the player would have to pick up an object, considering it being held, and then moving that object to a bag or an equipment slot. Linley's Dungeon Crawl (1995) was created by Linley Henzell and featured a skill-based character progression system, in which experience points could be used to improve specific skills, such as weapon proficiency or trap detection. One fork <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> form the basis for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (2006). SSI's Dungeon Hack (1993) offered randomized dungeons and permadeath within AD 2nd Edition rules.|$|E
5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at {{the right place at the}} right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E
25|$|Induced spatial {{autocorrelation}} (or 'induced spatial dependence') {{arises from}} the species response to the spatial structure of exogenous (external) factors, which are themselves spatially autocorrelated. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be the winter habitat range of deer, which use conifers for heat retention and forage.|$|E

25|$|True/inherent spatial {{autocorrelation}} {{arises from}} interactions among individuals located in close proximity. This process is endogenous (internal) {{and results in}} the individuals being spatially adjacent in a patchy fashion. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be sexual reproduction, the success of which requires the closeness of a male and female of the species.|$|E
25|$|When {{modeling}} smaller networks {{the objective}} function {{can be changed}} accordingly.

25|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be {{breathing}} air in an heliox environment. The helium in the heliox diffuses {{into the skin}} quickly, while the nitrogen diffuses more slowly from the capillaries to the skin {{and out of the}} body. The resulting effect generates supersaturation in certain sites of the superficial tissues and the formation of inert gas bubbles.|$|E
25|$|Bacteriocins are of {{interest}} in medicine because they are made by non-pathogenic bacteria that normally colonize the human body. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be genus Lactobacilli. These bacteria inhabit the normal, lower reproductive tract of women. Loss of these harmless bacteria following antibiotic use may allow opportunistic pathogenic bacteria to invade the human body.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for some species to show combined varieties at one time, especially if one variety is opacity-based {{and the other is}} pattern-based.

The full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus, which would identify respectively its genus, species, and two combined varieties.|$|E

25|$|The Auckland Chamber of Commerce {{publicly}} {{stated that}} if Telecom did not {{invest in a}} next-generation high-speed network, comparable with that of other Western nations, they would fund a private fibre-optic based service in the 100 megabit speed range.

25|$|Many {{species of}} salamander, and {{amphibians}} in general, {{are known to}} have neotenized characteristics because of the environment they live in. The axolotl is a species of salamander that retains its juvenile aquatic form throughout adulthood, an excellent example of full neoteny. Gills are a common juvenile characteristic in amphibians that are kept after maturation; an example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be a comparison of the tiger salamander and the rough-skinned newt, both of which retain gills into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|A {{job where}} there are many workers willing to work {{a large amount of}} time (high supply) {{competing}} for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job {{where there are}} few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages {{due to the nature of}} the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.|$|E
