30|$|There {{have been}} some works in the {{literature}} about energy-efficient relay-assisted networks from the link layer to the network layer [3 – 8]. For the link layer, the energy efficiency problem for multi-carrier amplify-and-forward (AF) relay links is considered in [3]. The optimization problem cast in the paper is non-convex and is converted into a quasi-concave problem by two approximate methods, thus providing a suboptimal solution. In [4 – 6], energy-efficient two-way relay links under different forwarding schemes are studied. The energy efficiency for <b>one-way</b> relay <b>transmission</b> and two-way relay transmission is compared when the AF strategy is adopted in [4], showing that when the bidirectional data amounts are equal, two-way relay transmission performs better; otherwise <b>one-way</b> relay <b>transmission</b> may offer higher energy efficiency. In [5], hybrid relay transmission transmitting partial messages with <b>one-way</b> relay <b>transmission</b> and the remaining messages with two-way relay transmission is proposed. Simulation {{results show that the}} performance of hybrid relay transmission is better than that of the two-way relay <b>transmission</b> and <b>one-way</b> relay <b>transmission.</b> Energy efficiency of the two-way relay link using decode-and-forward (DF) strategy is investigated in [6] and an improved bisection algorithm is proposed to find the optimal energy efficiency. For the network layer, in [7, 8], energy-efficient multi-relay networks are studied, in which the source node sends massage to the destination node via the relay nodes and the best one or several relay nodes by a certain criterion are selected to forward the message from source node in order to achieve the highest energy efficiency.|$|R

30|$|Recently, {{cooperative}} relay {{technique has}} been introduced into CRNs for throughput enhancement and coverage extension without large energy consumption [4]. Traditional <b>one-way</b> relay <b>transmission</b> has a 1 / 2 spectral efficiency loss than direct transmission, which is induced by half-duplex relay nodes [5]. In other words, since half-duplex relay nodes cannot simultaneously transmit and receive signals, <b>one-way</b> relay <b>transmission</b> needs four time slots to accomplish information exchange when two users communicate with each other. In order to overcome the inherent spectrum loss, two-way relaying transmission with physical-layer network coding (PNC) is proposed [6], in which only two time slots are required to finish information exchange. According to the difference of signal processing functions at relay nodes, PNC has several sub-protocols, such as decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF). Many previous works focus on PNC-AF protocol since it is easily realized in practical systems [7, 8]. Therefore, we focus on two-way OFDM-based CRN with PNC-AF protocol in this paper.|$|R

5000|$|Communication for Development (C4D) {{is a broad}} {{term used}} to refer to all the {{different}} types of communication that need to take place in societies if sustainable democratic development is to occur. [...] The approach to Communication for Development (C4D) has evolved over the years. Initially developed after World War II as a tool for diffusion of ideas, communication initiatives primarily involved a <b>one-way</b> <b>transmission</b> of information from the sender to the receiver. This includes largescale media campaigns, social marketing, dissemination of printed materials, and ‘educationentertainment’. Since then, C4D has broadened to incorporate interpersonal communication: face-to-face communication that can either be one-on-one or in small groups. This came alongside the general push for more participatory approaches to development and greater representation of voices from the South. The belief is that while mass media allows for the learning of new ideas, interpersonal networks encourage the shift from knowledge to continued practice.|$|E
50|$|This {{programmatic}} {{approach is}} evident in variants of online course design. others being described {{in the context of}} Web 2.0 technologies that view the trend towards great social networking online as simply an evolution of elearning rather than a major paradigm shift. The utilisation of social software, however, is not simply a new way to teach content, it is method that shifts our relationship with knowledge to include a greater emphasis on peer-to-peer sharing of knowledge, towards more flexible sharing (favouring wikis and web sites over formal journals and copyright) and more ephemeral knowledge (the constantly updating world of blogs and RSS feeds (Mason and Rennie, 2008). Researchers have consequently explored a changing educational landscape where social networking (using a whole variety of new applications) is no longer the <b>one-way</b> <b>transmission</b> of knowledge, but a collaborative process of research and sharing that is no longer linear, not necessarily under the full control of the tutor, and places a higher value on the co-creation, sharing, and re-purposing of educational resources, and above all on increased interaction between the learning participants (Mason and Rennie, 2006).|$|E
5000|$|The {{telephony}} network severely constrains end-to-end delays. ITU-T G.114/G.131 {{states that}} <b>one-way</b> <b>transmission</b> times {{of up to}} 150 ms are universally acceptable, assuming adequate echo control is provided. These constraints are not problematic for TDM networks, where the major component of the end-to-end delay is electrical propagation time ("light speed delay"). By contrast, IP-based systems typically add various forms of delay, {{one of which is}} based on {{the time it takes to}} form packets (packetization delay), which is proportional to the packet size divided by the data rate. Packet sizes cannot be made too small or the packet header overhead will become overwhelming. The other form of delay introduced by IP systems is the playout delay, which needs to be added at the recipient to buffer packet delay variation and ensure a smooth playout.VoIP systems that try to be very bandwidth efficient may also add tens of milliseconds of algorithmic delay in the voice codec. Historically, bad implementations have added additional, operating-system induced delays, which together with the other delays in practice sometimes approach 100 ms even before taking propagation delays into account.|$|E
5000|$|The {{plan was}} to conduct the transatlantic service using Fessenden {{designed}} rotary spark-gap transmitters. A 420 foot (128 meter) guyed antenna was constructed at Brant Rock, with a similar tower erected at Machrihanish in western Scotland. In January 1906, these stations made the first successful two-way transmission across the Atlantic, exchanging Morse code messages. (Marconi had only achieved <b>one-way</b> <b>transmissions</b> at this time.) However, the system was unable to reliably bridge this distance when the sun was up, or {{during the summer months}} when interference levels were higher, so work was suspended until later in the year. Then, on December 6, 1906, the Machrihanish radio tower collapsed in a gale, abruptly ending the transatlantic project before it could begin commercial service. (A detailed review in Engineering magazine blamed the collapse on sub-standard construction, due to [...] "the way in which the joints were made by the man employed for the purpose by the sub-contractors to whom the work was entrusted by the Brown Hoisting Machinery Company" [...] and [...] "The only wonder is that the tower did not fall before.") ...|$|R

50|$|Development {{communication}} {{has brought}} to the fore the evolution of communication for development (C4D)which has mirrored broader shifts in theories and models {{of economic and social}} development. For much of the post-World War II period, C4D was informed by the ‘modernization’ paradigm, which sought to transform ‘traditional’ societies into modern, Western societies through the transmission of attitudes, practices and technologies. Correspondingly, communication initiatives adopted a diffusion approach, which uses communication to carry out a transfer of information. It is seen as a way to amplify voices, facilitate meaningful participation and foster social change. This includes large-scale media campaigns, social marketing, dissemination of printed materials, ‘education-entertainment’ and other forms of <b>one-way</b> <b>transmission</b> of information from the sender to the receiver. Proponents of diffusion theory recognised the limitations of mass media, however, in promoting sustained behavioral change. The theory also incorporated interpersonal communication: face-to-face communication that can either be one-on-one or in small groups. The objectives are to share information, respond to questions, and motivate specific behavioral practices. The belief is that while mass media allows for the learning of new ideas, interpersonal networks encourage the shift from knowledge to continued practice.|$|E
