As they are relatively heavy, they are built on larger forks in trees rather than out in the canopy. Building the nest is often time-consuming initially as the birds try (and often fail) to wedge sticks, which are [...] long and [...] thick, into the tree fork to make a platform.

Furthermore, old nests often disintegrate within twelve months due to their exposed locations. The female develops a brood patch—a patch of bare skin on the bird's underparts that reddens and becomes much more extensive from around three weeks before the first egg is laid.

60|$|Returning to {{the thread}} of our exposition, we have next to trace, {{throughout}} organic progress, this same all-pervading principle. And here, where {{the evolution of the}} homogeneous into the heterogeneous was first observed, the production of many effects by one cause is least easy to demonstrate. The development of a seed into a plant, or an ovum into an animal, is so gradual, while the forces which determine it are so involved, {{and at the same time}} so unobtrusive, that it is difficult to detect the multiplication of effects which is elsewhere so obvious. But, guided by indirect evidence, we may safely conclude that here too the law holds. Note, first, how numerous are the changes which any marked action works upon an adult organism--a human being, for instance. An alarming sound or sight, besides the impressions on the organs of sense and the nerves, may produce a start, a scream, a distortion of the face, a trembling consequent on general muscular relaxation, a burst of perspiration, a rush of blood to the brain, followed possibly by arrest of the heart's action and by syncope; and if the subject be feeble, an indisposition with its long train of complicated symptoms may set in. Similarly in cases of disease. A minute portion of the small-pox virus introduced into the system, will, in a severe case, cause, during the first stage, rigors, heat of skin, accelerated pulse, furred tongue, loss of appetite, thirst, epigastric uneasiness, vomiting, headache, pains in the back and limbs, muscular weakness, convulsions, delirium, &c.; in the second stage, cutaneous eruption, itching, tingling, sore throat, swelled fauces, salivation, cough, hoarseness, dyspnoea, &c.; and in the third stage, <b>oedematous</b> inflammations, pneumonia, pleurisy, diarrhoea, inflammation of the brain, ophthalmia, erysipelas, &c.: each of which enumerated symptoms is itself more or less complex. Medicines, special foods, better air, might in like manner be instanced as producing multipled results. Now it needs only to consider that the many changes thus wrought by one force upon an adult organism, will be in part paralleled in an embryo organism, to understand how here also, the evolution of the homogeneous into the heterogeneous may be due to the production of many effects by one cause. The external heat, which, falling on a matter having special proclivities, determines the first complications of the germ, may, by acting on these, superinduce further complications; upon these still higher and more numerous ones; and so on continually: each organ as it is developed serving, by its actions and reactions on the rest, to initiate new complexities. The first pulsations of the foetal heart must simultaneously aid the unfolding of every part. The growth of each tissue, by taking from the blood special proportions of elements, must modify the constitution of the blood; and so must modify the nutrition of all the other tissues. The heart's action, implying as it does a certain waste, necessitates an addition to the blood of effete matters, which must influence the rest of the system, and perhaps, as some think, cause the formation of excretory organs. The nervous connexions established among the viscera must further multiply their mutual influences; and so continually. Still stronger becomes the probability of this view when we call to mind the fact, that the same germ may be evolved into different forms according to circumstances. Thus, during its earlier stages, every embryo is sexless--becomes either male or female as the balance of forces acting on it determines. Again, it is a well-established fact that the larva of a working-bee will develop into a queen-bee, if before it is too late, its food be changed to that on which the larvæ of queen-bees are fed. All which instances suggest that the proximate cause of each advance in embryonic complication is the action of incident forces upon the complication previously existing. Indeed, we may find a priori reason to think that the evolution proceeds after this manner. For since no germ, animal or vegetal, contains the slightest rudiment or indication of the future organism--since the microscope has shown us that the first process set up in every fertilized germ, is a process of repeated spontaneous fissions ending in the production of a mass of cells, not one of which exhibits any special character; there seems no alternative but to suppose that the partial organization at any moment existing in a growing embryo, is transformed by the agencies acting upon it into the succeeding phase of organization, and this into the next, until, through ever-increasing complexities, the ultimate form is reached. Not indeed that we can thus really explain the production of any plant or animal. We are still in the dark respecting those mysterious properties in virtue of which the germ, when subject to fit influences, undergoes the special changes that begin the series of transformations. All we aim to show, is, that given a germ possessing those particular proclivities distinguishing the species to which it belongs, and the evolution of an organism from it, probably depends on that multiplication of effects which we have seen to be the cause of progress in general, so far as we have yet traced it.|$|E

In 1973, the first simple NMR image was published and the first medical imaging in 1977, entering the clinical arena in the early 1980s. In 1984, NMR medical imaging was renamed MRI. Initial attempts to image the heart were confounded by respiratory and cardiac motion, solved by using cardiac ECG gating, faster scan techniques and breath hold imaging. Increasingly sophisticated techniques were developed including cine imaging and techniques to characterise heart muscle as normal or abnormal (fat infiltration, <b>oedematous,</b> iron loaded, acutely infarcted or fibrosed).|$|E

50|$|Stump blow-out, or {{duodenal}} blow-out, is the leakage of {{the blind}} end of the duodenum. It occurs as a complication of Billroth II gastrectomy, usually on {{the fourth or fifth}} day after surgery. It is due to improper closure of duodenal stump, especially when the duodenum is inflamed and <b>oedematous.</b> It can also occur because of afferent loop block, local pancreatitis and distal obstruction.The patient who was previously convalescing satisfactorily may suddenly present with severe abdominal pain, fever and shock-like state. Jaundice may develop within 48 hours owing to the absorption of bile from peritoneal cavity. If the abdomen is drained, bile-stained fluid may be seen emerging at the drain site.Intravenous fluids should be started and adequate surgical drainage should be provided. Surgery is indicated when there is peritonitis, unresponsive fistula or distal obstruction. Once the life-threatening phase is over, the priority should be to give adequate nutrition.

During this time, Platt imprinted the a prediction on Waterlow that, [...] "Nutrition will be the problem of the future". He was sent to the Caribbean in 1945 to investigate why large numbers of children there were dying and discovered that many had <b>oedematous</b> malnutrition and fatty livers, but was unsure why this was the case. To investigate the cases, he made a microbalance using the newly invented adhesive araldite, to weigh 2 mg samples of liver tissue and also a microrespirometer to measure the enzyme activity in the samples. The microrespirometer {{is said to have been}} much more sensitive than those used by other biochemists at the time and the microbalance was sensitive to within one millionth of a gram. He subsequently discovered that the syndrome he was observing was the same as Kwashiorkor which had been described a few years earlier in Africa. Waterlow set about investigating the biochemical basis of Kwashiorkor, both in the West Indies and at several field stations in Africa. He was the founding editor of the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition.|$|E

AIMS [...] To therefore analyse the influence of hyperlipaemia on the course of acute <b>oedematous</b> and acute necrotising pancreatitis in rats. SUBJECTS [...] Male Wistar rats were used in all experiments. METHODS [...] Six different groups of animals were used: two groups without pancreatitis (controls), two with acute <b>oedematous</b> pancreatitis, and two with acute necrotising pancreatitis. One group from each pair was treated with Triton WR 1339, which induces endogenous hyperlipaemia. Blood samples were taken from all subjects to measure triglyceride, cholesterol, amylase, and lipase. Pancreatic tissue samples were taken and the degree of pancreatic damage was judged microscopically. RESULTS [...] In the control groups no significant changes occurred, either in serum enzyme activities or in histology. The hyperlipaemic subgroup of animals with acute <b>oedematous</b> pancreatitis developed significantly higher (p < 0. 001) serum amylase activities and a greater degree of histological damage (p < 0. 01) than the animals of the non-hyperlipaemic acute <b>oedematous</b> pancreatitis group.

We report the first comprehensive descriptions of the clinical features and risk factors of patients with <b>oedematous</b> disease from the Bellarine Peninsula of south-eastern Victoria, Australia. Methods Data on all confirmed Mycobacterium ulcerans cases managed at Barwon Health, Victoria, were collected from 1 / 1 / 1998 – 31 / 12 / 2012. A multivariate logistic regression model {{was used to assess}} associations with <b>oedematous</b> forms of Mycobacterium ulcerans disease. Results Seventeen of 238 (7 %) patients had <b>oedematous</b> Mycobacterium ulcerans lesions. Their median age was 70 years (IQR 17 – 82 years) and 71 % were male. Twenty-one percent of lesions were WHO category one, 35 % category two and 41 % category three. 16 (94 %) patients were initially diagnosed with cellulitis and received a median 14 days (IQR 9 – 17 days) of antibiotics and 65 % required hospitalization prior to Mycobacterium ulcerans diagnosis. Fever was present in 50 % and pain in 87 % of patients. The WCC, neutrophil count and CRP were elevated in 54 %, 62 % and 75 % of cases respectively. The median duration of antibiotic treatment was 84 days (IQR 67 – 96) and 94 % of cases required surgical intervention. On multivariable analysis, there was an increased likelihood of a lesion being <b>oedematous</b> if on the hand (OR 85. 62, 95 % CI 13. 69 – 535. 70; P< 0. 001), elbow (OR 7. 83, 95 % CI 1. 39 – 43. 96; p< 0. 001) or ankle (OR 7. 92, 95 % CI 1. 28 – 49. 16; p< 0. 001), or if the patient had diabetes mellitus (OR 9. 42, 95 % CI 1. 62 – 54. 74; p = 0. 02).
