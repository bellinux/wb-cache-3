The screenplay was written by Wong and Glen Morgan, both of whom had worked on the franchise's first film in 2000. Final Destination 3 stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Ryan Merriman, and is set {{five years after the}} first film. Winstead plays Wendy Christensen, a teenager who has a premonition that a roller coaster <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> and her classmates are riding derails.

5|$|In 1990 Linda Syddick went to Sydney to see {{her work}} Ngkarte Dreaming hung in the Blake Prize {{exhibition}} – one of three occasions prior to 1994 <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> was a Blake finalist.

Linda's works are held in several major public collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kim Deal {{was eager}} to {{continue}} recording and performing. At first, she envisioned her next album as a solo record, <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> would play all of the instrument parts. When she was recording initial demos for the project, she asked Kelley to play on some of them, to distract her from her drug difficulties. Since Kelley was now also involved, Deal {{decided not to go}} solo, but formed a new group. She recruited Macpherson to play drums, musician Luis Lerma, bass, and Nate Farley, guitar. Later, Kelley dropped out of the project for rehabilitation and moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota. For fun, Deal began calling herself Tammy Ampersand, and the group, Tammy and the Amps. This later became simply the Amps.|$|E

5|$|Otranto {{had made}} two round-trips to Australia by January 1910, {{and then made}} a 17-day cruise in the Mediterranean before {{resuming}} her London–Australia runs into early 1911. That year, the company was awarded a contract to carry mail and she was redesignated as RMS Otranto, the RMS standing for Royal Mail Ship. She was present at King George V's Coronation Naval Review on 26 June and made several voyages to the Norwegian fjords before mid-September {{when she returned to}} the Australia run, <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> remained until war was declared on Germany on 4 August 1914.|$|E
5|$|The {{figure of}} Hope holds a broken lyre, {{based on an}} ancient Athenian wood and {{tortoiseshell}} lyre then {{on display in the}} British Museum. Although broken musical instruments were a frequently occurring motif in European art, they had never previously been associated with Hope. Hope's lyre has only a single string remaining, <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> attempts to play. She strains to listen {{to the sound of the}} single unbroken string, symbolising both persistence and fragility, and the closeness of hope and despair. Watts had recently shown interest in the idea of a continuity between the visual arts and music, and had previously made use of musical instruments as a way to invigorate the subjects of his portraits.|$|E
5|$|Upon completion, {{the ship}} was {{chartered}} to the Dominion Line, a subsidiary line of International Mercantile Marine (IMM) with which International Navigation had merged in 1902. The liner sailed for Dominion on her maiden voyage on 8 March 1902 from Liverpool to Boston. After completing eleven voyages on that route, Merion was returned to the American Line in March 1903. The following month she began sailing on the Liverpool–Philadelphia route <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> sailed {{most of the rest}} of her passenger career. She was briefly chartered to the Red Star Line in 1907 for one Antwerp–New York voyage.|$|E

5|$|Her {{father was}} first elected to Dáil Éireann as a Fine Gael Teachta Dála (TD) at the 2005 Meath by-election, winning the seat vacated by the {{resignation}} of former Taoiseach John Bruton, and was a popular figure with constituents. McEntee began to work in Leinster House as her father's personal assistant in May 2010 while he was an opposition TD. One of the first issues <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> worked with {{her father was a}} campaign on behalf of the owners of several thousand houses damaged by the use of pyrite, a material used as backfill during construction, that expands when damp or exposed to air. She considered standing as a candidate in the 2014 local elections, and discussed the prospect with her father, as well as the possibility of one day succeeding him {{as a member of the}} Dáil. She moved with him to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine when he was appointed minister of state after Fine Gael became a party of government following the 2011 general election.|$|E
5|$|On 26 January 1569, Mary {{was moved}} to Tutbury Castle {{and placed in the}} custody of the Earl of Shrewsbury and his {{formidable}} wife Bess of Hardwick. Elizabeth considered Mary's designs on the English throne to be a serious threat and so confined her to Shrewsbury's properties, including Tutbury, Sheffield Castle, Wingfield Manor and Chatsworth House, all located in the interior of England halfway between Scotland and London, and distant from the sea. Mary was permitted her own domestic staff, which never numbered less than 16, and needed 30 carts to transport her belongings from house to house. Her chambers were decorated with fine tapestries and carpets, as well as her cloth of state <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> had the French phrase En ma fin est mon commencement ("In my end lies my beginning") embroidered. Her bedlinen was changed daily, and her own chefs prepared meals with a choice of 32 dishes served on silver plates. She was occasionally allowed outside under strict supervision, spent seven summers at the spa town of Buxton, and spent much of her time doing embroidery. Her health declined, perhaps through porphyria or lack of exercise, and by the 1580s, she had severe rheumatism in her limbs, rendering her lame.|$|E
5|$|South Wind Through the Kitchen (1997) was the {{completion}} {{of one of the}} projects of David's later years <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite of her articles and recipes. Many of the contributors, such as the chef Simon Hopkinson, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and recipes are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays. The title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, and is a reference to South Wind, a novel by David's mentor Norman Douglas.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{directed}} by Kamila Andini, who also wrote the script and, in collaboration with Dirmawan Hatta, the screenplay. For her feature film debut, Andini chose {{to write about the}} sea– a topic which had long interested her and <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> had previously recorded documentaries. She had also had a long-held interest in environmental issues. It was produced by former Miss Indonesia, Nadine Chandrawinata, together with Andini's father, the director Garin Nugroho. Andini has stated that she only consulted with her father and that he was not directly involved in the production, while Chandrawinata described herself as assistant producer, with Nugroho in charge. Artistic direction was handled by Timothy D Setyanto, with costumes by Retno Ratih Damayanti and make-up by Erwin Wijaya. Cinematography was completed by Ipung Rachmat Syaiful. Editing was handled by Wawan I Wibowo, while Thoersi Argeswara provided music and Khikmawan Santosa provided sound effects.|$|E
5|$|To prove {{she is able}} {{to handle}} her own affairs, Serena refuses to leave jail with either Lily or CeCe (Caroline Lagerfelt) {{although}} Lily drops the charges <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>she</b> had Serena arrested. Rufus (Matthew Settle) is also angry with Lily for Serena's arrest; Dan (Penn Badgley) and Jenny (Taylor Momsen) inform Vanessa (Jessica Szohr) that Rufus returned home without proposing to Lily, and he has remained in his bedroom ever since. Lily feuds with CeCe for telling Rufus about their lovechild. From jail, Serena encourages Blair (Leighton Meester) to enjoy prom with Nate (Chace Crawford) in the way Blair had chronicled in a scrapbook as a preteen, but each of the couple’s prom plans, such as the limo, hotel reservation and Blair's dress, inexplicably go awry. Nate suspects Chuck (Ed Westwick) of sabotaging the prom in an effort to win Blair back, but Chuck denies involvement. Dan convinces Serena to allow him to pay her bail and escort her to the Prom.|$|E
