Choice <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> their lattices have been very studied {{in the framework of}} the theory of the revealed preference in economics. A significant connection between closure <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> choice <b>operators</b> is the duality between anti-exchange operators (corresponding to convex geometries) <b>and</b> path-independent choice <b>operators.</b> More generally, there is a one-to-one correspondence between closure <b>operators</b> <b>and</b> choice <b>operators...</b>|$|R
