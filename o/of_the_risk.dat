5|$|Although some guides {{indicate}} {{the species is}} edible with suitable preparation (such as boiling), it is generally not recommended for consumption because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of confusion with other toxic Gyromitra species that contain the compound gyromitrin.

5|$|Mercury readily {{combines}} with aluminium {{to form a}} mercury-aluminium amalgam {{when the}} two pure metals come into contact.

5|$|A {{preventative}} procedure (thoracotomy or thoracoscopy with pleurodesis) may be recommended {{after an}} episode of pneumothorax, with the intention to prevent recurrence. Evidence on the most effective treatment is still conflicting in some areas, and there is variation between treatments available in Europe and the US. Not all episodes of pneumothorax require such interventions; the decision depends largely on estimation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of recurrence. These procedures are often recommended after the occurrence of a second pneumothorax. Surgery {{may need to be}} considered if someone has experienced pneumothorax on both sides ("bilateral"), sequential episodes that involve both sides, or if an episode was associated with pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Acetylcysteine, {{also called}} N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce {{paracetamol}} toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite {{so that it}} does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine {{has been shown to be}} a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion.|$|E

Willkie also went to Ireland, hoping to persuade Éamon de Valera to abandon neutrality, but his urging was unavailing. Willkie left London for Washington on February 5; because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being shot down by Nazi aircraft, the {{roundabout}} journey home took four days. He testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 11, and his support was key to passing Lend-Lease.|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and scrapie are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E

5|$|Each 3milliliter dose lasts {{approximately}} 30minutes. Pain relief begins after 6–8 breaths {{and continues}} {{for several minutes}} after stopping inhalation. The maximum recommended dose is 6milliliters per day or 15milliliters per week because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of cumulative dose-related nephrotoxicity, and {{it should not be}} used on consecutive days. Despite the potential for renal impairment when used at anesthetic doses, no significant adverse effects {{have been reported in the}} literature when it is used at the lower doses (up to 6milliliters) used for producing analgesia and sedation. Due to the risk of organ (especially renal) toxicity, methoxyflurane is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing kidney disease or diabetes mellitus, and is not recommended to be administered in conjunction with tetracyclines or other potentially nephrotoxic or enzyme-inducing drugs.|$|E
5|$|Exsudoporus frostii {{mushrooms}} can {{be recognized}} by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the stipe, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury.
