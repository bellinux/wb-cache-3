5000|$|Five young teens; Finn, Willa, Charlene, Maybeck, and Philby, {{have been}} {{selected}} to serve as holographic theme park guides, Disney Hosts Interactives (DHI), in Walt Disney World.

Chased by ghosts and more zombies under the Traveler's control, they flee.|$|R
5000|$|Gaston is also {{featured}} in the Marvel Comics serial for Beauty and the Beast, taking place during Belle's stay at the castle. He generally served as comic relief and effectively the [...] "protagonist" [...] of the village B-stories, where {{he is trying to}} come up with some scheme to get Belle to marry him, only for the triplets to interfere and sabotage his plans in order to get him to focus on them over Belle. He also appears in an expanded role in Serena Valentino's 2014 book The Beast Within: A Tale Of Beauty's Prince, which takes place prior to the start of the original film. In the novel, Gaston and the Beast are portrayed as childhood friends, with the curse erasing Gaston's memory of the prince. He has a brief cameo in the fourth Kingdom Keepers book, where he alongside Prince John and Horned King were present with the <b>Overtakers</b> at Tom Sawyer Island. He also had a section dedicated to himself in the tongue-and-cheek book Villain Files alongside the other Disney Villains, with it implying that his meeting Belle was during archery practice. He also was in Descendants: Isle of the Lost, the tie-in novel to Descendants, where he had to belle as their wife and had two sons, whom he evidently named after himself due to his egomania. They also shared his egomania to some extent, but were comparatively kinder than their father.|$|R
