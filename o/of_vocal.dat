5|$|Stops {{that are}} fortis (or 'strong') are {{differentiated}} {{from those that}} are lenis (or 'weak') {{on the basis of}} length of closure, as opposed to the voice onset time (VOT), the period after the release of the stop before the commencement <b>of</b> <b>vocal</b> fold activity (or voice) which normally differentiates fortis and lenis stops in English and most other languages.|$|E

5|$|The lungs {{also play}} {{a pivotal role in}} speech by {{providing}} air and airflow for the creation <b>of</b> <b>vocal</b> sounds.

The soundtrack spawned two soundtrack albums, as well as a disc <b>of</b> <b>vocal</b> and orchestral arrangements.|$|E
5|$|At {{each stage}} {{mentioned}} above, children play with sounds and learn methods {{to help them}} learn words. There is a relationship between children's prelinguistic phonetic skills and their lexical progress at age two: failure to develop the required phonetic skills in their prelinguistic period results in children's delay in producing words. Environmental influences may affect children's phonological development, such as hearing loss {{as a result of}} ear infections. Deaf infants and children with hearing problems due to infections are usually delayed in the beginning <b>of</b> <b>vocal</b> babbling.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number <b>of</b> <b>vocal</b> and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many {{be made in}} cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when in distress and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E

5|$|Commentary on {{the album}} has {{included}} discussion of its minimal instrumentation and the interjection of unexpected sounds.

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1904, he left Podolia {{and moved to the}} Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, where he became a teacher <b>of</b> <b>vocal</b> and {{instrumental}} music in a school for railroad workers' children. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Leontovych organized a choir of workers that performed in meetings. These works included arrangements of Ukrainian, Jewish, Armenian, Russian, and Polish folk songs. Leontovych's activity caught the attention of local authorities, and in {{the spring of}} 1908 he was forced to move back to his native Podolia region to the city of Tulchyn.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} {{to an extreme}} length of time is accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during the verses, by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars <b>of</b> <b>vocal</b> melody. Partly {{as a result of}} the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic.|$|E
30|$|The length <b>of</b> the <b>vocal</b> tract and its {{cross-sectional}} {{areas are}} the main parameters which determine the shape <b>of</b> the <b>vocal</b> tract and {{have a significant impact}} on the distribution <b>of</b> formants. <b>Vocal</b> tract length and cross-sectional areas of the tube model are computed from real speech.|$|R

5|$|Though {{originally}} set to an Italian libretto, Orfeo ed Euridice owes much to {{the genre}} of French opera, particularly in its use of accompanied recitative and a general absence <b>of</b> <b>vocal</b> virtuosity. Indeed, twelve years after the 1762 premiere, Gluck re-adapted the opera to suit the tastes of a Parisian audience at the Académie Royale de Musique with a libretto by Pierre-Louis Moline. This reworking was given the title Orphée et Eurydice, and several alterations were made in vocal casting and orchestration to suit French tastes.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{physical}} examination, {{breath sounds}} (heard with a stethoscope) may be diminished on the affected side, partly because {{air in the}} pleural space dampens the transmission of sound. Measures of the conduction <b>of</b> <b>vocal</b> vibrations {{to the surface of}} the chest may be altered. Percussion of the chest may be perceived as hyperresonant (like a booming drum), and vocal resonance and tactile fremitus can both be noticeably decreased. Importantly, the volume of the pneumothorax can show limited correlation with the intensity of the symptoms experienced by the victim, and physical signs may not be apparent if the pneumothorax is relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Before the Baroque era, {{keyboard}} music generally was {{not written}} for one instrument or another, but rather was written {{to be played}} on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period {{is the same as}} that of the harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions from a variety of regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations <b>of</b> <b>vocal</b> music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E

50|$|The {{vibratory}} portion <b>of</b> the <b>vocal</b> fold in {{the anterior}} glottis {{is connected to the}} thyroid cartilage anteriorly by the macula flava and anterior commissure tendon, or Broyles' ligament. Posteriorly, this vibratory portion is connected to the <b>vocal</b> process <b>of</b> the arytenoid cartilage by the posterior macula flava. The macula flava in newborn vocal folds is important for the growth and development <b>of</b> the <b>vocal</b> ligament and layered structure <b>of</b> the <b>vocal</b> folds. In the adult, the macula flavae are probably required for metabolism of the extracellular matrices <b>of</b> the <b>vocal</b> fold mucosa, replacing damaged fibers {{in order to maintain the}} integrity and elasticity <b>of</b> the <b>vocal</b> fold tissues. Age-related changes in the macula flava influence the fibrous components <b>of</b> the <b>vocal</b> folds and are partially responsible for the differences in the acoustics of the adult and aged voice.|$|R
