5|$|A major 18-month {{redevelopment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> led by W.S. Atkins with Foster and Partners as sub-consultants {{was completed}} in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square,</b> demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace {{in front of the}} National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a café. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.|$|E

5|$|Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux {{triangle}} has {{the minimum}} {{area and the}} sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is the farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and {{is closely related to}} the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square,</b> and has the smallest possible area of shapes with this property. However, although it covers most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> in this rotation process, it fails to cover {{a small fraction of the}} square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.|$|E

5|$|San Marco Square is the neighborhood's major {{commercial}} district. The triangular {{district is}} located at the three-way juncture of Atlantic Boulevard, Hendricks Avenue and San Marco Boulevard; a tiered fountain at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> originally marked the convergence of these streets. The San Marco Building, a Mediterranean Revival structure completed in 1927, was the district's first commercial building and set its architectural tone. Other features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> include the San Marco Theatre, an art deco single-screen movie theater first opened in 1938; and the Little Theatre, home to Theatre Jacksonville, one of the country's oldest community theater troupes.|$|E
5|$|The Presidio {{was built}} to {{standard}} plans for a Spanish colonial military headquarters, using locally available materials, so the buildings forming the outer square were constructed with thick, solid adobe outer walls. The main gate opened into an open parade ground/plaza in the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square.</b> The chapel stood {{at the center of}} the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square,</b> facing the gate across the plaza. While it was never attacked by a strong military force during its sixty years of operation, the Presidio was subject to the assaults of nature. Several devastating earthquakes in the early 19th century destroyed much of the structure.|$|E

5|$|A {{weekly market}} was {{granted to the}} town by Baldwin de Redvers and the first market took place in 1149 at the {{junction}} of Castle Street and High Street. These weekly markets stopped in 1872 but resumed a century later in a car park next to the town hall, now the site of Saxon Square. When construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square</b> began in 1983, the market was moved to a car park in Bank Close. Today it is held every Monday in High Street which is then closed to traffic.

5|$|Any {{curve of}} {{constant}} width can form a rotor within a square, a shape that can perform a complete rotation while staying within the square and {{at all times}} touching all four sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square.</b> However, the Reuleaux triangle is the rotor with the minimum possible area. As it rotates, its axis does not stay fixed at a single point, but instead follows a curve formed by the pieces of four ellipses. Because of its 120° angles, the rotating Reuleaux triangle cannot reach some points near the sharper angles at the square's vertices, but rather covers a shape with slightly rounded corners, also formed by elliptical arcs.|$|E
5|$|Barry's scheme {{provided}} two plinths for sculptures on {{the north}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>square.</b> A bronze equestrian statue of George IV by Sir Francis Chantrey, originally intended to be placed on top of the Marble Arch, was installed on the eastern plinth in 1844, while the other remained empty until the late-20th century. There are two other statues on plinths, both installed during the 19th century: General Sir Charles James Napier by George Cannon Adams in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir Henry Havelock by William Behnes in the south-east in 1861. In 2000, the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, suggested replacing the statues with figures more familiar to the general public.|$|E
