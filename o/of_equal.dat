5|$|Electric {{potential}} is a scalar quantity, that is, {{it has only}} magnitude and not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> height, a set of lines marking points <b>of</b> <b>equal</b> potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E

This finding could suggest that there are fundamental differences between the returns for mergers <b>of</b> <b>equals</b> and acquisitions <b>of</b> banking firms. To test if mergers <b>of</b> <b>equals</b> in fact differ from acquisitions, I examine bidder and target returns, number of days to complete the transaction, and returns based on headquarter location.
