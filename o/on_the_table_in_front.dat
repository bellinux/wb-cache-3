5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, place {{one of these}} pieces on the board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E
500|$|Her {{influence}} {{with the public}} was again demonstrated when sales of Riesling wine increased by 30% in the UK after she had incorporated it into her Coq au Riesling recipe on Nigella Express. In December 2007 she appeared on BBC's The Graham Norton Show and revealed that she had once eaten 30 pickled eggs for a £1,000 bet, saying [...] "How stupid to challenge me! I made them all put their money <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of me. The next day I had scrambled eggs for breakfast." ...|$|E
500|$|Leslie {{decides to}} confront Tammy directly, {{only to find}} Tammy {{seems to be a}} {{friendly}} woman who instantly agrees to let Leslie have Lot 48 as a [...] "professional courtesy". Impressed, Leslie brings Tammy to the parks department so she can talk to Ron and work out their differences. Tammy and an agitated Ron go off to have coffee, and Donna (Retta) insists to Leslie that the arrangement is a mistake because the two act crazy when they are together. At a local diner, Ron and Tammy immediately start a very loud argument {{in front of the other}} patrons. Moments later, however, the two are publicly making out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of everyone. The two rush off to a motel, where they frantically remove their clothing before even entering the building.|$|E

500|$|Several {{witnesses}} later {{reported that}} they heard a loud gunshot at approximately 15:30. After waiting a few minutes, Hitler's valet, Heinz Linge, opened the study door with Bormann at his side. Linge later stated that he immediately noted a scent of burnt almonds, which is a common observation {{in the presence of}} prussic acid (the aqueous form of hydrogen cyanide). Hitler's adjutant, SS-Sturmbannführer Otto Günsche, entered the study and found the two lifeless bodies on the sofa. Eva, with her legs drawn up, was to Hitler's left and slumped away from him. Günsche stated that Hitler [...] "... sat... sunken over, with blood dripping out of his right temple. He had shot himself with his own pistol, a Walther PPK 7.65". The gun lay at his feet and according to SS-Oberscharführer Rochus Misch, Hitler's head was lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him. Blood dripping from Hitler's right temple and chin had made a large stain on the right arm of the sofa and was pooling on the carpet. According to Linge, Eva's body had no visible physical wounds, and her face showed how she had died—by cyanide poisoning. Günsche and SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke stated [...] "unequivocally" [...] that all outsiders and those performing duties and work in the bunker [...] "did not have any access" [...] to Hitler's private living quarters during the time of death (between 15:00 and 16:00).|$|E
2500|$|Officer's skat (German: [...] ) is {{a variant}} for two players. Each player gets 16 cards <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him, 8 facing down and 8 {{on top of}} each of them with face shown. Bidding is {{replaced}} by declaring a game type and trump by the companion. When a top card is played, the hidden card is uncovered, making a total of 16 tricks in that game. Scoring is like normal skat.|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{with the}} {{player on the}} dealer's left, each player in turn lays one card face up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of him or her, stating the count—that is, the {{cumulative}} value of the cards that have been laid (for example, the first player lays a five and says [...] "five", the next lays a six and says [...] "eleven", and so on)—without the count going above 31. The cards are not laid in {{the centre of the}} table as, {{at the end of the}} [...] "play," [...] each player needs to pick up the cards they have laid.|$|E

2500|$|Randi has {{appeared}} on numerous TV shows, sometimes to directly debunk the claimed abilities of fellow guests. In a 1981 appearance on That's My Line, Randi appeared opposite claimed psychic James Hydrick, {{who said that he}} could move objects with his mind and appeared to demonstrate this claim on live television by turning a page in a telephone book without touching it. Randi, having determined that Hydrick was surreptitiously blowing on the book, arranged foam packaging peanuts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the telephone book for the demonstration. This prevented Hydrick from demonstrating his abilities, which would have been exposed when the blowing moved the packaging. Randi writes that, eventually, Hydrick [...] "confessed everything".|$|E
