50|$|July 6, MEND claimed {{responsibility}} for {{an attack on the}} Okan <b>oil</b> <b>manifold.</b> The pipeline was blown up at 8:45 p.m. (3:45 p.m. ET) Sunday. The militants claim that the manifold carried some 80 percent of Chevron Nigeria Limited's off-shore crude oil to a loading platform.|$|E
5000|$|Capable of {{producing}} [...] {{out of its}} 4565 cc displacement, the Northstar featured a cast aluminum 90Â° V8 block with 102 mm (4 in) bore spacing split into unitary upper and lower halves. The lower crankcase assembly supported the crankshaft without conventional main bearing caps. An <b>oil</b> <b>manifold</b> plate with an integrated silicone gasket forms the oil gallery under this. A typical oil change used 7.5-8 quarts of oil.|$|E
5000|$|This highly maneuverable weapon has an optimal, low-to-medium {{altitude}} delivery capability with pinpoint accuracy. It {{also has}} a standoff capability. During Desert Storm, all 71 GBU-15 modular glide bombs used were dropped from F-111F aircraft. Most notably, EGBU-15s were the munitions used for destroying the <b>oil</b> <b>manifolds</b> on the storage tanks to stop oil from spilling into the Persian Gulf [...] These EGBU-15s sealed flaming <b>oil</b> pipeline <b>manifolds</b> sabotaged by Saddam Hussein's troops.|$|R

40|$|The National Bureau of Standards {{tested a}} 300 -horsepower Hispano-Suiza engine to {{determine}} the characteristic performance of the engine at various altitudes. The engine was operated at the ground, at 25, 000 feet, and at intermediate altitudes, both at full loads {{similar to those that}} would be imposed upon the engine at various speeds by a propeller whose normal full-load speed was 1, 800 r. p. m. Friction horsepower also was determined in order that the mechanical efficiency of the engine might be calculated. From the test data there were computed the brake horsepower, brake mean effective pressure, specific fuel consumption, mixture ratio, jacket loss, exhaust loss, and thermal, mechanical, and volumetric efficiencies. A record of jacket water temperatures, <b>oil</b> temperatures, <b>manifold</b> pressures, etc., shows the conditions under which the test was made...|$|R
5|$|Operations aboard oil tankers {{are governed}} by an {{established}} body of best practices and {{a large body of}} international law. Cargo can be moved on or off of an oil tanker in several ways. One method is for the ship to moor alongside a pier, connect with cargo hoses or marine loading arms. Another method involves mooring to offshore buoys, such as a single point mooring, and making a cargo connection via underwater cargo hoses. A third method is by ship-to-ship transfer, also known as lightering. In this method, two ships come alongside in open sea and <b>oil</b> is transferred <b>manifold</b> to manifold via flexible hoses. Lightering is sometimes used where a loaded tanker is too large to enter a specific port.|$|R
5000|$|Differences between F7P (1.8L 16V) and F7R include {{increased}} {{capacity to}} 1998 cc, bigger valves, more aggressive cam profile, different crank, larger piston bore (82.7mm compared to F7P of 82.0mm), longer stroke (93.0mm compared to 83.50mm) different exhaust <b>manifold,</b> <b>oil</b> cooler, etc. All {{this results in}} more low-down torque and more power. Also F7R is coupled to uprated gearbox (JC5) instead of JB3(1.8 16V). Highly tuned F7R engine was used in Renault's rally car Clio Williams Maxi with power output ranging from 250 to [...] This version was coupled with Sadev 6-speed manual or 7-speed Hewland sequential gearbox (stock Williams 5-speed manual). Later evolutions of rally engine had destroked crankshaft with 90 mm stroke and 84 mm bore diameter to keep the 1998 cc capacity.|$|R
40|$|In {{cooperation}} with the Engineering Division of the Air Service of the United States Army, a Liberty- 12 engine has been tested at the Bureau of Standards. The program of tests was planned to yield that information considered most important in determining {{the value of the}} engine for aviation. Full power runs were made at the ground, at 25, 000 feet, and at several intermediate altitudes. To determine the mechanical efficiency of the engine, friction horsepower was measured at the ground and at 15, 000 feet. As a basis for predicting engine performance with a propeller, a series of tests was made in which the dynamometer load and engine throttle were adjusted at each speed to simulate the engine load which would be imposed at that speed by a propeller operating under normal full load at 1, 700 r. p. m. Among the quantities calculated from the test measurements are: brake horsepower; break mean effective pressure; fuel consumption; mixture ratio; mechanical, thermal, and volumetric efficiency; and the percentage of the heat in the fuel appearing in the jacket water and in the exhaust. Jacket water temperature, <b>oil</b> temperature, <b>manifold</b> pressure, etc., are recorded to show the conditions under which the test was made...|$|R
5000|$|Nylon 66 is {{frequently}} used when high mechanical strength, rigidity, good stability under heat and/or chemical resistance are required It {{is used in}} fibers for textiles and carpets and molded parts. For textiles, fibers are sold under various brands, for example Nilit brands or the Cordura brand for luggage, {{but it is also}} used in airbags, apparel, and for carpet fibres under the Ultron brand. Nylon 66 lends itself well to make 3D structural objects, mostly by injection molding finding broad use in auto application under the hood such as radiator end tanks, rocker covers, air intake <b>manifolds,</b> <b>oil</b> pans [...] and numerous other structural parts [...] such as ball bearing cages, electro-insulating elements, pipes, profiles, various machine parts, zip ties, conveyor belts, hoses, polymer framed weapons, and the outer layer of turnout blankets. Nylon 66 is also a popular guitar nut material.|$|R
5000|$|Production started-up on 11 November 1976, and on 13 December 1976 {{the first}} tanker was loaded. The Brent field oil is {{extracted}} by four platforms in an irregular SSW-NNE line. [...] The first in place was the concrete-legged [...] "Condeep" [...] Brent Bravo in 1975, {{followed by the}} concrete-legged Brent Delta, Brent Charlie, and steel-jacket Brent Alpha. As of 2004, the platform was still producing <b>oil</b> through a <b>manifold</b> (all Brent Alpha fluids are produced across to Brent Bravo). A fifth installation, the floating Brent Spar, served as a storage- and tanker-loading buoy and was installed early in the field's construction. The [...] "spar" [...] design of this installation led to the name by which it became {{the best known of}} the Brent installations (outside the oil industry). The field also included a remote flare, the [...] "Brent Flare", which was used to flare off excess gas before gas handling and export facilities were installed in the field. This unit was decommissioned and removed using a heavy lifting barge in 2005.|$|R
2500|$|With Roadmaster being a {{completely}} new model, and with Buick having totally restyled its entire line for 1936, {{one might have expected}} only modest changes for 1937. But that was not the case. Buick was the only GM car, along with the Chevrolet Standard, to retain its basic 1934 styling for 1935, so the 1936 re-style merely caught Buick up {{with the rest of the}} GM marques. [...] For 1937, Buick moved to newly re-styled bodies along with all other GM cars. The Roadmaster gained a divided grille with horizontal bars. The center section of the grille was painted to match the body of the car. Fenders became squared off and the headlight shells were gracefully streamlined. Overall height fell by [...] without sacrificing interior room. A new carburetor and revised camshaft raised engine horsepower to 130. The engine also received a new intake <b>manifold,</b> <b>oil</b> pump, cooling system and a quieter overhead valve mechanism. A formal sedan, featuring a roll-down glass partition between the front and rear compartments, was added to the Roadmaster line for $1,641, of which 452 were sold. The price of the sedan was raised to $1,518, and that of the phaeton to $1,856, or by 21 percent and 19 percent respectively. Nevertheless, overall Roadmaster sales increased to 16,129.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{worldwide}} interest in the exploration, production and utilization programs for offshore oil, natural gas and other minerals. As a part of these efforts considerable interest has been directed {{in the last decade}} towards marine geotechnology. Adhesive resistance of ocean sediments is one of the important properties of marine soils which finds an application in ship salvage, refloating of exploratory platforms and relocation of marine installations such as pipelines, <b>oil</b> rigs, well-head <b>manifolds,</b> well linings and ice-soil interaction studies. [...] There is considerable research work reported in the literature about the adhesion and skin friction between terrestrial soils and construction materials. However, ocean floor soils differ from most terrestrial soils in their properties. Surficial ocean sediments are generally cohesive and highly underconsolidated, having very low shear strength with high liquidity index. Such soils have negligible angle of shear resistance. In the studies of interaction of such soils with embedded objects, only adhesion is of primary importance. Very little information is available at present about the adhesive resistance of these underconsolidated sediments. A closely related property is the base suction at the interface of the object base and soil, which is important in the breakout problem. [...] An attempt has been made in this investigation to study the adhesion and base suction during pull out tests in an artificially sedimented soil having properties comparable to those of ocean sediments. Laboratory tests were carried out to determine (a) the adhesion between the soil and objects of different surface roughness, (b) the suction at the base of prismatic objects of different base configurations during pull out, and (c) the total breakout force for fully embedded objects. [...] Only one type of soil was used in all the tests and the sample was prepared by mixing a pre-weighed dry soil in a known volume of water. [...] The adhesive resistance was found to depend on the surface roughness of the embedded objects {{as well as on the}} soil cohesion. Surface unevenness and physio-chemical action were two additional factors influencing adhesion, as observed in the tests on plexiglas and glass plate respectively. [...] Base suction for prismatic objects was found to be a function of the depth to breadth ration (D/B) of the object. It is higher for higher D/B values. Base configurations do not appear to have any significant influence on the base suction values. [...] A fairly good correlation was found between the breakout force determined from the experiments and that estimated analytically. [...] Pull out tests conducted with fresh water ice sheets indicate that the adhesion - cohesion ratio is very nearly constant in the range of soil strengths tested...|$|R
