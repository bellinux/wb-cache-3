But {{it was a very}} fine person, and a fair and lustrous beard, {{spreading}} itself upon a well-presented chest, contributed to its effect. After a moment Catherine recognised the upper half of the face, which, though her visitor's clustering locks had grown thin, was still remarkably handsome. He stood in a deeply deferential attitude, with his eyes on her face. [...] "I have ventured--I have ventured," [...] he said; and then he paused, looking about him, as if he expected her to ask him to sit down. It was the old voice, but it had not the old charm. Catherine, for a minute, was conscious of a distinct determination not to invite him to take a seat. Why had he come? It was wrong for him to come. Morris was embarrassed, but Catherine gave him no help. It was not that she was glad of his embarrassment; on the contrary, it excited all her <b>own</b> <b>liabilities</b> of this kind, and gave her great pain. But how could she welcome him when she felt so vividly that he ought not to have come? [...] "I wanted so much--I was determined," [...] Morris went on. But he stopped again; it was not easy. Catherine still said nothing, and he may well have recalled with apprehension her ancient faculty of silence. She continued to look at him, however, and as she did so she made the strangest observation. It seemed to be he, and yet not he; it was the man who had been everything, and yet this person was nothing. How long ago it was--how old she had grown--how much she had lived! She had lived on something that was connected with HIM, and she had consumed it in doing so. This person did not look unhappy. He was fair and well-preserved, perfectly dressed, mature and complete. As Catherine looked at him, the story of his life defined itself in his eyes; he had made himself comfortable, and he had never been caught. But even while her perception opened itself to this, she had no desire to catch him; his presence was painful to her, and she only wished he would go.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{questions}} the widely accepted view that deficits have real {{effects in the}} life cycle model. Standard analyses of deficits within life cycle models treat the government as a dictatorial entity that can effect any intergenerational redistribution it desires. In contrast, this paper drops the assumption of compulsion and models the government as a coalition of self-interested young and old generations whose bargaining determines government decisions. Since each generation is selfish, no generation will voluntarily absorb the debts of another except as {{a quid pro quo}} for receiving particular goods or services. Hence, redistribution per se between generations will not arise. Because each generation is ultimately responsible for its <b>own</b> <b>liabilities,</b> deficit finance, while altering the timing of tax receipts, has no economic impact. ...|$|E

We investigate their behaviour in CHAPS, the United Kingdom’s large-value payment system. Our estimates suggest that in normal times, banks increase their payment outflows when their liquidity is above target and immediately following the receipt of payments. We use these estimates to determine the robustness of this payment system to two hypothetical behavioural changes. In the first, a single bank stops sending payments, perhaps because of an operational problem. In the second, it pays out exactly what it previously received, relying exclusively on the liquidity provided by other system members. Using the observed uncertainty around our estimated behavioural equations, we derive probabilistic statements about the time at which the bank’s counterparties would run out of liquidity if they followed their estimated normal-time behaviour.

40|$|Most {{textbook}} models {{explain the}} operation of monetary policy {{in terms of how}} the central bank influences the market rate of interest by managing the supply of its liabilities relative to the demand for them. Yet some central banks no longer operate that way and, instead, set an interest rate for their <b>own</b> <b>liabilities.</b> This raises the question of how under that modus of operation the central bank's rate is transmitted to the financial markets. Another question concerns whether advances in information technology may erode the demand for central bank money and hence threaten the ability of central banks to implement monetary policy. There are, however, some simple answers to these conundrums. In an open and efficient inancial system, the central bank can determine the market rate of interest by standing in the market at its own rate, and rely on interest rate arbitrage to transmit that rate to the market. It follows that even if advances in information technology result in a diminished use of, and thus reduced demand for, a stock of central bank money, that need not undermine a central bank's capacity to implement monetary policy. ...|$|E

40|$|Throughout the 1990 s, China’s {{stock market}} was {{developed}} {{as a tool of}} industrial policy. It was used to supply capital to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that remained controlled by the state and whose performance usually declined after listing. Secondary market trading was poorly regulated, again partly for political reasons. As a result, the market has become infamous for extreme volatility, price manipulation and grossly unreliable accounting. This is a problem for the government since the stock market is ill-equipped to support the government’s other increasingly important economic priorities. The government now needs to improve the efficiency of industry in order to sustain employment creation, to raise capital to finance its <b>own</b> <b>liabilities</b> and to put into place a modern pension system. As a result, China’s stock market is being slowly reformed. Listed companies are quietly being allowed to privatise. The regulatory framework has been rationalised. The empowered China Securities Regulatory Commission is pushing forward with a range of policies aimed at improving corporate governance. Shareholders have been allowed to pursue civil compensation claims against firms in the courts. Financial intermediaries are being privatised, the fund sector is being rapidly expanded and foreign investors are gradually being allowed in. These changes, although deeply unpopular among some important groups, will mature the market over the next decade. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The International Accounting Standards Board and the Financial Accounting Standards Board allow {{fair value}} {{measurement}} of liabilities. Previous {{findings from the}} literature on recognition versus disclosure indicate that recognition of fair value information better serves investors' needs, {{because it is more}} likely to facilitate the incorporation of the information into their judgment. In cases of credit risk changes for <b>own</b> <b>liabilities,</b> however, many authors doubt that fair value measurement is beneficial due to its potential counter-intuitiveness. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to gain insight into non-professional investors' processing of fair value information for liabilities. Design/methodology/approach – A between-subjects laboratory experiment was employed. Subjects received financial information on three different companies. The authors manipulated the accounting treatment of liabilities between the three groups. Subjects ranked three companies according to their economic performance. The authors then compared these rankings to the companies' actual performance. Findings – The results of the experiment indicate that non-professional investors are less likely to acquire the information of credit risk changes when liabilities are not measured at fair value. Additionally, evidence was found that fair value measurement is to some extent counter-intuitive for non-professional investors. Research limitations/implications – A main limitation is that our experiment concentrates on liabilities and abstracts from interactions of both sides of the balance sheet. Originality/value – This is the first study to analyze in detail non-professional investors' information processing of liabilities measured at fair value.

40|$|Monetary {{policy is}} one of the two {{principal}} means (the other being fiscal policy) by which government authorities in a market economy regularly influence the pace and direction of overall economic activity, importantly including not only the level of aggregate output and employment but also the general rate at which prices rise or fall. The ability of central banks to carry out monetary policy stems from their monopoly position as suppliers of their <b>own</b> <b>liabilities,</b> which banks in turn need (either as legally required reserves or as balances for settling interbank claims) in order to create the money and credit used in everyday economic transactions. Important developments both in research and in the actual conduct of monetary policy in recent decades have revolved around the choice of a short-term interest rate versus a reserve quantity as the central bank's direct operating instrument, whether to use some measure of money as an intermediate target, whether to constrain the central bank to follow some fairly simple policy rule, what degree of political independence a central bank should have, and whether to target inflation. Some key areas of ongoing research in this area, as of the beginning of the 21 st century, are whether the behavioral process by which monetary policy affects nonfinancial economic activity centers more on money or on credit, quantitative measurement of whatever is the mechanism at work, the trade-off between price inflation and real aspects of economic activity like output and employment, and just why it is that the public in most industrialized countries is as averse to inflation as is apparently the case. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} parity {{conditions}} between assets denominated in different currencies, traded in a wellintegrated {{segment of the}} international capital market, and derives the consequences for the exchange rate expectations. The main objective is to assess the uncovered asset return parity for the Czech koruna exchange rate. I argue that any reasonable decision-theoretical foundation of the uncovered parity condition should be formulated in terms of secondary market yields on long-term instruments and not the short-term money market rates. Specifically, the international version of the Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model (CCAPM) is the universal (and, in fact, the single) message of any stochastic general equilibrium model of an open economy. Accordingly, I replace the traditional uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) by the uncovered total return parity condition. The theoretical {{arguments in favor of}} the uncovered asset return parity are matched by a number of examples, of which the main group is formed by long-maturity government bonds. Data are examined for the Czech versus German 5 year government bonds, the CZK 10 year bonds of the European Investment Bank vs. German government 10 year bonds, {{as well as for the}} Austrian versus US-Treasury 10 year bonds. In both cases, parity seems to verify, although the time horizons and the measures of exchange rate movements, for which it becomes visible, are different. The proposed microfoundation of the uncovered asset return parity uses a model of consumption and investment in an open economy under diffusion uncertainty with soft liquidity constraints. The model is solved by means of the stochastic maximum principle including the adjoint equations for the costate variables. The general equilibrium of portfolio optimizing investors is used to derive a breakdown of the country risk premium present in the uncovered asset return parity relation between a selected pair of fmancial instruments. This allows one to analyze the prevailing beliefs about the long-term exchange rate path. An extension of the basic consumption and investment model to the context of a productive firm issuing its <b>own</b> <b>liabilities</b> to cover liquidity needs, leads to an analogous uncovered yield parity result. I show that the uncovered return parity from the producer perspective is the same as from the consumer and investor perspective. This opens a way for the exchange rate expectation-extraction by means of corporate bonds and other company-specific instruments. In addition, the disparity of returns in international equity markets possesses a certain explanatory power as regards expected competitiveness of domestic and foreign industries. uncovered parity, asset prices, portfolio optimization, international CCAPM...|$|E
