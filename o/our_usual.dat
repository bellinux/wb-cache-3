'You must know, I'm in love with her,' he added resolutely." ...|$|E

It was more about human emotions, drama, relationships".|$|E
500|$|In 1898, Shackleton joined Union-Castle Line, {{the regular}} mail and {{passenger}} carrier between Southampton and Cape Town. He was, as a shipmate recorded, [...] "a departure from <b>our</b> <b>usual</b> type of young officer", content {{with his own}} company though not aloof, [...] "spouting lines from Keats [...] Browning", a mixture of sensitivity and aggression but, withal, sympathetic. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Boer War in 1899, Shackleton transferred to the troopship Tintagel Castle where, in March 1900, he met an army lieutenant, Cedric Longstaff, whose father Llewellyn W. Longstaff was the main financial backer of the National Antarctic Expedition then being organised in London. Shackleton used his acquaintance with the son to obtain an interview with Longstaff senior, with a view to obtaining a place on the expedition. Longstaff, impressed by Shackleton's keenness, recommended him to Sir Clements Markham, the expedition's overlord, making it clear that he wanted Shackleton accepted. On 17 February 1901, his appointment as third officer to the expedition's ship Discovery was confirmed; on 4 June he was commissioned into the Royal Navy, with the rank of sub-lieutenant in the Reserves. [...] Although officially on leave from Union-Castle, this was in fact the end of Shackleton's Merchant Navy service.|$|E

500|$|With {{his next}} album, the new decade found Morrison {{following}} his muse into uncharted territory and sometimes merciless reviews. In February 1980, Morrison {{and a group}} of musicians travelled to Super Bear, a studio in the French Alps, to record (on the site of a former abbey) what is considered to be the most controversial album in his discography; later [...] "Morrison admitted his original concept was even more esoteric than the final product." [...] The album, Common One, consisted of six songs; the longest, [...] "Summertime in England", lasted fifteen and one-half minutes and ended with the words,"Can you feel the silence?". NME magazine's Paul Du Noyer called the album [...] "colossally smug and cosmically dull; an interminable, vacuous and drearily egotistical stab at spirituality: Into the muzak." [...] Greil Marcus, whose previous writings had been favourably inclined towards Morrison, critically remarked: [...] "It's Van acting the part of the 'mystic poet' he thinks he's supposed to be." [...] Morrison insisted the album was never [...] "meant to be a commercial album." [...] Biographer Clinton Heylin concludes: [...] "He would not attempt anything so ambitious again. Henceforth every radical idea would be tempered by some notion of commerciality." [...] Later, critics reassessed the album more favourably with the success of [...] "Summertime in England". Lester Bangs wrote in 1982, [...] "Van was making holy music even though he thought he was, and us rock critics had made <b>our</b> <b>usual</b> mistake of paying too much attention to the lyrics." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{his first}} film was released, Buñuel {{became the first}} filmmaker to be officially welcomed {{into the ranks of}} the Surrealists by the movement's leader André Breton, an event {{recalled}} by film historian Georges Sadoul: [...] "Breton had convoked the creators to <b>our</b> <b>usual</b> venue ... one summer's evening. Dalí had the large eyes, grace, and timidity of a gazelle. [...] To us, Buñuel, big and athletic, his black eyes protruding a little, seemed exactly like he always is in Un Chien Andalou, meticulously honing the razor that will slice the open eye in two." [...] After he joined the Communist Party in Spain, however, it was quickly made clear to him that he could not be both a Communist and a Surrealist; his artistic collaborator Pierre Unik recounted in a letter of 30 January 1932 that [...] "a comrade from Agit-Prop" [...] called Buñuel and others together to tell them that, [...] "Surrealism was a movement of bourgeois degeneration", continuing, [...] "What will the rank-and-file comrades say the day I have to announce to them, 'Comrades, I no longer have the right to militate amongst you...because I'm a degenerate bourgeois?'" [...] In consequence, on 6 May 1932, Buñuel wrote a letter to André Breton renouncing his membership in the Surrealist group: [...] "Given the current state of things there could be no question for a Communist of doubting for an instant between the choice of his party and any other sort of activity or discipline". He {{even went so far as}} to try to re-issue a drastically cut version of L'Age d'Or (over two-thirds of the original were eliminated) in response to complaints that the full 60-minute original was formally too difficult for the proletariat. Nonetheless, he retained a lifelong affinity with the Surrealist movement and longstanding friendships with many of the most prominent Surrealists.|$|E
