In a project to help meet those objectives, each student, with the assistance of a “resource person” from the food industry, completes the project as {{if he or she is}} responsible for the quality assurance analyses of a specific food product in a food company. The student identifies the chemical, physical, sensory, and microbial analyses for raw ingredients, in-process products, and the finished product. The project requires the student to participate in related class discussion, prepare a final written report, and make a brief class presentation. Analysis of survey data showed the project was more than moderately relevant or useful to former students working in the food industry, and related directly to the initial <b>or</b> <b>current</b> <b>positions</b> of most former students...|$|R

An association between accumulated experience of manual working class and self-rated health is found. Also, when controlling for accumulated class experience, the social gradient for current class is no longer significant. Furthermore, even for non-manual employees the odds of reporting less than good self-rated health is increasing with each added year of previous manual experience. This suggests that the social gradient in health is more complex than just a matter of <b>current</b> social <b>position</b> influencing <b>current</b> health, and that the effects would potentially be modified if the full complexity of life-time social positions were taken into account...|$|R

The time of plain non-sensorial smart phones {{is more or less}} over, and we are facing the future environment where built-in sensors as ambient temperature, magnetic field, accelerometer, gravity, light, humidity, and others are common equipment of current mobile devices [1, 2]. All of these sensors are supportive to the provided inner content. For instance, the user interface has been enhanced using gyroscope, and therefore, the visualization can be controlled by rotation <b>or</b> <b>current</b> <b>position</b> of a device [3]. However, we might also start seeing sensors as receptors of global human body where, if we gather more sensorial data, we are being transformed into a smarter and more enhanced society. We recognized the most significant influence of sensors in computing estimation capability of surrounding environment and user behavior recognition where identification of human stereotypes is leading to the increase of productivity in terms of association corresponding processes with partial or full automation. Today’s low-cost sensorial technologies’ doors are opening up for daily life improvements and are shorting distances between content from producer and to consumer. Typically, the content could be served depending on <b>current</b> environment <b>or</b> user’s behavior. For instance, the user is located at a home environment, and therefore, the applications associated with the mobile device, such as home controlling or leisure, have higher priority. Under specific circumstances, we assume that the applications and content are so predictable that we could talk about Artificial User Interface as an improvement of device usability. Devices could offer predefined or the most preferred content launched automatically or initiate routines in specific circumstances.|$|R

To date, the AI technologies developed in areas like speech recognition, natural language processing, student modelling and intelligent tutoring have not been applied to {{the specific needs of}} children with ASD. In this paper we describe the design of Simone Says, a proposed software environment in which young children can practice semantically and socially meaningful language by playing a sort of interactive, linguistic game of Simon Says. Current research and practice in remediation both stress the need for achieving engagement and sustaining motivation in taking appropriate conversational turns and using language in functionally appropriate ways. Simone Says is intended to meet these requirements by using the natural attraction of computers to create opportunities for meaningful, speech-based language practice in a highly simplified social setting. In exercises that progress from vocabulary building to simple social conversation, the system will automatically generate contexts in which the student is rewarded for meaningful responses as defined by his <b>or</b> her <b>current</b> <b>position</b> along the normal developmental progression...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Human malaria {{infection}} {{remains a}} problem of public health importance in many regions of the world. The infection continues to spread particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In Nigeria, malaria and its treatment {{have been affected by}} factors like wrong diagnosis, wrong attitude of the people, unavailability of drugs, fake and substandard drugs, attitude and practices of medical and paramedical personnel. Nigeria’s national standard for malaria treatment was recently changed to artemisinin combination therapy. Methods: A descriptive study using a structured questionnaire was administered to all doctors (123) practicing in the three Army hospitals in Lagos. The study was done between March, 2009 and April, 2009. The findings were precoded; data entry and analysis was done using EPI INFO version 3. 5. 1 statistical software. Results: Presumptive/clinical diagnosis was still a common practice for diagnosing malaria among doctors, as well as the use of microscopy. None of the doctors had the facility for diagnosing malaria with rapid diagnostic test in their hospitals. Fifty one percent of the doctors stated that they utilized the current National antimalarial treatment guidelines. Significant proportion of the doctors used Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACTs) as first line treatment of uncomplicated malaria in adults and children. Chloroquine was the commonest drug for first line treatment of uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy. Only 45. 5 % of the doctors had correct knowledge of Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), while 33. 3 % knew the stage of pregnancy in which a pregnant woman should receive IPTp with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. Awareness and the content of knowledge of the current National antimalarial treatment guideline were not affected by the category <b>or</b> <b>current</b> <b>position</b> of the doctors. Thirteen percent of the respondents had attended training/update workshop organized by the Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) Roll Back Malaria programme on the current National antimalarial treatment guideline. Conclusion: The study showed that there is need to improve use of recommended antimalarial medicines for all categories of patients by doctors in Army Hospitals in Lagos. More effort should be made by the Federal Ministry of Health and other stakeholders to organize training and refresher courses on the current National antimalarial treatment guidelines for all categories of health care providers...|$|R

Additionally, we use rules to implement complex decision trees. We compare our solution to an implementation using OWL-DL, the Pellet reasoner, and SPARQL queries.

The aim of the work is to review a housing situation of Czech households, with the emphasis on the age of the head of household, from several complementary perspectives. Housing conditions of young households are described by the concept of the financial and physical affordability of housing on the basis of objective data about their income situation and the cost and quality of housing. Therefore, we can identify households that have limited access to adequate housing e. g. because of their social background <b>or</b> <b>current</b> social <b>position</b> in the society. The paper also examines the subjective opinions of respondents on the quality and the financial burden of housing. To achieve these objectives, data from the Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) of the Czech Statistical Office are analyzed for the years 2005 - 2011. The analysis also contains the regional perspective, which is used to compare the housing affordability for households living in the different areas of the Czech Republic. Also for this reason results of the thesis could be useful as a basis for housing policy makers. Keywords: young households, housing affordability, housing [...] ...|$|R
