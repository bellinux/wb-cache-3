5|$|After wasting their {{ammunition}} in {{this preliminary}} action, the Mahdist force began a flanking maneuver against the Belgians. The Mahdists' right flank, situated {{along the river}} parallel to the Nile, advanced rapidly trying to pin Chaltin {{with his back to}} the river. Chaltin, who by this time had advanced within two hundred meters of the Mahdists and begun a more effective barrage of his own, replied to the threat by ordering the sudden advance of his reserve companies. The move checked the advancing Mahdists, avoiding the unfavorable position and causing the rebels to falter. Sensing that victory was near, Chaltin ordered the Azande to charge the Mahdists to separate the advanced right wing from the rest of the line. The charge was successful, and the now considerably damaged Mahdist flanking force was completely cut off and surrounded by Free State soldiers. Chaltin's main companies then attacked, pressing the Mahdist defenses as they forced their way into the hills. Three <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> attacked the well-defended path through the hills, while two others charged the hilltops. After a fierce contest for the heights, the demoralized and weakened Mahdist line broke and its remaining defenders fled to the north towards Rejaf, leaving ammunition and weapons. The action was finished by eight-thirty that morning.|$|E
