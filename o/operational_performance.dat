5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Boeing 747, McDonnell Douglas DC-10, and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar {{became the first}} {{generation}} of wide-body passenger airliners to enter service. In 1978, Boeing unveiled three new models: the twin-engine Boeing 757 to replace its 727, the twin-engine 767 to challenge the Airbus A300, and a trijet 777 concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011. The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s' extended-range twin-engine <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> standards (ETOPS) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations. These regulations allowed twin-engine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours' distance from emergency diversionary airports. Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners. The trijet 777 was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants. Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the 767-300ER and the 747-400.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1980s, the 767 {{spearheaded the}} growth of twinjet flights across the {{northern}} Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine <b>operational</b> <b>performance</b> standards (ETOPS) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines. Before the 767, overwater flight paths of twinjets could {{be no more than}} 90 minutes away from diversion airports. In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines. The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.|$|E

40|$|Several {{operations}} {{decisions are}} based {{on some kind of}} forecast of future demand. For this reason, manufacturing companies pay significant attention towards this process and research has devoted attention to this issue. This paper investigates the impact of how forecasting is conducted on accuracy and <b>operational</b> <b>performances.</b> Attention is here paid on three elements that characterize the forecasting process: whether structured techniques are adopted, whether detailed information is used, {{and the extent to which}} forecasting is used in decision making processes. Analyses are conducted by means of data provided by the fourth edition of the Global Manufacturing Research Group questionnaire. Data has been collect from 343 companies belonging to several manufacturing industries from 6 different countries. Empirical analysis shows that the relationship between how forecasting is conducted and <b>operational</b> <b>performances</b> is not fully explained only by taking into consideration forecast accuracy. Results show that companies adopting a structured forecasting process have positive impacts on <b>operational</b> <b>performances</b> (here manufacturing cost and delivery are considered) not only through improved accuracy.

25|$|A {{perennial}} {{problem for}} the French Navy was the strategic priorities of France, which were first and foremost tied to its European ambitions. This reality meant that the army was often treated better than the navy, and as a result, the latter suffered in training and <b>operational</b> <b>performance.</b> The 18th century saw {{the beginning of the}} Royal Navy's domination, which managed to inflict a number of significant defeats on the French. However, in a very impressive effort, a French fleet under de Grasse managed to defeat a British fleet at the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781, ensuring that the Franco-American ground forces would win the ongoing Siege of Yorktown. Beyond that, and Suffren's impressive campaigns against the British in India, there was not much more good news. The French Revolution all but crippled the French Navy, and efforts to make it into a powerful force under Napoleon were dashed at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, where the British all but annihilated a combined Franco-Spanish fleet.
