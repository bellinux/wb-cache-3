5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates {{for males and females}} over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which could be explained by the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse. However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that <b>older</b> <b>people</b> who self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 <b>older</b> <b>people</b> who self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.|$|E

40|$|Using data {{obtained}} from an investigation, the article points to the difficult position of <b>old</b> <b>people’s</b> agricultural households in comparison to agricultural households with members fit for active work. In general, <b>old</b> <b>people</b> 2 ̆ 7 s households possess small farms. Due to inadequate mechanical- equipment and lack of labour <b>old</b> <b>people’s</b> households also achieve lower yields per hectare, {{as can be seen}} from »natural effect of the cultivation of one hectare of arable land«. For the same reason, <b>old</b> <b>people’s</b> households, although possessing small farms, often lease their land or use hired labour and equipment. The article also deals with the pattern of spending both of <b>old</b> <b>people’s</b> and of agricultural households: generally, <b>old</b> <b>people’s</b> households appear to spend twice less and to have a less favourable structure of expenses, because they spend a comparatively larger proportion of their money on maintaining production while investing 7. 5 times less money in development and modernization than do agricultural households which have enough man-power available. In recent years a large number of <b>old</b> <b>people’s</b> households have sold their land and thus ensured a livelihood for themselves...|$|R

40|$|Old age is {{a natural}} course of life. Permanent {{prolongation}} of the life in the old age also prolongs the period when the <b>old</b> <b>people</b> need help and care. One of the possibilities of {{the care of the}} <b>old</b> <b>people</b> is the development of the field and outpatient social services. The scope of the assistance and support provided by means of the social services demands the <b>old</b> <b>people</b> codetermination, and it has to hold their human dignity. The assistance has to result from the individually defined needs of the <b>old</b> <b>people,</b> it has to bring an active impact on them and encourage their individuality. The Social Services Act modifies the conditions of awarding the care allowance not only to <b>old</b> <b>people</b> but to all those who, in view of the health condition, need the assistance of another individual to cope with everyday routines in care of their own body. The development of the field social services allows the <b>old</b> <b>people</b> to persist in their natural environment as long as possible and, simultaneously, it helps in care the relatives of the old person. Presently, within the region around Třebíč there are four basic providers of the field social services altogether. The main aim of this Thesis is to determine whether there is a combination of the professional and non professional care, to map which are the most favoured services within the region around Třebíč, and to compare the possibility of utilization of services of the social services providers in <b>old</b> <b>people</b> in municipalities up to 3, 000 inhabitants and <b>old</b> <b>people</b> in the town of Třebíč. These aims make up the base for the following hypotheses: I. <b>Old</b> <b>people</b> prefer the assistance of their families to the field services II. <b>Old</b> <b>people</b> in the town of Třebíč utilize the assistance of the registered social services providers more than the <b>old</b> <b>people</b> in municipalities up to 3, 000 inhabitants The results of this Bachelor Thesis will be available to the social services providers, if appropriate, to improve the supply of the social services in the region around Třebíč...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigatedthe {{implications}} of socio-economic transformation for social protection among the <b>old</b> <b>people</b> in Tanzania. It argues that <b>old</b> <b>people</b> had been neglected {{in terms of}} social and income security despite the National Ageing Policy (2003) as well as the National Social Security Policy (2003) stipulating that every citizen has the right to be protected against social and economic distress. Methodological triangulation was used to collect information, in particular the study used the survey interviews, focus group discussions, in-depth interviews and documentary reviews. The results show that respondents offered different explanations on the existing values and norms that guide the provision of social protection among <b>old</b> <b>people</b> within the study area. It was further evident that, the changes in the value system had affected social protection provision among <b>old</b> <b>people</b> within the study area. Among the effects are insecure, disrespected, isolated and poor living conditions. The study has established that the existing policies that related to catering and providing for <b>old</b> <b>people</b> remained largely unknown to the majority of the respondents interviewed neither were they aware of their entitlements and rights stipulated by these policies. This study further, contextualizes the influence of economic transformation on the social protection of the <b>old</b> <b>people,</b> whose effects include loss of income, working even in old age, increased vulnerability, poverty among <b>old</b> <b>people</b> and a sense of abandonment. Thus, the study concludes that comprehensive social policy for the <b>old</b> <b>people</b> is of crucial importance to engender the sustainability of their livelihood in contemporary society. ...|$|R
