5|$|AFL teams won {{the next}} two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues merged {{to form a new}} 26-team league. The {{resulting}} newly expanded NFL eventually incorporated some of the innovations that led to the AFL's success, such as including names on player's jerseys, official scoreboard clocks, national television contracts (the addition of Monday Night Football gave the NFL broadcast rights <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Big Three television networks), and sharing of gate and broadcasting revenues between home and visiting teams.|$|E

With equipment imported from Norway, the initiative cost around $140,000 and lasted several months. The solar panels have helped to improve night-time visibility and enhance the city's overall aesthetic appeal.|$|E

5|$|During November1993, {{assembly}} of the first prototype commenced at two separate locations, these being Sikorsky's facility in Stratford, Connecticut and Boeing's manufacturing plant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; later <b>on,</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotorcraft's sub-assemblies were transferred to the former location where final assembly occurred. In the following year, the number of prototypes to be produced was reduced from four to two rotorcraft. On 25May1995, the first Comanche prototype was formally rolled out at Sikorsky's production facility, after which it was transferred to West Palm Beach, Florida to commence flight testing activities. On 4January1996, the prototype, flown by test pilots Bob Gradle and Rus Stiles, performed its 39-minute maiden flight. The first flight had been originally planned to take place during August 1995, but had been delayed {{by a number of}} structural and software problems that had been encountered. On 30 March 1999, the second prototype conducted its first flight, before joining the flight test program shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the {{reporter}} summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E

Ross, set to retire after the 2016 season, had been Heyward's teammate during his first three seasons in Atlanta, and Heyward considered him a key mentor in his early MLB career. In an interview with the Bleacher Report website, Heyward said,I know how special it is to have teammates like he was my first three years in Atlanta. You don't take it for granted. I wanted to say thank you {{from the bottom of my}} heart, as a teammate and as a friend, for what he's done for me.|$|E

In 1885 he founded the International Chess Magazine in New York and edited it until 1891. In addition to game commentaries and blow-by-blow accounts of the negotiations leading to his 1886 match with Johann Zukertort and of the American Chess Congress' world championship project, he wrote {{a long series of}} articles about Paul Morphy, who had died in 1884.

5|$|Taylor Swift is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, {{released}} on October 24, 2006, by Big Machine Records. Swift was 16 {{years old at}} the time of the album's release and wrote its songs during her freshman year of high school. Swift has writing credits <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album's songs, including those co-written with Liz Rose. Swift experimented with several producers, ultimately choosing Nathan Chapman, who had produced her demo album. Musically, the album is country music styled, and lyrically it speaks of romantic relationships, a couple of which Swift wrote from observing relationships before being in one. Lyrics also touch on Swift's personal struggles in high school.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the Grand Canyon Diorama in 1958 prompted changes to the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped awnings <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cattle cars and gondolas. The walls on the cattle cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the diorama. That same year, a third gondola with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth gondola with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought {{the total number of}} freight cars in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Red, to eight. Prior to these modifications, the cattle cars and gondolas of this train set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand {{for the duration of the}} ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, had insisted that there be no seats on them; he wanted the passengers to feel like cattle on an actual cattle train.|$|E

5|$|The {{international}} community made repeated unsuccessful attempts {{to end the}} fighting. Both sides violated ceasefires, often within hours. Calls by some European Community members for the Western European Union to intervene militarily were vetoed by the United Kingdom. Instead, a Conference for Yugoslavia was established under the chairmanship of Lord Carrington {{to find a way}} to end the conflict. The United Nations (UN) imposed an arms embargo <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yugoslav republics in September 1991 under Security Council Resolution 713, but this was ineffective, in part because the JNA had no need to import weapons. The European powers abandoned attempts to keep Yugoslavia united and agreed to recognise the independence of Croatia and Slovenia on 15 January 1992.|$|E

5|$|What's Your Raashee? was {{produced}} by Ronnie Screwvala at UTV Motion Pictures in collaboration with Ashutosh Gowariker Productions, with Gowariker's wife, Sunita, serving as the producer. The film had its world premiere at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival on 19 September 2009, with more than 2,000 attendees at Roy Thomson Hall. The film was released on 25 September 2009. It had a good opening at the multiplexes but poor attendance elsewhere. Following criticism of the film's excessive length, in mid-week, three songs were cut from the film's theatrical prints to reduce {{the length of the}} film. However, the new length was still over three hours, and it was not confirmed if the length was reduced <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prints across India. During its run, it grossed 160 million at the box office and was considered as a financial failure. Two weeks after the theatrical release, What's Your Raashee? was released for pay-per-view viewing on various DTH platforms such as Tata Sky, Airtel Digital TV, and Dish TV. Distributed by UTV Home Entertainment, the film was released on DVD on 10 December 2009 across all regions, with no bonus content. VCD versions were released at the same time. Blu-ray versions were released in 2011.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, RodrÃ­guez was {{selected}} as the American League MVP. He set a new American League record for home runs in a single season among catchers with 35. RodrÃ­guez was also the first catcher to have more than 30home runs, 100 runs batted in, and 100 runs scored in the history of Major League Baseball. In addition, he holds the distinction of being the first catcher {{in the history of the}} league to amass more than 20home runs and 20stolen bases. From May 8, 1999 to June 1, 1999, RodrÃ­guez had a career high 20 game hitting streak. He had 25 stolen bases, which was fifth most among catchers in the history of the league. He led the league in times grounded into a double play, with 31. RodrÃ­guez was only the ninth catcher in the history of Major League Baseball to win the Most Valuable Player award, and he was the first to win it since Thurman Munson in 1976. He was named <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ballots, getting seven first place votes and six second place votes. RodrÃ­guez was the sixth Puerto Rican to win the award, and the fourth player from the Texas Rangers to win it. He also won the Silver Slugger Award for the sixth time in a row and {{was selected}} Most Valuable Player by Baseball Digest. He was again named to all-star teams by the Associated Press, The Sporting News, and Baseball America. While he was hitting home runs, he wasn't taking many walks. He is one of only six players active in 2009 who have had at least 30 home runs in a season in which they had more homers than walks (34 HR, 24 BB in 1999). The others are Alfonso Soriano (39â€“23 in 2002, 36â€“33 in 2005, 33â€“31 in 2007), Garret Anderson (35â€“24 in 2000), Ryan Braun (34â€“29 in 2007), Joe Crede (30â€“28 in 2006), and JosÃ© GuillÃ©n (31â€“24 in 2003).|$|E
