This study aims to: (1) examine the influence of P. <b>O.</b> <b>W.</b> E. R. learning on the effectiveness of students’ learning; and (2) analyze students' writing skills after applying the P. <b>O.</b> <b>W.</b> E. R strategy learning. It is a qualitative descriptive research where the primary data analyzed is the development of student writing before, during, and after the implementation of P. <b>O.</b> <b>W.</b> E. R. Learning. In addition, as secondary data, the analysis of questionnaires, interviews, and classroom observations were tabulated as supporting primary data. Participants selected by using Purposive Participant technique. A total of 80 regular students of the 2016 English Study Program at STKIP Siliwangi were involved. The results of the study showed an increase in students writing skill form before the implementation, during, and after the implementation of P. <b>O.</b> <b>W.</b> E. R. Learning.
