Fossett's first job out of business school was with IBM; he then served as a consultant for Deloitte and Touche, and later accepted a job with Marshall Field's. Fossett later said, [...] "For {{the first five years}} <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>business</b> career, I was distracted by being in computer systems, and then I became interested in financial markets.

500|$|The lyric [...] "Boy, you actin’ so corny like Fritos" [...] {{generated}} {{a positive response}} from both critics and fans alike, with MTV News reporting that fans were [...] "freaking" [...] over it. Wass described the inclusion of Fritos as [...] "hilarious", while Camp likened it {{to a form of}} product placement. Billboard highlighted the juxtaposition between the chorus, [...] "Close the door/Lose the key/Leave my heart on the mat for me/I was yours eternally/There's an end to infinity" [...] and one of the verses, [...] "Name hold weight like kilos/Boy you actin' so corny like Fritos/Wouldn't have none of that without me, though/Ain't none <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>business,</b> it's tea though/Outta ammo, gotta reload/If life was a game you're a free throw/It's nothing that you don't already know," [...] noting that the former is [...] "almost sweet" [...] compared to the latter.|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>business</b> if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1920 Pace {{amicably}} dissolved his long-standing {{partnership with}} Handy, {{with whom he}} also collaborated as lyricist. As Handy wrote, [...] "To add to my woes, my partner withdrew from the business. He disagreed with some <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>business</b> methods, but no harsh words were involved. He simply chose this time to sever connection with our firm in order that he might organize Pace Phonograph Company, issuing Black Swan Records and making a serious bid for the Negro market[...] [...] [...] With Pace went {{a large number of}} our employees[...] [...] [...] Still more confusion and anguish grew out of the fact that people did not generally know that I had no stake in the Black Swan Record Company." ...|$|E
2500|$|McAuliffe told The New York Times in 1999, [...] "I've met all <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>business</b> {{contacts}} through politics. It's all interrelated." [...] When {{he meets}} {{a new business}} contact, he continued, [...] "Then I raise money from them." [...] He acknowledged that success of his business dealings stemmed partly from his relationship with Bill Clinton, saying, [...] "No question, that's a piece of it." [...] He also credited his ties to former congressmen Dick Gephardt and Tony Coelho, his Rolodex of 5,000-plus names, {{and his ability to}} personally relate to people. In 2004, {{he was one of the}} five-member board of directors of the Clinton Foundation. He told New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich in 2012 that his Rolodex held 18,632 names.|$|E

2500|$|A {{business}} will most often {{have more than}} one asset account. An essential asset account in any business is the business's bank account (see: [...] "Accounts pertaining to the five accounting elements" [...] below for more examples) The same applies to liability accounts i.e. if I have borrowed money from two sources (called creditors or payables), then I must open two accounts to represent this present liability, called 'Creditor/Payable A' and 'Creditor/Payable B'. In this manner I may have multiple, different accounts. However all these accounts are all classified as one of the five types of accounts, therefore my entire business can be described in terms of its assets, expenses, liabilities, income and equity/capital (see extended accounting equation). This is the extent of [...] "my" [...] business in relation to accounts, regardless of the business' practices (the business may be a retail franchise, furniture shop, restaurant, etc.). With respect to my business, each of the five accounting elements will have a monetary value, and this can be used to assess the financial position <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>business</b> at any time (my success, failure, or any other attributes that I might need to know).|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to Gore's alleged conflict of interest, {{some critics have}} labeled Gore a [...] "carbon billionaire." [...] In response to these criticisms Gore stated that it is “certainly not true” {{that he is a}} “carbon billionaire” and that he is [...] "proud to put my money where my mouth is for the past 30 years. And though that is not the majority <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>business</b> activities, I absolutely believe in investing in accordance with my beliefs and my values." [...] Gore was challenged on this topic by Tennessee Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn who asked him: [...] "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something {{that you are going to}} personally benefit from?” Gore responded by stating: [...] "I believe that the transition to a green economy is good for our economy and good for all of us, and I have invested in it." [...] Gore also added that all earnings from his investments have gone to the Alliance for Climate Protection and that [...] "If you believe that the reason I have been working on this issue for 30 years is because of greed, you don’t know me." [...] Finally, Gore told Blackburn: [...] "Do you think there is something wrong with being active in business in this country [...] I am proud of it. I am proud of it." ...|$|E
