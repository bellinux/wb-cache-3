5|$|Moreover, any object {{traveling}} {{at a constant}} velocity must be subject to zero net force (resultant force). This is the definition <b>of</b> <b>dynamic</b> equilibrium: when all the forces on an object balance but it still moves at a constant velocity.|$|E
5|$|A simple case <b>of</b> <b>dynamic</b> {{equilibrium}} {{occurs in}} constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. This results in zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E

5|$|Improvements in {{structural}} alignment methods {{constitute an}} active area of research, and new or modified methods are often proposed that are claimed to offer advantages over the {{older and more}} widely distributed techniques. A recent example, TM-align, uses a novel method for weighting its distance matrix, to which standard dynamic programming is then applied. The weighting is proposed to accelerate the convergence <b>of</b> <b>dynamic</b> programming and correct for effects arising from alignment lengths. In a benchmarking study, TM-align {{has been reported to}} improve in both speed and accuracy over DALI and CE.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sequence}} alignment {{and protein}} structure alignment algorithms {{have been developed}} assuming linear data representations and as such {{are not able to}} detect circular permutations between proteins. Two examples of frequently used methods that have problems correctly aligning proteins related by circular permutation are dynamic programming and many hidden Markov models. As an alternative to these, a number of algorithms are built on top of non-linear approaches and are able to detect topology-independent similarities, or employ modifications allowing them to circumvent the limitations <b>of</b> <b>dynamic</b> programming. The table below is a collection of such methods.|$|E

At least one extrasolar planet, HD 189733 b, has been claimed to have such a weather system, similar to the Great Red Spot but twice as large.|$|E

40|$|As larger {{displays}} {{become more}} available {{their lack of}} adequate input techniques become apparent. In this paper we show the scalability <b>of</b> the <b>dynamic</b> size and speed cursor for large, high-resolution displays.

In our experiment we compared the three different implementations <b>of</b> the <b>dynamic</b> size and speed cursor to cursor warping and standard cursor settings. In the experiment we found gender bias for two different tasks (clicking and simple drag and drop), found that one <b>of</b> the <b>dynamic</b> size and speed cursor implementations generally outperformed cursor warping and the standard cursor setting, and explain how distance to and size of targets effected results. We conclude by suggesting the use <b>of</b> a <b>dynamic</b> size and speed cursor with large, high-resolution displays. Author Keywords input techniques, dynamic, large display...|$|R

5|$|The {{calculations}} that {{purported to}} show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating aerofoils. The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect <b>of</b> <b>dynamic</b> stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, four {{units of}} vacuum {{fluorescent}} displays (VFD) were {{mounted on the}} ceiling. Eight units <b>of</b> <b>dynamic</b> route maps were mounted above every door in each car in trainset 053/054 for a two-month trial. This new SMRT Active Route Map Information System (STARiS) was then progressively introduced to all C151 trainsets, and subsequently to C651 and C751B trains for a cost of S$12 million—S$20,000 per car. It became standard equipment on all new rolling stocks subsequently introduced on the East-West Line and North-South Line.|$|E
40|$|Based on Amartya Sen's {{capability}} approach, {{this study}} first built non probabilist theoretical framework of analysis <b>of</b> multidimensional <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> welfare taking {{the interactions between}} its different components into account. Then, it developed theoretical analyses based on this framework before to propose a method of empirical application of this model on a panel with two observations. Theoretical analyses <b>of</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> welfare – by step diagram method – point out the importance <b>of</b> such <b>dynamic</b> analysis. Indeed, from two instances, on the one hand, these analyses show {{that the combination of}} the structural policies which aim at to develop opportunities or to facilitate their access and the policies which aim at to increase households capabilities would rapidly lead to sensitive poverty reduction. On the other hand, these analyses point out that the efficiency of an anti-poverty policy depends on the nature <b>of</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> welfare. One anti-poverty policy which revealed itself effective in one locality can be ineffective in an other one, if the dynamics of welfare in both localities have not same nature. An implementation <b>of</b> this <b>dynamic</b> model on a panel with two observations enables to apprehend (i) multidimensional vulnerability of each household and the degree of this vulnerability, (ii) discriminating <b>of</b> welfare <b>dynamic</b> according to gender, social class, ethnic group, locality and so on, (iii) social factors – discrimination, social and legal norms and so on – which are constraints to a positive <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> welfare, (iv) importance of each component of potentialities into multidimensional <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> well-being. For a given population, the application <b>of</b> this <b>dynamic</b> model successively on different panels corresponding to different periods permits to apprehend the evolution (on time) of (i) difficulties or facilities of households or some specifics groups access to opportunities and (ii) social constraints which hang over <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> welfare. That allows to know if structural policies are making {{in the sense of a}} progressive insertion of poor. Thus, this framework can enable to apprehend <b>dynamic</b> <b>of</b> well-being of a population into several aspects. However, valuations of this method require high quality of database about relatively important number of households. In the contrary case, the robustness of results is not guaranteed.

5|$|Working {{memory is}} the ability of the brain to {{maintain}} a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in. This sort <b>of</b> <b>dynamic</b> memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies—groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use <b>of</b> <b>dynamic</b> brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors were themselves cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E
5|$|In C++ {{computer}} programming, allocators are {{an important}} component of the C++ Standard Library. The standard library provides several data structures, such as list and set, commonly referred to as containers. A common trait among these containers is their ability to change size during the execution of the program. To achieve this, some form <b>of</b> <b>dynamic</b> memory allocation is usually required. Allocators handle all the requests for allocation and deallocation of memory for a given container. The C++ Standard Library provides general-purpose allocators that are used by default, however, custom allocators may also be supplied by the programmer.|$|E

Additionally, SGDs are rarely covered by health insurance companies. As a result, resources are very limited with regards to both funding and staffing.
