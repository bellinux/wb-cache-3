5|$|The term {{pneumonia}} {{is sometimes}} more broadly applied to any condition resulting in inflammation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> (caused for example by autoimmune diseases, chemical burns or drug reactions); however, this inflammation is more accurately {{referred to as}} pneumonitis.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis may infect {{any part}} of the body, but most {{commonly}} occurs in the lungs (known as pulmonary tuberculosis). Extrapulmonary TB occurs when tuberculosis develops outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> although extrapulmonary TB may coexist with pulmonary TB.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E

40|$|A case of {{inflammatory}} pseudotumor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> occurring in a six-year-old boy is reported with clinicopathologic findings, including its ultrastructure. The patient had had frequent {{upper respiratory tract}} infections, and one and half year before <b>the</b> discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> mass, he suffered from pneumonia <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right <b>lung,</b> which was serologically {{proven to be a}} mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Exploratory thoracotomy revealed a large mediastinal mass that was removed together with the right middle and lower lobes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> <b>The</b> mass arose from <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> with an endobronchial element. Microscopically, the mass was composed of a variety of inflammatory and mesenchymal cells, including plasma cells, histiocytes, lymphocytes, and fibroblast-like spindle cells. Ultrastructurally, the spindle-shaped mesenchymal cells were either fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. At <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{inflammatory pseudotumor}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung,</b> <b>the</b> serum titer <b>of</b> antimycoplasma antibody rose again, and <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> parenchyma adjacent to the mass showed interstitial pneumonia with features <b>of</b> bronchiolitis obliterans. <b>The</b> present case suggests that <b>the</b> inflammatory pseudotumor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> could be a postinflammatory lesion associated with mycoplasma pneumoniae infection...|$|R
50|$|It innervates the {{bronchial}} {{tree and}} the visceral pleura. According to <b>the</b> relation <b>of</b> nerves to <b>the</b> root <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung,</b> <b>the</b> pulmonary plexus is divided into the anterior pulmonary plexus, which lies in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> and <b>the</b> posterior pulmonary plexus, which lies behind <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b>|$|R
5|$|Asthma is {{a common}} {{long-term}} inflammatory disease of the airways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur {{a few times a}} day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise.|$|E
5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from the hole in the airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs</b> is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
30|$|Due to {{the limited}} spatial {{resolution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SPECT system, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of about 1 to 1.5 cm, the reconstructed activity distribution around <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> will be blurred. Voxels involved in <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> edge will result in high CV values, which are not necessarily correlated to inhomogeneity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> activity distribution. Therefore, a one-voxel-wide layer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> was ‘peeled off’ from <b>the</b> periphery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> segmented <b>lung,</b> thereby creating a reduced lung volume with most of this edge effect excluded.|$|R

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: A new noninvasive {{practical}} {{technique called}} electrical impedance tomography (EIT) was examined for <b>the</b> measurement <b>of</b> alveolar recruitment. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: ICU {{of a general}} hospital. PATIENTS: Acute respiratory failure (ARF) patients. MEASUREMENTS: The ventilation-induced impedance changes (VICs) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nondependent and <b>the</b> dependent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> were determined by EIT {{as a measure of}} tidal volume distribution. By <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> an impedance ratio (IR), defined as <b>the</b> VIC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nondependent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> divided by <b>the</b> VIC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dependent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung,</b> <b>the</b> ventilation performances in both parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> were compared to each other. RESULTS: Between patients, <b>the</b> VIC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nondependent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> was significantly lower in the patients with a level of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of > 10 cm H 2 O than in patients with a PEEP of 10 cm H 2 O than in the group with PEEP between 0 and 5 cm H 2 O (1. 28 +/- 0. 58 vs 2. 99 +/- 1. 24, respectively; p < 0. 01). In individual patients, <b>the</b> VIC <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>lung</b> increased when <b>the</b> PEEP level was increased. <b>The</b> VICs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nondependent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dependent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> showed significant increases at a PEEP of 10 cm H 2 O compared to a PEEP of 0 cm H 2 O (p < 0. 05). Also the IR decreased in individual patients when the PEEP was increased; a significant decrease was found at 10 cm H 2 O compared to 0 cm H 2 O (1. 67 +/- 1. 24 vs 2. 23 +/- 1. 47, respectively; p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in IR indicates an increase in VIC in <b>the</b> dependent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> above <b>the</b> nondependent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> <b>The</b> increase in VIC can be regarded as an increase in lung volume, implying alveolar recruitment in <b>the</b> dependent part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> <b>The</b> same results also have been shown in earlier reports by CT scan. Since EIT is far more practical than CT scanning and also is a bedside method, EIT might help in <b>the</b> adjustment <b>of</b> ventilator settings in ARF patient...|$|R

5|$|Information {{from the}} {{peripheral}} chemoreceptors is relayed {{to a series}} of interconnected nuclei which comprise the respiratory centres in the medulla oblongata and the pons of the brainstem. This information determines the average rate of ventilation of the alveoli <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> to keep the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the arterial blood constant. The respiratory centre does so via motor neurons which activate the muscles of respiration (in particular the diaphragm).|$|E
50|$|In {{disorders}} {{that are}} intrinsic to <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> parenchyma, <b>the</b> underlying process is usually pulmonary fibrosis (scarring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung).</b> As <b>the</b> disease progresses, <b>the</b> normal <b>lung</b> tissue is gradually replaced by scar tissue interspersed with pockets of air.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{morphology}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rat <b>lung</b> was {{studied by}} light microscopy in different situations: after surgical and pharmacological castration and after administration <b>of</b> testosterone to <b>the</b> castrated rat {{to determine if}} the androgen is required to maintain <b>the</b> normal morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> We also determined <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> flutamide on <b>the</b> phospholipid composition <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> surfactant and microsomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> Rats were separated into five groups: I - control non-castrated rats, II - castrated rats sacrificed 21 days after castration, III - castrated rats that received testosterone daily from day 2 to day 21 after castration, IV - castrated rats that received testosterone from day 15 to day 21 after castration, and V - control rats injected with flutamide for 7 days. <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> different phospholipids in the surfactant and microsomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> was measured in group I and V rats. At the light microscopy level, the surgical and pharmacological castration provoked alterations in <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung,</b> similar to that observed in human <b>lung</b> emphysema. <b>The</b> compositions <b>of</b> surfactant and microsomes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> were similar to those previously reported by us for the surgically castrated rats.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> represents 30 % of all non-small cell lung carcinomas. It arises from dysplasia of squamous epithelium <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bronchi and is {{strongly associated with}} cigarette smoking. Squamous {{cell carcinoma}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> is known to produce metastases in the brain parenchyma. Case presentation We present <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> an 80 -year-old indigenous Australian man with an unusual presentation of metastatic carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung.</b> <b>The</b> case demonstrated a squamous cell carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> with an intracranial metastatic lesion destroying the parietal bone and extending into the extracranial soft tissue. A visible deformity as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metastasis was evident on physical examination and computed tomography demonstrated extensive bone destruction. Conclusion The authors were {{unable to find a}} case of this occurring from a squamous cell carcinoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lung</b> anywhere in <b>the</b> world literature.

5|$|Many early {{suggestions}} {{focused on}} adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, following {{the hypothesis that}} hadrosaurids were amphibious, a common line of thought until the 1960s.

Sternberg that it served as an airtrap to keep water out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> and Ned Colbert that it served as an air reservoir for prolonged stays underwater.|$|E
5|$|Once in space, sudden {{exposure}} of unprotected humans to very low pressure, such as during a rapid decompression, can cause pulmonary barotrauma—a rupture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs,</b> {{due to the}} large pressure differential between {{inside and outside the}} chest. Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture. Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to hypoxia.|$|E
5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both common (as frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach, from where it cannot be taken up by the circulatory system, instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b> If this situation is not immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.|$|E

5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and buccal pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air in and out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lungs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{noble gases}} have direct {{application}} in medicine. Helium is sometimes {{used to improve}} the ease of breathing of asthma sufferers.
