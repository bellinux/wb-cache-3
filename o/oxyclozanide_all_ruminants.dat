40|$|Abstract Background Specialised leaf-eating {{is almost}} universally {{regarded}} as the ancestral state of <b>all</b> <b>ruminants,</b> yet little evidence can be cited {{in support of this}} assumption, apart from the fact that <b>all</b> early <b>ruminants</b> had low crowned cheek teeth.

Results Here we report the results of two independent palaeodietary reconstructions for one of the earliest deer, Procervulus ginsburgi from the Early Miocene of Spain, suggesting that despite having lower tooth crowns than any living ruminant, this species included a significant proportion of grass in its diet. Conclusion The phylogenetic distribution of feeding styles strongly supports that leaf-grass mixed feeding was the original feeding style of deer, and that later dietary specialization on leaves or grass occurred independently in several lineages. Evidence for other ruminant clades suggests that facultative mixed feeding may in fact have been the primitive dietary state of the Ruminantia, which would have been morphologically expressed only under specific environmental factors. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an {{icosahedral}} non-enveloped virus {{within the}} genus Orbivirus of Reoviridae and exists as 24 distinct serotypes. BTV can infect <b>all</b> <b>ruminant</b> species and causes severe sickness in sheep. Recently, {{it was reported}} that BTV can infect some human cancer cells selectively. Because of the important oncolysis of this virus, we developed a novel purifying method for large-scale production. The purifying logic is simple, which is picking out all the components unwanted and the left is what we want. The process can be summarized in 4 steps: centrifugation, pulling down cell debrises and soluble proteins by co-immunoprecipitation with agarose Protein A, dialysis and filtration sterilization after concentration. Results The result of transmission electron microscope (TEM) observation showed that the sample of purified virus has a very clear background and the virions still kept intact. The result of 50 % tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50) assay showed that the bioactivity of purified virus is relatively high. Conclusions This method can purify BTV- 10 with high quality and high biological activity on large-scale production. It also can be used for purifying other BTV serotypes. </p...|$|R

The NADPH-d staining showed that the innervations of the tunica muscularis of the reticular groove lip were composed of nerve corpuscles, nerve fibres and nerve cells of the mucosa epithelium.

It is interesting to note that the same morphologies were observed in samples of the mucosa epithelium, and of the tunica muscularis processed by NADPH-d and in those processed by immunogold techniques. This study has demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the rumination activity and that it plays a double role in this activity in the reticular groove of <b>all</b> domestic <b>ruminants</b> studied: (1) NO plays a role similar to the one it has in the mucosa epithelium of all the other compartments of the ruminant forestomach, (2) The lip sections of the reticular groove has shown abundant innervations that may indirectly coordinate and control the forestomach motility through the direct activation of the nitrergic (nitroxidergic) nerve cells and nerve fibres...|$|R

Significant sequence variation in TLR 5 exists between animal species but {{its impact on}} activity is less well understood. Building on our previous research that bovine TLR 5 (bTLR 5) is functional, we compared human and bovine TLR 5 activity and signalling in cognate cell lines. bTLR 5 induced higher levels of CXCL 8 when expressed in bovine cells and reciprocal results were found for human TLR 5 (hTLR 5) in human cells, indicative of host cell specificity in this response. Analysis of Toll/interleukin- 1 receptor (TIR) sequences indicated that these differential responses involve cognate MyD 88 recognition. siRNA knockdowns and inhibitor experiments demonstrated {{that there are some}} host differences in signalling.

Maximal sequence identity to any BTV ranged from 63 % (segment 2) to 79 % (segments 7 and 10).

Our objectives are to estimate the frequency of ruminant brucellosis and to describe its spatial distribution in Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, Nile Delta, Egypt. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a cross-sectional study in which 791 sheep, 383 goats, 188 cattle milk tanks and 173 buffalo milk tanks were randomly selected in 40 villages and tested for the presence of antibodies against Brucella spp. The seroprevalence among different species was estimated and visualized using choropleth maps.

By cloning expressed genes from ovine and bovine placental cDNA libraries, by Southern genomic blotting, by screening genomic libraries, and by using PCR to amplify portions of PAG genes from genomic DNA, we estimate that cattle, sheep, and most probably <b>all</b> <b>ruminant</b> Artiodactyla possess many, possibly 100 or more, PAG genes, {{many of which are}} placentally expressed. The PAGs are highly diverse in sequence, with regions of hypervariability confined largely to surface-exposed loops.

Construction of distance phylograms, based on comparisons of PAG and related aspartic proteinase amino acid sequences, suggests that much diversification of the PAG genes occurred after the divergence of the Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla, but that at least one gene is represented outside the hooved species. The results also suggest that positive selection of duplicated genes has acted to provide considerable functional diversity among the PAGs, whose presence at the interface between the placenta and endometrium and in the maternal circulation indicates involvement in fetal–maternal interactions...|$|R

40|$|G duodenalis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common parasites found in ruminants. Most if not <b>all</b> <b>ruminants</b> become {{infected}} with G duodenalis at some point in their first few months of life. Giardiasis is chronic in ruminants, and, although it does not result in severe clinical signs, it does cause intestinal pathologic conditions that may result in malabsorption. Thus, giardiasis may be a production-limiting disease of ruminants. Studies employing molecular techniques demonstrate that the vast majority of ruminants are infected by a livestock-specific genotype of G duodenalis. Hence, although ruminants may serve as a potential reservoir for giardiasis in humans, they pose much less of a risk than was previously thought. C parvum remains an important cause of diarrhea in neonatal ruminants. Still, no treatment exists for cryptosporidiosis in North America. Recent research indicates that the parasite is much more common and important in dairy calves than in beef calves, and only young ruminants, generally less than 1 month of age, are infected with C parvum. Thus the zoonotic risk associated with C parvum infections in ruminants is limited to young animals and is easily managed. Less understood than intestinal cryptosporidiosis, abomasal cryptosporidiosis, caused by C andersoni, is an emerging disease in cattle that may have a significant impact on production in both beef and dairy cattle. In general, C andersoni infections are not common in cattle, but the prevalence can be high in some herds, and infections last months or even years. Further research is required if we are better to understand the significance of abomasal cryptosporidiosis...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. All animals, {{including}} humans, are {{adapted to}} life in a microbial world. Anaerobic habitats have existed continuously {{throughout the history of}} the earth, the gastrointestinal tract being a contemporary microniche. Since microorganisms colonize and grow rapidly under the favorable conditions in the gut they could compete for nutrients with the host. This microbial challenge has modified the course of evolution in animals, resulting in selection of complex animal-microbe relationships that vary tremendously, ranging from competition to cooperation. The ecological and evolutionary interactions between herbivorous dino-saurs and the first mammalian herbivores and their food plants are reconstructed using knowledge gained during the study of modern living vertebrates, especially foregut and hindgut fermenting mammals. The ruminant is well adapted to achieve maximal digestion of roughage using the physiological mechanism at the reticulo-omasal orifice which selectively retains large particles in the reticulo-rumen. However, the most obvious feature of <b>all</b> <b>ruminants</b> is the regurgitation, rechewing and reswallowing of foregut digesta termed rumination. Foregut fermenting mammals also share interesting and unique features in two enzymes, stom-ach lysozyme and pancreatic ribonuclease which accompany and are adaptations to this mode of digestion. The microbial community inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract is represented by all major groups of microbes (bacteria, archaea, ciliate protozoa, anaerobic fungi and bacteriophage) and characterized by its high pop-ulation density, wide diversity and complexity of interactions. The development and application of molecular ecology techniques promises to link distribution and identity of gastrointestinal microbes in their natural environment with their genetic potential and in situ activities...|$|R
40|$|Species {{dependent}} geonetical {{differences in}} renal clearance and urinary excretion of kanamycin were investigated in adult female buffaloes, cows, sheep and goats. The drug was administered {{as a single}} intravenous dose (5 mg/kg b. wt). Blood and urine samples were collected at various time intervals after drug administration. The plasma and urine concentrations of the drug were determined using the microbiological assay. The mean (± SE) values for endogenous creatinine clearance (an index of glomerular filtration rate) were 0. 77 ± 0. 05, 0. 49 ± 0. 07, 0. 81 ± 0. 07 and 0. 98 ± 0. 13 ml/min. kg in buffaloes, cows, sheep and goats, respectively. Experiments regarding kidney handling of kanamycin in these ruminant species revealed respective values of renal clearance as 0. 08 ± 0. 01, 0. 07 ± 0. 01, 0. 19 ± 0. 02 and 0. 23 ± 0. 04 ml/min. kg. Besides glomerular filtration, kanamycin was reabsorbed from the renal tubules of <b>all</b> <b>ruminant</b> species and actively secreted into the renal tubules of buffaloes and goats. The cumulative percentages of intravenous dose of kanamycin excreted through urine during 12 hours in buffaloes, cows, sheep and goats were 4. 31 ± 0. 37, 2. 53 ± 0. 30, 11. 0 ± 1. 04 and 15. 8 ± 2. 22, respectively. This species variation {{in the percentage of}} urinary excretion in these domestic ruminants coincides with their respective glomerular filtration rates, being the highest in goats, lowest in cows and intermediate in sheep and buffaloes...|$|R
40|$|Mycoplasmas of the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster are <b>all</b> <b>ruminant</b> pathogens. Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides is {{responsible}} for contagious bovine pleuropneumonia and is known to produce capsular polysaccharide (CPS) and exopolysaccharide (EPS). Previous studies have strongly suggested a role for Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides polysaccharides in pathogenicity. Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides-secreted EPS was recently characterized as a ?(1 ? 6) -galactofuranose homopolymer (galactan) identical to the capsular product. Here, we extended the characterization of secreted polysaccharides to all {{other members of the}} M. mycoides cluster: M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, M. capricolum subsp. capricolum, M. leachii, and M. mycoides subsp. capri (including the LC and Capri serovars). Extracted EPS was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, resulting in the identification of a homopolymer of ?(1 ? 2) -glucopyranose (glucan) in M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae and M. leachii. Monoclonal antibodies specific for this glucan and for the Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides-secreted galactan were used to detect the two polysaccharides. While M. mycoides subsp. capri strains of serovar LC produced only capsular galactan, no polysaccharide could be detected in strains of serovar Capri. All strains of M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae and M. leachii produced glucan CPS and EPS, whereas glucan production and localization varied among M. capricolum subsp. capricolum strains. Genes associated with polysaccharide synthesis and forming a biosynthetic pathway were predicted in all cluster members. These genes were organized in clusters within two loci representing genetic variability hot spots. Phylogenetic analysis showed that some of these genes, notably galE and glf, were acquired via horizontal gene transfer. These findings call for a reassessment of the specificity of the serological tests based on mycoplasma polysaccharides. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
