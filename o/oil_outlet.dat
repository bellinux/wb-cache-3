This reservoir is usually tall and round or narrow and specially designed with internal baffles, and an <b>oil</b> <b>outlet</b> (supply) {{at the very bottom}} for uninhibited oil supply. The dry-sump oil pump is a minimum of 2 stages, with as many as 5 or 6. One stage is for pressure and is supplied the oil {{from the bottom of the}} reservoir, and along with an adjustable pressure regulator, supplies the oil under pressure through the filter and into the engine. The remaining stages [...] "scavenge" [...] the oil out of the dry-sump pan and return the oil (and gasses) to the top of the tank or reservoir. If an oil cooler is used usually it is mounted inline between the scavenge outlets and the tank. The dry-sump pump is usually driven by a Gilmer or HTD timing belt and pulleys, off the front of the crankshaft, at approximately one half crank speed. The dry-sump pump is designed with multiple stages to ensure that all the oil is scavenged from the pan and also to allow removal of excess air from the crankcase.|$|E

Measurements of hydrodynamic pressure, temperature profiles at the oil-bush and oil-shaft interfaces, oil flowrate and minimum film thickness under steady state conditions have been performed and the results discussed. The operating conditions were found to affect significantly the temperature profile inside the bearing. At low eccentricity tests the maximum temperature occurred at the unloaded lobe of the bearing, with the downstream groove contributing poorly to bearing cooling. As eccentricity increased, a temperature increase in the loaded lobe of the bearing was observed, along with a temperature decrease in the unloaded lobe. At high eccentricities the downstream groove was found to contribute significantly to bearing cooling.
