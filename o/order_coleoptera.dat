5|$|The {{name of the}} taxonomic <b>order,</b> <b>Coleoptera,</b> {{comes from}} the Greek koleopteros (κολεόπτερος), given to the group by Aristotle for their elytra, {{hardened}} shield-like forewings, from koleos, sheath, and pteron, wing. The English name beetle comes from the Old English word bitela, little biter, related to bītan (to bite), leading to Middle English betylle. Another Old English name for beetle is ceafor, chafer, used in names such as cockchafer, from the Proto-Germanic *kabraz- (compare German Käfer).|$|E
5|$|Beetles are a {{group of}} insects that form the <b>order</b> <b>Coleoptera,</b> in the {{superorder}} Endopterygota. Their front pair of wings is hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects. The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently. The largest of all families, the Curculionidae (weevils) with some 70,000 member species, belongs to this order. They are found in almost every habitat except {{the sea and the}} polar regions. They interact with their ecosystems in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle, while others such as Coccinellidae (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat aphids, scale insects, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.|$|E
25|$|Beetles (<b>Order</b> <b>Coleoptera)</b> are {{generally}} {{found on the}} corpse when it is more decomposed. In drier conditions, the beetles can be replaced by moth flies (Psychodidae).|$|E

50|$|He {{received}} many insects from his properties in Spain and South America. He also made extensive, and expensive purchases especially of large showy tropical beetles and wasps. His entomological contributions were {{mainly in the}} <b>orders</b> <b>Coleoptera,</b> Hymenoptera and Hemiptera.|$|R
30|$|Overall, about 79 % of {{the insects}} {{captured}} on all fields {{belonged to the}} order of Diptera (Additional file 11). The majority of the remaining insects belonged to the <b>orders</b> <b>Coleoptera,</b> Heteroptera, and Lepidoptera (about 10, 6, and 2 %, respectively).|$|R
25|$|Beetles are {{representative}} of the <b>order</b> <b>Coleoptera</b> which accounts for the largest of the insect orders. Beetles are very adaptive and can be found in almost all environments with the exception of Antarctica and high mountainous regions. The most diverse beetle fauna {{can be found in the}} tropics. In addition, beetles are less submissive to temperatures. Thus, if a carcass has been found in cold temperatures, the beetle will be prevalent over Calliphoridae.|$|E
25|$|Nicrophorus americanus, {{also known}} as the American burying beetle or giant carrion beetle, is a {{critically}} endangered species of beetle endemic to North America. It belongs to the <b>order</b> <b>Coleoptera</b> and the family Silphidae. The carrion beetle in North America is carnivorous, feeds on carrion and requires carrion to breed. It {{is also one of the}} few species of beetle to exhibit parental care. The decline of the American burying beetle has been attributed to habitat loss, alteration, and degradation, and they now occur over less than 10% of their historic range.|$|E
25|$|Tympanal {{organs are}} hearing organs. Such an organ is {{generally}} a membrane (tympanum) stretched across a frame backed by an air sac and associated sensory neurons. In the <b>order</b> <b>Coleoptera,</b> tympanal organs {{have been described}} {{in at least two}} families. Several species of the genus Cicindela in the family Cicindelidae have ears on the dorsal surface of the first abdominal segment beneath the wing; two tribes in the family Dynastinae (Scarabaeidae) have ears just beneath the pronotal shield or neck membrane. The ears of both families are to ultrasonic frequencies, with strong evidence that they function to detect the presence of bats via their ultrasonic echolocation. Even though beetles constitute a large order and live in a variety of niches, examples of hearing is surprisingly lacking in species, though it is likely that most are just undiscovered.|$|E

2500|$|The Lampyridae are {{a family}} of insects in the beetle <b>order</b> <b>Coleoptera.</b> They are winged beetles, [...] {{commonly}} called fireflies or lightning bugs for their conspicuous use of bioluminescence during twilight to attract mates or prey. Fireflies produce a [...] "cold light", with no infrared or ultraviolet frequencies. This chemically produced light from the lower abdomen may be yellow, green, or pale red, with wavelengths from 510 to 670 nanometers.|$|E
2500|$|Creophilus maxillosus {{belongs to}} the <b>order</b> <b>Coleoptera</b> and is most {{commonly}} referred to as the hairy rove beetle. [...] The rove beetles are a large family, having almost 2,900 species in North America. This species can be found in woods and wherever carrion is found, usually from the spring to autumn months. These active beetles fly swiftly or run rapidly over the ground with the tip of the abdomen raised like a scorpion's stinger. Although a few are known to be parasitic, most rove beetles and their larvae prey upon mites, other insects, and small worms.|$|E
60|$|<b>Order,</b> <b>Coleoptera</b> (Beetles).—Many beetles are {{coloured}} so as {{to resemble}} the surfaces which they habitually frequent. Other species are ornamented with gorgeous metallic tints,—for instance, many Carabidæ, which live {{on the ground and}} have the power of defending themselves by an intensely acrid secretion,—the splendid diamond-beetles which are protected by an extremely hard covering,—many species of Chrysomela, such as C. cerealis, a large species beautifully striped with various colours, and in Britain confined to the bare summit of Snowdon,—and a host of other species. These splendid colours, which are often arranged in stripes, spots, crosses and other elegant patterns, can hardly be beneficial, as a protection, except in the case of some flower-feeding species; and we cannot believe that they are purposeless. Hence the suspicion arises, that they serve as a sexual attraction; but we have no evidence on this head, for the sexes rarely differ in colour. Blind beetles, which cannot of course behold each other’s beauty, never exhibit, as I hear from Mr. Waterhouse, jun., bright colours, though they often have polished coats: but the explanation of their obscurity may be that blind insects inhabit caves and other obscure stations.|$|E
25|$|Many {{chemically}} defended insect species {{take advantage}} of clustering over solitary confinement. Among some insect larvae in the <b>orders</b> <b>Coleoptera</b> and Hymenoptera, cycloalexy is adopted. Either the heads or ends of the abdomen, depending on where noxious compounds are secreted, make up the circumference of a circle. The remaining larvae lie inside this defensive ring where the defenders repel predators through threatening attitudes, regurgitation, and biting.|$|R

50|$|Adelina is a genus of alveolates {{within the}} phylum Apicomplexa. They are coccidian parasites of {{arthropods}} and oligochaetes. Host <b>orders</b> include <b>Coleoptera,</b> Diptera, Collembola, Embioptera, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera.|$|R
60|$|Charis melipona, a South American Longicorn of {{the family}} Necydalidæ, has been so named from its {{resemblance}} to a small bee of the genus Melipona. It {{is one of the}} most remarkable cases of mimicry, since the beetle has the thorax and body densely hairy like the bee, and the legs are tufted in a manner most unusual in the <b>order</b> <b>Coleoptera.</b> Another Longicorn, Odontocera odyneroides, has the abdomen banded with yellow, and constricted at the base, and is altogether so exactly like a small common wasp of the genus Odynerus, that Mr. Bates informs us he was afraid to take it out of his net with his fingers for fear of being stung. Had Mr. Bates's taste for insects been less omnivorous than it was, the beetle's disguise might have saved it from his pin, as it had no doubt often done from the beak of hungry birds. A larger insect, Sphecomorpha chalybea, is exactly like one of the large metallic blue wasps, and like them has the abdomen connected with the thorax by a pedicel, rendering the deception most complete and striking. Many Eastern species of Longicorns of the genus Oberea, when on the wing exactly resemble Tenthredinidæ, and many of the small species of Hesthesis run about on timber, and cannot be distinguished from ants. There is one genus of South American Longicorns that appears to mimic the shielded bugs of the genus Scutellera. The Gymnocerous capucinus is one of these, and is very like Pachyotris fabricii, one of the Scutelleridæ. The beautiful Gymnocerous dulcissimus is also very like the same group of insects, though there is no known species that exactly corresponds to it; but this is not to be wondered at, as the tropical Hemiptera have been comparatively so little cared for by collectors.|$|E

50|$|Aggregations {{are common}} among diapausing {{tropical}} insects, {{especially in the}} <b>orders</b> <b>Coleoptera,</b> Lepidoptera, and Hemiptera. Aggregations {{may be used as}} protection against predation, since aggregating species are frequently toxic and predators quickly learn to avoid them. They can also serve to reduce water loss, as seen in the fungus beetle, Stenotarsus rotundus, which forms aggregations of up to 70,000 individuals, which may be eight beetles deep. Relative humidity is increased within the aggregations and beetles experience less water loss, probably due to decreased surface area to volume ratios reducing evaporative water loss.|$|R
