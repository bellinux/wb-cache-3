50|$|Although {{there is}} no reason to say that all <b>oil</b> <b>additives</b> used in {{packaged}} engine oil are good and all aftermarket <b>oil</b> <b>additives</b> are bad, there has been a tendency in the aftermarket industry to make unfounded claims regarding the efficacy of their <b>oil</b> <b>additives.</b> These unsubstantiated claims have caused consumers to be lured into adding a bottle of chemicals to their engines which do not lower emissions, improve wear resistance, lower temperatures, improve efficiency, or extend engine life more than the (much cheaper) oil would have. Many consumers are convinced that aftermarket <b>oil</b> <b>additives</b> work, but many consumers are convinced that they do not work and are in fact detrimental to the engine. The topic is hotly debated on the Internet.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the effects}} of {{lubricating}} <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> diesel fuel on the diesel engine emission particles characterizations, such as size distribution, morphology, nanostructure and composition was investigated on a light-duty diesel engine. Fast particle spectrum analysis {{was used for the}} determination of size distribution, and transmission electric microscopy (TEM) technique for the investigation of morphology of particles. On the other hand, the element carbon fraction can be obtained through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Compared with the emission particles from burning pure diesel fuel, the emission particles from burning lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> diesel fuel have lower fractal dimension. Measurement results of the nanostructure parameters show that emission particles from burning <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> dosed fuel have lower graphite structure than those from burning pure diesel fuel. TGA results indicate that more volatile and ash fraction were contained in the particles when <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> was mixed into diesel. In conclusion, the <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> may increase the nucleation mode particles and ash component. Therefore, the enhanced performance of diesel particulate filter (DPF) system may be required. Thus, the usage of <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> should be optimized by considering the tradeoff between oil quality and particle emissions contribution...|$|R

30|$|The {{function}} of additives is either to enhance an already-existing {{property of the}} base fluid or to add a new property. Viscosity index improvers, antifoaming agents, emulsifiers, demulsifiers, and pour point depressants are examples {{of different kinds of}} additives. Most of the present day additives are synthetic acrylate based. But with increasing environmental awareness, the research in the area towards the synthesis of multifunctional biodegradable lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> is increasing day by day. Hence, in our present work chemistry of biodegradable multifunctional lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> based on vegetable oil (sunflower oil) has been investigated. In the present work solvent-free synthesis of homopolymer of sunflower oil was performed by two different ways; microwave irradiation method and thermal method using benzoyl peroxide as initiator. Characterization of the polymers was done by spectral (NMR, IR), GPC and viscometric analysis and finally performance evaluation was tested by standard ASTM methods. Performance evaluation as pour point depressant, viscosity modifier or viscosity index improver and antiwear in different base oils (BO 1, BO 2) was carried out by standard ASTM methods. Shear stability and oil thickening property of the polymers have also been investigated and reported here. Thermal stability of the polymers was determined by thermogravimetric analysis. A comparison of their performances has also been reported. The additive prepared by microwave-assisted method showed better viscosity index and pour point values as compared to thermally prepared additive. Thus, polymerized sunflower oil may be used as a potential biodegradable lube <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> and hence the microwave-assisted protocol may be considered as a cost-effective greener approach for synthesis of lube <b>oil</b> <b>additive.</b>|$|R

Mathematical models were used for fitting experimental values of dynamic viscosity.

40|$|Emissions from {{aircraft}} engines represent a highly complex and important issue, which {{is related to}} the risk to human health. Particles emitted in urban areas and in the vicinity of airports affect air quality and have a particularly negative impact on airport workers. The development of measurement techniques and the methodology for evaluating exhaust emissions have allowed for the elaboration of appropriate procedures for the certification of aircraft and the enhancement of existing standards. Particulate matter emissions depend, among other things, on the composition of the fuel used and its additives. Some aircraft engine designs require a fuel additive in the form of oil, which ensures the proper operation of the fuel supply system. This article presents the results of studies conducted on jet engines powered by clean aviation fuel and fuel with the addition of oil. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effect of the addition of oil on the size distribution and concentration of emitted particles. It was found that, for small values of thrust, <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> increases the concentration of particles. With an increase in the thrust force, the reduction of particles concentration was recorded in the case of the engine powered by fuel with <b>oil</b> <b>additive.</b> There was no significant effect of <b>oil</b> <b>additive</b> on the size distribution of emitted particles...|$|R
