40|$|Objective-To {{determine}} {{prevalence of}} anthelmintic resistance in cyathostome nematodes of {{horses in the}} southern United States. Design-Cross-sectional study. Animals- 786 horses on 44 farms and stables in Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, and Louisiana. Procedure-Fecal egg count (FEC) reduction tests were performed on 44 large farms and stables. Horses on each farm were treated with an oral paste formulation of fenbendazole, <b>oxibendazole,</b> pyrantel pamoate, or ivermectin at recommended label dosages. A mixed linear model was fitted to the percentage reduction in FEC, accounting for differences among farms, states, ages, treatments, and treatment by state interactions. Results-By use of a conservative measure of resistance (< 80 % reduction), the percentage of farms with anthelmintic-resistant cyathostomes was 977 %, 0 %, 53. 5 %, and 40. 5 % for fenbendazole, ivermectin, <b>oxibendazole,</b> and pyrantel pamoate, respectively. Mean percentage reductions in FEC for all farms were 24. 8 %, 99. 9 %, 73. 8 %, and 78. 6 % for fenbendazole, ivermectin, <b>oxibendazole,</b> and pyrantel pamoate, respectively. Pairwise contrasts between states for each treatment revealed that in almost all instances, {{there were no significant}} differences in results between states. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The prevalence of resistance found in this study was higher than that reported previously, suggesting that anthelmintic resistance in equine cyathostomes is becoming a major problem.

40|$|AbstractAnthelmintics {{have been}} applied indiscriminately to control horse {{nematodes}} for over 40 years. Three broad-spectrum anthelmintic classes are currently registered for nematode control in horses: benzimidazoles (fenbendazole, <b>oxibendazole),</b> tetrahydropyrimidines (pyrantel) and macrocyclic lactones (ivermectin, moxidectin). Generally, control strategies have focused on nematode egg suppression regimens that involve the frequent application of anthelmintics to all horses at intervals based on strongyle egg reappearance periods after treatment. The widespread use of such programmes has substantially reduced clinical disease, especially that associated with large strongyle species; however, high treatment frequency has led to considerable selection pressure for anthelmintic resistance, particularly in cyathostomin species. Field studies published {{over the last decade}} indicate that benzimidazole resistance is widespread globally in cyathostomins and there are also many reports of resistance to pyrantel in these worms. Cyathostomin resistance to macrocyclic lactone compounds is emerging, principally measured as a reduction in strongyle egg reappearance time observed after treatment. Ivermectin resistance is a further concern in the small intestinal nematode, Parascaris equorum, an important pathogen of foals. These issues indicate that horse nematodes must now be controlled using methods less dependent on anthelmintic use and more reliant on management practices designed to reduce the force of infection in the environment. Such strategies include improved grazing management integrated with targeted anthelmintic administration involving faecal egg count (FEC) -directed treatments. The latter require that the supporting diagnostic tests available are robust and practically applicable. Recent research has focused on maximising the value of FEC analysis in horses and on optimizing protocols for anthelmintic efficacy testing. Other studies have sought to develop diagnostics that will help define levels of pre-patent infection. This review describes recent advances in each of these areas of research...|$|E

An overview of the literature of Toxocara infections in dogs and cats and human toxocarosis is given. Little {{is known about the}} prevalence of the infection in the different categories of dogs and cats which is a prerequisite to give adequate information. Surveys in the Netherlands are described among privately owned dogs and cats and stray cats, dog breeding kennels and catteries to determine patent infections in dogs and cats and environmental contamination with Toxocara and other nematode eggs in breeding colonies as well as eventual risk factors for infection. Activation of somatic Toxocara larvae followed by a tracheal migration {{and the development of a}} patent infection is suggested for cyclic bitches during metoestrus.

The IC$ sb{ 50 }$ and K$ sb{ rm a}$ values approximately correlated with the known anthelmintic potency (recommended therapeutic doses) of the BZs except for OFZ and ABZSO. Tubulin bound BZs at 4 $ sp circ$C with lower K$ sb{ rm a}$ than at 37 $ sp circ$C. Western blot of tubulin separated by 2 -dimensional electrophoresis showed that the $ beta$-tubulin isoform pattern of the S and R strains were dissimilar whi...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of anthelmintic resistance to benzimidazoles and avermectin in cyathostome nematodes in New Zealand horses was investigated using a larval development assay (LDA) {{to conduct a}} small survey. For the benzimidazoles the analogue, thiabendazole was used and for avermectin the analogues, ivermectin and ivermectin aglycone {{were used in the}} LDA. The normal range of LD 50 values was estimated by assaying eggs from Kaimanawa feral horses (n = 22) for each analogue used. From these the mean LD 50 values + 2 xstandard deviation was taken as the upper limit of normal. The survey involved domestic horses (n = 47) from several locations around New Zealand. For ivermectin and ivermectin aglycone 12 % had LD 50 values higher than normal with resistance factors up to 5. 3 and 6. 8 respectively. This represents horses from three separate farms. For the benzimidazoles 43 % of domestic horses had higher than normal LD 50 values with resistance factors up to 4. 8. These results suggest that some nematodes in these domestic horses had an increased tolerance to avermectins and as well as to benzimidazoles. Two studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of a combination of abamectin (0. 2 mg/kg), <b>oxibendazole</b> (10 mg/kg) and bithionol (5 mg/kg or 7 mg. kg). In the first study bithionol was included at 5 mg/kg and in the second study it was included at 7 mg/kg. These studies showed the efficacy of the combination was > 98 % against adult luminal stages of S. vulgaris, S. edentatus, cyathostomes, migratory stages of S. edentatus and third instar stages of Gasterophilus intestinalis. Efficacy against mucosal stages of cyathostomes (about 64 %) and arterial stages of S. vulgaris (71 %) was poor. Inclusion of bithionol at 7 mg/kg achieved an efficacy of 100 % against A. perfoliata whereas at 5 mg/kg the efficacy was only 84. 6 %. In these studies the following species were identified: two species of Strongylus (S. vulgaris and S. edentatus); three species of Triodontophorus (T. serratus, T. minor and T. tenuicollis); and twelve species of cyathostomes (Cyathostomum coronatum, Cyathostomum labiatum, Cyathostomum catinatum, Cylicocyclus nassatus, Cylicocyclus leptostomus, Cylicocyclus radiatus, Cylicocyclus insigne, Cylicostephanus poculatus, Cylicostephanus minutus, Cylicostephanus calicatus, Cylicostephanus longibursatus and Cylicostephanus goldi) ...|$|E
