500|$|In 1994, Conran {{set up a}} bluescreen in {{his living}} room and began {{assembling}} the tools he would need to create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than [...] "just a vague idea <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> who flew a plane. We would talk about all the obvious things like Indiana Jones and all the stuff we liked." [...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{included}} a guest appearance from Alexander Siddig, {{who played the}} [...] "Muslim hero" [...] Muhammed Ibhn Khaldun. Siddig was already well known as playing regular character Julian Bashir in [...] The producers viewed Siddig as a [...] "noble" [...] actor when he was playing the character. Siddig described the role as a [...] "godsend" [...] to him, because it enabled him to [...] "portray various aspects of an Arab man who was readily credible. He {{came out of a}} new identity I was looking for, trying to take a snapshot <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> before he disappears. He was my father. He was your father. He was the father of all the generations that had a liberal upbringing and didn't make a lot of money." [...] Roshan Seth played imam Fazul Azzam; he was cast because Brenton wanted him to appear in the episode. Meanwhile, Taahir Husain played the bomber Abu Hassan. The producers felt that the child actor was [...] "a find" [...] for them; it was his first television appearance, but they believed his performance [...] "carried it off." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Thing-Fish {{characterization}} {{was performed}} by Ike Willis, who helped shaped the dialogue himself using African American Vernacular English According to Willis, [...] "in my family, we sort of joke around with dialects, and what it sounded like to me was [...] Paul Laurence Dunbar. [...] I asked Frank if he had ever heard <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy,</b> and he said, 'No,' so I started giving him examples of Dunbar's work, and eventually, that ended up being a big influence on the Thing-Fish dialect." ...|$|E
50|$|Noses do vary {{quite a bit}} in width, so {{keep that}} in mind. The sides <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy’s</b> nose extend a little past the inside corners of his eyes.|$|R
2500|$|... "I {{thought that}} the public would kick us off the air because <b>of</b> <b>this</b> egregious <b>guy.</b> No. They loved ... they knew him." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “The {{first time}} I heard Duke {{it gave me}} chills,” said Fogerty. [...] "I hadn't {{experienced}} energy like that in a long time. It was like walking in on Jimmy Swaggart in his heyday. Everybody in the audience was shouting and screaming {{and having a good}} time. I mean the crowd was just eating out <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy's</b> hand. Immediately the light went on in my head--somebody ought to record these guys." ...|$|R
2500|$|David Freiberg, a folk-guitarist {{friend of}} Valenti's, was {{recruited}} to the group. He {{had previously been}} in a band with Paul Kantner and David Crosby but like Cipollina he had been arrested and briefly jailed for marijuana possession and had just been released. [...] "We were to take care <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> Freiberg," [...] Cipollina recalled, and though they had never met before, Freiberg was integrated into the group. The band also added Skip Spence on guitar and began to rehearse at Marty Balin's club, the Matrix. Balin, {{in search of a}} drummer for the band he was organizing (which became Jefferson Airplane), convinced Spence to switch instruments and groups.|$|E
2500|$|Harrelson had {{input into}} the {{wardrobe}} for his character, Tallahassee. [...] "I never worked so long and hard on an outfit in my life," [...] he stated. [...] "What this guy wears is who he is. You {{want to get a}} sense <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> as soon as you see him. So I pick out the necklaces, the sunglasses. But the hat? The minute you see that on Tallahassee, you buy him. He's real. And he's got a real cool hat". Harrelson's choice of headwear for Tallahassee came not just down to style, but also to his environmental passions: the distinctive hat is handmade in Brazil by a company called The Real Deal using recycled cargo-truck tarps and wire from old truck tires.|$|E
2500|$|Guy of Lusignan and Reynald of Chatillon {{were brought}} to Saladin's tent. Saladin offered Guy a drink, which was a sign in Muslim culture that the {{prisoner}} would be spared, although Guy was unaware <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> <b>Guy</b> passed the goblet to Reynald, but Saladin struck it from his hands, saying [...] "I did not ask this evil man to drink, {{and he would not}} save his life by doing so". He then charged Reynald with breaking the truce. Some reports, such as that of Baha al' Din, claim that Saladin then executed Reynald himself with a single stroke of his sword. However, others record that Saladin struck Reynald as a sign to his bodyguards to behead him. Guy assumed that he would also be beheaded, but Saladin assured him that [...] "kings do not kill kings." ...|$|E
40|$|Kendra*, {{senior in}} {{agricultural}} business, finally downloaded Tinder after constant pestering from her friends. Within {{a couple of}} weeks of downloading the app, Kendra had met two guys. While her first date went well, her second date out was anything but a romantic night out. She should’ve known right away that he was a little creepy. “He told me he was looking for whatever was out there. I should have known that as my first clue <b>of,</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy’s</b> kind <b>of</b> a creeper,” Kendra says. *Names were changed to protect the identities of those involved...|$|R
50|$|A notable example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is <b>Guy</b> Paul Morin, who was wrongfully {{convicted in}} his second trial after the {{acquittal}} in his first trial was vacated by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Cowboys & Indians, Perry spoke about {{the evolution of the}} John Goodnight character, which he created. [...] He {{is turning out to be}} a little darker than I think everybody envisioned at the beginning. And I think that's because most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy's</b> make-up, and most of his integrity, comes from that bad childhood experience, those bad things that happened to him in the first movie. He's still touched by that. Which is why I think he'll stay moving. They keep wanting to set him down in one place, and have him be the judge there. But that's not interesting to me. <b>This</b> is a <b>guy</b> who has to keep going to a different place time and again.|$|R
6000|$|To {{all this}} Robin listened, {{and as he}} listened his gorge rose. Well he knew <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>Guy</b> of Gisbourne, {{and of all the}} bloody and murderous deeds that he had done in Herefordshire, for his doings were famous {{throughout}} all the land. Yet, although he loathed the very presence of the man, he held his peace, for he had an end to serve. [...] "Truly," [...] quoth he, [...] "I have heard of thy gentle doings. Methinks there is no one in all the world that Robin Hood would rather meet than thee." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{survived the}} war {{after a year}} of {{dysentery}} and malaria, curing himself chewing leaves of cocaine introduced by the Bolivian prisoners. But his survival was not just to his courage, fortitude or luck, but to his writing skills. His comrades tried not expose too much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> that wrote passionate love letters for them to their girlfriends.|$|E
5000|$|In a radio interview, {{director}} Ryan Davies said: [...] "The idea {{we came up}} {{with was}} that <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> who's completely mental playing the piano until his fingers bleed and attacking random people on the street. There's a lot of blood and gore. The band wanted the video to be juxtaposed to the song, because there's no piano in the actual song." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{review of}} the album, from Rock Report, states, [...] "this 7-track demo clearly shows what great {{potential}} this band has. This material {{is so strong that}} it can only be a matter <b>of</b> time before <b>this</b> <b>guys</b> get signed." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{asterisk}} (*) denotes {{members of}} the previous Legislature who continued in office as members <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Legislature. <b>Guy</b> James Mangano, Edward S. Lentol and Jeremiah J. Moriarty changed from the Assembly to the Senate at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Legislature. Assemblyman Irwin R. Brownstein was elected to fill a vacancy in the Senate.|$|R
5000|$|... "Drive Home" [...] {{is based}} on a {{suggestion}} from illustrator Hajo Mueller. It is [...] "about a couple driving along in a car at night, very much in love; the guy is driving, and his partner - his wife or girlfriend or whoever she is - is in the passenger seat, and the next minute she’s gone." [...] The ghost of the man's partner eventually returns, [...] "saying, ‘I’m going to remind you now what happened that night.’ There was a terrible car accident, and she died, etcetera, etcetera - again, the idea of trauma leading to a missing part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy’s</b> life. He can’t deal with the reality of what happened, so he blocks it out - like taking a piece of tape and editing a big chunk out of it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Singer Mark Seymour said, [...] "With the lyrics, I'd {{been reading}} a Jeanette Winterson novel, [...] "The Passion". It {{was a story}} about Napoleon's chef when he invaded Russia. The army was {{destroyed}} by the weather. It's a story about survival. It's a really powerful book and somehow I drew this analogy between the idea <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> managing to survive this incredible ordeal and Hunters and Collectors making this excruciating record." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wayne Miller, {{one of the}} unit's photographers, remembered Steichen's {{instructions}} this way: [...] " [...] 'I don't {{care what}} you do, Wayne, but bring back something that will please the brass a little bit, an aircraft carrier or somebody with all the braid; {{spend the rest of}} your time photographing the man.' It was Steichen's prime concern—don't photograph the war; photograph the man, the little guy; the struggle, the heartaches, plus the dreams <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy.</b> Photograph the sailor." ...|$|E
5000|$|McMullin had {{the support}} of several anti-Trump Republican donors and his presidential bid was also backed by several former members of Better for America, a 501(c)(4) {{organization}} dedicated to getting nationwide ballot access for an independent candidate for President in the 2016 election. McMullin's campaign is supported by some members of the [...] "Never Trump" [...] movement. Trump repeatedly attacked McMullin, referring to him as [...] "McMuffin" [...] and stating that [...] "I never even heard <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> before. Nobody did." ...|$|E
5000|$|On his mound presence, Syndergaard has said, [...] "I {{feel like}} most people think I'm kind <b>of</b> <b>this</b> quiet <b>guy,</b> but when I'm on the mound ... I {{try to be as}} intimidating as possible. I try to use that as a weapon of mine. I feel like I'm {{on top of the world}} when I'm on the mound." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just {{leave it}} to me," [...] he said. [...] "The less you know, the better off you'll be. What you want is to get rid <b>of</b> <b>this</b> fresh <b>guy</b> and have all the papers in a certain vault {{destroyed}}. You {{see to it that}} only the papers you want destroyed are in that vault, and I'll do the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's another thing," [...] he said, {{swinging}} round {{suddenly and}} causing his sister to drop another stitch. [...] "Maybe you think he's some kind <b>of</b> a Dago, <b>this</b> <b>guy?</b> Maybe that's what's biting you. Let {{me tell you}} that he's an American--pretty near as much an American as you are yourself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tookey also {{witnessed}} a man {{bleed to death}} from a stabbing in 1997, and his reaction troubled him: [...] "It has brought home to me that I have seen so much violence on screen (the latest film is Crash) that I have become desensitised. Talking with the others on the street, I was noticeably less affected by the sight <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> bleeding to death. After the killing, {{a number of people}} had nightmares. Shouldn't I have? It was my lack of reaction that was so chilling." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{cover of}} the album {{features}} artwork by tattoo artist, Steve Cross from Melbourne. It depicts a man with blazing coloured wings leaping off a cliff. [...] "With this album {{we wanted to do}} something a bit different than just pictures of us. We kinda wanted to go a little bit more creative and imaginative. We thought of this concept <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> like leaping off this cliff with these flaming colourful wings, and it kind of really worked with the context of this album and obviously the title." [...] - Notley ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Need You Now" [...] was {{directed}} by Mick Jones and released on 27 April 2017. The video charts a man's inner demons, addiction problems and continual self-destruction. Lewis explained to MusicFeeds“Instead of the video being a direct reflection of the lyrics, {{we came up with}} this dark idea <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> who is keeping everything together on the surface but on weekends he loses himself. I have seen a lot of friends who have gone through that, so it’s close to home for me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nah. Lemme tell you, Charley, an' I got the {{witnesses}} to prove it, {{so help me}} God. I was settin' in me kitchen eatin' a bowl <b>of</b> soup, when <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> comes in an' gets gay wid me. I never seen him in me born days before. He was drunk--" ...|$|R
5000|$|Keith Levene (2001/07): “There was <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> {{that was}} an old mate <b>of</b> Johns (...) <b>This</b> <b>guy,</b> {{designer}} Kenny MacDonald, made his suit and all of ours, and it made him look good to have the guys from PIL wearing his stuff (...) He wouldnt be his lapdog, and John {{thought he was a}} star and wanted that. John named him on our first album on Low Life.” “That song was about Malcolm McLaren in theory, but at one point I think it was about schoolfriend John Gray. Lydons usually got the hump with someone, and he usually writes with someone in mind, someone hes not too happy with.” ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 6, 2010, {{a federal}} grand jury indicted Abdulmutallab on six {{criminal}} counts including attempted use of {{a weapon of mass destruction}} and attempted murder. [...] "Not guilty" [...] pleas were entered on the behalf of Abdulmutallab at the hearing. The charges carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment plus 90 years. He faced his first court hearing, a detention hearing, on January 8, 2010. A former federal prosecutor told the Detroit News that [...] "there's no chance <b>of</b> getting <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> bond in a million years".|$|R
5000|$|L.A. mobster turned {{government}} witness Anthony Fiato {{once described}} Milano {{after their first}} encounter: I {{thought he was a}} fucking hobo. His shirt's open, he has a big potbelly, scuffed shoes. He tells me to call him Flipper, like the dolphin. My first impression <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> was that he was a down-at-the-heels hobo, more so than some high-level Mafia member. He was more of an albatross than a dolphin. But he was tougher than he looked. He had a reputation and wasn't afraid to mix it up.|$|E
5000|$|Speaking to Record Collector in 1992, Harley {{said of the}} {{remixing}} of [...] "Irresistible": [...] "Irresistible {{came out}} here in the 80s, but this is a new mix and it's fabulous. I gave it to a guy who works at Air Studios in London, Stuart Breed. He has done a fantastic job. I went in initially as the producer to do it with him, but after half an hour <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> hitting the buttons and doing fantastic things with sampling machines, I said [...] "I'm going for a cup of tea, you get on with it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Vocalist Josh Todd has {{mentioned}} that the songs [...] "Rescue Me" [...] and [...] "A Child Called [...] "It"" [...] were both inspired by the Dave Pelzer book, A Child Called [...] "It". [...] "There were times when I had to put the book down because the abuse <b>of</b> <b>this</b> boy was so bad, but I felt like the book found me… I was compelled to write <b>this</b> song out <b>of</b> inspiration from <b>this</b> <b>guy’s</b> incredible journey." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{score to}} Houdini {{was written by}} the veteran film {{composer}} John Debney. A lifelong fan of Harry Houdini, Debney joined the project {{at the behest of}} a producer with whom he had previously collaborated on the A&E miniseries Bonnie & Clyde. [...] Rather than compose a period score for the series, Debney instead elected to write an [...] "electronic/contemporary" [...] score, with [...] "instruments from the period that would give you the flavor of the times and give you the feeling <b>of</b> who <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> was." [...] A two volume soundtrack was released for digital download by Lakeshore Records on August 26, 2014 and later on CD September 23, 2014.|$|R
5000|$|On killing Jerome, showrunner Bruno Heller {{talked in}} an {{interview}} for ComicBook.com, stating [...] "We always knew, it’s one of those things, when we saw Cameron’s performance and how brilliant he was, {{there was a moment}} <b>of</b> 'oh hell, <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> is genius!' But we had a storyline that has to go how it has to go, otherwise it'd be cheating. So to that degree, there was some second guessing that 'oh hell, we're losing this brilliant young actor." ...|$|R
