5|$|In 1980, Akira Toriyama {{had created}} the popular manga Dr. Slump; within roughly six months, he wanted to end the series but his {{publisher}} Shueisha would only allow {{him to do so}} if he agreed to start another serial for them shortly after.

This led to the two-part , published in the August and October 1983 issues of Fresh Jump. It follows a boy, adept at martial arts, who escorts a princess <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>journey</b> back to her home country. Dragon Boy was very well-received and evolved to become Dragon Ball.|$|E
