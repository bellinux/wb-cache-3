40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, we {{measured}} the morphometric and histological {{changes in the}} cyprinid loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, during <b>the</b> early period <b>of</b> growth. Eyes, yolk length, yolk height, and yolk volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larva decreased for 16 days post hatching (DPH) (P 0. 05), the most anterior extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head × <b>the</b> posterior end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supraoccipital, the most anterior extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin, the most anterior extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pectoral fin, <b>the</b> posterior end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supraoccipital × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fin, and <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> ventral <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caudal fin gradually decreased, whereas the most anterior extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head × <b>the</b> dorsal <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caudal fin, <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anal fin, <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pectoral fin, and <b>the</b> insertion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fin gradually increased (P< 0. 05). In the cyprinid loach, the retina is composed <b>of</b> six layers: <b>the</b> epithelial layer, ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer, outer limiting membrane, and rod and cone layer (RCL). After hatching, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RCL gradually increased in density. The kidney and midgut epithelium were already formed in the cyprinid loach just after hatching and grew gradually in subsequent days...|$|R

5|$|The Norfolk Spaniel was {{believed}} to have come about from a cross of spaniels with the Black and Tan Terrier, which was cultivated by an unspecified Duke of Norfolk. However, later historians disagree with this theory, saying that the Duke of Norfolk's spaniels were of the King Charles type and that terrier stock {{had nothing to do}} with the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norfolk Spaniel. The theory of the Duke of Norfolk-based <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Norfolk Spaniel was thought disproved by the investigation of James Farrow, a 19th-century spaniel breeder, who wrote to Henry Fitzalan-Howard, 15th Duke of Norfolk in order to find out the truth about the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breed. The Duke responded, denying any connection to the breed, although he did state that his grandfather, Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, owned Sussex Spaniels. The letter from the Duke was printed in The Kennel Gazette in 1899. An alternative origin was proposed by Rawdon Briggs Lee in volume two of his 1897 work A History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland. Lee argued that the Norfolk Spaniel was descended from a crossing of a curly-coated water spaniel and a Sussex Spaniel or another strain of land spaniel.|$|E
