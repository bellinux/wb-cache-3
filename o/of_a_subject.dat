5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> ally, although information for this campaign is very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this. There is no evidence that any of these allies received any substantial aid from Athens, which was still too preoccupied with the Social War.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan {{disagreed}} {{several times}} over the choice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject.</b> After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.|$|E

25|$|Les Joueurs de {{football}} is {{testament to the}} close association of two artists, Metzinger and Gleizes, and to their shared social, cultural and philosophical conviction that painting represented more than a fleeting glimpse {{of the world in}} which they lived, that indeed by showing multiple facets <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> captured at successive intervals in time simultaneously, a truer more complete image would emerge.|$|E
25|$|Kuhn {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} an exemplar in a postscript to the second edition of The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1970). He noted that he was substituting the term 'exemplars' for 'paradigm', meaning the problems and solutions that students <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> learn from the beginning of their education. For example, physicists might have as exemplars the inclined plane, Kepler's laws of planetary motion, or instruments like the calorimeter.|$|E
25|$|Public Safety Recruits {{must pass}} a {{training}} course which includes all necessary training required by New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services (DCJS) for {{training as a}} Peace Officer. In addition, recruits go through training in physical control <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject,</b> the use and effects of pepper spray, and firearms training.

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>subject’s</b> maximum {{voluntary}} contraction (MVC) is recorded {{and used to}} normalize both reference forces and results between subjects. During the test subjects are assisted in producing a reference force using various types of feedback (static weight or visual display of force generated). This is followed by <b>an</b> attempt <b>of</b> the <b>subject</b> to generate the reference force without assistance. The duration for both reference and matching tasks is usually four seconds. Results are taken as <b>a</b> mean value <b>of</b> force generated over a time interval set by the researcher. Time intervals are generally one second long and {{near the end of}} the attempt. Reference forces are typically set as <b>a</b> percentage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject’s</b> MVC while error is typically reported as <b>a</b> percentage <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject’s</b> MVC.|$|R
25|$|The first Janissary {{units were}} formed from {{prisoners of war}} and slaves, {{probably}} {{as a result of}} the sultan taking his traditional one-fifth share of his army's plunder in kind rather than cash; however the continuing enslaving of dhimmi constituted a continuing abuse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> population. Initially the recruiters favoured Greeks and Albanians. As borders of the Ottoman Empire expanded, the devşirme was extended to include Bosniaks, Bulgarians, Croats, Serbs, Armenians, Hungarians and later, in rare instances, Romanians, Georgians, Ukrainians and southern Russians.|$|E
25|$|Through the Salon d'Automne, Gleizes becomes {{associated}} with the Duchamp brothers, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7 rue Lemaître in the Parisian suburb Puteaux, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, a regular meeting places for the Cubist group. The Puteaux studios share a garden with the studio of František Kupka, the Czech painter who is developing a non-representational style based on music and the progressive abstraction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> in motion.|$|E
25|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{is a fairly}} new and growing field of study. Though it can date back {{as early as the}} days of Plato and Aristotle, it was not identified as a specific practice. It was unknown that everyday teaching and learning in which individuals had to think about individual differences, assessment, development, the nature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> being taught, problem solving, and transfer of learning was the beginning to the field of educational psychology. These topics are important to education and as a result it is important to understanding human cognition, learning, and social perception.|$|E
40|$|Fresh fruits are {{important}} sources of many nutrients to human, e. g., vitamin, minerals (Sorensen et al. 1999). Numerous {{studies have demonstrated}} that a person regularly eating fruits will have lower risk for several cardiovascular diseases. In a nutritional epidemiological study, investigators wish to evaluate their education programs that promote fruits and vegetable consumption. In this study, it is crucial to obtain accurate estimates <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject’s</b> frequency <b>of</b> eating fruits, which is measured as number <b>of</b> days <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> eating fruits in a year. It is difficult to directly measure the number <b>of</b> days <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> eats fruits over an entire year. Instead, the investigators decided to measure the number <b>of</b> days <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> ate fruit in the week immediately before his/her interview with investigators. Since each week has 7 days, and each year has 52 weeks, it seems reasonable to get the estimates of number of days in the whole year by inflating the number of days reported in a week with <b>a</b> factor <b>of</b> 52. We illustrate an alternative Bayesian estimate here...|$|R
50|$|In Scottish schools, Preliminary Examinations (commonly {{known as}} Prelim Exams) are exams set {{in high schools}} after about two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject's</b> course has been completed, S4/5/6 pupils usually sit their exams in late January to early February.|$|R

25|$|Although {{the number}} of {{subjects}} offered was large, choices were limited as each school could offer only a few subjects on the list for budget constraints, restrictions on combinations of subjects and the actual time allowed to cover the large syllabus of different subjects. In addition, some of the subjects were unpopular. One could not tAle the A and AS <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> at the same examination. Students could take a maximum of 7 AL and/or AS subjects in one examination, {{but only a few}} students actually took 7 subjects from 2004.|$|E
25|$|Another Cubist {{scandal is}} {{produced}} at the Salon d'Automne of 1911. The Indépendants exhibitors develop {{relations with the}} Duchamp brothers, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp. The studios of Jacques Villon and Raymond Duchamp-Villon at 7, rue Lemaître, become, together with Gleizes' studio at Courbevoie, regular meeting places for the newly formed Groupe de Puteaux (soon to exhibit under the name Section d'Or). František Kupka, the Czech painter interested in non-representational painting based on analogies with music and the progressive abstraction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> in motion, joins the discussions.|$|E
25|$|Socrates' second argument, the Theory of Recollection, {{shows that}} it is {{possible}} to draw information out of a person who seems not to have any knowledge <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> prior to his being questioned about it (a priori knowledge).

Since the person in Socrates' story is able to provide correct answers to his interrogator, it must be the case that his answers arose from recollections of knowledge gained during a previous life.|$|E

25|$|In 1914 Boccioni {{published}} his book, Pittura, scultura futuriste (Futurist Painting and Sculpture), which caused a rift {{between himself and}} some of his Futurist comrades. As a result, perhaps, he abandoned his exploration of Dynamism, and instead sought further decomposition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> by means of colour. With Horizontal Volumes in 1915 and the Portrait of Ferruccio Busoni in 1916, he completed a full return to figurative painting. Perhaps fittingly, this last painting was a portrait of the maestro who purchased his first Futurist work, The City Rises.|$|E
25|$|Mortlockese uses tense markers such as mii and {{to denote}} {{the present tense}} state <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject,</b> aa to denote a present tense state that an object has changed to from a different, past state, kɞ to {{describe}} something {{that has already been}} completed, pɞ and lɛ to denote future tense, pʷapʷ to denote a possible action or state in future tense, and sæn/mwo for something that has not happened yet. Each of these markers is used in conjunction with the subject proclitics except for the markers aa and mii. Additionally, the marker mii can be used with any type of intransitive verb.|$|E
25|$|Cubist and Futurist devices appear {{superimposed}} in Metzinger's At the Cycle-Race Track, {{creating an}} image that is readable yet essentially anti-naturalistic. Cubist elements include {{the reduction of the}} geometric schema to simplified shapes, and the juxtaposition of rotating planes to define spatial qualities, printed-paper collage, the incorporation of a granular surface and multiple perspective. Parallels with Futurism include the choice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> in motion (the bicyclist), the suggestion of velocity (motion blur on the wheel spokes), and the fusing of forms in a static picture plane. Metzingers's work integrates the idea of an aesthetic generated by the modern myth of the machine and speed.|$|E

5000|$|Importance is <b>a</b> {{subjective}} indicator <b>of</b> value. <b>As</b> a concept, {{importance is}} the recognized attribution <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject's</b> significance or value {{as defined by}} a perspective.

50|$|Objectivity is {{a central}} {{philosophical}} concept, related to reality and truth, which has been variously defined by sources. Generally, objectivity means the state or quality of being true even outside <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject's</b> individual biases, interpretations, feelings, and imaginings. A proposition is generally considered objectively true (to have objective truth) when its truth conditions are met without biases caused by feelings, ideas, opinions, etc., <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sentient <b>subject.</b> <b>A</b> second, broader {{meaning of the term}} refers to the ability in any context to judge fairly, without partiality or external influence. This second meaning of objectivity is sometimes used synonymously with neutrality.|$|R
25|$|Lagrange was a {{favourite}} of the king, {{who used}} frequently to discourse {{to him on}} the advantages of perfect regularity of life. The lesson went home, and thenceforth Lagrange studied his mind and body as though they were machines, and found by experiment the exact amount of work which he was able to do without breaking down. Every night he set himself a definite task for the next day, and on completing any branch <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> he wrote a short analysis to see what points in the demonstrations or in the subject-matter were capable of improvement. He always thought out the subject of his papers before he began to compose them, and usually wrote them straight off without a single erasure or correction.|$|E
25|$|The major propositions of Badiou's {{philosophy}} all {{find their}} basis in Being and Event, {{in which he}} continues his attempt (which he began in Théorie du sujet) to reconcile a notion of the subject with ontology, and in particular post-structuralist and constructivist ontologies. A frequent criticism of post-structuralist work is that it prohibits, through its fixation on semiotics and language, any notion <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject.</b> Badiou's work is, by his own admission, an attempt {{to break out of}} contemporary philosophy's fixation upon language, which he sees almost as a straitjacket. This effort leads him, in Being and Event, to combine rigorous mathematical formulae with his readings of poets such as Mallarmé and Hölderlin and religious thinkers such as Pascal. His philosophy draws upon both 'analytical' and 'continental' traditions. In Badiou's own opinion, this combination places him awkwardly relative to his contemporaries, meaning that his work had been only slowly taken up. Being and Event offers an example of this slow uptake, in fact: it was translated into English only in 2005, a full seventeen years after its French publication.|$|E
25|$|Moltmann relates {{his views}} on the trinity to three modes of human freedom. The first mode is the {{political}} meaning of freedom as supremacy. This mode is rejected by Moltmann, who sees it as corresponding to a God who rules over his creation, which exists merely to serve Him. It is a relation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>subject</b> with an object, where {{the goal is to}} enhance the supremacy of the subject. The second mode of human freedom is the socio-historical and Hegelian meaning of freedom as communion, which implies the relation between two subjects. This relationship aims at love and solidarity, and corresponds to the perichoresis of the Father and Son, and through the Son the children of God, or humanity. This relationship is both liberating and loving, and is one Moltmann favors. The third mode of human freedom is the implicitly religious concept of freedom as the passion of the creature for his or her potential. This deals with the relationship between subjects and their common future project. This is the mode favored most by Moltmann, who correlates this relationship with the one humans share with God {{in the realm of the}} Holy Spirit. Here, an indwelling of the Spirit allows humans to be friends with God. As you can see, the first mode of freedom is political, and focuses on The Father; the second is communal, focusing on the Son; and the third is religious, focusing on the Spirit.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWhile web-based {{learning}} has opened educational opportunities {{to more people}} in more situations, it has also introduced <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> problems related to independent, online interaction with learning material.
