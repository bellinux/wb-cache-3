40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} {{for the design of}} a wireless portable vibration acquisition and analysis instrument. The system can achieve high-speed synchronous data acquisition at the sample speed of 10 k samples per second per channel. The system employs Wireless LAN technology to achieve data transmission to 54 Mbps. A remote signal analysis scheme based on an embedded system is proposed, which is achieved via the wireless connection between the on-line monitoring diagnosis system and the portable instrument. A novel curve display module with two-finger <b>touching</b> <b>zooming</b> technique is employed. The user interface operates under the Windows CE embedded operation system...|$|R
50|$|Due to Professor Zoom's recent tamperings {{with the}} Speed Force, Johnny Quick is later seen by his daughter, Jesse and her husband, the current Hourman begging Barry Allen to spare Jesse's life.

His daughter Jesse taking the mantle of Johnny's costume with Wally West uses his connection to the Speed Force to rejuvenate the speedsters and, in the process, repair Jesse's suits.|$|R
5000|$|The {{external}} controls of the Series 1 were also mechanically {{more complex than}} the Zoomar. Most early zooms had separate twist control rings to vary the focus and focal length - a [...] "two touch" [...] zoom. The Series 1 used a single control ring: twist to focus, push-pull to zoom - a [...] "one touch" [...] zoom. For a short time, about 1980-1985, one-touch zooms were the dominant type, because of their ease of handling. However, the arrival of interchangeable lens autofocus cameras in 1985 with the Minolta Maxxum 7000 (Japan; called Alpha 7000 in Japan, 7000 AF in Europe) necessarily forced the decoupling of focusing and zooming controls and two <b>touch</b> <b>zooms</b> made an instant comeback.|$|R
