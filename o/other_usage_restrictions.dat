40|$|Debugging data {{races in}} {{parallel}} applications {{is a difficult}} task. Error-causing data races may appear to vanish due to changes in an application’s optimization level, thread scheduling, {{whether or not a}} debugger is used, and other effects. Further, many race conditions cause incorrect program behavior only in rare scenarios and may lie undetected during software testing. Tools exist today that do a decent job in finding data races in multi-threaded applications. Some data-race detection tools are very efficient and can detect data races with less than a 2 x performance penalty. Most such tools, however, do not provide enough information to the user, require recompilation, or impose <b>other</b> <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Other tools, such as the one considered in this paper (Intel’s Thread Checker), provide users with plenty of useful information and can be used with any application binary, but have high overheads – often over 200 x. It is the goal of this paper to speed up Thread Checker by filtering out the vast majority of memory references that are highly unlikely to be involved in data races. In our work, we develop filters that filter 90 - 100 % of all memory references from the datarace detection algorithm, resulting in speedups of 2. 2 - 5. 5 x, with an average improvement of 3. 3 x...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of mobile}} phone has become {{widespread}} among Nigerians; both old and young. Indiscriminate use of mobile phone has become popular {{in public and}} private places. In public places, it is becoming difficult to achieve total restriction in mobile phone usage because of varying attitudinal tendencies within the society. There is need to evaluate the compliance of the individual phone user to non-compliance with various phone <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> laws in public buildings so as to determine the proactive method that can be employed in forestalling future occurrences. In this paper, the degree of compliance of people to mobile phone <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> laws in public places is evaluated. Information was gathered through questionnaire administration and visitation to selected public places such as, examination halls, banking halls, and detention centers (police cells and prison halls) in Akure. The questionnaires were presented {{in such a way that}} it will provide response to the issue of the degree of phone <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> compliance, attitudinal responses of public places managers to violators, and the perception of unauthorized phone users to restriction regulation. The data obtained were analyzed statistically using descriptive statistics based on percentages. The validation of the results were carried out using paired- t test to determine whether there is a significant difference between the degrees of phone <b>usage</b> <b>restriction</b> in the specific public places used in this study. The results of the analysis showed that the phone <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions</b> were violated in all the places investigated and the highes...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel way of usage management using a infrastructure that enables accountability on the Web at the protocol level. The protocol, HTTPA (Accountable Hyper Text Transfer Protocol), requires the data producer {{and the data}} consumer {{to come to an}} agreement before the data transfer, enabling both parities will be held accountable for the agreement they had entered into. The data consumer will express the intentions of data access and usage, whereas the data producer will express the <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions</b> on the data. This data transfer is facilitated by a trusted third party “Provenance Controller ” in an “intentions and <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions</b> handshake”. The sender/data producer will evaluate to what extent the <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions</b> match the data consumer’s intentions. If they match, the data consumer is granted access to the data; else she is notified of the mismatched components. This protocol cannot prevent the unauthorized reuse of data, but rather {{it can be used to}} develop accountability mechanisms that will identify violators allowing them to be held them accountable for data they inappropriately consumed and served. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{evolution}} of highly conserved genes, a few "synonymous" substitutions at third bases that would not alter the protein sequence are forbidden or very rare, presumably {{as a result of}} functional requirements of the gene or the messenger RNA.

The changes that occur at the majority of third bases are subject to codon <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions.</b> These <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions</b> control sequence similarities between very distant genes.

The rising costs of journal subscriptions, site licenses, and interlibrary loan have made libraries look for new methods of providing those materials. In 2014, Auburn University Libraries began a pilot project to test the feasibility of using ReadCube, an article delivery service, as a method of patron‐driven acquisition for scholarly journal articles. ReadCube allows users immediate access to articles from Nature Publishing Group journals at a lower cost than document delivery, but with <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions.</b> This case study evaluates ReadCube as an alternative to interlibrary loan by comparing the costs and usage of ReadCube Access to those of interlibrary loan.

40|$|Alms is a {{general-purpose}} {{programming language}} that supports practical affine types. To offer the expressiveness of Girard’s linear logic {{while keeping the}} type system light and convenient, Alms uses expressive kinds that minimize notation while maximizing polymorphism between affine and unlimited types. A key feature of Alms {{is the ability to}} introduce abstract affine types via ML-style signature ascription. In Alms, an interface can impose stiffer resource <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions</b> than the principal <b>usage</b> <b>restrictions</b> of its implementation. This form of sealing allows the type system to naturally and directly express a variety of resource management protocols from special-purpose type systems. We present two pieces of evidence to demonstrate the validity of our design goals. First, we introduce a prototype implementation of Alms and discuss our experience programming in the language. Second, we establish the soundness of the core language. We also use the core model to prove a principal kinding theorem...|$|R
