5|$|Darius {{then began}} to plan to {{completely}} conquer Greece, but died in 486 BC and responsibility for the conquest passed to his son Xerxes. In 480 BC, Xerxes personally led the second Persian invasion <b>of</b> <b>Greece</b> {{with one of the}} largest ancient armies ever assembled. Victory over the allied Greek states at the famous Battle of Thermopylae allowed the Persians to torch an evacuated Athens and overrun most <b>of</b> <b>Greece.</b> However, while seeking to destroy the combined Greek fleet, the Persians suffered a severe defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, the confederated Greeks went on the offensive, defeating the Persian army at the Battle of Plataea, and ending the invasion <b>of</b> <b>Greece.</b>|$|E

5|$|Darius {{therefore}} began {{raising a}} huge new army {{with which he}} meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his Egyptian subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.

Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt, and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion <b>of</b> <b>Greece.</b> This expedition was finally ready by 480 BC, and the second Persian invasion <b>of</b> <b>Greece</b> thereby began, {{under the command of}} Xerxes himself.|$|E

After Darius's death, his son Xerxes spent several years planning for the second invasion, mustering an enormous army and navy. The Athenians and Spartans led the Greek resistance. About a tenth of the Greek city-states joined the 'Allied' effort; most remained neutral or submitted to Xerxes.|$|E
