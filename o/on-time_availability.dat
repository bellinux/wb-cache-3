These criteria emphasize on the <b>on-time</b> <b>availability</b> of reliable data, {{rich enough to}} meet consumer’s needs. In addition, such data must represent a fact on business reality and provide adequate interpretation in a context intended. While these criteria emphasize as well on information visibility, consequently, it means information has to be trustworthily available on-time and able to elucidate users’ requirement. Furthermore, exchanged information can be proprietary and confidential [23, 42, 53, 54, 67].|$|E
40|$|In the {{engineering}} and contracting sector, the <b>on-time</b> <b>availability</b> of materials {{is a crucial}} element of any project. In recent years, there has been increasing competition in the supply of such components, {{as a result of}} market globalization. This has generated customer demand for higher performance, service, and quality and, most of all, shorter delivery times. However, it has also forced suppliers to increase efforts to satisfy these requirements in order to remain competitive. Thus, contractors have moved to focus their attention on the task of more precisely modelling on-time delivery risks. Historical data, expert opinion, and agreements between contractors and suppliers are some available sources of information {{that can be used to}} generate more accurate forecasts. We combine these various inputs in a Bayesian approach based on dynamic linear modelling. Our methodology has been implemented as a web-based Decision Support System, and has been applied in a real case study from an oil sector engineering and contracting company...|$|E

In addition to conventional launchers, novel launch concepts include suborbital aircraft, high altitude balloons or flying launch platforms. As a result, new mission profiles, usage concepts and an increased need for launch capacity are leading to a growing interest in expanding space activities and making their operation possible from locations all over the world. The dynamics of this process can be seen in an already rapidly growing number of commercial launches. Air Traffic Management (ATM) is challenged to integrate those vehicles in safe and efficient ways. The ATM integration concept must follow a common approach that can accommodate all different types of commercial spacecraft operations. Its goal must be to allow for a sustainable development of both, commercial air and space transportation. Therefore, harmonization and global interoperability is key, as it ensures seamless operation between systems, an accepted set of common technical and operational standards and minimized costs through identified synergies. This paper describes the necessary evolution of commercial space ATM integration towards a concept that is addressing as well interoperability issues between the aviation and space domains as between the ATM systems of different world regions. Based on an approach that accommodates key elements of the future Single European Sky (SES) and the US Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), its backbone is a dedicated CST service for the System Wide Information Management (SWIM). It is designed to facilitate <b>on-time</b> <b>availability</b> of required information to plan, monitor and accommodate space flights within the airspace system at all relevant stakeholder levels. The provision of adequate flight planning information and updates together with continuous surveillance data during all flight phases relevant for ATM is essential to enable the developed solution. Interoperability aspects of essential CNS functionalities are therefore crucial for successful implementation of the suggested integration concept and have to be considered specifically...|$|E
30|$|Responding {{to these}} {{challenges}} extends logistics processes’ scope beyond the formerly known tasks [1]. Space limitations at {{the assembly line}} lead to the picking and sequencing of parts, a core logistics activity nowadays. With an increased focus on the trade-off between stock reduction and higher delivery frequencies, the number of parts delivered by just-in-sequence processes is also rising. At all times, <b>on-time</b> parts <b>availability</b> at the assembly line is essential to ensure high manufacturing capacity utilisation.|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} network consists of 840 physicians serving over 260,000 patients in 43 {{states and the}} District of Columbia. Each physician cares for up to 600 patients {{as opposed to the}} average 2,500-3,500 patients in a traditional primary-care practice. MDVIP patients receive a comprehensive physical examination and follow-up wellness plan as well as electronic medical records and a personalized patient portal with focus on diet, exercise, doctor communication and more. The company states that additional patient benefits include acute-care visits, same or next-day <b>availability,</b> <b>on-time</b> appointments, 24/7 physician availability, and enhanced coordination of specialty care.|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} {{the scope of the}} {{affected}} SC network, SNP can be categorized into SC design and SC configuration. SC design represents a comprehensive reorganization of the entire supply network which can affect all plants, distribution centers (DCs) and suppliers as well as the entire product assortment of a company [29]. Such strategic adjustments of the whole network design are capital-intense, occur rather infrequently, are quite difficult to revert, and have long-term impacts on the economic performance of a company [28, 55, 56]. In contrast, SC configuration aims at defining and establishing a product- or category-specific SC and affects only selected parts of the supply network. However, SC configuration can result in a complicated exercise and a complex planning problem [75]. SC configuration decisions occur very frequently during NPI projects, because SCM must be aligned with the development and introduction of new products to achieve customer satisfaction and SC performance [41, 42, 62]. New or modified products have to be allocated to own plants or contract manufacturers within the existing supply network in a way that ensures cost efficiency as well as <b>on-time</b> and in-full <b>availability</b> of high-quality products over the whole PLC [29]. The complexity of resulting SC configuration problems is amplified by uncertainties and dynamics [87].|$|R
40|$|The phrase “Quality of Service ” (QoS) {{has been}} popular for about 15 years, however {{there has been}} little or no {{consensus}} in terms of what QoS actually is, what various QoS metrics are, and what QoS specifications are. Yet, QoS has spread far and wide, beyond the realm of networking, into areas such as transportation, health care, hospitality, manufacturing, etc. In fact, the author believes it may be better to introduce QoS using examples from the service industry to provide appropriate analogies in the hope of giving the study of QoS more structure as well as discover newer ways of providing QoS in computer networks. To define a service industry, one must first differentiate between goods which are usually tangible, and services which typically are intangible. In fact several organizations that have been traditionally concentrating on their goods (such as cars at vehicle manufacturers, food at restaurants, books at bookstores, etc.) are now paying {{a lot of attention to}} service (such as <b>on-time</b> delivery, <b>availability,</b> warranties, return policies, overall experience, etc.). These typically fall under the realm of providing QoS. 1. 1 Elements of a Service System Examples of service systems range from complex inter-connected networks such as computercommunication networks, transportation systems, theme parks, etc. to simpler individual units such as a barber shop, repair shops, theatres, restaurants, hospitals, hotels, etc. In all these examples two key players emerge, namely, the service provider and users. As the names suggest, the users receive service provided by the service provider. Users (also called customers if there is money involved) do not necessarily have to be humans, they could be other living or non-living entities. Further, users do not have to be single individuals, they could be part of a group (such as in a multicast session, in a restaurant, at a play, etc.). On the same token, for a given system, there could be zero, one or many service providers. Although most services are such that they are owned by a single entity (the one to blame if things go wrong), there are some (including the Internet) that are owned by several groups...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure that the safe {{capacity}} of the terminal area is not exceeded, Air Traffic Management ATM often places restrictions on arriving flights transitioning from en route airspace to terminal airspace. This restriction of arrival traffic is commonly referred to as arrival flow management, and includes techniques such as metering, vectoring, fix-load balancing, and the imposition of miles-in-trail separations. These restrictions are enacted without regard for the relative priority which airlines may be placing on individual flights based on factors such as crew criticality, passenger connectivity, critical turn times, gate <b>availability,</b> <b>on-time</b> performance, fuel status, or runway preference. The development of new arrival flow management techniques which take into consideration priorities expressed by air carriers will likely reduce the economic impact of ATM restrictions on the airlines and lead to increased airline economic efficiency by allowing airlines to have greater control over their individual arrival banks of aircraft. NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have designed and developed a suite of software decision support tools (DSTs) collectively known as the Center TRACON Automation System (CTAS). One of these tools, the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA) is currently being used at the Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center to perform arrival flow management of traffic into the Dallas/Fort Worth airport (DFW). The TMA is a time-based strategic planning tool that assists Traffic Management Coordinators (TMCs) and En Route Air Traffic Controllers in efficiently balancing arrival demand with airport capacity. The primary algorithm in the TMA is a real-time scheduler which generates efficient landing sequences and landing times for arrivals within about 200 no a. from touchdown. This scheduler will sequence aircraft so that they arrive in a first- come - first-served (FCFS) order. While FCFS sequencing establishes a fair order based on estimated times of arrival, it {{does not take into account}} individual airline priorities among incoming flights. NASA is exploring the possibility of allowing airlines to express relative arrival priorities to air traffic management through the development of new CTAS scheduling algorithms which take into consideration airline arrival preferences. The accommodation of airline priorities in arrival sequencing and scheduling would under most circumstances result in a deviation from a "natural" or FCFS arrival order. As a First step toward developing airline influenced sequencing algorithms, an investigation was conducted to determine the feasibility of reordering arrival traffic from a strict FCFS sequence. A fast-time simulation has been developed which allows statistical evaluation of sequencing and scheduling algorithms for arrival traffic at the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport. In contrast to real-time simulation or field tests, which would require on the order of ninety minutes to examine a single traffic rush period, the fast-time simulation allows examination of multiple rush periods in a matter of seconds...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. In today's global {{knowledge}} economy, progressive companies must {{be equipped with}} a good balance of internal knowledge, both in scope and depth, and must adapt to the rapidly changing business environment. The ability of an organisation to manage knowledge as a corporate strategy is becoming a key competitive advantage. The essence of building an organisation's strength or capability in strategic knowledge management is to deepen {{the understanding of the}} exploitation and exploration of knowledge. The impact of strategic knowledge management on organisations embarking on such initiatives will be significant. This is particularly C N C ~w hen organisations are. focusing their efforts on improving the performance of their supply chains. Several organisations, implementing supply chain management improvements, have generated savings of millions of rands. This has prompted the CEO's of organisations to shift from individual company performance to what is called supply chain performance. Supply chain performance refers to the extended supply chain's activities in meeting end-customer requirements, including product <b>availability,</b> <b>on-time</b> delivery, and all the necessary inventory and capacity in the supply chain to deliver that performance in a responsive manner. Supply chain performance crosses company boundaries since it includes basic materials, components, subassemblies and finished products, and distribution through various channels to the end customer. It also crosses traditional functional organisation lines such as procurement, manufacturing, distribution, marketing & sales, and research & development. Therefore, increasing international cooperation, vertical integration, along with a focus on core activities, have led to the notion that fums are links in a networked supply chain. This novel perspective has created the challenge of designing and managing a network of interdependent relationships, developed and fostered through strategic collaboration. Despite various attempts to identify stumbling blocks in the path towards improved performance and competitiveness in the non-ferrous foundry industry, no research attempt has yet been made towards a systematic development of a supply chain management strategy. This study identifies and consolidates various supply chain initiatives and factors to develop key supply chain management constructs conducive to advancing the field in the industry. An extensive literature study was undertaken to identify effective supply chain management practices and to develop constructs {{that could be used in}} the supply chain management strategy. A questionnaire was then developed based on these different constructs and circulated among industry members to determine their perception of the validity and usage of these supply chain management constructs in their own firms. These constructs would then form the basis for the supply chain management strategy. Furthermore, the results were then discussed to identify any shortfalls or areas for improvement and the possible reasons for these shortcomings. It was found that there is a clear shortfall or uncertainty in the use of information technology as a tool to improve the supply chain performance. There was also no clear indication that the respondents knew the benefits that could be realised from using an information system that could supply information from the entire supply chain. Another shortfall that was identified was the willingness to collaborate across the whole supply chain. The respondents were also, very undecided about the use of cross-functional teams, supplier involvement and logistics integration. This paper also describes the characteristics, competitive factors and supply chain management issues related to a non-ferrous foundry as part of the entire supply chain. Despite the industry members Wig aware of most of these issues, there was a clear requirement to integrate these supply chain management processes. The management of knowledge throughout the supply chain was identified as critical to achieving competitive advantage. Master...|$|R
