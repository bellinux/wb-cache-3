5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while {{a thick layer of}} fog rolled <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> Dozens of vehicles including several semi-trailers quickly crashed into each other shortly after 8a.m., one following another in the dense fog, and the accumulating wreckage caught traffic travelling in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, MD71 was {{involved}} in a three-route number change involving highways in three different areas of the state. MD71 was reassigned to the Blue Star Memorial Highway then under construction from Queenstown to the Delaware state line; this designation lasted only three years before U.S.Route301 was rerouted <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> in 1959. MD71 was designated MD194 to match the adjacent numbered highway in Pennsylvania. MD194 had previously been assigned to Flower Avenue in Takoma Park; Flower Avenue was then designated MD787.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the {{granular}} pavement {{section of}} Highway 2 south of Watrous was tested {{with a cold}} in-place recycling or “CIR” method to rehabilitate highways. This CIR process is a cost-effective method which recycles the top surface of a road. This pulverized material is mixed with asphalt emulsion and spread and compacted back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume.|$|E

5|$|In the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} community, NY117 serves the Bedford Hills Metro-North station before widening to four lanes as it crosses the railroad tracks and connects to exit39 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. For the next mile (1.6km), NY117 runs alongside {{the northern edge of}} the Saw Mill River Parkway as it heads through another residential part of Bedford Hills as a two-lane road. At Harris Road, the route turns southeastward, crossing the parkway and the adjacent railroad tracks again as it intersects with the parkway's exit42. NY117's southeastward run on Harris Road ends just past the railroad crossing, where the highway turns northeast onto an unnamed road leading to a commercial and industrial area south of the hamlet of Katonah. After turning <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> NY117 serves various businesses before the route ends at the southbound-only exit43 of the Saw Mill River Parkway. NY117 northbound feeds into the northbound direction of the parkway, while exit43 serves as the start of NY117 southbound.|$|E
25|$|While {{driving his}} 1968 Ford Mustang GT, Bullitt spots the Ross hitmen tailing {{him in a}} 1968 Dodge Charger R/T. He {{maneuvers}} to get behind them, they attempt to flee, and a high-speed muscle car chase ensues through the hilly streets of San Francisco's Russian Hill and out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> ending when the Mustang forces the Charger {{off the road and}} into a gas station, causing a fiery explosion that incinerates the hitmen.|$|E
25|$|Beyond, {{the road}} remains mostly {{straight}} and northwestward, eventually returning to more wooded country along a ridgetop where the southwestern corner of Clarence Fahnestock State Park is nearby. It then turns {{more to the}} west and descends to the intersection with Indian Brook Road, near the Bird and Bottle Inn. From here it parallels nearby Route 9, reaching some more developed areas until it finally ends with a merge <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b>|$|E
50|$|In March 2003, The state DOT rerouted {{the west}} end of NC 24 from US 74 to Interstate 77 (Exit 18). This was {{facilitated}} by following Harris Boulevard in east Charlotte instead of following NC 27. This added nearly 15 mi <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway's</b> length. On December 8, 2008, Interstate 485 opened in Northwest Mecklenburg County; at that same time NC 24 was extended again by 1 mi to the new freeway (Exit 21) along West WT Harris Boulevard.|$|R

25|$|In 1774, when Squire fled a ransacked house, he ran {{straight}} into {{several members of}} the local constabulary and was arrested for highway robbery. This was actually a lucky break. By escaping through the front door, which opened <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> he avoided a more serious charge of stealing. Although Squire was sentenced to be transported to America for 7 years, he elected to serve in the army and returned to Kingston as a free man within 4 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{coup attempt}} was {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} performed by Admiral Hernan Gruber Odreman, the highest-ranking officer among conspirators {{who was supposed to}} capture President Pérez when he returned to Venezuela from Davos. However, he refused after discovering that Rafael Caldera was to become head of the governing board following the coup. A second attempt to capture Pérez was then committed hours later by then Army captain, Miguel Rodríguez Torres. Since Pérez had knowledge of the coup, the president was then driven without the car lights on and his vehicle sped <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> Torres, surprised, then ordered those under his command to fire at President Pérez's fleeing vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Graham Sutherland, who {{had just}} been shot at in his car, {{reversed}} back up the road and drove to the service station close by, where he tried to inform people what was happening. Bryant drove up to the service station and cut off a white Toyota Corolla that was attempting to exit <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> Glenn Pears was driving, with girlfriend Zoe Hall in the passenger seat. Bryant quickly exited the car with his rifle in hand and tried to pull Hall from the car. Pears {{got out of the car}} and approached Bryant. Bryant pointed the gun at Pears and pushed him backwards, eventually directing him into the now open boot of the BMW, locking Pears inside.|$|E

25|$|With the 8th Line Demi-Brigade and 1st Chasseurs à Cheval leading, Richepanse {{seized the}} village of Maitenbeth and {{advanced}} to the main highway. There he confronted elements of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Prince Johann of Liechtenstein's cavalry division. Leaving his two advance units to {{bear the brunt of}} General-major Christian Wolfskeel's cuirassier charges, Richepanse wheeled the 48th Line Demi-Brigade west <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> Aware that this route took him directly into Kollowrat's rear area, he formed the demi-brigade's three battalions side by side with skirmishers protecting the flanks. Hearing firing to the east, Weyrother gathered up three Bavarian battalions from Kollowrat's column and sent them to investigate. These units moved to the southeast and became embroiled in the fight with Drouet. Two more Bavarian battalions under General-major Karl Philipp von Wrede now appeared and blocked Richepanse's path. After a brief fight, the 48th Line overwhelmed Wrede's men and Weyrother fell wounded.|$|E
500|$|A {{thousand}} people, {{mostly black}} school children, awaited the senators outside the Clarksdale Neighborhood Center. Clark climbed {{on top of}} a car to announce that their planned press conference was canceled, as their flight in Memphis was due to take off in two hours for the capital and he was [...] "going to catch that plane." [...] Meanwhile, Kennedy had mounted another vehicle and gave a short speech to the crowd. He said he was glad to have made the trip, and told them, [...] "The problems of poverty are problems of all United States citizens." [...] He was shortly thereafter engulfed by people wanting handshakes and autographs, though police soon cleared the way and the motorcade continued <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> The senators had only been in the city for 20 minutes.|$|E
500|$|While {{traveling}} to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where his family would stay while {{he returned to}} combat in Vietnam, Jabara and his 16-year-old daughter Carol Anne {{died in a car}} accident in Delray Beach, Florida, on 17 November 1966. The Jabara family were in two cars that day, {{on their way to a}} new home in South Carolina where his wife Nina and their children—James Jr., Carol Anne, Jeanne, and Cathy—would reside during Jabara's combat tour. Carol Anne was driving a Volkswagen with her father as a passenger in the back seat. She lost control of the car going through a construction zone, when she initially veered onto a grass median. She swerved back <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> but during the rapid turn, she lost control and the vehicle returned to the median where it rolled several times. Jabara sustained head injuries and was pronounced dead on arrival at a Delray hospital, and Carol Anne died two days later. A memorial service was held for Jabara at Homestead Air Force Base with a missing man formation fly-by. Jabara and his daughter were buried together in a single grave at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

2500|$|After {{firing on}} the police, the gunmen commandeered two Fahd wheeled armored {{personnel}} carriers and attempted {{to break through the}} Kerem Shalom checkpoint into Israel. A few minutes before the gunmen infiltrated across the border, IDF troops received an alert regarding a possible breach of the Egyptian–Israeli border. [...] This followed intelligence informing the IDF that an Egyptian border patrol post had recently been surrounded. [...] One of the APCs was driven into the checkpoint, where it exploded, apparently booby-trapped. The other vehicle crossed into Israel and drove for approximately 100 meters on the highway before encountering troops from the IDF Bedouin Reconnaissance Battalion, which opened fire on the vehicle but failed to stop its advance. [...] The IDF then sent three tanks <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> but the vehicle accelerated away.|$|E

2500|$|The Parkway has two lanes in each direction. Due to its age, it was {{originally}} constructed without the merge-lanes, long on-ramps, and long off-ramps that are found on modern limited-access highways. Some entrances have perilously short and/or sharp ramps; some entrances even have stop signs, with no merge lane whatsoever; this leads to some dangerous entrances <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highway.</b> Most have since been modernized, with the interchange of Route 111 in Trumbull featuring Connecticut's first single point urban interchange (SPUI). The speed limit on the parkway ranges from 45 to 55mph (70 to 90km/h).

50|$|Populations of all six {{species of}} Gopherus have {{declined}} dramatically. In the past, gopher tortoises were hunted for their meat, {{which was used}} in stews. Currently the most significant threat to their survival is habitat destruction, but the pet trade and collisions with vehicles have also taken their toll. To help decrease gopher tortoise death due to collisions with vehicles, the US Department of Transportation in Mississippi has recently placed angled fences along the road side to keep tortoise from wandering <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>highways</b> near their habitats. On November 9, 2009, the US Fish and Wildlife Service proposed rulemaking to include the Eastern Population of the Gopher tortoise, Gopherus polyphemus, in the List of Threatened Wildlife.|$|R
