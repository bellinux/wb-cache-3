5|$|After Lee's surrender, {{a public}} meeting {{was held in}} Shreveport, Louisiana, at which many {{speakers}} supported continuation of the war. Plans were developed for the Davis government to flee to Havana, Cuba. There, the leaders would regroup and head to the Confederate-controlled Trans-Mississippi area by way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande.</b> None of these plans was put into practice.|$|E
5|$|June 30, 2010– Hurricane Alex made {{landfall}} at Soto la Marina, Tamaulipas in Mexico {{as a large}} Category2 hurricane, bringing heavy rains, wind, and tornadoes to South Texas. The hurricane's remnants {{also bring}} heavy rains to portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande,</b> causing it to exceed record levels.|$|E
5|$|Matamoros, Tamaulipas, on the {{southern}} bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande,</b> experienced the hurricane for several days beginning on October2. Along the coast, several ships were wrecked. The Mexican custom house, situated {{at the mouth of}} the river, was destroyed. It was later rebuilt at a more sheltered location farther inland.|$|E
50|$|While the company's {{freight traffic}} {{continued}} to grow, private passenger vehicles and commercial airlines eroded the company's passenger traffic. As a result, May 28, 1967, was <b>the</b> last run <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande's</b> Prospector; July 27, 1967, was <b>the</b> last run <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande's</b> Royal Gorge, and in March 1970, <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande's</b> portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> California Zephyr {{was cut from}} daily to thrice-weekly service.|$|R

The Elephant Butte hydroelectric station is a base load power plant that draws water from the reservoir and has a capacity of 27.95 megawatts.|$|R
5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{thousands}} of oil workers were evacuated from Gulf of Mexico oil rigs. In Del Rio, some highways and roads were closed after the initial flooding, in anticipation of more flooding as the system stalled over the area. Of the 2000 Laredo, Texas residents ordered {{to leave their homes}} in anticipation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> overflowing its banks, only 600 actually did so.|$|E
5|$|Santa Fe County, Texas {{formed in}} 1848 from lands {{claimed by the}} Republic of Texas and ceded by Mexico. It {{included}} a vast area later becoming portions of several states from New Mexico east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> extending northward into south-central Wyoming. Within Texas' modern boundaries, the county included the Trans-Pecos {{and most of the}} Panhandle. The county was abolished when Texas ceded its western lands under the Compromise of 1850.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} included lands {{south of}} the Gila River and west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> which the U.S. acquired {{so that it could}} construct a transcontinental railroad along a deep southern route, which the Southern Pacific Railroad later completed in 1881/1883. The purchase also aimed to reconcile outstanding border issues between the U.S. and Mexico following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the earlier Mexican–American War of 1846–1848.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to tamp down on the unrest, martial law was {{declared}} and military governor General Martín Perfecto de Cos established headquarters in San Antonio de Béxar, stationing his troops at the Alamo. When the Texian volunteer soldiers gained control of the fortress at the Siege of Béxar, compelling Cos to surrender on December 9, many saw his expulsion {{to the other side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> as the end of Mexican forces in Texas. Most Texian soldiers in Béxar left to join a planned invasion of Matamoros, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|After Resaca de la Palma, Mexican {{forces were}} cleared from the Texan side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande,</b> but {{additional}} operations {{were required to}} force Mexico {{to agree to the}} border. The Mexican commander, General Mariano Arista, withdrew his forces to Linares, with Taylor in pursuit for sixty miles before returning to Fort Brown for reinforcements. He then marched against Monterrey. The heavily fortified city had a 10,000-man garrison under Arista's replacement, General Pedro de Ampudia, but its supply line running south to Saltillo was vulnerable. Lacking the heavy artillery needed for a siege, Taylor planned a double envelopment, with one division executing a turning movement to cut the supply line and attack from the west and south, and his other two divisions assaulting {{the north side of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|As Alex neared {{hurricane}} strength on {{the evening}} of June28, a hurricane warning was issued for the coast of Texas south of Baffin Bay to the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande.</b> The Mexican government also issued a hurricane warning from the Rio Grande south to La Cruz. A tropical storm warning was posted for coastal Texas from Baffin Bay northward to Port O'Connor. Governor of Texas Rick Perry declared a state of disaster in 19 counties and ordered the deployment of Texas Military Forces personnel (including 80 citizen-soldiers of the Texas State Guard Medical Brigade) to the Rio Grande Valley. President Barack Obama also declared a state of emergency, freeing federal funds for 25 counties in Texas.|$|E

5|$|As the Racer {{endured the}} gale, another vessel to her north, HMSRingdove, felt the storm {{around the same}} time. Both ships {{recorded}} easterly winds for several days as they traversed the Yucatán Channel, indicating that the storm center remained to their south. The hurricane crossed the northern Yucatán Peninsula and moved west-northwestward across the Gulf of Mexico, nearing the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> by early on October3. The storm is estimated to have peaked as the equivalence of a Category4 or stronger on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson scale. As the hurricane approached a strong high pressure area to the north, it slowed drastically and recurved sharply to the northeast while its center was just off southern Texas.|$|E
5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives {{to go ahead}} with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the Rio Grande managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E
5|$|In late 1866, Napoleon {{tried to}} {{postpone}} the French departure, but the Americans had large numbers of troops on the north bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> and Seward held firm. Napoleon suggested a new Mexican government that would exclude both Maximilian and Juárez; the Americans had recognized Juárez as the legitimate president and were not willing to consider this. In the meantime, Juárez, {{with the help of}} American military aid, was advancing through northeast Mexico. The French withdrew in early 1867, leaving Maximilian, who was soon captured by Juárez's troops. Although both the U.S. and France urged Juárez against it, the deposed emperor was executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867.|$|E

5|$|On August 26, a {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} central Gulf of Mexico. It drifted westward for several days, and by August 30 it intensified into {{a tropical}} storm while turning more southwestward. The storm peaked in intensity as a weak tropical storm shortly thereafter. On August 31 the storm moved inland near the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande,</b> and weakened as it swept inland. Advisories were issued for coastal areas before which strong winds and high tides affected the Texas coast. The cyclone inflicted some property damage in the Brownsville area. Winds unroofed houses at Port Isabel and destroyed some Mexican huts. The storm also blew fishing craft aground. No initial reports of fatalities were received, but two towns were left cut off from communication with Brownsville.|$|E
5|$|The colony faced {{numerous}} difficulties {{during its}} brief existence, including Native American raids, epidemics, and harsh conditions. From that base, La Salle led several expeditions {{to find the}} Mississippi River. These did not succeed, but La Salle did explore much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> and parts of east Texas. During one of his absences in 1686, the colony's last ship was wrecked, leaving the colonists unable to obtain resources from the French colonies of the Caribbean. As conditions deteriorated, La Salle realized the colony could survive only {{with help from the}} French settlements in Illinois Country to the north, along the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers. His last expedition ended along the Brazos River in early 1687, when La Salle and five of his men were murdered during a mutiny.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm was}} tracked {{beginning}} on June30 offshore North Carolina. It moved eastward and was last noted {{on the following}} day. However, no tropical cyclones were reported {{in the remainder of}} July or August. Activity resume when another tropical storm was located southeast of the Bahamas on September6. It intensified into a hurricane before making landfall in North Carolina and was last noted over the north Atlantic Ocean on September17. The SS Central America sank offshore, drowning 424 passengers and crew members. Another hurricane may have existed east of South Carolina between September22 and October26, though little information is available. The final documented tropical cyclone was initially observed east of Lesser Antilles on September24. It traversed the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, striking the Yucatán Peninsula and later Port Isabel, Texas. The storm dissipated on September30. In Texas, damage was reported in several towns near the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> River.|$|E

5|$|France {{formally}} relinquished {{its claim}} to its region of Texas in 1762, when French Louisiana was ceded to the Spanish Empire. The inclusion of Spanish Louisiana into New Spain meant that Texas was no longer essentially a buffer province. The easternmost Texas settlements were disbanded, with the population relocating to San Antonio. However, in 1799 Spain gave Louisiana back to France, and in 1803 Napoléon Bonaparte (and France) sold the territory, known as the Louisiana Purchase, to the United States. U.S. President Thomas Jefferson insisted that the purchase included all land {{to the east of}} the Rocky Mountains and to the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande,</b> although its large southwestern expanse was within New Spain. The dispute was not resolved until the Adams–Onís Treaty compromise in 1819, when Spain ceded Spanish Florida to the United States in return for recognition of the Sabine River as the eastern boundary of Spanish Texas and western boundary of the Missouri Territory. The U.S. claims on the vast Spanish territories west of the Sabine River into Santa Fe de Nuevo México province (New Mexico).|$|E
5|$|Once {{over the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico, the storm shifted its course to the west-southwest and {{gradually}} recovered its intensity. The {{path of the}} storm brought it close to the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> in early August. Few ships encountered the small storm as it regained hurricane status on August4, just aday before striking northern Mexico with winds of 90mph (145km/h)—making it close to a modern-day Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Striking close to {{the border between the}} United States and Mexico, the storm caused extensive damage in both countries. Winds damaged buildings and crops in Tamaulipas and the southern regions of Texas, with heavy losses to citrus production in the Rio Grande Valley. While only oneperson died in the United States, heavy rains led to catastrophic flooding that claimed at least 31lives in northern Mexico; the worst-hit areas were in and near the city of Monterrey. While monetary losses in Mexico were unclear, the storm did at least $3,000,000 in damages in the United States, measured in contemporary U.S. dollars.|$|E
5|$|The National Hurricane Center began issuing {{hurricane}} warnings {{early on}} August 14, anticipating that Beryl would reach hurricane strength. The warnings were issued along the Texas coast from Baffin Bay to the United StatesMexico border. The Government of Mexico issued hurricane warnings from the borderline south to La Pesca. The hurricane warnings issued stretched for 230miles (370km) along the coast. Mexico also issued {{a tropical storm}} warning south of La Pesca to Tampico. A storm surge of 2 to 5feet (0.6m to 1.5m) was expected along the coast near and {{to the north of}} Beryl’s center. Rainfall between 5 and 10inches (125 to 250mm) were also expected. Thousands of residents in coastal areas of southern Texas and northern Mexico were asked {{to pay attention to the}} hurricane warnings and to move towards higher ground. The National Weather Service warned the cities of Cameron and Kenedy, and Willacy County in southern Texas that severe flooding is the deadliest threat associated with the storm. In low-lying rural areas near the mouth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande,</b> an estimated 20,000 residents were urged to seek shelter, as the inadequate drainage in these areas make them in danger to severe flooding. The National Weather Service also warned of possible tornadoes forming when associated with thunderstorms and tropical storm generated winds. Authorities in southern Texas filled 20,000 sandbags along the shores, and closed government offices. Residents nailed plywood on windows, parks were temporarily closed, and documents were transferred to waterproof storage areas.|$|E
