5|$|A {{group of}} Louisville Democrats, {{supporters}} of U. S. Senator Jo Blackburn, {{made the first}} formal calls for a new convention. A short time after, a large meeting at Mount Sterling gave the movement a definite form. They called for a meeting in Lexington on August 2 to organize {{the details of a}} new convention. At subsequent mass meetings, it was announced that former governor John Y. Brown would accept the nomination of a second convention, should <b>one</b> <b>be</b> held. As Brown had been thought to be a supporter of Goebel, this announcement caused no small stir among Democrats. Representatives of sixty counties attended the August 2 meeting in Lexington. Resolutions endorsing the Democratic platform from the 1896 Democratic National Convention and the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan in 1900 were adopted. Then, ex-governor Brown addressed the crowd. Finally, the representatives agreed to a nominating convention to be held on August 16.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Gallipoli Campaign {{had ended}} and the AIF in Egypt {{was in the process}} of {{doubling}} in size from two divisions to four. Birdwood wished to appoint two British generals to command the new divisions, but Senator Pearce opposed this, ordering that <b>one</b> <b>be</b> given to McCay. On 22 March 1916, McCay arrived back in Egypt to assume command of the 5th Division. He found that General Headquarters, Egyptian Expeditionary Force had ordered II Anzac Corps, of which the 5th Division was a part, to replace I Anzac Corps in the defence of the Suez Canal. Owing to a shortage of rolling stock, the 4th and 5th Divisions were ordered to undertake a three-day route march across the desert under service conditions, carrying their packs and weapons. This proved to be a greater test of staff and troops than anticipated, and many men dropped from thirst or exhaustion. Many of his men blamed McCay for subjecting them to such a humiliating and severe trial.|$|E
5|$|The first {{plans for}} an airport serving Notodden were {{launched}} in 1954 by Reidar Hedwig-Dahl, director of the tourist office. In late 1954 or early 1955, he held a meeting with Ludvig G. Braathen, owner of Braathens SAFE, and representatives for his airline. They saw Notodden as a possible gateway to Telemark and Braathen promised to start flying to an airport serving Notodden, should <b>one</b> <b>be</b> built. At the time, Braathen had started flying to several smaller airports in Norway using a fleet of de Havilland Heron aircraft. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that he wanted more but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Røros.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, Ferrari {{was called}} to assist a {{military}} wife during childbirth at the Hospital Militar Central of Buenos Aires, which had no gynecological unit. After she proposed that <b>one</b> <b>be</b> developed, Ferrari started the facility with one bed and donated equipment and supplies. The military gazette began advertising from June of that year that gynecological services were available from Mondays to Fridays at the hospital. As military wives {{became aware of the}} services, the growth was exponential and within five years Ferrari had expanded the service to two floors that housed a maternity unit with two delivery rooms, their own sterilization facility, a recovery unit, and forty beds in private rooms. She also developed a small sealed room with purified air and an incubator, {{the first of its kind}} in Argentina. Ferrari brought the techniques she had learned abroad to Argentina. Though radiology had been performed in other parts of the world for decades, there was resistance to implementing it by professionals who had no experience with it. Ferrari insisted it should be introduced and fought against the previous practice of surgical solutions for all cases, advocating that surgery only be used when absolutely necessary. A commemoration for the 10th anniversary of the maternity unit was attended by the Minister of War, the Director General of Health, the Hospital Director and other senior officials, as well as by children born over the past 10 years together with their families. A commission of the Marine wives who had received service from Ferrari's unit made a substantial donation. Despite her success, the atmosphere at the hospital remained hostile. Following the 1930 coup d'état of José Félix Uriburu with the country's shift to a more conservative stance during the Infamous Decade, Ferrari ultimately was forced to leave the hospital in 1939.|$|E

25|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of First Division Chelsea in June 1952. Upon Drake's arrival at Chelsea, {{he made a}} series of sweeping changes, doing much to rid the club of its previous amateurish, music hall image. He discarded the club's Chelsea pensioner crest and with it the Pensioners nickname, and insisted a new <b>one</b> <b>be</b> adopted. From these changes came the Lion Rampant Regardant crest and the Blues nickname. He introduced scouting reports and a new, tougher, training regime based on ballwork, a rare practice in English football at the time. The club's previous policy of signing unreliable big-name players was abandoned; Drake instead used his knowledge of the lower divisions and the amateur game to recruit little-known, but more reliable, players such as John McNichol, Frank Blunstone, Derek Saunders, Jim Lewis and Peter Sillett.|$|E
25|$|The canals of Lake Xochimilco were {{initially}} created along with artificial agricultural plots called chinampas. Chinampas were invented by the pre-Hispanic {{peoples of the}} region around 1,000 year ago {{as a way to}} increase agricultural production. On the shallow waters of the lakes, rafts were constructed of juniper branches. Onto these rafts floating on the water, lakebed mud and soil were heaped and crops planted. These rafts, tied to juniper trees, would eventually sink and a new <b>one</b> <b>be</b> built to replace it. Over time, these sunken rafts would form square or rectangular islands, held in place in part by the juniper trees. As these chinampa islands propagated, areas of the lake were reduced to canals. These “floating gardens” were {{an important part of the}} economy of the Aztec Empire by the time the Spanish arrived.|$|E
25|$|The Carlin bill {{began moving}} through the House in January 1915. But House members balked at the cost. Garrison tried to break the {{deadlock}} on January 9 by issuing a report that declared the existing bridge unsafe, and requesting that the new <b>one</b> <b>be</b> built in the same location. The D.C. Commissioners said {{the location of the}} bridge was up to them, and the Corps warned that not only could the existing bridge not be enlarged but agreed with Garrison that it was structurally unsound. Swanson changed his mind, and agreed in January 1916 that the new bridge should be built on the existing site. Garrison endorsed the Carlin bill on January 27. On February 3, 1916, vehicular traffic over Aqueduct Bridge was limited by the city to a single automobile at a time due to its dangerous nature. The House passed legislation appropriating $1.175 million for construction of a new bridge on March 6. D.C. commissioners held hearings on the bridge site in late March, and approved the site in early April. The Senate passed some minor amendments to the House bill, and after some legislative discussions and a conference committee, the Carlin bill passed Congress on May 2, 1916. President Woodrow Wilson signed the legislation on May 19.|$|E

25|$|The school {{itself has}} had a long and tumultuous history. The several {{attempts}} to establish a secondary school in town failed before the founding of the high school. Among the failed schools were: Barnstable Academy 1837; Hyannis High School, 1837; and the Hyannis Seminary, 1849. These schools were mostly run with private funds. There was the feeling though that these schools were insufficient and there was a consensus that a town funded high school should be established. In 1871, it was voted that a high school would be established in West Barnstable and Centerville. In 1872, it was voted that another <b>one</b> <b>be</b> established in Hyannis. A struggle ensued among the three villages on who would get the school. Centerville soon dropped out and this led to a compromise being reached between the two villages. It turned out that Hyannis started classes in 1873, maintaining the school until 1876. Barnstable then oversaw the school from 1876–1879. In 1879, the school moved permanently back to Hyannis. As a result of these moves in location, the first graduating class occurred in 1883. This was caused because when the school would move, the students from which the school was originally located would drop out and the students in the new location would join the school. The first class originally included two people, Miss Phoebee Crowell and Miss Nellie Coleman. Class sizes grew slowly from there. In 1890, the class size was four. The 1895, eleven; 1900, fourteen; 1905, fifteen; 1920, twenty-two. From 1920 on, the classes grew steadily until the first class of over 100, the class of 1949 was graduated.|$|E

500|$|In 1869, John William Fenton, {{a visiting}} Irish {{military}} band leader, {{realized there was}} no national anthem in Japan, and suggested to Iwao Ōyama, {{an officer of the}} Satsuma Clan, that <b>one</b> <b>be</b> created. Ōyama agreed, and selected the lyrics. The lyrics may have been chosen for their similarity to the British national anthem, due to Fenton's influence. After selecting the anthem's lyrics, Ōyama then asked Fenton to create the melody. After being given just two to three weeks to compose the melody and only a few days to rehearse, Fenton debuted the anthem before the Japanese Emperor in 1870. This was the first version of [...] "Kimigayo". This was discarded because the melody [...] "lacked solemnity", according to the Japanese government although others believe it is because the melody was actually [...] "unsingable" [...] for the Japanese. However, this version is still performed annually at the Myōkōji temple in Yokohama, where Fenton served as a military band leader. Myōkōji serves as a memorial to him.|$|E
500|$|Many of Auden's poems {{during the}} 1930s and after were {{inspired}} by unconsummated love, and in the 1950s he summarised his emotional life in a famous couplet: [...] "If equal affection cannot be / Let the more loving <b>one</b> <b>be</b> me" [...] ("The More Loving One"). He had a gift for friendship and, starting in the late 1930s, a strong wish for the stability of marriage; {{in a letter to}} his friend James Stern he called marriage [...] "the only subject." [...] Throughout his life, Auden performed charitable acts, sometimes in public (as in his 1935 marriage of convenience to Erika Mann that provided her with a British passport to escape the Nazis), but, especially in later years, more often in private. He was embarrassed if they were publicly revealed, as when his gift to his friend Dorothy Day for the Catholic Worker movement was reported on the front page of The New York Times in 1956.|$|E
