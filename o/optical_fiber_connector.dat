50|$|An <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>connector</b> terminates {{the end of}} {{an optical}} fiber, and enables quicker {{connection}} and disconnection than splicing. The connectors mechanically couple and align the cores of fibers so light can pass. Better connectors lose very little light due to reflection or misalignment of the fibers. In all, about 100 fiber optic connectors have been introduced to the market.|$|E
5000|$|For indoor applications, the {{jacketed}} fiber {{is generally}} enclosed, with {{a bundle of}} flexible fibrous polymer strength members like aramid (e.g. Twaron or Kevlar), in a lightweight plastic cover to form a simple cable.

50|$|Field-mountable {{optical fiber}} {{connectors}} {{are used to}} join optical fiber jumper cables that contain one singlemode fiber. These assemblies can be separated into two major categories: single-jointed connector assemblies and multiple-jointed connector assemblies. According to Telcordia GR-1081, a single-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is only one}} spot where two different fibers are joined together. This is the situation generally found when connector assemblies are made from factory-assembled <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>connector</b> plugs. A multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly where {{there is more than one}} closely spaced connection joining different fibers together. An example of a multiple-jointed connector assembly is a connector assembly that uses the stub-fiber type of connector plug.|$|E

5000|$|TOSLINK (from Toshiba Link) is a {{standardized}} <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>connector</b> system. Also known generically as an [...] "optical audio cable" [...] or just [...] "optical cable", its most common use is in consumer audio equipment (via a [...] "digital optical" [...] socket), where it carries a digital audio stream from components such as CD and DVD players, DAT recorders, computers, and modern video game consoles, to an AV receiver that can decode two channels of uncompressed lossless PCM audio or compressed 5.1/7.1 surround sound such as Dolby Digital Plus or DTS-HD High Resolution Audio. Unlike HDMI, TOSLINK {{does not have}} the bandwidth to carry the lossless versions of Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, or more than two channels of PCM audio.|$|E
50|$|Mini-TOSLINK is a {{standardized}} <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>connector</b> {{smaller than the}} standard square TOSLINK connector commonly used in larger consumer audio equipment. The plug is almost {{the same size and}} shape as the ubiquitous 3.5 mm stereo minijack. Adapters are available to connect a full-size TOSLINK plug to a mini-TOSLINK socket. Combined 3.5 mm jack and mini-TOSLINK sockets exist which can accept a 3.5 mm jack or a mini-TOSLINK plug; mini-TOSLINK plugs are made 0.5 mm longer than electrical jack plugs so that the latter are too short to touch and damage the LED of combined connectors. Many laptop computer and portable digital audio equipment models, such as the Google Chromecast Audio device and Apple AirPort Express and iPod Hi-Fi, use these connectors that allow for the insertion of 3.5 mm analog (electrical) headphone output or microphone input or mini-TOSLINK digital (optical) output.|$|E
50|$|In {{fiber optics}} and telecommunications, an index-matching {{material}} {{may be used}} in conjunction with pairs of mated connectors or with mechanical splices to reduce signal reflected in the guided mode (known as return loss) (see: <b>Optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>connector).</b> Without the use of an index-matching material, Fresnel reflections will occur at the smooth end faces of a fiber unless there is no fiber-air interface or other significant mismatch in refractive index. These reflections may be as high as -14 dB (i.e., 14 dB below the optical power of the incident signal). When the reflected signal returns to the transmitting end, it may be reflected again and return to the receiving end at a level that is (28 plus twice the fiber loss) dB below the direct signal. The reflected signal will also be delayed by twice the delay time introduced by the fiber. The twice-reflected, delayed signal superimposed on the direct signal may noticeably degrade an analog baseband intensity-modulated video signal. Conversely, for digital transmission, the reflected signal will often have no practical effect on the detected signal seen at the decision point of the digital optical receiver except in marginal cases where bit-error ratio is significant. However, certain digital transmitters such as those employing a Distributed Feedback Laser may be affected by back reflection and then fall outside specifications such as Side Mode Suppression Ratio, potentially degrading system bit error ratio, so networking standards intended for DFB lasers may specify a back-reflection tolerance such as -10 dB for transmitters so that they remain within specification even without index matching. This back-reflection tolerance might be achieved using an optical isolator or by way of reduced coupling efficiency.|$|E

In this study, {{in contrast to the}} contradiction between penetration depth and analyte diameter of optical fiber probe-based evanescent wave, we demonstrate that double-taper optical fiber used in a radiation wave-based all-fiber immunofluorescence biosensor (RWAIB) can detect micron-scale analytes using Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 as representative target. Finite-difference time-domain method was used to compare the properties of evanescent wave and radiation wave (RW). Ray-tracing model was formulated to optimize the taper geometry of the probe. Based on a commercial multi-mode fiber, a double-taper probe was fabricated and connected with biosensor through a "ferrule connector" <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>connector.</b> The RWAIB configuration was accomplished using commercial multi-mode fibers and fiber-based devices according to the "all-fiber" method.

Quantitation could be achieved within the concentration range of 10 (3) cfu · mL(- 1) to 107 cfu · mL(- 1). No non-specific recognition to ten kinds of food-borne pathogens was observed.

30|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that zirconia is really remarkable {{for a wide range}} and combination of physical and mechanical properties, such as high fracture toughness; high strength and hardness; biocompatibility; ionic conductivity; radiation and chemical resistance [1]. A lot of properties combined in one material, zirconia. It is possible due to the ability of zirconia to phase transformations [2]. Zirconia can exist in three states: a monoclinic state, a tetragonal state, and a cubic state. These states can be stabilized by adding such additives as Y 2 O 3, MgO, CaO [3]. Yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia (Y-TZP) has been known as an important structural ceramic and is used for products of grinding media, the <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>connector</b> and precision parts. In all cases of using zirconia nanopowders, the producer of ceramics parts need to know the optimal pressure-temperature-time regimes for obtaining dense or porous nanostructure ceramics. The advantage of nanopowders is the possibility of low temperature sintering and as a result the ceramic structure homogeneity. It is known that granulometric (size and shape of particles and the size of aggregates and agglomerates), phase and chemical composition of starting powders as well as the same characteristic of agglomeration as agglomerate “hardness” determine the compactions and sintering regime. The agglomeration is conditioned by van der Waals forces between particles. If these forces are weak the agglomerates are referred to as “soft” agglomerates. These agglomerates can be easily broken in a liquid medium by ultrasonic, or/and dispersants additions. In contrast, strong forces between particles due to high temperature calcinations or incorrect chemical additions result in “hard” agglomerates. In this case, it is too high to realize the benefits of the nanosized primary crystallites. The high sintering temperature leads to bimodal grain size distribution and phase separation in zirconia ceramics. The prevention of hard agglomeration is a one of the basic aims in nanopowders synthesis process as well as uniform particles shape and narrow size distribution [2].|$|E
40|$|The Diamond AVIM <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>connector</b> {{has been}} used for over a decade in flight environments. AVIM which stands for Aviation Intermediate Maintenance is always {{referenced}} as a fiber optic connector type from the DIN (Deutsches Institut fur Normung) family of optical fiber connectors. The newly available Mini AVIM and DMI (Definition Multimedia Interface) connectors also by Diamond provide similar features as the high performance AVIM with the added benefits of being small form factor for board mount and internal box use where long connectors and strain relief can not be accommodated. Transceiver, fiber laser technology and receiver optic technology based on small sized constraints will benefit the most by the reduction in connector form factor. It {{is for this reason that}} the Mini AVIM is being evaluated for multimode and single mode optical fiber use in both fiber based and cable based packaging configurations. In a fiber based termination, there are no cable materials to bond to the connector. The only bonding that is conducted is the mounting of the fiber with epoxy to the connector ferrules (which are called DMI ferrules). In a cable configuration, the compatibility of the connector subcomponents along with the upjacketing materials of the cable around the fiber needs to be considered carefully for termination fabrication. Cabled terminations will show greater insertion loss and high probability of failures during thermal cycling testing. This is due to the stressing of the combination of materials that each have different Coefficients of Thermal Expansion (CTE's) and that are bonded together to the connector subcomponents. As the materials flex during thermal excursions, forces are applied to the termination and can make the system fail if the grouping of materials (per their CTE's) are not compatible and this includes cable materials, epoxies, ferrule and connector body components. For this evaluation, multimode 100 micron core step index fiber was used for the fiber terminated condition, and single mode SMF- 28 upjacketed with W. L. Gore Flexlite was used for the cabled configuration. For background purposes, a comparison is presented here for information purposes between the high performance AVIM connector features and the Mini AVIM small form factor connectors. Basic connector features are described here...|$|E
