5|$|A German photographer, Astrid Kirchherr, {{asked if}} they wouldn't mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups <b>only</b> <b>had</b> snapshots taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs in der Dom, a municipal park, close to the Reeperbahn. In the afternoon Kirchherr took them to her mother's house in Altona, minus Best, who decided not to attend. Dot Rhone, McCartney's girlfriend at the time who later visited Hamburg, described Best as being very quiet and never taking part in conversations with the group.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 54,800 beds were {{available}} in Palestine and Egypt, including convalescence and clearing hospitals; 22,524 beds were made available in Egypt, and a hospital centre in the Deir el Belah and Gaza region, along with stationary hospitals between Kantara and Ludd, could accommodate another 15,000 casualties. No. 14 Australian General Hospital on the Suez Canal was full of malaria cases from the Jordan Valley with the overflow in the No. 31 British General Hospital at Abbassia, Cairo. The Australian Stationary Hospital at Mosacar <b>only</b> <b>had</b> a few beds available.|$|E
5|$|Abandoning {{their usual}} {{strategy}} {{of trying to}} make major inroads in Liberal-dominated Quebec, the Tories focused on winning seats in the other provinces. They were successful; though they gained few seats in Quebec, they won 112seats overall to the Liberals' 105. With the remaining seats won by other parties, the PC party <b>only</b> <b>had</b> a plurality in the House of Commons, but the margin was sufficient to make John Diefenbaker Canada's first Tory Prime Minister since 1935.|$|E

5|$|After the Morea {{military}} expedition, the Greeks <b>only</b> <b>had</b> to {{face the}} Turkish troops in Central Greece. Livadeia, gateway to Boeotia, was conquered {{at the beginning of}} November 1828. A counterattack by Mahmud Pasha from Euboea was repulsed in January 1829. In April, Naupaktos was restored to the Greeks; in May, Augustinos Kapodistrias recaptured the symbolic town of Messolonghi. However, it took the military victory of Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29 and the Treaty of Adrianople before the independence of Greece was recognised.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard {{how he could}} have made that $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid <b>only</b> <b>had</b> to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he <b>only</b> <b>had</b> to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Navy {{went into}} a period of decline. In 1864, the Navy had 51,500men in uniform, and almost 700 ships and about 60 monitor-type coastal ironclads which made the U.S. Navy the second {{largest in the world}} after the Royal Navy. By 1880 the Navy <b>only</b> <b>had</b> 48 ships in commission, 6,000 men, and the ships and shore {{facilities}} were decrepit but Congress saw no need to spend money to improve them. The Navy was unprepared to fight a major maritime war before 1897.|$|E

Carlsen won two games, against Gelfand and Nakamura, and drew the rest. Although he finished equal on points with Aronian, he placed ahead since the tiebreak {{was determined by the}} number of black games; Carlsen had five black games, while Aronian <b>only</b> <b>had</b> four.|$|E
5|$|As {{the land}} fraud trials reached their conclusion, {{attention}} also {{turned to the}} Southern Pacific Railroad (which had acquired the O in 1887). Not <b>only</b> <b>had</b> the company violated {{the terms of the}} grant agreement, but in 1903, declared it was terminating land sales—in violation of the grant agreement—either as a hedge against future increases in land values or to retain the timber profits for itself.|$|E
5|$|Ayers Rock's {{treatment}} by Australian radio stations during the 1970s {{was related to}} the popularity of AM. Unlike the US, which had a vibrant FM radio scene, in 1976 Australia <b>only</b> <b>had</b> ABC FM and a few community FM stations which primarily played classical music. Commercial AM stations, playing pop and rock music, dominated the local airwaves. The group established their reputation with live performances, exposure in print media, and word of mouth, with minimal Australian radio promotion.|$|E

5|$|Before the Austro-Turkish {{war and the}} 1698 Great Fire, Skopje was one of {{the biggest}} cities in the Balkans, with a {{population}} estimated between 30,000 and 60,000 inhabitants. After the fire, it experienced a long period of decline and <b>only</b> <b>had</b> 10,000 inhabitants in 1836. However, the population started to rise again after 1850 and reached 32,000 inhabitants in 1905. In the 20th century, Skopje {{was one of the}} fastest growing cities in Yugoslavia and it has 448,200 inhabitants in 1971. Since then, the demographic growth has continued at a steady pace.|$|E
5|$|Burnside, {{against the}} advice of the president, prematurely {{launched}} an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was stunningly defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December. Not <b>only</b> <b>had</b> Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in Joseph Hooker, despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|Christologically Maximus {{insisted on}} a strict dyophysitism, which {{can be seen as}} a {{corollary}} of the emphasis on theosis. In terms of salvation, humanity is intended to be fully united with God. This is possible for Maximus because God was first fully united with humanity in the incarnation. If Christ did not become fully human (if, for example, he <b>only</b> <b>had</b> a divine and not a human will), then salvation was no longer possible, as humanity could not become fully divine.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the number}} of GPUs in the system, its initial boot was unsuccessful. This was because its {{motherboard}} uses a 32 bit BIOS, which <b>only</b> <b>had</b> approximately 3 GB of address space for the video cards. However, Asus managed to provide them a specialized BIOS that entirely skipped the address space allocation of the GTX 295 video cards. The BIOS-replacement coreboot was not tested.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I, {{and the development of}} the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen <b>only</b> <b>had</b> to follow. The guns were fired simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Queen Mary received her director before the Battle of Jutland.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine was a British Fort ship {{which was}} built in Canada in 1942.
