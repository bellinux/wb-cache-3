40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three substantial chapters on topics related to <b>occupational</b> and industrial <b>mobility.</b> Using quarterly data of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) from 1992 to 2013, Chapter 2 documents the mobility across occupations and industries (referred to as career change). The findings suggest that <b>occupational</b> and industrial <b>mobility</b> are surprisingly high. Both <b>occupational</b> and industrial <b>mobility</b> are procyclical. The majority of instances of career change are associated with wage growth. During an expansion, a career changer's wage grows more than someone who stays in their career. However, this does not apply if the career changer was unemployed and then hired during a recession. The evidence suggests that career mobility during a business cycle is important for understanding the labour market flows and wage growth. The use of interviewing method may affect {{the accuracy of the}} data. The dependent interviewing is introduced in the survey, and is helpful in reducing the measurement errors. Chapter 3 uses data from British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and UK Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS) to examine the robustness of the results obtained by using LFS. The procyclicality of <b>occupational</b> and industrial <b>mobility</b> are reassured when the change of interviewing method is controlled for. The further detailed occupational and industrial classification is applied, and the pro-cyclicality of <b>occupational</b> and industrial <b>mobility</b> is found in the further detailing of classifications. Given the solid evidence found in Chaper 2 and 3, Chapter 4 develops a theoretical model to understand the mechanism of workers' reallocation. Aggregate productivity shock, sectoral productivity shock and preference shock are included in order to investigate reallocation through business cycle, net mobility and gross mobility respectively. This model shows the procyclicality of gross mobility between sectors, which is consistent with the findings in Chapter 2 and 3. This chapter also explains the higher level of unemployment during recession. This thesis undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the <b>occupational</b> and industrial <b>mobility</b> in the UK using both empirical and theoretical methods.

40|$|In this study, job {{structure}} is assessed {{in terms of}} workers' <b>occupational</b> status and <b>mobility.</b> Job quality is accounted for in this process {{on the basis of}} workers' perceptions of their skill requirements and job security, and {{on the basis of their}} level of intrinsic interest. The findings indicate that respondents perceive their skill requirements and job security in ways that do not necessarily correspond with their <b>occupational</b> status or <b>mobility.</b> They also indicate no strong correlation between respondents' <b>occupational</b> status or <b>mobility</b> and their intrinsic interest. Given these findings, the issue is that one cannot evaluate jobs on a variety of dimensions and assume that these measure desirability.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role played}} by identity, or a sense of belonging to a home community, in determining <b>occupational</b> choice and <b>mobility.</b> The analysis links competition between migrant networks in the Midwest when it was rst developing, and the in-group identity that emerged endogenously to support these networks, to institutional participation and occupational choice today. Individuals born in counties with greater ethnic fractionalization in 1860, where identity was more likely to have emerged, are (i) significantly more likely to participate in institutions such as churches and parochial schools that transmit identity {{from one generation to the}} next, and (ii) significantly less likely to select into mobile skilled occupations 150 years later. The effect of historical fractionalization on participation in these socializing institutions actually grows stronger over the course of the twentieth century, emphasizing the idea that small initial differences in identity can have large long-term effects on institutions and economic choices. identity, institutional persistence, networks, <b>occupational</b> choice, <b>mobility...</b>|$|R

Obtaining more education and skills appear to be viable mechanisms for at least some migrant peasant workers to achieve higher occupational or social status in the city.

One {{solution to this}} constraint {{is to try to}} construct the desired data using information from multiple data sources and prior information.

This paper attempts to broaden the applications and generalize the solution by extending the model-based approach to incomplete data analysis advocated by Willekens (1982). The log-linear model is presented here as a flexible platform for incomplete data analysis and a path diagram describes several alternative modeling approaches; different paths are determined by the level of available information.

50|$|The demand theory {{partially}} holds {{as there}} were women who worked pre-war time for <b>occupational</b> and wage <b>mobility</b> opportunities. However, these experienced women workers voluntarily quit working more than housewives did. The reason is work-experienced women had many opportunities.

50|$|Another {{issue with}} {{temporary}} migrants is the limited mobility afforded to them {{within the confines}} of their stipulated contracts.

However, due to the live-in requirement and the length of the LCP contract, deskilling occurs, wherein educational qualifications and training once held by immigrants prior to entering the program are not utilized or developed. This leads to downward <b>occupational</b> <b>mobility</b> as re-entry into the labour market with a skilled position becomes difficult upon the end of the contract, and once permanent residency is achieved.|$|E

50|$|Duncanâ€™s {{best known}} {{work is a}} 1967 book that he coauthored with Peter Blau and Andrea Tyree, The American Occupational Structure.

The bookâ€™s impact went far beyond its analyses of <b>occupational</b> <b>mobility.</b> Using survey data and statistical techniques, it showed how an important sociological topic could be analyzed effectively and rigorously with appropriate quantitative methods. The work helped inspire a new generation of sociologists to pursue quantitative sociology.

50|$|Over the years, {{there has}} been a decline in the {{occurrence}} of child marriages but it is lower in case of females than males. The trend of child marriages has been a major cause of girls' illiteracy or lower level of education. It can also damage the girls physical, mental and social health leading to serious health issues in the future. Prenatal, neonatal, and maternal health problems are also tied to women married before the age of 18. It is also evident that child marriages are widely prevalent among cultivators and laborers. Dependency on elders and lack of independent occupational aspirations or <b>occupational</b> <b>mobility</b> further hampers the efforts of limiting child marriages.As a result, child marriages, particularly in the rural areas of Pakistan, continue to take place. There are, however, spatial trends as indicated by different trends of distinct villages. Big farmers seem to be gradually doing away with child marriages; and it remains more concentrated among the landless farmers and laborers. Exposure to urban areas has helped in reduction of child marriage; and finally, realization of bad effects of child marriages has positive relationship with reduction in child marriage indicating thereby a positive role of general understanding and awareness which is spreading quite fast.|$|E
5000|$|Denise Segura {{argues that}} the social {{inequality}} women of color face cannot be properly explained by an analysis {{any one of the}} facets that constitute triple oppression, because their subordination in social hierarchies is relative to men, white people, and higher-income strata. Chicana, or Mexican-American, women are subject to inequality in the home as well as in social contexts, such as the labor force. The relegation of women and minorities to traditionally low-paying jobs has made it so that Chicanas do not have many options for work outside of agriculture or domesticity, areas characterized by low wages and, therefore, low status. Discrimination based on race and gender and a reluctance to acculturate inhibit <b>occupational</b> <b>mobility.</b> Cultural cues and high fertility also encourage Mexican-American women to remain in the home and bear children instead of participating in the work force. The combination of race and gender bias and the inability to obtain white-collar jobs form the basis for the triple oppression felt by Mexican-American women. In turn, triple oppression limits Chicanasâ€™ employment opportunities to low wages, lower than her male (Chicano) and white (women) counterparts, and [...] "secondary" [...] jobs e.g. clerical and factory jobs, effectively solidifying their status {{at the bottom of the}} social hierarchy.|$|E

MethodThe program, which involved a computer system regulating the presentation of auditory or visual cues and the delivery of preferred stimulation, was introduced according to a non-concurrent multiple baseline design across participants.

Preferred stimulation was available to the participants for collecting and for depositing the objects. ResultsDuring the program, all participants had an increase in their independent responses of collecting objects and transporting them to the final destination.

30|$|Zora {{represents}} the first type of family relations, associated with intergenerational preservation of high social status {{in spite of}} parental initial <b>occupational</b> downward <b>mobility</b> due to the migration process. Mother and daughter agree in describing the mode of parentâ€“child interactions as authoritative; in this climate the parents provided a strong psychological support to their daughter in her school career and mobilised both family-internal and family-external resources when deemed necessary. The parents were also capable to stand by the young woman, when they asserted themselves in the relations with the teacher. Finally they exerted a watchful control over her company: this form of social control proved important to her academic success (Coleman 1988). This is clearly different from the protective parenting style identified by Nauck (1999) as distinctive in Turkish families in Germany or by Domenech-Rodriguez et al. in Latino families in the United States.|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} how {{the gendered}} and classed positions of migrant women explain {{the meanings of}} becoming an entrepreneur {{and the role of}} their spouses in their occupational trajectories. Using a translocational positionality approach, the article challenges the claim that women escape patriarchal domination by establishing their own businesses. The narratives of 35 Latin American women entrepreneurs in Spain reveal that becoming an entrepreneur is conditioned by class-based ideas of masculinity and femininity. I argue that middle-class Latin American immigrant women become entrepreneurs to promote their spouseâ€™s career advancement while conforming to class-based norms of femininity. In contrast, lower class Latin American women view the business as a space of autonomy and <b>occupational</b> upward <b>mobility</b> that nevertheless also complies with working-class definitions of femininity. The policy implications of these findings relate to making class aspirations central to the support of labour market integration and empowerment of migrant women. <br/...|$|R
