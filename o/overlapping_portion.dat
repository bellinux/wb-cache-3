40|$|Despite {{their success}} as primary {{treatment}} for vascular diseases, Nitinol peripheral stents are still affected by complications related to fatigue failure. Hip and knee movements during daily activities produce large and cyclic deformations of the superficial femoral artery, that concomitant {{to the effects}} of pulsatile blood pressure, may cause fatigue failure in the stent. Fatigue failure typically occurs in cases of very extended lesions, which often require the use of two or more overlapping stents. In this study, finite element models were used to study the fatigue behavior of Nitinol stents when subjected to cyclic axial compression in different conditions. A specific commercial Nitinol stent was chosen for the analysis and subjected to cyclic axial compression typical of the femoral vascular region. Three different configurations were investigated: stent alone, stent deployed in a tube, and two overlapping stents deployed in a tube. Results confirm that stent oversizing has an influence in determining both the mean and amplitude strains induced in the stent and {{plays an important role in}} determining the fatigue response of Nitinol stents. In case of overlapping stents, numerical results suggest higher amplitude strains concentrate in the region close to the <b>overlapping</b> <b>portion</b> where the abrupt change in stiffness causes higher cyclic compression.

Optical microscopy shows that failure of hair-hairspray junctions is usually adhesive failure rather than cohesive failure of the resin itself.

However, movements during gait produce large and cyclic deformations of the superficial femoral artery, increasing {{the risk of}} fatigue fracture of implanted stents.

In this study, finite element models were used to study the fatigue behavior of overlapped Nitinol stents. Two different approaches were adopted: i) simulating the deployment of a stent into another stent and ii) using a single stent with double stiffness in the overlapping region. Simulations of cyclic axial compression of stents deployed in a simplified cylindrical model of a peripheral artery were then performed (Ansys Inc., Canonsburg, PA, USA). Fatigue risk was assessed on the basis of amplitudes (εI a) and mean values (εI m) of the cyclic first principal strain through the stent.

40|$|We {{characterize}} {{the function of}} MHC molecules by the sets of pathogens that they recognize, which we call their “recognition sets. ” Two features of the MHC–pathogen interaction may be important {{to the theory of}} polymorphism construction at MHC loci: First, there may be a large degree of overlap, or degeneracy, among the recognition sets of MHC molecules. Second, when infected with a pathogen, an MHC genotype may have a higher fitness if that pathogen belongs to the <b>overlapping</b> <b>portion,</b> or intersection, of the two recognition sets of the host, when compared with a genotype that contains that pathogen in only one of its recognition sets. We call this benefit “intersection advantage,” γ, and incorporate it, as well as the degree of recognition degeneracy, m, into a model of heterozygote advantage that utilizes a set-theoretic definition of fitness. Counterintuitively, we show that levels of polymorphism are positively related to m and that a high level of recognition degeneracy is necessary for polymorphism at MHC loci under heterozygote advantage. Increasing γ reduces levels of polymorphism considerably. Hence, if intersection advantage is significant for MHC genotypes, then heterozygote advantage may not explain the very high levels of polymorphism observed at MHC genes...|$|E

This encoding is accomplished through modulating firing of CA 1 pyramidal cells in response to different actions performed in the same egocentric and allocentric space. In this experiment we aimed to determine the different type of CA 1 cell firing rate modulation in response to movement through 2 different trajectories existing on the same track. We specifically focused on the area on our Plus-track where these two trajectories overlapped. We recorded single cells from rats and found place cells with fields on the <b>overlapping</b> <b>portion</b> of the track. About half of these cells did not show {{a significant change in}} the firing of their place field when the two trajectories were compared.

Second, the place field’s center of mass shifted depending on the route. Lastly, we found that a small percentage exhibited both forms of encoding. Our results suggest that hippocampal place cells are capable of a highly specific level of modulation affected by more then the specific location, and grand changes in direction/behavior.

A tyrosine phosphatase-like protein, IA- 2, is a major target for autoantibodies and T-cells in the disease. In this study, we have further characterized the T-cell response to IA- 2 by the generation and characterization of T-cell lines. T-cell lines responsive to IA- 2 antigen were generated from 17 of 32 patients and 3 of 10 control subjects. Antigen specificity was confirmed in lines from six diabetic patients and one control individual by demonstration of responses to synthetic IA- 2 peptides and epitope mapping. Five lines from diabetic patients responded to one of two peptides representing amino acids 831 - 850 and 841 - 860 of IA- 2.

We used a quasar catalog from an <b>overlapping</b> <b>portion</b> of the SDSS Stripe 82 region to quantify the completeness and efficiency of selection methods involving color, probabilistic modeling, variability, and combinations of color/probabilistic modeling with variability. We only considered objects that appear as point sources in the DES images. We examine color selection methods based on the WISE mid-IR W 1 -W 2 color, a mixture of WISE and DES colors (g-i and i-W 1) and a mixture of VHS and DES colors (g-i and i-K). For probabilistic quasar selection, we used XDQSOz, an algorithm that employs an empirical multi-wavelength flux model of quasars to assign quasar probabilities. Our variability selection uses the multi-band chi 2 -probability that sources are constant in the DES Year 1 griz-band light curves. The completeness and efficiency are calculated relative to an underlying sample of point sources that are detected in the required selection bands and pass our data quality and photometric error cuts. We conduct our analyses at two magnitude limits, i 85 % for both i-band magnitude limits and efficiencies of > 80 % to the bright limit and > 60 % to the faint limit; however, the giW 1 and giW 1 +variability methods give the highest quasar surface densities. The XDQSOz method and combinations of W 1 W 2 /giW 1 /XDQSOz with variability are among the better selection methods when both high completeness and high efficiency are desired.
