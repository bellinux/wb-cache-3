25|$|The Company {{inherited}} a revenue collection {{system from the}} Mughals in which the heaviest proportion of the tax burden fell on the cultivators, with one-third of the production reserved for imperial entitlement; this pre-colonial system became the Company revenue policy's baseline. However, there was vast variation across India in the methods by which the revenues were collected; with this complication in mind, a Committee of Circuit toured the districts of expanded Bengal Presidency {{in order to make}} a five-year settlement, consisting of five-yearly inspections and temporary tax farming. In their <b>overall</b> <b>approach</b> to revenue policy, Company officials were guided by two goals: first, preserving as much as possible the balance of rights and obligations that were traditionally claimed by the farmers who cultivated the land and the various intermediaries who collected tax on the state's behalf and who reserved a cut for themselves; and second, identifying those sectors of the rural economy that would maximise both revenue and security. Although their first revenue settlement turned out to be essentially the same as the more informal pre-existing Mughal one, the Company had created a foundation for the growth of both information and bureaucracy.|$|E

500|$|Program music came {{naturally}} to Rimsky-Korsakov. To him, [...] "even a folk theme has {{a program of}} sorts." [...] He composed {{the majority of his}} orchestral works in this genre at two periods of his career—at the beginning, with Sadko and Antar (also known as his Second Symphony, Op. 9), and in the 1880s, with Scheherezade, Capriccio Espagnol and the Russian Easter Overture. Despite the gap between these two periods, the composer's <b>overall</b> <b>approach</b> and the way he used his musical themes remained consistent. Both Antar and Scheherezade use a robust [...] "Russian" [...] theme to portray the male progagonists (the title character in Antar; the sultan in Scheherezade) and a more sinuous [...] "Eastern" [...] theme for the female ones (the peri Gul-Nazar in Antar and the title character in Scheherezade).|$|E

Afterward, the band did more songwriting {{for about a month}} and then recorded most of the album at Studio Litho. The <b>overall</b> <b>approach</b> to songwriting was less collaborative than with past efforts, with the individual band members having brought in most of the songs more completely written. The band sought to try things it had not done before and to use a greater variety of material. The band tried to create a live atmosphere for the album, and looked to leave in sounds that producers would normally try to clean up, such as feedback and out-of-tune guitar parts. The overall time spent working {{on the album}} was less than what the band had spent working on Superunknown. Cornell described the album-making process as [...] "way faster and way easier".|$|E

Like Descartes, he rejected appeals to uncertain sense perception and common sense (except in the very specific way he describes concerning aesthetics), or the prejudices of one's [...] "Weltanschauung", and tried to give a new way to certainty through methodical logic, and an assumption of a type of a priori knowledge. He was also not in agreement with Reid and the Scottish school, who he criticized in his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics as using [...] "the magic wand of common sense", and not properly confronting the [...] "metaphysical" [...] problem defined by Hume, which Kant wanted to be solved scientifically - {{the problem of how to}} use reason to consider how one ought to act.|$|E
2500|$|In their <b>overall</b> <b>approach,</b> Thomas and Smith drew on {{the example}} of the WEA {{programs}} and the educational philosophy of John Dewey, with a strong emphasis on diversity and democratic process.

[...] "We are learning toleration," [...] one student {{said in an interview with}} the Woman's Journal. Another remarked that [...] "to her the summer work, the mingling with the representatives of many industries, of many localities, of many points of view, had brought home the conviction that the problem of each working woman was the problem of all, the problem of all that of each." ...|$|E

Examination of the underdrawings show that the artist frequently deviated from his preliminary sketches, {{an indication of the}} looseness and freshness of his <b>overall</b> <b>approach.</b> The images are flat as they are completed before the advent of perspective. They are the more remarkable for the rich and precisely rendered small details, and use of glazes, given that they were completed before the development of oil painting some 30 years later. According to art historian Robert Suckale, [...] "never before have weapons appeared sharper or shields more spiked." [...] The painting is quintessentially Gothic and does not evidence any Italian influence. Rather it can be within the tradition of Bohemian painting, or possibly Franco-Flemish art. Its innovative use of light may be traced to the techniques of the Master Theoderic, while the positioning of the knight below Christ in the Resurrection references the Christ child in the c 1350 Italian-Byzantium icon, the Eichhorn Madonna.|$|E

50|$|There are two <b>overall</b> <b>approaches</b> within voice classification: one for opera vocalists {{and one for}} {{choral music}} parts. One of the major {{differences}} in classifying voices between these two is that choral music classifies voices entirely upon vocal range, whereas in opera classification systems many other factors are considered. Indeed, tessitura (where the voice feels most comfortable singing) and vocal timbre (the innate quality of sound to the voice) are more important factors than vocal range within opera categorization. Within opera there are several systems in use including the German Fach system, the Italian opera tradition, and French opera tradition.|$|R
40|$|International audienceDue to {{the nature}} of their inputs, outputs and processes, {{professional}} service firms (PSFs) face three generic management challenges, namely strategic management, knowledge management and human-resource management. These three management issues are closely interrelated. They need to be managed in consistent whole patterns in relation to kinds of business activities. Following the typology of Lowendahl (2005 [1997]), 'client relation' and 'adapting solutions' kinds of PSF have consistent <b>overall</b> <b>approaches</b> to the three management issues. But, concerning 'creative problem-solving' ('CPS') PSFs, {{there is a lack of}} a consistent <b>overall</b> management <b>approach,</b> This latter can be neither hierarchical management nor self-management. We propose to investigate the democratic management approach as a potential consistent solution for 'CPS' PSFs. To this aim, we draw on a longitudinal in-depth case study in a French democratic consulting firm confronted with the need for managing differentiation between individuals and collective integration. In the last section we discuss the contributions of such a management perspective for PSFs, as well as the difficulties and the contingencies of the case-study...|$|R
2500|$|Blizzard {{will support}} the game through various updates, such as the {{competitive}} mode that was added in June 2016, and potential changes to how the Play of the Game is selected to showcase non-attacking-based Heroes. Other updates will come from monitoring the game and adjusting various attributes of the Heroes to better manage their expectations they had in designing the game {{and in response to}} player feedback. For example, one of the first planned updates was to change the strength of McCree's alternate fire [...] "Fan the Hammer" [...] ability, which could do a great deal of damage to most targets. Blizzard felt this attack should be lethal to most of the Heroes but should not be able to take out Tank-based characters in a single shot, and reduced the damage to address this. Similarly, Symmetra had major character update in late 2016 that gave her additional abilities including a second Ultimate ability, the changes made in response to Blizzard's observations that she had been infrequently selected by players. Kaplan said that while they do want to promote lesser-played heroes, their goal of these updates is not to strive for equal selection rates for all heroes, but to work with the fluctuations in the meta-game as new heroes are introduced and new strategies by players are developed to counter new heroes or updates made to other heroes. Kaplan described their <b>overall</b> <b>approach</b> in these post-release adjustments as part of a [...] "balance triangle", weighing the various statistics they collect, the feedback and general attitudes from the player base they monitor, and their own personal opinions and gut feelings where the balance should be. Not all three points are equally weighed, but they consider avoiding allowing one of these areas overwhelm the other two.|$|E
