The only difference in the appearance of the first five models was the color of the trim, number of USB ports, {{the presence or absence of}} a door (which covers the flash card readers on equipped models) and some minor changes to the air vents.

5000|$|Most cable {{companies}} require a set-top box to view their cable channels, even on newer televisions with digital cable QAM tuners, because most digital cable channels are now encrypted, or [...] "scrambled", to reduce cable service theft. A cable from the {{jack in the}} wall {{is attached to the}} input of the box, and an <b>output</b> <b>cable</b> from the box is attached to the television, usually the RF-IN or composite input on older TVs. Since the set-top box only decodes the single channel that is being watched, each television in the house requires a separate box. Some unencrypted channels, usually traditional over-the-air broadcast networks, can be displayed without a receiver box. The cable company will provide set top boxes based on the level of service a customer purchases, from basic set top boxes with a standard definition picture connected through the standard coaxial connection on the TV, to high-definition wireless DVR receivers connected via HDMI or component. Older analog television sets are [...] "cable ready" [...] and can receive the old analog cable without a set-top box. To receive digital cable channels on an analog television set, even unencrypted ones, requires a different type of box, a digital television adapter supplied by the cable company.

40|$|The vacuum-assisted, constant-force {{exercise}} device (VAC-FED) {{has been proposed}} to fill {{a need for a}} safe, reliable exercise machine that would provide constant loads that could range from 20 to 250 lb (0. 09 to 1. 12 kN) with strokes that could range from 6 to 36 in. (0. 15 to 0. 91 m). The VAC-FED was originally intended to enable astronauts in microgravity to simulate the lifting of free weights, but it could just as well be used on Earth for simulated weight lifting and other constant-force exercises. Because the VAC-FED would utilize atmospheric/vacuum differential pressure instead of weights to generate force, it could weigh considerably less than either a set of free weights or a typical conventional exercise machine based on weights. Also, the use of atmospheric/ vacuum differential pressure to generate force would render the VAC-FED inherently safer, relative to free weights and to conventional exercise machines that utilize springs to generate forces. The overall function of the VAC-FED would be to generate a constant tensile force in an <b>output</b> <b>cable,</b> which would be attached to a bar, handle, or other exercise interface. The primary force generator in the VAC-FED would be a piston in a cylinder. The piston would separate a volume vented to atmosphere {{at one end of the}} cylinder from an evacuated volume at the other end of the cylinder (see figure). Hence, neglecting friction at the piston seals, the force generated would be nearly constant equal to the area of the piston multiplied by the atmospheric/vacuum differential pressure. In the vented volume in the cylinder, a direct-force cable would be looped around a pulley on the piston, doubling the stroke and halving the tension. One end of the direct-force cable would be anchored to a cylinder cap; the other end of the direct-force cable would be wrapped around a variable-ratio pulley that would couple tension to the <b>output</b> <b>cable.</b> As its name suggests, the variable-ratio pulley would contain a mechanism that could be used to vary the ratio between the tension in the direct-force cable and the tension in the <b>output</b> <b>cable.</b> This mechanism could contain gears, pulleys, and/or levers, for example...|$|E

This may be done by placing a calibration specimen into the ultrasonic beam and measuring the time-domain electrical signal in the <b>output</b> <b>cable</b> of the receiver. Using models, we then predict how this received electrical signal would be changed if the calibration specimen were removed and unflawed and flawed components were placed into the beam in turn.

If the difference between the predicted output signals for the two components is sufficiently large, compared to system noise, then the hypothetical flaw is said to be detectable...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{over-voltage}} transients on ac induction motors when connected {{through a}} cable of arbitrary length to a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) {{consisting of a}} Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) inverter with Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) power devices. Factors contributing to a motor over-voltage transient equal to a theoretical twice dc bus voltage are first described using existing transmission line analysis.

This phenomenon is observed on all PWM inverters with <b>output</b> <b>cable</b> lengths greater than l c distance.

50|$|In {{an audio}} amplifier, {{all forms of}} {{oscillation}} are generally unwanted. Poor design and layout can sometimes lead to squegging in such an amplifier. As always, this arises {{from a combination of}} high and low frequency oscillations. Poor layout or poor shielding leads to high-frequency oscillations where the output has been coupled back to the input, especially if the input and <b>output</b> <b>cables</b> are run together for a distance. The high-frequency oscillations cause heavy currents in the output stages and, with poor power supply decoupling, these upset the input stage biasing and disrupt the high frequency oscillations. Squegging then arises. Squegging in audio amplifiers is commonly called motorboating because it sounds in the loudspeaker like an outboard boat motor at low speed.|$|R
