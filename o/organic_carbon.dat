5|$|The ocean can be {{conceptualized}} as being divided into various zones, depending on depth, and {{presence or absence}} of sunlight. Nearly all life forms in the ocean depend on the photosynthetic activities of phytoplankton and other marine plants to convert carbon dioxide into <b>organic</b> <b>carbon,</b> which is the basic building block of organic matter. Photosynthesis in turn requires energy from sunlight to drive the chemical reactions that produce <b>organic</b> <b>carbon.</b>|$|E

The oceans' surface layer holds large amounts of dissolved <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> that is exchanged rapidly with the atmosphere. The deep layer's concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon is about 15 percent higher than that of the surface layer and it remains there for much longer periods of time.

5|$|Carbon {{metabolism}} in bacteria {{is either}} heterotrophic, where <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> compounds {{are used as}} carbon sources, or autotrophic, meaning that cellular carbon is obtained by fixing carbon dioxide. Heterotrophic bacteria include parasitic types. Typical autotrophic bacteria are phototrophic cyanobacteria, green sulfur-bacteria and some purple bacteria, but also many chemolithotrophic species, such as nitrifying or sulfur-oxidising bacteria. Energy metabolism of bacteria is either based on phototrophy, the use of light through photosynthesis, or based on chemotrophy, the use of chemical substances for energy, which are mostly oxidised {{at the expense of}} oxygen or alternative electron acceptors (aerobic/anaerobic respiration).|$|E

40|$|This review {{looks at}} {{factors that may}} {{influence}} <b>organic</b> soil <b>carbon</b> and issues facing its inclusion in a carbon trading scheme in the future. A key factor contributing to climate change is excessive levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and global efforts are focussed on both reducing our {{emissions of greenhouse gases}} and increasing the storage (sequestration) of atmospheric carbon. Soil, as {{an important part of the}} carbon cycle of the planet, has the potential to store carbon and contribute to mitigating greenhouse gases. In total, soils contain about 3 times more carbon than the atmosphere and 4. 5 times more carbon than all living things.   Hence a relatively small increase in the proportion of soil carbon could make a significant contribution to reducing atmospheric carbon. The amount of <b>organic</b> soil <b>carbon</b> that can be stored is influenced by a number of factors, including land use practices, soil type and climate. Increasing the amount of <b>organic</b> soil <b>carbon</b> may also improve soil health, providing added benefits to ecosystems and agricultural and forestry productivity. This review looks at factors that may influence <b>organic</b> soil <b>carbon</b> and issues facing its inclusion in a carbon trading scheme in the future. In order for <b>organic</b> soil <b>carbon</b> to be included in an enterprise-level carbon trading scheme, it must be measurable in an efficient and inexpensive way and at scales small enough to be applicable at the farm level.

5|$|Some Hydnellum species, {{including}} H. ferrugineum and H. scleropodium, form a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{protected}} from tides and storms by coral reefs {{are often the}} best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to over-fishing, {{because much of the}} <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on the reefs. Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} Archaea is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many Archaea to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all Archaea or different main groups within Archaea. Another unique feature of Archaea is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic Archaea play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E

5|$|The oceans {{are home}} to a diverse {{collection}} of life forms that {{use it as a}} habitat. Since sunlight illuminates only the upper layers, the major part of the ocean exists in permanent darkness. As the different depth and temperature zones each provide habitat for a unique set of species, the marine environment as a whole encompasses an immense diversity of life. Marine habitats range from surface water to the deepest oceanic trenches, including coral reefs, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, tidepools, muddy, sandy and rocky seabeds, and the open pelagic zone. The organisms living in the sea range from whales 30 meters (100ft) long to microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton, fungi, bacteria and viruses, including recently discovered marine bacteriophages which live parasitically inside bacteria. Marine life plays an important part in the carbon cycle as photosynthetic organisms convert dissolved carbon dioxide into <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> and it is economically important to humans for providing fish for use as food.|$|E

40|$|A Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) is a {{discharge}} of untreated sewer water and storm water released into water bodies when {{the capacity of}} sewer pipes reach to limits during storm events. CSOs often contain environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and these pollutants may distribute through water flow. The Brandon CSO outfall {{is located in the}} lower Duwamish River in Seattle, WA. This study focuses on deposition patterns of PCBs from the Brandon CSO. Deposition of PCBs on sediments is dependent upon settlement of sediment particles distributed in the water column. CSO water contains substantial amount of various types of sediment particles. Some PCB molecules attach to these suspended solids and deposit near the Brandon CSO. Previous investigations found near-field sediment deposition would be most affect by suspended solids with a settling velocity greater than 0. 25 mm/s (Battelle, 2006). We used EFDC (Environmental Fluid Dynamics Computer Code) models and estimated what portion of the suspended solids transport polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and settle into the sediment bed. As well as the effect of particle settling velocities, numerical study found the importance of the rate of PCB absorption by <b>organic</b> <b>carbons</b> on particles. Because of a hydrophobic feature of PCB molecules, instead of attaching directly to mineral surface on particles, these molecules bind to hydrophobic ends of <b>organic</b> <b>carbons</b> on sediment particles. Therefore, PCB partitioning is strongly influenced by the organic content of the suspended solids (Karickhoff et al., 1979 and Schwarzenbach et al., 2003) ...|$|R
5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} {{over the past decade}} or so shows that they teem with a wide variety of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> flux.|$|E
5|$|Through {{studies of}} carbon isotope ratios (similar to the {{methodology}} used in carbon dating, except with the stable isotopes C-12 and C-13), {{it has been}} shown that the carbon found in diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic sources.

In contrast, eclogitic diamonds contain <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> from organic detritus that has been pushed down from the surface of the Earth's crust through subduction (see plate tectonics) before transforming into diamond. These two different source of carbon have measurably different 13C:12C ratios.

30|$|To {{understand}} {{the impact of}} aerosols on regional and global climates, we used historical control experiments (HIST) for the 155 -year period from 1851 to 2005, under the protocol for historical experiments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR 5; Taylor 2012). To clarify the effects of aerosols on the atmospheric hydrological cycle through both the aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud interactions, including slow responses, we used the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate-Earth System Models (MIROC-ESM; Watanabe et al. 2011), a CGCM, coupled with the Spectral Radiation-Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS; Takemura et al. 2000; 2002). We performed sensitivity (pre-industrial aerosol; piAERO) experiments to estimate the effects of anthropogenic aerosols; these {{were the same as}} HIST, but with the emissions of anthropogenic aerosols fixed at their preindustrial (around 1850) values. The anthropogenic aerosols in our experiments are sulfates, <b>organic</b> <b>carbons,</b> and black carbons. The amount of black carbons is much smaller than that of the other anthropogenic aerosols although the effects of black carbons are quite {{different from those of the}} sulfates and <b>organic</b> <b>carbons.</b> We note that there are interannual and long-term variations in natural aerosols, such as dust and volcanic aerosols. We selected the analysis period of from 1976 to 2005 because the emission of anthropogenic aerosols has been increased until the end of the simulation period over the Asian monsoon region (e.g., Ohara et al. 2007). To reduce uncertainty in the simulation, we used three ensembles for each experiment. We used 90 seasonal means to calculate the 30 -year seasonal mean. The differences between HIST and piAERO experiments were evaluated using the two-sided Student’s t test at the 95 % significance level.|$|R
