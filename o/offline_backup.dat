50|$|Due to {{the nature}} of CryptoLocker's operation, some experts reluctantly {{suggested}} that paying the ransom {{was the only way to}} recover files from CryptoLocker in the absence of current <b>backups</b> (<b>offline</b> <b>backups</b> made before the infection that are inaccessible from infected computers cannot be attacked by CryptoLocker). Due to the length of the key employed by CryptoLocker, experts considered it practically impossible to use a brute-force attack to obtain the key needed to decrypt files without paying ransom; the similar 2008 trojan Gpcode.AK used a 1024-bit key that was believed to be large enough to be computationally infeasible to break without a concerted distributed effort, or the discovery of a flaw that could be used to break the encryption. Sophos security analyst Paul Ducklin speculated that CryptoLocker's online decryption service involved a dictionary attack against its own encryption using its database of keys, explaining the requirement to wait up to 24 hours to receive a result.|$|R

5000|$|A four-way {{joystick}} {{was provided}} to control low-frequency oscillation (LFO) modulation as well as pitch bending. Pulling the joystick bender towards you also allowed control over voltage-controlled filter (VCF) as well. Around the back panel are jacks for headphones, stereo line out (to plug into a keyboard amplifier, PA system, mixing board, etc.), pedal inputs for damper, portamento and [...] "program up" [...] are provided. Also available are two sockets for tape recorder interface to facilitate <b>offline</b> patch <b>backup</b> and storage of sounds and other data. Electrical power was supplied via a two-pin IEC C9-type connection cable rather than the rather more ubiquitous C13 type, which can potentially {{be a source of}} frustration if lost.|$|R
50|$|In June 2015, Let's Encrypt {{generated}} an RSA {{root certificate}} with its private key stored on a hardware security module which is kept offline. The root certificate {{is used to}} sign two intermediate certificates which are cross-signed by the certificate authority IdenTrust. One of the intermediate certificates is used to sign issued certificates, while the other is kept <b>offline</b> as a <b>backup</b> in case of problems with the first intermediate certificate. Because the IdenTrust certificate is preinstalled in major web browsers, Let's Encrypt certificates can normally be validated and are accepted upon installation, out of the box, even while no browser vendors include the ISRG root certificate as a trust anchor.|$|R
