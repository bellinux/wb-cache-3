40|$|Summary Neuroendocrine tumor (NET) metastases {{represent}} at {{this moment}} the only accepted indication of liver transplantation (LT) for liver secondaries. Between 1984 - 2007, nine (1. 1 %) of 824 adult LTs were performed because of NET. There were five well differentiated functioning NETs (four carcinoids and one gastrinoma), three well differentiated non functioning NETs and one poorly differentiated NET. Indications for LT were an invalidating unresectable tumor (4 x), and/or a diffuse tumor localization (3 x) and/or a refractory hormonal syndrome (5 x). Median post-LT patient survival is 60. 9 months (range 4. 8 - 119). One-, 3 - and 5 -year actuarial survival rates are 88 %, 77 % and 33 %; 1, 3 and 5 years disease free survival rates are 67 %, 33 % and 11 %. Due to a more rigorous selection procedure, results improved since 2000; three out of five patients are alive disease-free at 78, 84 and 96 months. Review of these series together with {{a review of the}} literature reveals that results of LT for this <b>oncological</b> <b>condition</b> can be improved using better selection criteria, adapted immunosuppression and neo- and adjuvant surgical as well as medical tretament. LT should be considered earlier in the therapeutic algorithm of selected NET patients as it is the only therapy that can offer a cure...|$|E
40|$|Poor {{nutritional}} status {{is a major}} concern for children being treated for an oncology condition. It is vital for optimal prognosis that nutritional concerns are recognised and treated promptly. The majority of oncology treatment centres only use simple methods to screen for poor {{nutritional status}}; however, it is unknown whether these simple methods accurately recognise poor nutritional status. We aimed to determine whether commonly used simple nutritional assessment variables could accurately identify poor nutritional status in children being treated for oncological conditions. This cross-sectional study measured height, weight, mid-upper arm circumference, triceps skinfold, albumin levels and body cell mass in forty children being treated for an <b>oncological</b> <b>condition.</b> To determine whether commonly used nutritional variables were suitable determinants, the variables were compared against the reference measure of body cell mass index (BCMI) Z-scores. Using the BCMI Z-score cut-off of − 1 · 65, 48 % of the study population were considered poorly nourished. Correlational analysis showed that there was no significant biological relationship between the BCMI Z-score and the simple parameters. When divided into two groups based on the nutritional status indicated by the BCMI Z-score, the independent t tests between the well-nourished and malnourished groups demonstrated that {{there was a significant difference}} in the BMI Z-score (P = 0 · 01) between the groups. No simple nutritional measures were found to accurately identify poor nutritional status in children being treated for oncological conditions...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: (a) To explore parental {{experiences}} and needs during their child's end-of-life care at home; (b) to explore patient's characteristics and current provision of paediatric end-of-life {{care in the}} home care setting in Switzerland; and (c) to determine influencing system factors impacting end-of-life care at home. BACKGROUND: Parental experiences/needs and paediatric end-of-life care services in the home care setting are influenced by national healthcare policy, determinants {{of the family and}} the individual patient. In Switzerland, {{there is a lack of}} information about the provision of paediatric end-of-life care at home and related parent's experiences/needs. DESIGN: Sub-study of the nationwide multicenter study 'Paediatric End-of-Life CAre Needs in Switzerland' using a concurrent qualitative embedded mixed methods design. METHODS: Data will be collected from January-May 2014 through community care organizations and children's hospitals. The study includes approximately 40 - 50 families whose child (0 - 18  years) died in the years 2011 - 2012 due to a cardiological, neurological or <b>oncological</b> <b>condition</b> and spent at least 21  days at home during the last 4  weeks of life. Qualitative data will be collected through semi-structured interviews with parents and analysed by 'thematic analysis'. Quantitative data about patient's characteristics will be obtained from patient's medical charts and parental experiences/needs through the parental questionnaire. Appropriate descriptive and inference statistical methods will be used for data analysis. DISCUSSION: This study will provide comprehensive basic information about parental needs and patient characteristics for the provision of paediatric end-of-life care and may promote the development of family-centred paediatric end-of-life care services at home.

The indication for desensitization is where no alternative medications are available for the treatment of that condition, and where the benefits of desensitization outweigh the risks. Desensitization is a therapeutic modality for drug allergy (similar to allergen specific immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis and insect venom anaphylaxis). In contrast, the drug provocation test is a diagnostic modality used to confirm or refute the diagnosis of drug allergy.

40|$|It was {{sought to}} learn about the {{meanings}} within complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among patients undergoing treatment at the oncology service of the Clinical Hospital of Unicamp. For this, the following were analyzed: 1) how patients dealt with health/ disease; 2) the motivations and processes underlying the decision to use CAM; and 3) the sociability networks that influenced decisions regarding conventional and/ or unconventional cancer treatments. From the discourse of the eight patients interviewed, it was seen that CAM and religious services were important for constructing meanings for the following: the biological dimension of the illness, possibilities for cure, filling the void promoted by the biomedical model and searching for expanded care. Thus, religious practices were experienced by patients such that they constituted a strategy that legitimized and softened the uncertainty regarding questions of a moral, personal, social and physical nature, in relation to chronic <b>oncological</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Parents {{facing the}} death of their child have a strong need for {{compassionate}} professional support. Care services should be based on empirical evidence, be sensitive {{to the needs of the}} families concerned, take into account the heterogeneity within the medical field of paediatrics, and fit into the local health care system. We need to better understand the perspectives of parents facing {{the death of}} their child in order to guide further development and evaluation of specialised paediatric palliative and end-of-life (EOL) care services. METHODS Questionnaire survey to assess the EOL care perspectives of a Swiss population-based sample of bereaved parents who had lost a child due to a cardiac, neurological or <b>oncological</b> <b>condition,</b> or during the neonatal period in the years 2011 or 2012. The parental perspective was assessed with a newly developed and tested instrument that was structured according to six evidence-based quality domains. Responses regarding parental experiences and perceived satisfaction are described. Differences between the four diagnostic groups are analysed using a generalized estimation equation to account for the dyadic data structure. RESULTS Of 307 eligible families, 267 could be contacted and 135 (51 %) consented to participate in this questionnaire survey. Our findings show positive parental experiences of their child's EOL care and high perceived satisfaction with the care their child received. Parents of a child with cancer rated their experiences highest in most of the six quality domains and reported the highest satisfaction with care. The lowest scores were mainly reported by parents from the neurology group, with the exception of the shared decision making domain, where parents of neonates reported significantly less positive experiences. CONCLUSIONS Although positive in general, our study results suggest some areas for improvement. The integration of specialised paediatric palliative care has the potential to minimise lost opportunities to support and assist parents...|$|E
40|$|O novo milênio traz consigo uma nova realidade para o Brasil: o envelhecimento da população e com ele, o aumento dos números de casos de doenças crônicas, entre elas o câncer. Minha proposta, neste estudo, foi compreender como os pacientes oncológicos, em tratamento quimioterápico, por ocorrência de metástase, vivenciam a possibilidade da morte. Habitei o mundo da oncologia, aproximando-me dos pacientes em sua dimensão existencial. Para tal, foram {{realizadas}} entrevistas com sete pessoas adultas que fazem acompanhamento em uma clínica de oncologia privada na cidade de Guarapuava  PR. Para análise dessas entrevistas, aproprieime de algumas idéias do referencial filosófico de Martin Heidegger. Dessa análise, a morte emergiu de vários modos: implicitamente; como um fenômeno natural, vivido na impessoalidade, pela morte do outro ou dos casos de morte; ou ainda como fenômeno que permeia a existência. A incerteza quanto ao futuro emerge no confronto entre a possibilidade de morrer e a possibilidade de curar-se, mantendose, porém, a esperança de não ser mais um ser-doente. A cura é enfocada pelo paciente não somente na esfera biológica, mas também, na busca por uma melhor qualidade de vida, o que envolve um ressignificar o momento presente. A dor e o sofrimento são mantidos no passado enquanto o presente é refeito em um novo cotidiano que envolve o mundo particular da oncologia, um cotidiano que é ameaçado pelos limites e temores impostos pela doença. A temporalidade vivenciada está restrita principalmente à dimensão cronológica. A fé emerge significativamente nas falas como forma de amenizar o sentimento que sufoca o seraí. Considerando a condição ontológica de ser com o outro, a morte se mostrou, ao paciente com câncer, por meio de palavras, do falatório, de ações e do olhar do outro, principalmente familiar, que ao mesmo tempo acolhe e denuncia. Essas situações foram compreendidas como um modo inautêntico de cuidar. No entanto, na relação familiar a consideração e a paciência também emergiram como modo de cuidar autêntico. Emerge ainda a relação desses pacientes com os profissionais de saúde, revelando-se modos de cuidar quase sempre inautênticos, marcados pelo não respeito à sua autonomia e ao direito de participação na tomada de decisão sobre seu tratamento. Em meio a inautenticidade do cotidiano, alguns pacientes também se reconhecem em sua finitude. Este estudo permitiu uma reflexão sobre o modelo assistencial vigente, que não contempla o cuidar do homem em sua integralidade. É necessário construir competência humana para o cuidar integral, dirigindo-se não somente à cura, mas à pessoa humana, em sua singularidade. The {{new millennium}} brings along {{a new reality}} for Brazil: {{the aging of the}} population, and with it, the increase in the numbers of cases of chronic diseases, among them the cancer. My purpose in this study was to understand how the oncological patients in chemotherapic treatment, due to the metastasis, experience the death possibility. I lived in the oncological world, getting close to he patients in their existential dimension. To do so, were accomplished interviews with seven adult people that have been undergoing treatment in a private oncological clinic in Guarapuava  Pr. In order to analyze these interviews, I used some ideas of the philosophic reference of Martin Heidegger. From this analysis, death showed itself in different ways: implicit, as a natural phenomenon, lived in an impersonal way, by the others death or the cases of death, or even as a phenomenon that permeates the existence. The uncertainty about the future comes in the encounter between the possibility of dying and the possibility of healing, continuing, and, the hope of not being a sick person any longer. The cure is focused by the patient not only on the biological sphere but also in the search for a better quality of life, what involves a different meaning of the present moment. The pain and suffering are kept in the past while the present is remade in a new quotidian that involves the private world of the oncology, a quotidian that is threatened by the limits and fears imposed by the disease. The period of time experienced is restricted mainly to the chronological dimension. Faith appears meaningfully in the speeches as a way of softening the feeling that suffocates the human being. Considering the <b>oncological</b> <b>condition</b> of the human being with other, death has shown to the patient with cancer through words, talks, actions and through the eye of the other, mainly familiar, that in the same time shelters and denounces. Theses situations were understood as a facile way of taking care. However, in the familiar relation, attention and patience have also emerged as an authentic manner of taking care. It emerges still the relation between these patients with the health professionals, revealing methods of taking care nearly always facile, marked by the non-respect to the patients autonomy and by the right of participation when making decisions about his treatment. In the middle of this facile quotidian, some patients also recognize themselves in their finite. This study allowed a reflection on the present assistance model, that doesnt contemplates the care of the man in his totality. It is necessary to build human competence to the integral care, directing not only to the cure, but also the human being in his singularity...|$|E

40|$|Targeted {{radionuclide}} therapy (TRT) is {{a branch of}} cancer medicine concerned {{with the use of}} radioisotopes, radiolabelled molecules, nanoparticles or microparticles that either naturally accumulate in or are designed to home to tumours. They combine the specificity of molecular and, sometimes, physical targeting with the potent cytotoxicity of ionising radiation. Targeting vectors for TRT include antibodies, antibody fragments, proteins, peptides, and small molecules. The diversity of available carrier molecules together with the large panel of suitable radioisotopes with unique physicochemical properties allows vector-radionuclide pairings to be matched to the molecular, pathological and physical characteristics of a tumour. Some agents are designed for dual therapeutic and diagnostic (“theranostic”) applications. TRT use has increased with the introduction of agents that are indicated for common <b>oncological</b> <b>conditions,</b> including 90 Y-microspheres for the treatment of hepatic tumours and 223 RaCl 2 for bone metastases.

The extension of PBSCT into the use of allogeneic and cord blood cells so far has been met with encouraging results, and the latter holds promise to increasing donor availability to patients requiring transplantation. Developments in cytokine research and ex vivo manipulation of hemopoietic stem cells are enabling new approaches to anticancer treatment involving tumor purging, immunomodulation, ex vivo expansion of stem cells and gene therapy.

40|$|Infertility {{can arise}} as a {{consequence}} of treatment of <b>oncological</b> <b>conditions.</b> The parallel and continued improvement in both the management of oncology and fertility cases in recent times has brought to the forefront the potential for fertility preservation in patients being treated for cancer. Many survivors will maintain their reproductive potential after the successful completion of treatment for cancer. However total body irradiation, radiation to the gonads, and certain high dose chemotherapy regimens can place women at risk for acute ovarian failure or premature menopause and men at risk for temporary or permanent azoospermia. Providing information about risk of infertility and possible interventions to maintain reproductive potential are critical for the adolescent and young adult population at the time of diagnosis. There are established means of preserving fertility before cancer treatment; specifically, sperm cryopreservation for men and in vitro fertilization and embryo cryopreservation for women. Several innovative techniques are being actively investigated, including oocyte and ovarian follicle cryopreservation, ovarian tissue transplantation, and in vitro follicle maturation, which may expand the number of fertility preservation choices for young cancer patients. Fertility preservation may also require some modification of cancer therapy; thus, patients' wishes regarding future fertility and available fertility preservation alternatives should be discussed before initiation of therapy...|$|R

In the present report we will describe our experience in this field, with special reference to erectile function, urinary continence, fertility and feasibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Between 2000 and 2009 we have treated five patients with seminalsparing cystectomy for benign conditions, namely sclerosing cystitis, tuberculosis and a benign paraganglioma. All patients underwent a complete diagnostic evaluation including CT of upper abdomen and pelvis, and bone scintigraphy. Digital rectal examination was normal, PSA less than 2. 5, with a free to total ratio above 25 %. Cystectomy was performed, leaving in situ vas deferent, seminal vesicles, neurovascular bundles and prostatic capsule. Finally, an orthotopic bladder was performed. The ileal segment was anastomized to the prostatic capsule. RESULTS. All patients had uneventful recoveries and were continent within 2 weeks from the operation. Erectile function was maintained in all cases; in one patients fertility was preserved. CONCLUSIONS.

The tumour growth inhibition efficacy, antiangiogenic potential and pharmacokinetics of STX 243 were examined using four in vivo models. Both STX 243 and STX 140 were capable of retarding the growth of MDA-MB- 231 xenograft tumours (72 and 63 %, respectively), whereas no inhibition was observed for animals treated with 2 -MeOE 2. Further tumour inhibition studies showed that STX 243 was also active against MCF- 7 paclitaxel-resistant tumours. Using a Matrigel plug-based model, in vivo angiogenesis was restricted with STX 243 and STX 140 (50 and 72 %, respectively, using a 10 mg kg(- 1) oral dose), thereby showing the antiangiogenic activity of both compounds. The pharmacokinetics of STX 243 were examined at two different doses using adult female rats.

AIM: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the histopathological tumor response after long term neoadjuvant chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer and the possibilities of preserving the anal sphincter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 115 cases of advanced low rectal cancer that received preoperative treatment and underwent rectal resection with total mesorectal excision. The pretreatment tumor-node-metastasis stage (cTNM) was as follows: 38 patients were assigned as stage II and 77 patients as stage III. Long-term radiotherapy was delivered at a median dose of 47. 24 Gy (± 5. 47 Gy) and for 80 patients (69. 56 %) was associated with chemotherapy. The tumors “downstaging” was defined as any pathologic stage (ypTNM) less than pretreatment imagistic stage (cTNM). Sphincter-sparing surgery after preoperative radiotherapy was performed in safety <b>oncological</b> <b>conditions.</b> RESULTS: Comparison of preoperative and pathologic staging revealed that the depth of invasion was downstaged in 42 patients (36. 52 %) and lymph nodes status was downstaged in 16 patients of 77 patients (20. 77 %). Complete regression with absence of residual cancer was reported in 6 patients (5. 21 %). The sphincter sparing surgery was performed in 38 patients (33. 04 %). The procedures performed were resections considered low and very low, with total mesorectal excision and ratio hand sewn anastomosis/double stappled anastomosis was 20 to 18.

Our study found high levels of PAI- 1 only on unmanipulated adipose tissue samples of rats fed with high-energy food, which posteriorly became low in the same rats after change of their diet regimen. Carter and Church (2012) demonstrated that the native mature fat cells of breast seems to represent a greater threat to breast cancer than fat cells from other regions and, even higher than immature adipocytes or stem cells. In addition, fat cells are widely present in our body and {{there is no evidence that}} a fat grafting procedure by itself would bring additional oncological risk to a region that is already surrounded by adipose tissue.|$|R
40|$|Patients with <b>oncological</b> <b>conditions</b> {{are at an}} {{increased}} risk of developing a wide variety of complications from chemotherapy that they would not otherwise be exposed too. One such life threatening complication is tumor lysis syndrome, which is an oncology emergency that frequently lands patients in the intensive care unit. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurs most frequently after the initiation of chemotherapy or other chemotoxic drugs during the patients’ treatment course [8]. It causes faster than normal tumor cell breakdown and release of intracellular contents into the general circulation. [8]. This leads to a very predictable development of electrolyte imbalances to take place within the body, which if not treated can lead to end-organ damage as well as fatal cardiac dysrhythmias [8]. While TLS is fairly uncommon, there are specific factors that place some individuals at a higher risk of developing TLS then others. These include large tumor size, tumors with rapid cell division, and hematological cancers such as leukemia [3]. In addition, TLS can progress extremely quickly and has a high rate of morbidity and mortality [8]. It is important that nurses and physicians are educated and on the look out for TLS in high-risk individuals and initiate prophylactic treatment if indicated. Also, prompt recognition of TLS and initiation of treatment modalities is key to preventing end-organ damage and possibly death. In oncology specific intensive care units, such as the medical intensive care unit at The James Cancer Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, TLS {{is one of the most}} common reasons for patients to receive continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) after sepsis. The purpose of this poster is to provide information to nurses on general oncology floors so that they are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of TLS early, in the hopes that early identification and treatment will improve patient outcomes and decrease the number of patients with acute kidney injuries necessitating the need for CRRT...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{employment}} of dietary {{strategies such as}} ketogenic diets, which force cells to alter their energy source, has shown efficacy {{in the treatment of}} several diseases. Ketogenic diets are composed of high fat, moderate protein and low carbohydrates, which favour mitochondrial respiration rather than glycolysis for energy metabolism. DESIGN: This review focuses on how oncological, neurological and mitochondrial disorders have been targeted by ketogenic diets, their metabolic effects, and the possible mechanisms of action on mitochondrial energy homeostasis. The beneficial and adverse effects of the ketogenic diets are also highlighted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Although the full mechanism by which ketogenic diets improve <b>oncological</b> and neurological <b>conditions</b> still remains to be elucidated, their clinical efficacy has attracted many new followers, and ketogenic diets can be a good option as a co-adjuvant therapy, depending on the situation and the extent of the disease.

40|$|Obesity is {{considered}} a strong risk factor for renal cell carcinoma, the most common primary renal malignant neoplasm. An association between renal cell carcinoma and obesity {{has been reported in}} numerous trials. Several potential mechanisms may be responsible for the risk of renal cell carcinoma in obese subjects. We report the cases of two patients, submitted to bariatric malabsorbtive surgery, who presented a renal clear cell carcinoma several months after the operation. The diagnosis was made by routine postoperative ultrasound examination and confirmed by computed tomography in both cases. Both were treated surgically. Our approach after diagnosis of cancer consisted in evaluation of the patient's immunological, metabolic and nutritional status to establish whether {{it was a case of}} real malnutrition or an <b>oncological</b> risk <b>condition.</b> We judged that restoration of original gastrointestinal continuity was not necessary. In the literature, we found no evidence of an association between a cancer histotype and bariatric surgery. Confirming the association between renal cell carcinoma and morbid obesity, these case reports indicate the importance of imaging control, especially with non-invasive diagnostic studies, in high-risk cancer patients, such as obese patients, to detect lesions incidentally at an early stage. After a thorough review of the literature data, we consider bariatric patients a suitable group to be assessed for an early diagnosis of various types of cancer, detectable at preoperative or postoperative screening. Weight loss and continuous instrumental exams are conditions favourable to an early diagnosis. Guidelines regarding the management of oncological patients with a history of bariatric surgery are indispensable...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the modern technical society {{is linked to the}} use of ionizing radiation sources. In addition to nuclear power plants, there are the other significant ionizing radiation sources, for example, linear accelerators which are used both in radiography and in <b>oncological</b> therapy. The <b>conditions</b> for ionizing radiation source management become more and more stricter, and hence the higher demands are stipulated for the supervision of shielding structures of linear accelerators during their construction. The radiation density gauge for fast and flexible controls of the densities of fresh concrete mixtures has been successfully developed at the Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology. It is the radiation density gauge which revealed a serious failure during routine inspections of shielding concretes at a linear accelerator in the Brno Hospital. It was found that the density of heavy-weight concrete did not reach the prescribed calculated value. This failure was caused by a reduction of the density of heavy-weight aggregates used for production of heavy-weight concrete while {{it was not possible to}} remove this failure flexibly during construction. Hence, the placing of concrete was completed with the reduced density, and based upon the results of radiometric density measurements it was recommended to build an additional structure shield with different thick steel sheets. The final measurements of the regulatory body have proved that the additional shield was designed correctly. 1...|$|R
40|$|Owing to the {{heterogeneity}} of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), the availability of reliable circulating markers is critical for improving diagnostics, prognostic stratification, follow-up, and definition of treatment strategy. This review is focused on Chromogranin A (CgA), a hydrophilic glycoprotein present in large dense core vesicles of neuroendocrine cells. Despite being long identified as the most useful NEN-related circulating marker, clinical application of CgA is controversial. CgA assays still lack of standardization, thus hampering not only clinical management but also the comparison between different analyses. In the diagnostic setting, clinical utility of CgA is limited as hampered by a) the variety of <b>oncological</b> and non-oncological <b>conditions</b> affecting marker levels, which impairs specificity; b) the fact that 30 - 50 % of NENs show normal CgA, which impairs sensitivity. Regarding the prognostic phase, there is prospective evidence which demonstrates that advanced NENs secreting CgA have poorer outcome, as compared with those showing non-elevated marker levels. Although the identification of cut-offs allowing a proper risk stratification of CgA secreting patients has not been performed, this represents the most important clinical application of the marker. By contrast, based on prospective studies, the trend of elevated circulating CgA does not represent a valid indicator of morphological evolution and has therefore no utility for the follow-up phase. Ultimately, current knowledge {{about the role of}} the marker for the definition of treatment strategy is poor and is limited by the small number of available studies, their prevalent retrospective nature and the absence of control groups of untreated subjects...|$|R
40|$|Summary Aim of the study: {{to assess}} the need for palliative care {{services}} in care hospital and to examine the possibilities of satisfying patients need for palliative care. Objectives: 1.) to analize patients applying for services according to social, demographic and medical factors; 2.) to assess patients relatives oppinion {{about the quality of}} received services; 3.) to analise financial side of applied services and to realistically assess costs of services; 4.) to compare recourses granted by government with actual costs of services 5.) to analize the possibilities of applying palliative care services in palliative care hospital. Methods: the research was executed with the help of qualitive and quantitive methods in few stages: I. patients applying for services were analised according to social, demographic and medical factors using data from KCH registering books of year 2001 - 2003. II. Patient's relatives oppinion about the palliative care and quality of received services were analised. The relatives of patients in last stages of oncological and neuromothorical illnesses received questionnaires concerning this research. Research was executed 2004 July - December. 46 questionnaires were distributed. The response rate – 95, 7 %. The biggest part of respondens were women (61, 4 %). Data analysis was performed {{with the help of the}} statistical package SPSS 10. 03. Statistical procedures: chi- square's test c 2, the degree of freedom (df) and statistical value (p). The results were only regarded as significant if p< 0, 05. III. Costs of services were analised using financial summarys from 2002 – 2003. Actual costs of services were assessed and compared with the resources granted by government IV. Using the method of descriptional analysis possibilities of applying palliative care services in palliative care hospital were examined. Results: Most patients applying for palliative care services are over 65 years old (64, 9 %), live in cities (84, 9 %), have first group of disability (61 %), are lonely (18. 4 %), ill with <b>oncological</b> diseases. Difficult <b>condition</b> of patients shows great demand for palliative care services. 30. 1 % of patients were hospitalized the same day after turning up to hospital. 68. 8 % have been hospitalized for up to one month. 68. 4 % died. Statistically significant relation between period of time of being hospitalised and illness result was found (c 2 = 28, 007, df= 2, p< 0, 001). 40. 1 % of not hospitalized patients died before getting services. According to patient’s relatives questionnaire 40. 9 % of patients did not have family connections at that stage, 36. 2 % were hospitalized because of lack of possibilities to get services at home. 27. 3 % of patients were registered for services by their doctors. 40. 9 % of patients were aware of their diagnosis, 95. 5 % informed their families. 56. 8 % did not know what palliative medicine was. 54. 5 % of patient’s family members have stated that fighting with pain was not effective enough, 52. 3 % said that doctors discussed treating plans with them, 31. 8 % thought, that middle personel really took care of their problems. 31. 8 % believed that cancer could be avoided, 51. 9 % accepted the importance profilactics. Work of hospital staff was evaluated good and very good by 86. 3 % of patient’s relatives. Resources granted by government are not sufficient to provide patients with high quality services. Actual expenses for one-day service should be 2. 2 times bigger, palliative care expenses should be 4. 4 times bigger than now. Qualitative analysis shows that having adequate financing, hospital would be able to provide palliative care services. Conclusions: 1. The number of hospitalized patients increased 16. 8 % during 2001 / 03. Meanwhile financing did not change significantly. The number of patients could be increased only due to resources available from paid services and charity funds. In 2002 one bed has been occupied for 320. 3 days, 2003 - 342. 5 days. 2. Resources granted by government are not sufficient to provide patients with high quality services. Analysis of financing from Ministry of Health revealed it to be 2. 2 times less than actual expenses of services. 3. Analysis of results of given research concerning possibilities of applying palliative care services in care hospital revealed realistic potential of hospital to provide mentioned services if sufficient funding was applied...|$|R
