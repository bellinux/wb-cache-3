5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was generally}} well-received, and garnered its TVTV production team the 1974 Alfred I. du Pont/Columbia University Award in Broadcast Journalism. The documentary received a negative {{review in the}} New York Post, and positive reviews in The New York Times, The Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Sun-Times. The San Francisco Bay Guardian wrote that the TVTV team had improved since their previous work but wanted them to move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> challenging subjects.|$|E
5|$|During a {{geological}} survey on Surata IV, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) {{is struck by}} a thorn growing on a motile vine plant. The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise, where Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker's body. Within a matter of hours, the virus will reach Riker's brain, killing him. To try to save Riker's life, Pulaski puts him into a machine that will artificially stimulate his brain neurons, keeping them active and resisting the virus. This causes Riker to dream of his past adventures aboard the Enterprise. Riker's first dreams are of reasonably neutral occasions, such as {{his first meeting with}} Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner). He soon moves <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> passionate and even erotic dreams, such as meeting the cheerful young Edo women on Rubicon III, the matriarch Beata (Karen Montgomery) on Angel One, or the computer-generated holodeck woman Minuet (Carolyn McCormick).|$|E

25|$|Joseph Henry Scattergood (January 26, 1877 – June 15, 1953) was an American cricketer, {{active in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Scattergood {{was one of the}} Philadelphian cricketers that played {{from the end of the}} 19th century through the early years of the next. Scattergood was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a {{prominent}} Quaker family. He began his sports career as a baseball catcher, but was converted to a wicket-keeper while a student at Haverford College. While at Haverford, Scattergood also played football and tennis and served as the treasurer and secretary of his class. In 1895, he graduated from Haverford with honors in mathematics before going <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> schooling at Harvard University.

25|$|Promotion {{from one}} geup {{to the next}} can proceed rapidly in some schools, since schools often allow geup {{promotions}} every two, three, or four months. Students of geup rank learn the most basic techniques first, and then move <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>more</b> advanced techniques as they approach first dan. Many of the older and more traditional schools often take longer to allow students to test for higher ranks than newer, more contemporary schools, as {{they may not have}} the required testing intervals. In contrast, promotion from one dan to the next can take years. In fact, some styles impose age or time-in-rank limits on dan promotions. For example, the number of years between one dan promotion to the next may be limited to a minimum of the practitioner's current dan-rank, so that (for example) a 5th dan practitioner must wait 5 years to test for 6th dan.|$|E

Imam Ramee, an American, spoke on behalf of HT while living in Manchester, and was the featured speaker at the HT organized Muslim Unity Action March against the war in Iraq on March 15, 2003. He was reportedly an associate of Abu Hamza al-Masri, and is said to have preached to “shoe bomber” Richard Reid, along with Hanif and Sharif, at the North London Mosque in Finsbury Park.|$|E

Desire, passion, family, and identity are among Almodóvar's most prevalent themes.|$|E
