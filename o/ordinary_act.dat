The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an <b>ordinary</b> <b>act</b> of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E

25|$|As a {{transitional}} measure, {{for the first}} three years after the election of the first President of Ireland a bill to amend the Constitution could be passed by the Oireachtas as an <b>ordinary</b> <b>act.</b> An amendment bill before the election of the first President (on 25 June 1938) would have required a referendum. To prevent the Oireachtas abusing this provision, the President had the power to refer such a bill to the people. The First and Second Amendments were adopted in this way; President Douglas Hyde chose to sign each into law without referendum. The three-year limit was entrenched to prevent it being extended without referendum. Since 25 June 1941, the third anniversary of President Hyde's election, every amendment has had to follow the pattern of passage through the Oireachtas followed by a referendum.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{the rights}} and freedoms that are {{protected}} under the Charter, including the rights to freedom of speech, habeas corpus and the presumption of innocence, have their roots {{in a set of}} Canadian laws and legal precedents sometimes known as the Implied Bill of Rights. Many of these rights were also included in the Canadian Bill of Rights, which the Canadian Parliament enacted in 1960. However, the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of shortcomings. Unlike the Charter, it was an <b>ordinary</b> <b>Act</b> of Parliament, which could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament, and it was applicable only to the federal government. The courts also chose to interpret the Bill of Rights conservatively, only on rare occasions applying it to find a contrary law inoperative. The Bill of Rights did not contain all {{of the rights}} that are now included in the Charter, omitting, for instance, the right to vote and freedom of movement within Canada.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it has been}} {{suggested}} that the enactment of a statute by Parliament in the face of an adverse report by the PCMR should be taken as a [...] "mere disagreement over the interpretation of the Constitution and thus should not foreclose judicial review". However, this depends on whether the statute in question is a constitutional amendment or an <b>ordinary</b> <b>Act</b> of Parliament. Acts of Parliament may be disputed in court for their lack of compliance with the Constitution, but constitutional amendments may not be.|$|E
2500|$|However, these {{amendments}} {{were made}} to the 1963 State Constitution; the amendment Acts were silent on whether they applied to the RSIA. Thus, although Parliament has made no attempt to amend the RSIA since 1965, it can theoretically be changed or even repealed by a simple majority in Parliament. One problem this raises is even though the RSIA is categorized by the Government as a [...] "constitutional document", legally speaking it is apparently not part of the consolidated Constitution. Constitutional scholar Dr. Kevin Tan has suggested it should be recognized as a sui generis Act having a unique status. It may be that the RSIA's status {{is similar to that of}} the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, which is also an <b>ordinary</b> <b>Act</b> of Parliament. It has been said that while it is theoretically possible to amend or repeal the Bill of Rights Act by a simple majority of the New Zealand Parliament, [...] "any government intent on repeal or restrictive amendment of the Bill of Rights is likely to suffer extreme political difficulty and opprobrium".|$|E

When {{convinced}} that she was dead, Murlock had sense enough to remember that the dead must be prepared for burial. In performance of this sacred duty he blundered now and again, did certain things incorrectly, and others which he did correctly were done over and over. His occasional failures to accomplish some simple and <b>ordinary</b> <b>act</b> filled him with astonishment, like that of a drunken man who wonders at the suspension of familiar natural laws. He was surprised, too, that he did not weep--surprised and a little ashamed; surely it is unkind not to weep for the dead. [...] "To-morrow," [...] he said aloud, [...] "I shall have to make the coffin and dig the grave; and then I shall miss her, when she is no longer in sight; but now--she is dead, of course, but it is all right--it must be all right, somehow.

60|$|It was but an <b>ordinary</b> <b>act</b> of politeness in Stephen; it {{had hardly}} taken two minutes; and Lucy, who was singing, {{scarcely}} noticed it. But to Philip's mind, filled already with a vague anxiety that {{was likely to}} find a definite ground for itself in any trivial incident, this sudden eagerness in Stephen, and the change in Maggie's face, which was plainly reflecting a beam from his, seemed so strong a contrast with the previous overwrought signs of indifference, as {{to be charged with}} painful meaning. Stephen's voice, pouring in again, jarred upon his nervous susceptibility {{as if it had been}} the clang of sheet-iron, and he felt inclined to make the piano shriek in utter discord. He had really seen no communicable ground for suspecting any ususual feeling between Stephen and Maggie; his own reason told him so, and he wanted to go home at once that he might reflect coolly on these false images, till he had convinced himself of their nullity. But then, again, he wanted to stay as long as Stephen stayed,--always to be present when Stephen was present with Maggie. It seemed to poor Philip so natural, nay, inevitable, that any man who was near Maggie should fall in love with her! There was no promise of happiness for her if she were beguiled into loving Stephen Guest; and this thought emboldened Philip to view his own love for her in the light of a less unequal offering. He was beginning to play very falsely under this deafening inward tumult, and Lucy was looking at him in astonishment, when Mrs. Tulliver's entrance to summon them to lunch came as an excuse for abruptly breaking off the music.|$|E

The theoretical model predicts that 'scandalous' legislation tends to be passed {{at the beginning of}} the legislature, while 'non scandalous', broader legislation, is approved mostly at the end of the legislation.
