5|$|The first {{chemistry}} {{experiments were}} performed using gas thermochromatography in 2001, using 172Os and 173Os as a reference. During the experiment, 5 hassium atoms were synthesized using the reaction 248Cm(26Mg,5n)269Hs.

5|$|Free <b>oxygen</b> <b>gas</b> {{was almost}} nonexistent in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free oxygen {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|Given that E°(O2/H2O) = +1.229V, {{which is}} less than +1.395V, it would be {{expected}} that chlorine {{should be able to}} oxidise water to oxygen and hydrochloric acid. However, the kinetics of this reaction are unfavorable, and there is also a bubble overpotential effect to consider, so that electrolysis of aqueous chloride solutions evolves chlorine gas and not <b>oxygen</b> <b>gas,</b> a fact that is very useful for the industrial production of chlorine.|$|E

Potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks, as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and <b>oxygen</b> <b>gas.</b> Pure potassium metal is not often used, but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of <b>oxygen</b> <b>gas</b> on Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century {{scientists}} realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it. Using a cascade method, Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide {{in order to}} liquefy carbon dioxide, which in turn was evaporated to cool <b>oxygen</b> <b>gas</b> enough to liquefy it. He sent a telegram on December 22, 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen. Just two days later, French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. Only {{a few drops of}} the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted. Oxygen was liquified in a stable state {{for the first time on}} March 29, 1883 by Polish scientists from Jagiellonian University, Zygmunt Wróblewski and Karol Olszewski.|$|E

40|$|Key words：flue <b>gas</b> <b>oxygen</b> content; {{intelligent}} hybrid prediction method; GM (1, 1) grey prediction method; {{principal component}} analysis; case-based reasoning. Abstract. Focusing {{on the problem}} which power plant flue <b>gas</b> <b>oxygen</b> content is hard to predict efficiently, an intelligent hybrid prediction method is proposed. First, the RBF neural network and principal component analysis method are utilized to reduce the dimension of the input variables. Second, the case-based reasoning method is carried on to predict the flue <b>gas</b> <b>oxygen</b> content based on the above analysis results. Then, in order to reflect {{the cumulative effect of}} the flue <b>gas</b> <b>oxygen</b> content with time, the GM (1, 1) grey prediction method is used to predict the current flue <b>gas</b> <b>oxygen</b> content value. Finally, the final flue <b>gas</b> <b>oxygen</b> content is obtained by the variance-covariance method of weight combination forecasting. Simulations and industrial results show that the proposed intelligent hybrid prediction model has high accuracy and robustness, and can solve the problem of predicting the flue <b>gas</b> <b>oxygen</b> content effectively...|$|R
5|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and <b>oxygen</b> <b>gas</b> at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when nitric oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E

5|$|For some {{of these}} processes, the {{presence}} of nitrogen or <b>oxygen</b> <b>gases</b> might cause defects within the material. Argon is used in some types of arc welding such as {{gas metal arc welding}} and gas tungsten arc welding, {{as well as in the}} processing of titanium and other reactive elements.

40|$|The {{texturization}} of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) surfaces {{is achieved}} at atmospheric pressure {{by using the}} post-discharge of a radio-frequency plasma torch supplied in helium and <b>oxygen</b> <b>gases.</b> The surface properties are characterized by contact angle measurement, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. We show that the plasma treatment increases the surface hydrophobicity (with water contact angles increasing from 115 to 155 °) only by modifying the PTFE surface morphology and not the stoichiometry. Measurements of sample mass losses correlated to the ejection of CF 2 fragments from the PTFE surface evidenced an etching mechanism at atmospheric pressure. Poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) surfaces have been texturized at atmospheric pressure by using the post-discharge of a radio-frequency plasma torch supplied in helium and <b>oxygen</b> <b>gases.</b> An etching mechanism of the surface has been highlighted by correlating the mass losses measurements to the ejection of CF 2 fragments from the PTFE surface and {{to an increase in}} the surface hydrophobicity.

25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{most commonly}} {{available as a}} solution in water. For consumers, it is usually available from pharmacies at 3 and 6 wt% concentrations. The concentrations are sometimes {{described in terms of}} the volume of <b>oxygen</b> <b>gas</b> generated; one milliliter of a 20-volume solution generates twenty milliliters of <b>oxygen</b> <b>gas</b> when completely decomposed. For laboratory use, 30 wt% solutions are most common. Commercial grades from 70% to 98% are also available, but due to the potential of solutions of more than 68% hydrogen peroxide to be converted entirely to steam and oxygen (with the temperature of the steam increasing as the concentration increases above 68%) these grades are potentially far more hazardous and require special care in dedicated storage areas. Buyers must typically allow inspection by commercial manufacturers.|$|E
