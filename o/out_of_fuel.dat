5|$|On 22 September 1950, two EF-84Es, {{flown by}} David C. Schilling and Col. William Ritchie, flew across the North Atlantic from Great Britain to the United States. Ritchie's {{aircraft}} ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> over Newfoundland {{but the other}} successfully made the crossing which took ten hours two minutes and three aerial refuelings. The flight demonstrated {{that large numbers of}} fighters could be rapidly moved across the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The game ends {{in defeat}} if the player crashes, runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> or is {{shot down by}} taking too much damage. The player can also eject, but {{can only do so}} safely over Allied territory. The player is victorious if they defeat all enemy forces. During the game, points are awarded and {{displayed}} in the control panel for destroyed enemies and on game end tallied up in a high score table.|$|E
5|$|There {{was another}} {{controversial}} incident in 1991. Prost's inferior Ferrari {{was unable to}} put up a challenge regularly to Senna's frontrunning McLaren. At the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Prost battled Senna for 4th place, but he felt Senna defended too aggressively and at the first chicane forced Prost to take avoiding action by using the escape road. Prost stalled his car rejoining the race. Coincidentally, Senna ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> on the last lap at the very same point.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1860s and '70s {{there were}} already fears that civilization would run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fossil <b>fuels</b> and the need was felt for a better source. In 1873 Professor Augustin Mouchot wrote: ...|$|R
5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel.</b> However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
5|$|Bond is {{imprisoned in}} a holding cell, but escapes by {{crawling}} through an air vent. Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear pool reactor. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat as the entire lair explodes. After the boat runs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a Royal Navy ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's tow rope.|$|E
5|$|Brad Keselowski won {{the pole}} position, {{although}} he was almost immediately passed by Tony Stewart {{at the start of}} the race. Many Chase for the Sprint Cup participants, including Jimmie Johnson, Kurt Busch, and Hamlin, were in the top ten for most of the race, although some encountered problems in the closing laps. Stewart was leading the race with two laps remaining but ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> giving the lead, and the win, to Bowyer. There were twenty-one lead changes among eight different drivers, as well as eight cautions during the race.|$|E
50|$|Amber Rudd (energy {{secretary}} from 11 May 2015) {{announced on}} 18 November 2015 that all coal-fired power stations would close by 2025. This {{will not be}} a complete phase <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fossil <b>fuels</b> because new gas-fired power stations will replace them.|$|R
50|$|Only a {{few million}} years ago, IC 418 was {{probably}} a common red giant star. Since running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>fuel,</b> though, the outer envelope has begun expanding outward leaving a hot remnant core destined to become a white dwarf star.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1970s, GM {{was using}} powerplants sourced from various GM {{divisions}} where the Buick V8 {{was considered a}} factory option with the Buick 350 as the sole survivor, or in the worst case, for Buick vehicles where the 400/430/455 big blocks were phased <b>out</b> because <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> economy/emission requirements.|$|R
5|$|By lap 50, Johnson passed Reutimann to {{move back}} into the top ten. On lap 58, Kurt Busch passed Newman to claim the lead. Three laps later, Jeff Gordon claimed fifth {{position}} off Kahne, while Menard was passed by Johnson for eighth. On lap 63, Montoya moved into the third position after passing Biffle, while Gilliland went to his garage to retire from the race. Two laps later, Kyle Busch claimed seventh position off Kahne, as Montoya passed Newman for second on lap 66. On lap 67, Gordon and Biffle passed Newman for third and fourth positions. Four laps later, Johnson claimed seventh from Kahne. On lap 80, Reutimann ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> forcing {{him to make a}} pit stop.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{fuel stop}} at Nicosia International Airport, the pilots {{were forced to}} fly towards Munich-Riem Airport, where the hijackers {{initially}} had intended the exchange to take place. When the aircraft had arrived in Austrian airspace at around noon and it became evident that their demands could not be fulfilled in time, this plan was changed, and the Lufthansa crew had to divert instead to Zagreb {{in what was then}} the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, circling over Zagreb Airport until the Black September members had been brought there. This put the Germans under a pressure of time, as the aircraft would eventually run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel.</b>|$|E
5|$|Jeff Gordon won {{the pole}} position, {{although}} he was almost immediately passed by Kasey Kahne {{at the start of}} the race. Many Chase for the Sprint Cup participants, including Jimmie Johnson and Carl Edwards encountered problems during the race.

5|$|Kyle Busch {{maintained}} a 1.4 second lead over Kurt Busch by the 249th lap. Three laps later, Keselowski {{drove out of}} his garage to rejoin the race. By lap 262, drivers reported their cars were sliding in the corners as their tires became worn. Green flag pit stops began on lap 265; Kyle Busch maintained the lead {{at the end of}} the cycle, ahead of Reutimann and Kenseth. On the 290th lap, Kurt Busch's crew reported to him that he was running two laps short of fuel. Six laps later, Kyle Busch started to slow in the corners to conserve fuel. On the 298th lap, Martin dropped one position to run fifth. By the 302nd lap, overall speeds had dropped due to drivers starting to conserve fuel. Green flag pit stops began on lap 311, as Truex made a stop for fuel. Kyle Busch elected not to make a pit stop and increased his lead to four seconds by lap 314. Eight laps later, Kyle Busch was told by his team to reduce his speed. On lap 330, Kyle Busch drove to pit road, having run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> handing the lead to Kurt Busch. One lap later, Ambrose ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> as Kurt Busch held the lead to win his second race of the 2009 season. Hamlin finished second, ahead of Kenseth in third, Martin in fourth, and Harvick in fifth. Stewart, Bowyer, Biffle, Burton and A. J. Allmendinger rounded out the top ten finishers.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{found himself}} {{at the heart of}} the battle for the island before the {{squadron}} arrived. On 27 November the convoy came under attack from the Italian Navy in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. MacLachlan saw the Italian fleet at a distance and witnessed enemy shells splashing around the ship. He also witnessed an attack by Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers but they failed to damage the ships. Most of the Hurricanes that took off from the Argus fell into the water <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel.</b> The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|On lap 113, Burton {{moved up}} to sixth, while Jeff Gordon passed Earnhardt for {{eleventh}}. Allmendinger fell to twenty-fifth after pit stops due to having run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> on his way onto pit road. Three laps later, both Jeff Gordon and Earnhardt had passed Reutimann for tenth and eleventh respectively. By lap 120, Bowyer had a lead of about four seconds over Edwards. Four laps later, Harvick passed Montoya for fourteenth. On lap 132, Keselowski fell to ninth after being passed by Kurt Busch and Hamlin. On lap 147, Bowyer's lead of over seven seconds was reduced to nothing when the pace car moved on track. During the caution, which was caused by debris, most of the leaders made pit stops.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The {{threat posed}} by climate change and the striving for {{securities}} of energy supply are issues high on the political agenda these days. Governments are putting strategic plans in motion to decrease primary energy use, take carbon <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> and facilitate modal shifts. Taking a prominent place in these strategic plans is hydrogen as a future energy carrier. Energy stored in hydrogen would be available {{at any time and}} at any place on Earth, regardless of when or where the solar irradiance, the hydropower, or other renewable sources such as biomass, ocean energy or wind energy was converted. The fundamental variations in the times and places of solar energy supply and human energy demands can be overcome using hydrogen. Hydrogen gas combined with the standard air/fuel mixture increases the mileage. This form <b>of</b> alternative <b>fuel</b> is provided by a hydrogen generator mounted in the vehicle. Once set up i...|$|R

50|$|NGC 2818 is a {{planetary}} nebula {{located in the}} southern constellation Pyxis (The Compass). It consists largely of glowing gases from the star's outer layers ejected during {{the final stages of}} its life when it had run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fuel</b> necessary to sustain its core fusion processes. The remnants of its core will remain as a white dwarf.|$|R
5|$|On lap 22 Adrian Sutil crashed at turn {{four and}} the safety car had to be deployed; Hamilton had pitted just before the incident. Thus the pit lane was closed but Alonso and Nico Rosberg were forced to pit {{in order to avoid}} running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> and were given ten-second stop-and-go penalties. When the pit lane was re-opened {{and the rest of the}} field pitted, Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella left the pit lane while the red light was still on. Both were later disqualified from the race on lap 51.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter F.1 entered {{service with}} the Royal Air Force in July 1954. It {{was the first}} {{high-speed}} jet aircraft equipped with radar and fully powered flight controls to go into widespread service with the RAF. The Hunter replaced the Gloster Meteor, the Canadair Sabre, and the de Havilland Venom jet fighters in service. Initially, low internal fuel capacity restricted the Hunter's performance, giving it only a maximum flight endurance of about an hour. A tragic incident occurred on 8 February 1956, when a flight of eight Hunters was redirected to another airfield owing to adverse weather conditions. Six of the eight aircraft ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> and crashed, killing one pilot.|$|E
5|$|The Tupolev Tu-70 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Cart) was a Soviet passenger {{variant of}} the Tu-4 bomber (which was a reverse-engineered copy of the American-made Boeing B-29 Superfortress) designed immediately {{after the end of}} World War II. It used a number of components from Boeing B-29s that had made emergency landings in the Soviet Union after running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> after bombing Japan. It had the first pressurized fuselage in the Soviet Union and first flew on 27 November 1946. The aircraft was successfully tested, recommended for serial production, but ultimately not produced because of more pressing military orders and because Aeroflot had no requirement for such an aircraft.|$|E

50|$|Arriving on 23 September, S-32 {{departed}} {{again on}} 8 October. During a trim dive, a fuel discrepancy, {{caused by the}} presence of water in the line during fueling at Dutch Harbor, was discovered.

The discrepancy was approximately 9000 gallons, but S-32 continued west, into the Kuril Islands.|$|R
5|$|The fire's spread only {{stopped when}} {{it reached the}} 30th floor, {{which was the first}} fire-affected floor to have {{automatic}} sprinklers. Ten sprinklers extinguished the fire on the 30th floor and prevented continued spread. Contained by the automatic sprinklers and running <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel,</b> the fire was declared under control at 3:01 PM. The fire lasted over nineteen hours, destroyed eight floors, and killed three firefighters and injured twenty-four. Twelve alarms were called, which brought fifty-one engine companies, fifteen ladder companies, eleven specialized units, and over three hundred firefighters. The fire caused an estimated US$100 million in direct property loss.|$|E
5|$|To {{ground the}} play in reality, Kooman {{researched}} human trafficking {{and met with}} survivors. He read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident, in which 121 people were trafficked from Burma to Thailand and left in a locked water tank, which was then abandoned by its drivers and discovered only after 54 of the people had died from suffocation or hyperthermia. The truck carrying the water tank had been abandoned because it ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel.</b> When the truck was discovered in April 2008, it contained men, women, and children. Knowing {{that many of the}} impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play.|$|E
5|$|When {{the main}} attacking Japanese force has been located, the player must send all {{available}} air units to engage them in combat. Air combat takes place over real time, and may {{take up to}} a minute of travel time once launched from an aircraft carrier. Aircraft will run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> over time and will crash if not refuelled at a carrier. The game contains elements of arcade gameplay, which will automatically enable once the player comes {{into contact with the}} enemy. The arcade sequences involves the player utilising an anti-air machine gun in order to shoot down Japanese aircraft. The game ends once all four Japanese aircraft carriers have been destroyed.|$|E
