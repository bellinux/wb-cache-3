25|$|One of Abu Tir's most {{noticeable}} physical attributes and trademarks is his bright orange beard. The orange {{is actually a}} dyed substance called henna, a natural dyestuff, which needs to be applied periodically {{in order to maintain}} its lustrous colour. In an interview with the Israeli Channel 10 television Abu Tir stated that he had decided to dye his beard with henna because the prophet Muhammad had done so and also because it was a remedy for headaches and dandruff. Islam bans the use <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> dyes; however, {{there is no mention of}} a ban on the use of other colours. Residents in his native village of Umm Tuba say that his signature beard does help him stand out when he is out campaigning at public events and functions.|$|E
500|$|The horns, {{which are}} found on {{both males and}} females, have two to three twists and are {{typically}} [...] in females and [...] in males, although the maximum recorded length is [...] The lower and mid portions of the horns are marked {{with a series of}} 30 to 35 ring-shaped ridges. The tail is short and slender, ending in a puff <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair.</b> The hooves are broad with flat soles and strong dewclaws to help them walk on soft sand. All four feet possess scent glands. The life span of the addax is up to 19 years in the wild, which can be extended to 25 years under captivity.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Gaga slowly {{appearing}} {{from behind a}} building on a deserted street corner. The whole scenario is bathed in red and violet lights, coming from {{the windows of the}} buildings and alleyways as steam billows out from the drains. When the first verse of the song begins, Gaga emerges from the window of an apartment onto the fire escape. A long take follows, of Gaga strutting through the red-lit district singing the line [...] "I got a reason that you should take me home tonight", and a shock <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> falls in her eyes. Gaga does not remove it and the shot spans to her walking backside, gesturing the viewer to follow. The video consists mostly of interchanging shots of Gaga dancing and singing on the street, on the fire escape, and on the steps in front of the apartment building with Clemons. Near the end of the video, after Clemons' saxophone solo, Gaga crouches in front of the building's steps and kisses the sidewalk. The video concludes with a close-up of Gaga's face, before she re-enters through the window into her smokey apartment.|$|E
50|$|Myrmecotypus is {{a spider}} genus that mimics ants. Species mainly occur Panama to Mexico, with one species {{found in the}} United States, and one in Argentina, {{suggesting}} distribution may be much wider than currently appreciated.M. rettenmeyeri has a strange longitudinal band <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> extending along the midline of the cephalothorax. This seems to enhance the resemblance to the ant Camponotus sericeiventris with which it shares the same habitat. The crests <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> correspond to the solid longitudinal keel-like dorsal extensions of the posterior sections of the ant's thorax.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed {{on various}} plants, {{including}} Alnus rubra and Quercus garryana. They are black with long tufts <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> along the dorsum {{of the body}} and pale yellow-white hairs along the lateral line.|$|R
50|$|It is {{considered}} a pest on Pinus radiata, but has also been recorded feeding on Acacia, Eucalyptus, Pultenaea, Dodonaea, Choretrum, Myoporum and Tamarix. The caterpillars are brown and hairy, with a pencil <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> each side <b>of</b> its head and a hairy tail.|$|R
2500|$|Willis {{later said}} [...] "he is very picturesque...part mulatto and part Indian. With {{more of the}} {{physiognomy}} of a Spaniard, with masses <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> curling slightly and gracefully, and his long mustache, giving quite an appearance. He is of middle size, but built for an athlete. With broad chest and shoulders, narrow hips and legs slightly bowed. Mammoth Cave is a wonder in which draws good society and Stephen shows that {{he is used to}} it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pope Benedict was {{a slight}} man. [...] He wore the {{smallest}} of three cassocks that were prepared for {{the election of a}} new pope in 1914, and became known as [...] "Il Piccoletto" [...] or [...] "The Little Man". Benedict XV was dignified in bearing and courtly in terms of matters, but his appearance was not that of a pope. He had a sallow [...] complexion, a mat <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> and prominent teeth. Everything about him seemed crooked, from his nose to his eyes and shoulders.|$|E
2500|$|Bay horses, {{which have}} a black mane, tail, and legs {{with a mixture of}} red and black hairs on the body coat, and seal brown horses, which have {{primarily}} black coats in addition to black [...] "points", with reddish or tan hairs around their muzzle, eyes, girth and flanks have one of two genotypes at the Agouti locus: A/A A/a. Both coat colors exhibit a broad range of potential shades due to a variety of factors including the bleaching or fading <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair,</b> nutrition, and the presence of sooty or countershading factors.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Crossopetalum species, {{but have}} also been {{recorded}} on Myginda ilicifolia. They are orange with tufts <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hairs.</b> Pupation {{takes place in a}} loose silk cocoon, covered in larval hairs. It is made on stems and leaves of the host plant.|$|R
50|$|The kowari is {{coloured}} ashy-grey, and its {{distinguishing feature}} is the brush <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> {{on the end of}} its tail, which differs from that found in the mulgaras (Dasycercus) in that it completely encircles the end of the tail. They have a life span of 3-6 years.|$|R
50|$|This {{butterfly}} has a 2.5 to 2.6 in wingspan. The male {{is a deep}} indigo blue on the upperside {{with the}} margins being paler. The females are darker brown with yellow subapical marks. Males have a tuft <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> on the second vein where it meets the median vein.|$|R
2500|$|Born {{and raised}} in rural Victoria, Cave studied art before turning to music in the 1970s. As {{frontman}} of the Boys Next Door (later renamed the Birthday Party), he became a central figure in Melbourne's burgeoning post-punk scene. The band relocated to London in 1980, but, disillusioned by life there, evolved towards a darker, more challenging sound, and acquired a reputation as [...] "the most violent live band in the world". The Birthday Party {{is regarded as a}} major influence on gothic rock, and Cave, with his shock <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and pale, emaciated look, was described in the media as a poster boy for the genre.|$|E
2500|$|The Apostle of Allah, may Allah bless him, {{is neither}} too short nor too tall. His hair are neither curly nor straight, but {{a mixture of}} the two. He is a man <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and large skull. His {{complexion}} has a tinge of redness. His shoulder bones are broad and his palms and feet are fleshy. He has long al-masrubah which means hair growing from neck to navel. He is of long eye-lashes, close eyebrows, smooth and shining fore-head and long space between two shoulders. When he walks he walks inclining as if coming down from a height. [...] I never saw a man like him before him or after him.|$|E
2500|$|Russell's {{measurements}} were 38D-24-36, {{and she stood}} 5ft 7 in (97-61-91cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque than most of her contemporaries. Her favorite co-star Bob Hope once introduced her as [...] "the two and only Jane Russell". He joked, [...] "Culture {{is the ability to}} describe Jane Russell without moving your hands." [...] Howard Hughes said, [...] "There are two good reasons why men go to see her. Those are enough." [...] A publicity still for the movie showed her lying on a pile of straw, her blouse stretched tight across her voluptuous breasts. Her right hand was behind her head <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> and her left hand held a revolver. The image was a popular pin-up photo with servicemen during World War II. She did not appear in another movie until 1946, when she played Joan Kenwood in Young Widow for RKO.|$|E
5000|$|Similar to B. magnus, {{the yellow}} collar of B. cryptarum extends further below the wing {{than that of}} B. lucorum. Also, it has a thin [...] "S"-shaped line <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> through its yellow collar. In addition, the queens of B. cryptarum emerge before B. magnus or B. lucorum during the colony initiation.|$|R

2500|$|In {{his early}} days, Trueman had very fast pace but {{tended to be}} wayward and was liable to be punished accordingly. His natural hostility in that period earned him his famous {{nickname}} of [...] "Fiery Fred". As time went by, much of the belligerence and raw pace faded being replaced by a growing mastery of the bowling arts. Strength, determination and stamina were always among Trueman's greatest attributes and with maturity came a control of both seam and swing. In Warr's view, Trueman learned that it was unwise to always follow a boundary with a bouncer and instead he cultivated the yorker as [...] "a potent weapon". Trueman {{was one of the}} most charismatic cricketers of the post-war period and this charisma has been summarised by Mick Pope and Paul Dyson in [...] "the rolling up of the flapping shirt sleeve on the walk back to his mark; the tossing back of the wayward locks <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair</b> before the smooth accelerated run to the wicket culminating with a high cartwheel action and drag of the back foot through the crease", the conclusion being that [...] "Trueman is one of English cricket's icons".|$|E
2500|$|One {{year before}} the release of Mythologies, Quan Chi made a single-episode {{appearance}} in the 1996 animated series [...] He is an independent sorcerer who has an allegiance to no one, and is first seen watching a future vision of the Earthrealm defenders battling Shao Kahn's cybernetic soldiers. When this event actually occurs, he teleports himself uninterrupted {{to the realm of}} Zaterra, where he enters a cave and steals a glowing red crystal called the gem of Tetsurri. He then passes through a portal into Earthrealm {{in the guise of a}} youth (simply a smaller, thinner version of himself with a head <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hair)</b> seeking sanctuary from Outworld. As part of his ruse, Quan Chi exposes the Earth defenders to the gem when he offers it as a gift. Kitana prevents the team from accepting it, but it nonetheless triggers acute personality changes that cause increased hostility among the heroes. According to Raiden, the gem contains powers that darken the human soul, and its effects will only get worse over time. The Earthrealmers travel to Zaterra amidst much infighting to find and destroy the gem. As Nightwolf was the only one not exposed to the gem, he is able to overcome Quan Chi's black magic and smash the object to pieces, thus breaking the spell over the Earthrealmers. Aghast at the foiling of his plans, Quan Chi disappears and the heroes escape the cave as he collapses it. He was voiced by Nick Chinlund, and his name was hyphenated in the episode title ("The Secret of Quan-Chi").|$|E

50|$|A {{long history}} of {{confusion}} exists when classifying mulgaras, and only recently has confidence in identifying the two species been gained. Identification of the species has been greatly assisted by detailed genetic and morphological studies of museum specimens. The most distinguishing feature in identifying the two species is the crest of hair on the tail. The crest-tailed mulgara has a crest <b>of</b> long <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> on the upper side of the distal end of the tail, while the brush-tailed mulgara has a brush <b>of</b> <b>black</b> <b>hairs</b> along the final two-thirds of the tail. The two species also have a slightly different dental formation, which is difficult to observe in live animals, and the brush-tailed mulgara has six nipples while the crest-tailed Mulgara has eight. Mulgaras are distributed through the arid regions of Western Australia where they live in short burrows. The crest-tailed mulgara is listed as vulnerable.|$|R
