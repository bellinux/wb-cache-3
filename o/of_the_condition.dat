5|$|A {{definitive}} diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> {{can usually}} be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|Actor Michael J. Fox has PD and {{has greatly}} {{increased}} the {{public awareness of}} the disease. After diagnosis, Fox embraced his Parkinson's in television roles, sometimes acting without medication, in order to further illustrate the effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition.</b> He has written two autobiographies in which his fight against the disease plays a major role, and appeared before the United States Congress without medication to illustrate the effects of the disease. The Michael J. Fox Foundation aims to develop a cure for Parkinson's disease. Fox received an honorary doctorate in medicine from Karolinska Institutet for his contributions to research in Parkinson's disease.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Weak Bourbaki unmixed {{rings are}} defined in this paper. <b>The</b> {{definition}} <b>of</b> a weak Bourbaki unmixed ring {{is a candidate}} for an “appropriate ” definition of Cohen-Macaulayness. We will see that this definition satisfies many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions</b> we want an “appropriate ” definition to satisfy. It is not yet known whether this definition (or any other) satisfies all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, no example has been found of a weak Bourbaki unmixed ring which violates one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
5|$|An {{equivalent}} way of {{stating the}} same condition is that, if the angles are partitioned into two alternating subsets, then {{the sum of}} the angles in either of the two subsets is exactly 180 degrees. However, this equivalent form applies only to a crease pattern on a flat piece of paper, whereas the alternating sum form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> remains valid for crease patterns on conical sheets of paper with nonzero defect at the vertex.|$|E
5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition,</b> but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E
5|$|At least 40% {{of people}} with aphthous {{stomatitis}} have a positive family history, suggesting {{that some people are}} genetically predisposed to suffering with oral ulceration. HLA-B12, HLA-B51, HLA-Cw7, HLA-A2, HLA-A11, and HLA-DR2 are examples of human leukocyte antigen types associated with aphthous stomatitis. However, these HLA types are inconsistently associated with the condition, and also vary according to ethnicity. People who have a positive family history of aphthous stomatitis tend to develop a more severe form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition,</b> and at an earlier age than is typical.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process {{that might have been}} far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming King that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|From 1691 until around 1860 {{there had}} been no choir at the cathedral. There was also no organ for some time. Browne Willis' 1719 account {{describes}} the ruins of an organ given to the cathedral by Lady Kemysh of Cefn Mably found in the organ loft at that time. In 1860, Alfred Ollivant, who was then Bishop of Landaff, published a book, Some Account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Condition</b> of the Fabric of Llandaff Cathedral, from 1575 to the present time, intended to raise funds to restore the cathedral's choir and to purchase a new organ.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{primary goal}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{study was to}} {{identify}} <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> catecholamines and <b>the</b> associated receptors which might be involved in <b>the</b> recall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> NK cell response. Specific catecholamine receptor antagonists were selected to block <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> NK cell response at the recall step. <b>The</b> regional contents <b>of</b> dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine were determined in <b>the</b> brain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> animals by using the high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection (HPLC/ED). Results showed that pre-disruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central alpha 1 -, alpha 2 -, beta 1 -, beta 2 -, D 1 -, or D 2 -receptors at <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> recall stage, interrupted <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> enhancement in NK cell activity. The NE contents at the cerebellum, and DA contents at the striatum and hippocampus, were significantly higher in <b>the</b> brain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> animals when compared to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control animals. These information indicated <b>the</b> possible roles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems in regulating <b>the</b> recall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>conditioned</b> NK cell response.

5|$|Osteochondrosis, or {{surficial}} pits in bone {{at places}} where bones articulate, {{is also known}} in Edmontosaurus. This condition, resulting from cartilage failing {{to be replaced by}} bone during growth, was found to be present in 2.2% of 224edmontosaur toe bones. The underlying cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> is unknown. Genetic predisposition, trauma, feeding intensity, alterations in blood supply, excess thyroid hormones, and deficiencies in various growth factors have been suggested. Among dinosaurs, osteochondrosis (like tumors) is most commonly found in hadrosaurids.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} findings typically include jaundice {{and right}} upper quadrant tenderness. Charcot's triad {{is a set}} of three common findings in cholangitis: abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. This was assumed in the past to be present in 50–70% of cases, although more recently the frequency has been reported as 15–20%. Reynolds' pentad includes the findings of Charcot's triad with the presence of septic shock and mental confusion. This combination of symptoms indicates worsening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> and the development of sepsis, and is seen less commonly still.|$|E

5|$|Studies of {{rumination}} in {{otherwise healthy}} adults became decreasingly rare {{starting in the}} 1900s, {{and the majority of}} published reports analyzing the syndrome in mentally healthy patients appeared thereafter. At first, adult rumination was described and treated as a benign condition. It is now described as otherwise. While the base of patients to examine has gradually increased as more and more people come forward with their symptoms, awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> by the medical community and the general public is still limited.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. In order to inherit it, {{both of the}} parents of an individual must carry an affected gene. Most have no family history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition.</b> People with only one abnormal gene are called carriers (heterozygotes) and may have mild, but medically insignificant, abnormalities of copper metabolism.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sites of}} copper {{accumulation}} are {{the liver and}} the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, {{who tend to be}} in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>condition</b> but have not received a diagnosis.|$|E
