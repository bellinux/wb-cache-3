Up to the Ra-LPS structure, the calculated model dimensions were in good agreement with experimental data and were 2. 4 nm for lipid A, 2. 8 nm for Re-LPS, 3. 5 nm for Rd-LPS, and 4. 4 nm for Ra-LPS. The maximum length of a stretched S-form LPS model bearing four repeating units was evaluated to be 9. 6 nm; however, energetically favored LPS conformations showed the <b>O-specific</b> <b>chain</b> bent with respect to the Ra-LPS portion and significantly smaller dimensions (about 5. 0 to 5. 5 nm). According to the calculations, the Ra-LPS moiety has an approximately cylindrical shape and is conformationally well defined, in contrast to the <b>O-specific</b> <b>chain,</b> which was found to be the most flexible portion within the molecule...|$|E

40|$|Rabbits were immunized {{with the}} enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) -immunogenic strain Escherichia coli F 470. ECA-specific {{antiserum}} {{was obtained by}} absorbing the resulting antisera with the genetically closely related ECA-negative strain E. coli F 1283. These two strains also served as positive and negative controls in the localization study of ECA in Yersinia enterocolitica strain 75, smooth and rough forms (Ye 75 S and Ye 75 R), by the indirect immunoferritin technique. Cells of Ye 75 S grown at 22 degrees C showed no labeling with ferritin after treatment with the ECA-specific antiserum and subsequent ferritin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. If the cells were grown at 40 degrees C, however, most of the cells showed weak ferritin labeling. At this higher growth temperature, the lipopolysaccharide of this strain contains less <b>O-specific</b> <b>chains</b> (6 -deoxy-L-altrose), as was shown in a previous study. The rough mutant Ye 75 R, which lacks <b>O-specific</b> <b>chains</b> completely, showed denser labeling with ferritin. These results indicate that ECA on the cell surface of Ye 75 S is covered by <b>O-specific</b> <b>chains</b> of the lipopolysaccharide if grown at 22 degrees C and is therefore not accessible to ECA antibodies. It becomes accessible, however, when O-chains are lacking (R mutants) or when they are reduced in size or amount (growth at 40 degrees C) ...|$|R

The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding activities of the recombinant CRD-N and CRD-C (rCRD-N and rCRD-C) were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The LPS binding of rCRD-N and rCRD-C was pH-dependent: at pH below 6. 0, they show a higher binding ability to LPS. The binding of the rCRD-N was inhibited by both D-mannose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, whereas the binding of the rCRD-C was inhibited only by D-mannose.

40|$|For {{identification}} of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -associated epitopes of Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, LPS of strain Philadelphia 1 was investigated using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The <b>O-specific</b> <b>chain</b> of LPS is a homopolymer of 5 -acetamidino- 7 -acetamido- 8 -O-acetyl- 3, 5, 7, 9 -tetradeoxy-D-glycero- L-galacto- nonulosonic acid. At least four immunoaccessible epitopes were recognized by different MAbs on the intact LPS. After O-deacetylation of LPS, the reactivity {{of one of}} the MAbs (MAb 3 / 1) was lost, indicating thus that the corresponding epitope is associated with the 8 -O-acetyl group. Since the reactivity pattern of the MAb 3 / 1 is identical with those of the MAb 2 which was considered as a virulence marker for serogroup 1, this epitope may be involved in mediating virulence in L. pneumophila. Four MAbs specific to strains of serogroup 1 other than the monoclonal subtype Philadelphia recognized epitopes on the O-deacetylated LPS of strain Philadelphia 1 and, therefore, the virulence-associated epitope blocks recognition of the immunodeterminants that are accessible on the intact LPS of the strains lacking this epitope...|$|E

The polysaccharides are free of typical capsule components like hexuronic or aminohexuronic acids but contain (except that of strain 39 / 2) substantial amounts of phosphorus. A number of unusual o-methyl sugars (2 -o-methyl-D-galactose, 2, 3 -di-o-methyl-D-galactose, 2 -o-methyl-L-fucose) as well as 3, 6 -dideoxy-D-xylo-hexose (abequose) were identified in the R. gelatinosa polysaccharides. o-Methyl and dideoxy sugars however, are typical constituents of <b>O-specific</b> <b>chains</b> of the lipopolysaccharides of gram-negative bacteria (Rhodospirillaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively).

The results indicated that the <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chains</b> of nine serotypes are composed of oligosaccharide repeating units in the form of four alternative general structures in which a terminal DDH may vary. These structures are DDH [Formula: see text] 6 -deoxy-d-manno-heptose [Formula: see text] d-galactose (serogroups IA, IIA, and IVB), DDH [Formula: see text] d-mannose [Formula: see text] l-fucose (serogroups IB and IIB), and two configurations similar to the latter except that the 4 -position of l-fucose was either linked to the d-mannose residue (serogroups VA and VB) or to the DDH residue (serogroups III and IVA). In contrast, O-groups in lipopolysaccharide of the newly discovered serogroup VI contained the DDH colitose and 2 -acetamido- 2 -deoxy-d-galactose. Accordingly, all five known types of DDH have now been detected in lipopolysaccharides of Y. pseudotuberculosis.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{established}} that the well-known deproteinizing action of hot 45 % aqueous phenol on whole cells or isolated and purified endotoxin of Serratia marcescens 08 {{is caused by the}} cleavage of a phenol-sensitive linkage within the lipid moiety. As a result of this degradation, both the lipopolysaccharide and simple protein fragments retained a part of the lipid moiety. Although not proceeding at the same fast rate as the cleavage of the lipid moiety, such phenol treatment also caused a partial hydrolysis of the <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chain</b> and ester-bound fatty acids. Hydrolysis of the <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chain</b> accounted for 5 % of the lipopolysaccharide and that of ester-bound fatty acids accounted for 11 % of the total fatty acid content after 60 min of treatment.

The LPS species could be divided into ConA-reactive and non-reactive ones. Reactivity resided in the <b>O-specific</b> <b>chain</b> of LPS, and binding to the lipid A or core moieties of LPS could not be demonstrated by the present methods. The Î±-D-glucose or Î±-D-mannose residues of the repeating O-specific oligosaccharide units appeared to be recognized by ConA, except when blocked by steric hindrance. Specificity of the reaction was verified by inhibition with 2 % D-glucose. Binding by bacterium-specific sugar-residues could not be demonstrated. For precipitation to occur, polyvalency was required both for LPS and ConA, and the resulting precipitation appeared to be promoted by hydrophobic interactions between the lipid A moieties of LPS molecules. The LPS species were differently retained by the agarose gel, which can be explained by differences in their micellar structure in aqueous solution.

This antigen can induce autoantibodies, which {{may be involved in}} bacterial colonization and thus deserve further investigation. Flow cytometry was used {{to examine the effects of}} anti-Le monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) on H. pylori adhesion. A babA 2 mutant was also constructed to evaluate the effect of an anti-Lex MAb on adhesion. The bacterial agglutination and in situ adhesion assays were used to confirm the anti-Lex MAb effect on H. pylori adhesion. This study revealed that an anti-Lex MAb, but not an anti-Leb MAb or an anti-Ley MAb, could enhance the adhesion of H. pylori strains that expressed high levels of Lex antigen to AGS cells. The enhancement was not found on an H. pylori strain with a low level of Lex antigen. Anti-Lex MAb could increase the adhesion of both the wild-type strain and its isogenic babA 2 mutant to AGS cells. When AGS cells were pretreated with anti-Lex MAb, the adhesion of the babA 2 mutant also increased. Only anti-Lex MAb could promote bacterial agglutination, and the in situ adhesion assay further confirmed that adding anti-Lex MAb resulted in denser bacterial adhesion on the gastric epithelia collected from clinical patients. These results suggest anti-Lex MAb could specifically enhance the adhesion abilities of H. pylori strains through a mechanism by which anti-Lex MAb promotes bacterial aggregation and mediates bivalent interaction (antigen-antibody-antigen) between bacteria and host cells...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. The {{expression}} of adhesion molecules on human vascular endothelial cells (EC) during infection or inflammation {{is necessary to}} initiate migration of leukocytes to the disease focus. Various bacteria or endo-toxins (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) might exert differential capacity to induce adhesion molecules in endothelial cells. Therefore, we first investigated induction of adhesion by bacteria. Heat-killed Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) induced adhesion, whereas the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epider-midis or Mycobacterium tuberculosis did not, indicating the significance of LPS for this activation. Purified S-form LPS stimulated endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules for polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) or lymphocytes in a dose-dependent fashion. S-form LPS, containing an 0 -specific chain, induced a maximal level of adhesion, comparable to adhesion induced by interleukin- 1 (IL- 1). We obtained the same results in cell ELISA with anti-ICAM- 1 antibody (84 H 10). R-form LPS and free lipid A, lacking an <b>O-specific</b> <b>chain</b> also stimulated adhesion, however, to a lower degree (39 - 60 %). Synthetic lipid A precursor Ia (compound 406) or another LPS-antagonist (non-toxic Rhodobacter capsulatus LPS) did not trigger endothelial cells to express ad-hesion molecules. These antagonists specifically inhibited LPS- or free lipid A-, but not IL- 1 -induced adhesion. These results suggest that lipid A is the active structure of LPS necessary for induction of adhesion, that the oligosaccharide portion {{is important for the}} capacity of LPS to stimulate adhesion, and that activation of adhe...|$|E

Methylation analysis, in addition to 13 C and 1 H NMR studies of purified core oligosaccharides revealed structures similar to those established previously for the full core of Y. enterocolitica O: 3 {{in the case of the}} Ra mutant, and identical to that reported for the Rc mutant Ye 75 R, in the case of the two other mutants. The O-specific sugar, 6 d-l-altrose, which forms a homopolymeric O-chain, was present in small amounts in all three LPS preparations, as well as in the core oligosaccharide preparations along with the Ra and the Rc sugars, characteristic of the Y. enterocolitica O: 3 core. This result is in line with genetic data, indicating that it is the inner core region which is the receptor for the <b>O-specific</b> <b>chain</b> in Y. enterocolitica O: 3.

40|$|The {{conformational}} {{properties of}} the isolated S form of Salmonella sp. lipopolysaccharide (LPS), of Re mutant LPS, and of free lipid A were investigated by using X-ray diffraction and conformational energy calculations. The data obtained showed that LPS in a dried, in a hydrated, and probably also in an aqueous dispersion state is capable of forming bilayered lamellar arrangements similar to phospholipids. From the bilayer packing periodicities, a geometrical model of the extensions of the LPS regions lipid A, 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctulosonic acid, and <b>O-specific</b> <b>chain</b> along the membrane normal could be calculated. Furthermore, the lipid A component was found to assume a remarkably high ordered conformation: its fatty acid chains were tightly packed in a dense hexagonal lattice with a center-to-center distance of 0. 49 nm. The hydrophilic backbone of lipid A showed a strong tendency to form domains in the membrane, resulting in {{a more or less}} parallel arrangement of lipid A units. According to model calculations, the hydrophilic backbone of lipid A appears to be oriented approximately 45 degrees to the membrane surface, which would lead to a shed roof-like appearance of the surface structure in the indentations of which the 2 -keto- 3 -deoxyoctulosonic acid moiety would fit. In contrast, the O-specific chains assume a low ordered, heavily coiled conformation. Comparison of these structural properties with those known for natural phospholipids in biological membranes indicates that the high state of order of the lipid A portion of LPS might be an important factor in the structural role and permeation barrier functions of LPS in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria...|$|E

The main methods used, alone or in combination, for solving the structures have been chemical degradation procedures, mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In the studies of Hafnia alvei it was established that the O-deacetylated O-specific polysaccharide isolated from LPS from H. alvei strains 1200 and 1203 possess the same composition and sequence as the O-deacetylated H. alvei strain 1205, i. e. a glycerol teichoic acid-like polymer having a repeating unit composed of a pentasaccharide unit. Serological tests revealed immunochemical similarities between the LPS of the Hafnia alvei strains PCM 1200, 1203 and 1205. In the studies of Plesiomonas shigelloides strain CNCTC 144 / 92 {{it was concluded that}} the <b>O-specific</b> <b>chain</b> is composed of a trisaccharide repeating unit with the following structure: [-> 2) -b-D-Quip 3 NHR-(1 -> 3) -a-L-Rhap 2 OAc-(1 -> 3) -a-D-FucpNAc-(1 ->] in which the R was determined as 3 -hydroxy- 2, 3 -dimethyl- 5 -oxo-pyrrolidine- 2 -carboxylic acid.

Slower-moving bands appeared on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels only when large amounts of V. parahaemolyticus LPS were loaded. These bands were proven to be the aggregates of the fastest-moving low-molecular-weight bands by re-electrophoresis. The banding pattern of V. parahaemolyticus LPSs produced on nitrocellulose membranes by immunoblotting indicated that the V. parahaemolyticus LPSs did not have an <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chain.</b> The low ratio of total carbohydrate to lipid A of V. parahaemolyticus LPSs also suggested that they were like rough-type LPS.

Interestingly, for B. bronchiseptica, the resistance level was significantly affected by phase variation, as a bvgS deletion derivative showed an increased sensitivity to these peptides. Tn 5 -induced protamine-sensitive B. bronchiseptica mutants, which were found to be very susceptible to most of the cationic peptides, were isolated. In two of these mutants, the genetic loci inactivated by transposon insertion were identified as containing genes highly homologous to the wlbA and wlbL genes of B. pertussis that are involved in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In agreement with this finding, the two peptide-sensitive mutants revealed structural changes in the LPS, resulting in the loss of the <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chains</b> and the prevalence of the LPS core structure.

These rfb deletion derivatives (rfb strains) had typical bacteriophage sensitivity patterns of "rough" Salmonella strains and were at least 200, 000 times more sensitive to serum than their smooth ancestors. Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) extracted from them consisted only of two low-molecular-weight bands and lacked the ladderlike pattern of bands seen in the LPS of their smooth ancestors. The LPS from the rfb strains did not react in an enzyme immunoassay with any of three monoclonal antibodies directed against different epitopes of the O- 6, 7 antigen but reacted well with at least one of three monoclonal antibodies specific for core epitopes. The data were consistent with inability of these strains to synthesize <b>O-specific</b> <b>chains</b> and showed that the LPS extracted from SN 57 was of chemotype Ra and that from SN 36 was of chemotype Rb 1, while that of SN 37 consisted of a mixture of the two chemotypes.

All three O-antigen-deficient derivatives were about as virulent as their "smooth" ancestors by the intraperitoneal and intravenous routes (50 % lethal dose, 20 to 700 bacteria) but, unlike their ancestors, were avirulent by the oral route (50 % lethal dose, {{greater than or equal to}} 5 x 10 (9) bacteria).

40|$|The {{formation}} of complete cell wall core lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and O-antigenic side chains after addition of d-galactose to the uridine diphosphate-galactose- 4 -epimeraseless mutant, Salmonella typhimurium LT 2 -M 1, {{has been studied}} by (i) determination of adsorption rates of smooth and rough specific bacteriophages, (ii) passive hemagglutination inhibition, and (iii) qualitative and quantitative determination of the polysaccharide composition and structure. A rapid synthesis of the complete core LPS and O side chains occurred in bacteria in the log phase and the early stationary phase. Phage C 21, which attaches to unsubstituted Rc structures, was adsorbed by the bacteria for only 10 min after the addition of d-galactose. Unsubstituted Rc structures, however, could still be detected after 160 min by immunological and chemical assays. Attachment of the P 22 phage, which requires <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chains</b> {{with more than one}} repeating unit for adsorption, was demonstrated 10 min after the addition of d-galactose. Attachment of the Felix O- 1 phage, which requires a complete core, was observed between 20 and 80 min after the addition of d-galactose. The rough specific phages 6 SR and Br 2 did not adsorb to the bacteria at any time after the addition of d-galactose. By passive hemagglutination inhibition, the presence of O-specific structures could be demonstrated after 10 min. No antigenic activity of the Ra and Rb structures was observed in the LPS preparations isolated at any time after the addition of d-galactose. Methylation analysis of LPS preparations isolated at 10 and 160 min after the addition of d-galactose showed that the <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chains</b> contained an average of 11 and 15 repeating units, respectively. In the 10 -min sample, every 25 th âRc structureâ carried a side chain, compared to every 3 rd residue in the 160 -min sample...|$|R
40|$|The <b>O-specific</b> {{lipopolysaccharide}} side <b>chains</b> of Escherichia coli O 7 and Shigella boydii type 12 possess {{similar but}} not identical chemical structures. We investigated the genetic relatedness between the <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chain</b> genes in {{members of these}} two species. Examination of outer membrane protein and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) banding patterns demonstrated that five strains which had been identified as S. boydii type 12 fell into two clonal groups, SB 1 and SB 2. Hybridizations with O 7 -specific radiolabeled probes derived from the chromosomal DNA of an E. coli O 7 strain detected identical fragments among the three SB 1 strains of S. boydii type 12 and the two E. coli O 7 reference isolates. The two other S. boydii type 12 strains, which belonged to the SB 2 clone, did not show homologies with the O 7 probe under high-stringency conditions of hybridization. The homology between the O 7 and type 12 LPS gene regions from the SB 1 strains was further confirmed by the construction of O-specific side chain-deficient mutations in these strains by homologous recombination of a suicide plasmid containing O 7 -specific DNA sequences. Immunoblot experiments with O 7 antiserum gave a weak cross-reaction with LPS purified from the SB 2 strains but a very strong cross-reaction with the LPS from SB 1 isolates. Antiserum raised {{to one of the}} SB 2 strains cross-reacted only with S. boydii type 12 LPS from the SB 1 clone but failed to react with O 7 LPS...|$|R
30|$|LPS {{serves as}} a barrier to protect {{bacteria}} against adverse environmental elements and is thus necessary for bacterial growth (Raetz and Whitfield, 2002). LPS consists of a lipid A moiety, by which LPS is anchored to the membrane, a core oligosaccharide, which extends outward from the membrane, and a distal <b>O-specific</b> polysaccharide <b>chain</b> (O antigen) (Raetz and Whitfield, 2002). The core oligosaccharide is typically strain-specific, while the O antigen is serotype-specific. In addition, bacteria often mimic human polysaccharide processing by generating O-antigenic polysaccharides that are structurally similar to human polysaccharides in order to evade the human immune system. This mimicry can lead to infections and serious consequences for humans (Jones, 2005). Thus, the development of vaccines that inhibit the generation of bacterial O antigen is urgently needed (Yi et al., 2003).|$|R
40|$|Wild-type Salmonella typhimurium {{and cell}} wall mutants with {{sequential}} deficiencies in their cell wall polysaccharide were examined for {{sensitivity to the}} bactericidal action of the lysosomal fraction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The complete lipopolysaccharide basal core was essential for resistance to the bactericidal action. <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chains</b> of the wild type did not enhance the resistance. Absence of N-acetyl glucosamine considerably enhanced sensitivity, whereas absence of other core sugars did not; additional increase in sensitivity was obtained when the heptose phosphate was absent. Under conditions where appropriate supplementation of the medium permitted complete cell wall synthesis, the uridine diphosphate-gal- 4 -epimeraseless mutant regained resistance that was essentially {{equal to that of}} the wild type. Cells coated with specific antiserum and nongrowing cells were more resistant than normal growing cells...|$|R
40|$|Immunopotentiation {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} when Klebsiella O 3 lipopolysaccharide (KO 3 LPS), which possesses a linear mannan as the <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chain,</b> was injected subcutaneously into endotoxin resistant C 3 H/HeJ mice together with soluble protein antigens. The LPS exhibited significantly positive adjuvant effects on antibody responses in vivo after secondary antigen challenge and on delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions against protein antigens. However, KO 3 LPS was not a polyclonal B cell activator (PBA) in C 3 H/HeJ mice nor mitogenic in cultures of spleen cells of C 3 H/HeJ. Thus, {{the activity of the}} LPS in C 3 H/HeJ mice is confined to the potentiation of T-dependent immune responses. The contribution of the mannan O side chain to the adjuvant action of KO 3 LPS was suggested...|$|R
40|$|The fine {{structure}} of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), isolated from an avian strain of Escherichia coli O 18, was examined by electron microscopy. In positively stained preparations, ribbonlike structures with frequent branching were observed as previously reported (4). Two densely stained parallel lines were occasionally seen {{associated with a}} ribbon. When negative staining was employed, the LPS appeared as a branching ribbon with one central and two lateral zones divided by two relatively dense parallel lines running the complete length of the ribbon. The lateral zones were {{probably due to the}} O-antigenic side chains of the LPS. This interpretation was supported {{by the fact that the}} electron microscopic structure of the LPS from two rough strains, E. coli K- 12 Gal 23 and Salmonella tuphimurium TV 119 RII, both lacking the <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chains,</b> did not possess the outer lateral zones...|$|R
40|$|Lipopolysaccharides {{and their}} {{fractions}} {{were obtained from}} strains Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens UCM Ð- 111 and UCM Ð- 306 â components of insectofungicidal gaupsin biopreparation; their activity against tobacco mosaic virus has been studied. Lipopolysaccharides of strains Ð- 111 and Ð- 306 proved to be highly active antiviral agents and inhibited tobacco mosaic virus infectivity for three species of indicating plants in concentrations 0, 001 â 10 mg/ml. First lipopolysaccharides fraction (<b>O-specific</b> side <b>chains)</b> did not inhibit and often stimulated the virus reproduction. At {{the same time the}} core oligosaccharides (the second and the third lipopolysaccharides fractions) decreased to different extent the virus infection development. According to electron microscopy data the virions sticked together forming the sneafs at the direct lipopolysaccharides-virus contact in vitro whereas the single free virus particles were observed in the control. Evidence of direct interaction between lipopolysaccharides of P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens strains and tobacco mosaic virus is provided...|$|R
40|$|Seven temperature-{{sensitive}} rough mutants of Salmonella typhimurium {{were found}} to be sensitive to smooth-specific phages at low temperature (25 C, 30 C) and resistant or partially resistant to rough-specific phages, whereas at high temperatures (37 C, 45 C) they were resistant or partially resistant to smooth-specific phages but sensitive to rough-specific phages. These data indicate that at low temperature each strain makes lipopolysaccharide which is relatively normal, but at high temperatures <b>O-specific</b> side <b>chains</b> are not added to the lipopolysaccharide. At 45 C, these strains have the R-res- 1 or R-res- 2 phage sensitivity phenotype, and their genetic lesions map by P 22 -mediated transduction in the rfa gene cluster between cysE-pyrE, suggesting a mutation in genes with transferase functions. P 22 -mediated joint transduction with temperature-sensitive rfa mutants, leaky rfa mutants, and rfa P 22 lysogens have shown the following order of genes in the S. typhimurium linkage map: xyl-mtlA-mtlB-cysE-rfaF-rfaG-pyrE. An rfaE allele was not jointly transduced in the cysE-pyrE segment...|$|R
40|$|Only {{indirect}} {{evidence has been}} cited to document that lipopolysaccharide-mediated virulence at the bacterial level and serum antibodies to the <b>o-specific</b> side <b>chain</b> of the lipopolysaccharide molecule may prevent shigellosis. Our proposed use of the B subunit of Shiga toxin as a carrier protein is based upon evidence (even more indirect) that serum antitoxin may reduce the severity of dysentery and diarrhea. Because animal models of disease may provide information inap-plicable {{to the prediction of}} vaccine-induced protective immunity, we suggest that clinical trials in the population at risk should bestarted after successful completion of the safety and immunoge-nicity phases of vaccine development in laboratory animals and in the target population. Clinical studies of shigella vaccines are difficult because of the many causes of dysentery in a population with a high rate of intestinal disease.
