5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set <b>of</b> <b>spelling</b> conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.|$|E

50|$|Presented in the Player's Handbook II, {{the sorcerer}} is an arcane striker, with {{controller}} as a secondary role. Unlike other {{editions of the}} game, 4e sorcerers now have their own list <b>of</b> <b>spells,</b> rather than the same spells as the wizard. Sorcerers' attack spells generally use charisma, furthermore, many sorcerer spells benefit from high strength or dexterity. Sorcerers' sole class feature is spell source, there are several versions <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> source, one <b>of</b> which must be selected during character creation. Each version <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> source gives the sorcerer resistance to one damage type (which is fixed or variable depending on the version <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> source), gives the sorcerer a damage bonus based on either dexterity or strength, additionally, strength-based versions <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> source allow the sorcerer to use strength instead of dexterity or intelligence to determine AC while wearing light armor, and all versions <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> source give the sorcerer at least one additional benefit specific to that version <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> source, and many sorcerer powers have additional effects if a sorcerer has a specific version <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> source. In Player's Handbook II, two versions <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> source are presented: dragon magic and wild magic. Dragon magic refers {{to the belief that}} some sorcerers have draconic blood in their veins. Wild magic refers to a random, uncontainable magic that the sorcerer can tap into. In addition, the supplement Arcane Power introduces two more versions <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> source: storm magic and cosmic magic.|$|R

25|$|Webster's {{efforts at}} {{spelling}} reform were somewhat effective {{in his native}} country, resulting in certain well-known patterns <b>of</b> <b>spelling</b> differences between the American and British varieties of English, however, English-language spelling reform has rarely been adopted otherwise and thus, modern English orthography varies somewhat between countries and is far from phonemic in any country.|$|E

50|$|A magic {{system that}} is limited by a number <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> slots will give a spellcaster a certain number <b>of</b> <b>spells</b> per day that may be cast.

25|$|There are two {{standards}} for listing verbs in dictionaries. Most dictionaries follow the tradition <b>of</b> <b>spelling</b> out the infinitive {{form of the}} verb as the headword of the entry, but others such as the Redhouse Turkish-English Dictionary are more technical and spell out the stem of the verb instead, that is, they spell out a string of letters that is useful for producing all other verb forms through morphological rules. Similar to the latter, this article follows the stem-as-citeword standard.|$|E
25|$|Coffee menus {{worldwide}} use {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>spelling</b> variations for words to indicate coffee and milk, often using incorrect accents {{or a combination}} of French and Italian terms. Italian is caffellatte (the standard form; caffelatte is a Northern Italian variation), contracted from caffè latte, (with a grave accent over the e), while French is café au lait (with an acute accent); Spanish is café con leche and Portuguese is café com leite. Variants such as café latte, café latté and café lattè are commonly seen in English.|$|E
25|$|After Clement's 1598 {{printing}} of the Vulgate, the Vatican issued no other official printings, leaving the task to other printers. Although the other printers of the Clementine Vulgate faithfully reproduced {{the words of}} the official edition, they were often quite free in matters <b>of</b> <b>spelling,</b> punctuation, capitalization, and paragraph boundaries. In 1906, Capuchin friar Fr. Michael Hetzenauer produced an edition restoring the original Clementine text while taking into account variations in Clement's three printings as well as correctoria officially issued by the Vatican. The current standard reference edition is that of Alberto Colunga & Laurentio Turrado, published in Madrid in 1946.|$|E

5000|$|Many mummies were {{provided}} with some form of funerary literature to take {{with them to the}} afterlife. Most funerary literature consists <b>of</b> lists <b>of</b> <b>spells</b> and instructions for navigating the afterlife. During the Old Kingdom, only the pharaoh had access to this material, which scholars refer to as the Pyramid Texts. The Pyramid Texts are a collection <b>of</b> <b>spells</b> to assure the royal resurrection and protect the pharaoh from various malignant influences. The Pharaoh Unas was the first to use this collection <b>of</b> <b>spells,</b> as he and a few subsequent pharaohs had them carved on the walls of their pyramids.

25|$|The first notable 14th century Bulgarian scholar was Theodosius of Tarnovo (d. 1363), who was {{influenced}} by Hesychasm and spread hesyachastic ideas in Bulgaria. His most prominent disciple was Euthymius of Tarnovo (c. 1325 – c. 1403), who was Patriarch of Bulgaria between 1375 and 1393 {{and founder of the}} Tarnovo Literary School. A prolific writer, Euthymius oversaw a major linguistic reform that standardized the spelling and grammar of the Bulgarian language. Until the reform, texts often had variations <b>of</b> <b>spelling</b> and grammar use. The model of the reform was not the contemporaneous language but that of the first golden age of Bulgarian culture in the late 9th and early 10th centuries during the First Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
25|$|By {{the first}} half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was {{effectively}} unchallenged as the sole English translation in current use in Protestant churches, and was so dominant that the Roman Catholic Church in England issued in 1750 a revision of the 1610 Douay-Rheims Bible by Richard Challoner that was very much closer to the Authorized Version than to the original. However, general standards <b>of</b> <b>spelling,</b> punctuation, typesetting, capitalization and grammar had changed radically in the 100 years since the first edition of the Authorized Version, and all printers in the market were introducing continual piecemeal changes to their Bible texts to bring them into line with current practice – and with public expectations of standardized spelling and grammatical construction.|$|E
25|$|Manuscripts also differ. Usually the {{differences}} are minor—matters <b>of</b> <b>spelling</b> and the like—but occasionally they are significant, {{as in the case}} of the Comma Johanneum, a clause in the First Epistle of John that bears explicit witness to the doctrine of the Christian Trinity, but is not found in any manuscript earlier than the 10th century (codex 221), where it is shown as a marginal note. A similar example from the Old Testament is the difference between the Septuagint and Masoretic descriptions of the battle of David and Goliath: the Septuagint version is shorter and avoids the narrative inconsistencies of the familiar Masoretic story, notably the famous incident of Saul asking who David is as though he does not know his own harpist and shield-bearer.|$|E

40|$|The {{duration}} {{data sets}} {{used to study}} employment or unemployment often come from samples of individuals {{at a point in}} time (Cross Population Survey, CPS) and they contains the lengths <b>of</b> ongoing <b>spells</b> <b>of</b> employment or unemployment for sample subjects who are currently employed or unemployed. The observations are right-censored and termed spells in progress or incomplete <b>spells.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> the raw data involves a length-biased estimate <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> durations. In this paper, we examine the procedure to analyze a data set which includes only censored or incomplete spells when the full lengths <b>of</b> <b>spells,</b> conditioned on their being in progress at the time of survey, are Weibull distributed. Particularly, the methodology of estimation of the parameters is described for both the distribution function <b>of</b> <b>spell</b> durations and the proportional hazard model which include a set of explanatory variables (personal and job characteristics, local labor demand). Then, the methods are applied to the lengths <b>of</b> ongoing <b>spells</b> <b>of</b> employment for both employed workers and self-employed workers...|$|R

25|$|Plotinus {{wrote the}} essays {{that became the}} Enneads {{over a period of}} several years from ca. 253 until a few months before his death {{seventeen}} years later. Porphyry makes note that the Enneads, before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master's handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate his words, and he cared little for niceties <b>of</b> <b>spelling.</b> Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who not only polished them but put them into the arrangement we now have.|$|E
25|$|Long consonants {{were usually}} {{indicated}} through doubling, but ancient Latin orthography did {{not distinguish between}} the vocalic and consonantal uses of i and v. Vowel length was indicated only intermittently in classical sources and even then {{through a variety of}} means. Later medieval and modern usage tended to omit vowel length altogether. A short-lived convention <b>of</b> <b>spelling</b> long vowels by doubling the vowel letter is associated with the poet Lucius Accius. Later spelling conventions marked long vowels with an apex (a diacritic similar to an acute accent) or, in the case of long i, by increasing the height of the letter (long i); in the second century AD, those were given apices as well. Distinctions of vowel length became less important in later Latin and have ceased to be phonemic in the modern Romance languages, in which the previous long and short versions of the vowels have been either lost or replaced by other phonetic contrasts.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a series of {{linguistic}} sound changes {{towards the end of}} this period, including the Great Vowel Shift, which resulted in the i in mine, for example, changing from a pure vowel to a diphthong. These changes for the most part did not detract from the rule-governed nature of the spelling system; but in some cases they introduced confusing inconsistencies, like the well-known example of the many pronunciations of ough (rough, through, though, trough, plough, etc.). Most of these changes happened before the arrival of printing in England. However, the arrival of the printing press froze the current system, rather than providing the impetus for a realignment <b>of</b> <b>spelling</b> with pronunciation. Furthermore, it introduced further inconsistencies, partly because of the use of typesetters trained abroad, particularly in the Low Countries. For example, the h in ghost was influenced by Dutch. The addition and deletion of a silent e at the ends of words was also sometimes used to make the right-hand margin line up more neatly.|$|E

500|$|Chancery English, used in {{official}} documents, {{can be seen}} as the beginnings of Standard English – a national standard <b>of</b> <b>spelling</b> and grammar. [...] By the 15th century, the City of Westminster had been the seat of government administration for about three centuries. [...] After about 1430, the use of English in administrative documents replaced French which had been used since the Norman conquest. [...] Consequently, the written English that developed at the Court of Chancery eventually became a standard, both in its style of handwriting ('Chancery hand') and in its grammar and vocabulary. [...] By the 1440s and 1450s comparative regularisation <b>of</b> <b>spelling</b> had begun to emerge.|$|E
