5|$|From {{the point}} <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> {{the goal of}} {{mathematics}} is to classify and characterize, the representation theory of the Lorentz group is since 1947 a finished chapter. But {{in association with the}} Bargmann–Wigner programme, there are (as of 2006) yet unresolved purely mathematical problems, linked to the infinite-dimensional unitary representations.|$|E
5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque style {{dominated}} the Polish culture from the 1580s, {{building on the}} achievements of the Renaissance and for a while coexisting with it, to the mid 18th century. Initially Baroque artists and intellectuals, torn between the two competing views of the world, enjoyed wide latitude and freedom of expression. Soon however the Counter-Reformation instituted a binding point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> invoked the medieval tradition, imposed censorship in education and elsewhere (the index of prohibited books in Poland from 1617), and straightened out their convoluted ways. By the middle of the 17th century the doctrine had been firmly reestablished, sarmatism and religious zealotry had become the norm. Artistic tastes of the epoch were often acquiring an increasingly Oriental character. In contrast with the integrative tendencies of the previous period, the burgher and nobility cultural spheres went their separate ways. Renaissance publicist Stanisław Orzechowski had already provided the foundations for Baroque szlachta's political thinking.|$|E

Specifically, we propose improving 3 D object recognition based on Algebraic Functions <b>of</b> <b>Views</b> (AFoVs) by integrating AFoVs, a powerful framework for predicting geometric appearance due to viewpoint changes, with indexing and learning. During training, we compute the space <b>of</b> <b>views</b> <b>that</b> groups <b>of</b> object features can produce under the assumption of 3 D linear transformations, by combining a small number <b>of</b> references <b>views</b> <b>that</b> contain the object features using AFoVs. Unrealistic views (e. g., due to the assumption of 3 D linear transformations) are eliminated by imposing a pair of rigidity constraints based on knowledge of the transformation between the reference <b>views</b> <b>of</b> the object...|$|R

This means from a thermodynamic point <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> <b>that</b> this system is a Constant Volume and Variable Pressure system.

25|$|The {{advocacy}} model {{takes the}} point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> someone {{is needed to}} actively mediate between {{the environment and the}} person with FAS. Advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate (for example, a family member, friend, or case manager) and fall into three basic categories. An advocate for FAS: (1) interprets FAS and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates, (2) engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person, and (3) assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals.|$|E
25|$|Behn was immensely prolific, writing plays, {{fiction and}} poetry, and {{translating}} works from French. She caused scandal {{in some of}} her chosen subject matter, often alluding to sexual desire. She was aware, and stated that, the works would not have caused problems {{if they had been}} written by a man. Behn's work frequently takes homoerotic themes, featuring same-sex love between women. One of her best-known poems, The Disappointment, {{is the story of a}} sexual encounter told from a woman's point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> may be interpreted as a work about male impotence.|$|E

Views like these resonated with the progressive nationalist opposition to Marcos.|$|R
25|$|New Testament {{writings}} {{were sometimes}} {{used to support}} the case for slavery as well. Some of the writings of Paul, especially in Ephesians, instruct slaves to remain obedient to their masters. Southern ideology after the Revolution developed to argue a paternalistic point <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> <b>that</b> slavery was beneficial for enslaved {{people as well as}} the people who held them in slavery. They said that Christian planters could concentrate on improving treatment of slaves and that the people in bondage were offered protections from many ills, and treated better than industrial workers in the North.|$|E
25|$|Many of Kierkegaard's earlier {{writings}} from 1843 to 1846 {{were written}} pseudonymously. In the non-pseudonymous The Point of View of My Work as an Author, {{he explained that}} the pseudonymous works are written from perspectives which are not his own: while Kierkegaard himself was a religious author, the pseudonymous authors wrote from points <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> were aesthetic or speculative. One exception to this is Anti-Climacus, a pseudonymous author developed after the writing of The Point of View: Anti-Climacus is a religious author who writes from a Christian perspective so ideal that Kierkegaard did not wish it to be attributed to himself.|$|E
25|$|While all {{of those}} {{literary}} works were published under Liszt's name, it is not quite clear which parts of them he had written himself. It is known from his letters that {{during the time of}} his youth there had been collaboration with Marie d'Agoult. During the Weimar years it was the Princess Wittgenstein who helped him. In most cases the manuscripts have disappeared so {{that it is difficult to}} determine which of Liszt's literary works were actually works of his own. Until the end of his life, however, it was Liszt's point <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> it was he who was responsible for the contents of those literary works.|$|E
