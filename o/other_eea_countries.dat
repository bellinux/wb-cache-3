50|$|A {{citizen of}} an the EEA or Switzerland can {{live and work}} in all <b>other</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>countries</b> or Switzerland, (but not {{necessarily}} vote or work in sensitive fields, such as government, police, military where citizenship is often required). Non-citizens may not have the same rights to welfare and unemployment benefits like citizens.|$|E
50|$|Driving licences, {{particularly}} the photocard driving licence introduced in 1998, and passports {{are now the}} most widely used ID documents in the United Kingdom, but the former cannot be used as travel documents, except within the Common Travel Area. However, driving licences from the UK and other EU countries are usually accepted within <b>other</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>countries</b> for identity verification. Given that passports do not fit in a typical wallet or purse, most people do not carry their passports in public without an advance {{that they are going to}} need them. For people from the UK and other countries where national ID cards are not used or not common, this leaves driving licences as the only valid form of ID to be presented, if requested by an authority for a legitimately-given reason, but unlike a travel document, they do not show the holder's nationality or immigration status. Colloquially, in day-to-day life, most authorities do not ask for identification from individuals in a sudden, spot check type manner, such as by police or security guards, although this may become a concern in instances of stop and search.|$|E
50|$|When {{going through}} border {{controls}} to enter an <b>EEA</b> <b>country,</b> <b>EEA</b> and Swiss citizens possessing valid biometric passports are sometimes {{able to use}} automated gates instead of immigration counters. For example, when entering the United Kingdom, at major airports, adult holders of EEA or Swiss biometric passports can use ePassport gates, whilst all <b>other</b> <b>EEA</b> citizens (such as those using a national identity card or a non-biometric passport) and non-EEA citizens must use an immigration counter. Anyone travelling with children must also use an immigration counter.|$|R
25|$|The {{right of}} entry into the EEA and Switzerland (includes all EU and <b>EEA</b> <b>countries</b> and Switzerland) without {{additional}} visa was extended to the third-country family members of EEA nationals exercising their treaty right of free movement who hold a valid residence card of their <b>EEA</b> host <b>country</b> and wish to visit any <b>other</b> <b>EEA</b> member state for a short stay up to 90 days. This is implied in Directive 2004/38/EC, Article 5(2) provided that they travel together with the EEA national or join their spouse/partner {{at a later date}} (Article 6(2)). If the non-EEA family member has neither an EEA residence card nor a visa, but can show their family tie with the EU national by other means, then a visa must be issued at the border free of charge and entry permitted.|$|R
50|$|If a work is {{published}} simultaneously (i.e. {{in more than}} one country, but all within 30 days), and one of the countries is a European Economic Area (<b>EEA)</b> <b>country,</b> then the <b>EEA</b> <b>country</b> is the country of origin (even if another is a Berne Convention country); but if none of them is an <b>EEA</b> <b>country,</b> {{and one of them is}} a Berne Convention country, then the Berne Convention country is the country of origin.|$|R
3000|$|However, it is {{far from}} clear that the results in Austria can be {{generalized}} to <b>other</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>countries.</b> In particular, we examine the case of Sweden. The similarities between Sweden and Austria are, at first glance, striking. They have a similar population size and proportion of foreign born as well as generous welfare benefits (OECD 2016 a, 2016 b). 2 High welfare ambitions in both Austria and Sweden raise rewards to low-skilled workers for migrating to those countries over other countries. However, Austria and Sweden differ, for example, {{when it comes to the}} country of origin for immigrants. 3 [...]...|$|E
40|$|The record {{growth in}} premium {{revenues}} {{in the life}} insurance business in 1996 (+ 29. 6 percent) reflects the strong reaction of private households {{to changes in the}} fiscal incentive system. The reduced deductibility of health and life insurance premiums and the increase in the insurance tax on one-off premiums entailed a wave of pre-emptive and substitutive life insurance contracts. For 1997, the Association of Austrian Insurance Companies expects a corresponding slump in premium revenues of 15. 3 percent. The increase in the corporate income tax for insurance companies in 1996 and 1997 has further reduced public support for private old-age provision. The changes implemented by the consolidation package contrast with the recommendations contained in the report on the perspective of the Austrian pension system to the Federal Ministry of Labor, Health, and Social Affairs and further increase the number of special rules for products of retirement income provision. The reduction in the deductibility of life insurance premiums alone has lowered the yield of this insurance product for private households by some 14 percent. Recurring changes in the tax rules for private households make planning for individual old-age income provision very difficult. In 1996, business in the private insurance industry was driven by the changes entailed by the two consolidation packages. Life insurance premiums rose by almost 30 percent over 1995. The remaining insurance branches were characterized by competition among the insurance companies for market shares. In the health insurance sector, lower hospital costs and the (qualified) exemption from the value-added tax for medical doctors and hospitals were passed on to consumers. The decline in prices, however, was lower than expected. With the number of contracts in this category unchanged, premium revenues declined by 1. 8 percent in 1996. A further reduction by 2. 2 percent is expected by the Association of Austrian Insurance Companies for 1997. In property and accident insurance, a {{rise in the number of}} contracts increased premium payments by 4. 1 percent. The damage ratio in this category, though still below the long-term average, is again following a slight upward trend. With the leeway for price increases rather limited, the growth prospects of this sector in 1997 are modest (0. 75 percent). Foreign insurance companies from the European Economic Area operate in Austria mainly under the provision of the free flow of services and offer property and accident insurance products. In 1995, insurance companies from the EEA (excluding the U. K.) managed to draw insurance premiums totaling more the ATS 1 billion in Austria, implying a market share of 0. 7 percent. By contrast, revenues of Austrian insurance companies in <b>other</b> <b>EEA</b> <b>countries</b> amounted to only ATS 33 billion.

40|$|The key {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to empirically determine the effects of terrorism on FDI of the selected EU and <b>EEA</b> member <b>countries.</b> The methodology is based on a system-GMM estimator for dynamic panel data models on a sample covering up to 29 countries, and 13 -year periods from 2000 to 2013. The main results confirm that terrorism incidents, economic and institutional variables are found to depress FDI of analysed EU and <b>EEA</b> <b>countries.</b> It can be concluded that terrorism and institutional stability are most influential on FDI inflows of the observed EU and <b>EEA</b> <b>countries.</b> The results indicate that terrorist activities reduce security and confidence of investors in countries exposed to terrorist activities, reducing the inflow of foreign direct investment.
