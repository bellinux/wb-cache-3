5|$|By {{succeeding}} her husband, Ranavalona {{became the}} first female sovereign <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Imerina {{since its founding in}} 1540. Her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere. In the traditional culture of Imerina, rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs. Sovereigns often mobilized innovation through the creation of new forms of kinship, the traditional basis of the political order. Women, however, were associated with the household, a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign, and so were not viewed as suited to rule. Although female rulers had once been common among the Vazimba, described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of Andriamanelo (1540–1575), founder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> Imerina and successor to his Vazimba mother, Queen Rafohy (1530–1540).|$|E
