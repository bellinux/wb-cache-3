25|$|When introduced, the block-mounted <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> {{check valve}} was {{eliminated}} on the 4.0 (along with the 2.5 and 4.2s manufactured after September 1986) when AMC engineers standardized their oil filters. The pre-1987 engines had an <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> adapter with 3/4 (cylinder block end) and 13/16 threads (which used a GM <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac V8 engines) while the 1987-06 engines were originally {{fitted with a}} 20mm metric thread filter (later revised in 1991 for the common 3/4 threaded Mopar and Ford V8 oil filter; the <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> adapter was redesigned where the <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> is positioned 90 degrees offset adjacent to the starter motor - a Ford V8 <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> {{can be used in}} place of the short filter increasing oiling capacity).|$|E
25|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1980s, water-blown {{microcellular}} flexible foams were used to mold gaskets for automotive panels and air filter seals, replacing PVC plastisol from automotive applications have greatly increased market share.

25|$|American Motors devoted {{three years}} to the {{development}} of a new four-cylinder engine. The brand new engine was designed to use AMC's existing spacing between the cylinder bores so that the tooling remained the same. The location of other major components, such as the distributor, <b>oil</b> <b>filter,</b> and starter were also kept the same to so as to use the machine tools for the AMC straight-6 engine.|$|E
50|$|High {{efficiency}} <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> are {{a type of}} {{bypass filter}} that are claimed to allow extended oil drain intervals. HE <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> typically have pore sizes of 3 micrometres, which studies have shown reduce engine wear. Some fleets {{have been able to}} increase their drain intervals up to 5-10 times.|$|R

25|$|Most {{vehicles}} existing {{today have}} been serviced by GM {{during one of}} the safety recalls on the car. For the fire-related recall, shields and drip-trays were added to prevent leaking fluids from contacting hot surfaces. The presence of drip shields between the engine block and the exhaust manifold are a clue that the car has been retrofitted. The addition of the longer AC Delco PF51 <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> and a re-calibrated dipstick added extra oil capacity to the oiling system, and enabled running four quarts of oil in the crankcase instead of three, to help prevent oil starvation to the rods. Certain vehicles also had their connecting rods or entire block replaced.|$|E

25|$|Buick's largest, plushest {{and most}} {{expensive}} models were restyled for 1963, with distinctive rear fenders {{culminating in a}} sharp vertical edge housing narrow back-up lights. The taillights were horizontally placed in the vertical deck cove. A unique cast grille was used at the front. Bright wheelhouse and lower body moldings, with ribbed rear fender panels were used. Red-filled Electra 225 badges {{were found on the}} rear fenders, while four VentiPorts lent status to the front fenders. Interiors were cloth and vinyl combinations, while a Custom interior in vinyl and leather, with front bucket seats and a storage console, was available for the convertible and sport coupe. Standard equipment included directional signals, full-flow <b>oil</b> <b>filter,</b> dual speed electric windshield wiper/washers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-On parking brake, dual armrests, Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, padded dashboard, heater, defroster, glovebox light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof rearview mirror, power brakes, parking brake signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings. Buick dropped the Riviera name as a body style designation after the 1963 model year, shifting the Riviera name exclusively to Buick's new personal luxury coupe that had been introduced in 1963. Buick added a 7-way tilt steering wheel and a new cruise control as an option.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E
500|$|The early Super Cubs used a 6 volt {{ignition}} magneto {{mounted on the}} flywheel, with a battery to help maintain power to the lights, while later ones were upgraded to capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) systems. The lubrication system did not use an oil pump or <b>oil</b> <b>filter,</b> but was a primitive splash-fed system for both the crankcase and gearbox, with a non-consumable screen strainer to collect debris in the engine oil. Both {{the front and rear}} brakes were drums. On both the front and rear wheels were 2.25" [...] × 17" [...] wire spoke wheels, with full-width hubs.|$|E

500|$|Several {{in-flight}} shutdowns of Trent 700–powered A330-300s occurred. On 11 November 1996, {{engine failure}} on a Cathay Pacific flight forced {{it back to}} Ho Chi Minh City. On 17 April 1997, Cathay Pacific's subsidiary Dragonair experienced an engine shutdown on an A330, caused by carbon clogging the <b>oil</b> <b>filter.</b> As a result, Cathay Pacific self-suspended its 120-minute ETOPS clearance. [...] Another engine failure occurred on 6 May during climbout with a Cathay Pacific A330, due to a bearing failure in a Hispano-Suiza-built gearbox. Three days later, a Cathay Pacific A330 on climbout during a Bangkok–Hong Kong flight experienced an oil pressure drop and a resultant engine spool down, forcing a return to Bangkok. The cause was traced to metal contamination in the engine's master chip. Following a fifth engine failure on 23 May, Cathay Pacific and Dragonair voluntarily grounded their A330 fleets for two weeks, causing major disruption as Cathay's eleven A330s made up fifteen per cent of its passenger capacity. Rolls-Royce and Hispano-Suiza developed a redesigned lubrication system to resolve the problem.|$|E
500|$|All Tigers were {{fitted with}} a single Ford twin-choke carburettor. The {{compression}} ratio of the larger Mark II engine was increased from the 8.8:1 of the smaller block to 9.3:1. Other differences between the versions included upgraded valve springs (the 260 had developed a reputation for self-destructing if pushed beyond 5000rpm), an engine-oil cooler, an alternator instead of a dynamo, a larger single dry plate hydraulically operated clutch, wider ratio transmission, and some rear-axle modifications. There were also cosmetic changes: speed stripes instead of chrome strips {{down the side of}} the car, a modified radiator grille, and removal of the headlamp cowls. All Tigers were fitted with the same [...] wide steel disc bolt-on wheels as the Alpine IV, and Dunlop RS5 [...] cross-ply tyres. The lack of space in the Tiger's engine bay causes a few maintenance problems; the left bank of spark plugs is only accessible through a hole in the bulkhead for instance, normally sealed with a rubber bung, and the <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> had to be relocated from the lower left on the block to a higher position on the right-hand side, behind the generator.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of the {{standard}} AMC bell housing bolt pattern, AMC/Jeep engineers adopted the General Motors small V6 and four-cylinder bolt pattern (commonly used with GM's transverse-mounted powerplants) for their new engine, because the new AMC 2.5 replaced the four-cylinder engines that had been purchased from GM; and because AMC continued to buy the 2.8 L V6 from GM until the 4.0L I6 was introduced in 1987. The four-cylinder and V6 shared the same drivetrain components, whereas stronger transmissions were needed for the new 4.0L. The 2.5L also shared an 18mm threaded <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> used with the GM 2.8L (ACDelco PF47 or equivalent) to 1986; when the 4.0L was phased into production with the XJ the <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> was changed over to a 20mm thread size shared with Renaults until 1991.|$|E

2500|$|For the 1993 model year, the 'Digifant' {{electronic}} {{fuel injection}} replaced the carburetor, indicated by an emblem {{on the cover of}} the engine [...] reading 1600i. [...] At this time, some of the sedans had the velour upholstery from the Jetta GL in gray flannel. An electronic ignition system was introduced, and the engine also received hydraulic lifters and a spin-on <b>oil</b> <b>filter.</b> In the same year, and to replace the [...] "21 Million" [...] edition a new Volkswagen Sedán GL was also introduced as a limited edition; it was also called the Volkswagen Sedán Wolfsburg Edition. This edition was available only in three exterior colors: Steel Blue Metallic, Satin Grey Metallic and Indian Red Pearl. This version featured a black velour upholstery and two outside mirrors.|$|E
2500|$|For 1959, the Oldsmobile line-up was {{completely}} redesigned. However, unlike other GM makes (such as Chevrolet and Cadillac) Oldsmobile {{continued to use}} a full perimeter frame, instead of the GM X-frame. The 98 shared its appearance with the Oldsmobile 88. Oldsmobile stayed with its top series format by offering four body styles on an exclusive [...] wheelbase. Standard equipment included <b>oil</b> <b>filter,</b> turn signals, air scoop brakes, Safety spectrum speedometer, rocker panel moldings, special emblems, parking brake light, sponge vinyl headliner, deep twist carpeting, electric clock, wheel trim moldings, power steering, power brakes, and Jetaway Hydramatic Drive.

2500|$|Again, in 1963, the top-of-the-line Oldsmobile 98 had an {{exclusive}} [...] wheelbase. A new body style was the Custom Sports Coupe hardtop. It {{was the only}} body style with the 345 horsepower Starfire engine. The 4-door 6-window hardtop was renamed the Luxury Sedan (often condensed to L/S).
