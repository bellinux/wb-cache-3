40|$|Improving furnace {{efficiency}} {{is a high}} priority need for steel, aluminum, glass and other metal casting industries. Consequently, {{there has been a}} great deal of research for developing efficient burners for furnaces motivated by pollutant prevention and global warming concerns. This work attempts to address these needs. It is different from the previous attempts because it considers the furnace as a system rather than furnace and burners separately. Fuel and air are injected separately as turbulent jets and mixed, heated and diluted inside the furnace. Thus, the flame pattern and emissions depend on the jet interaction and mixing in multiple turbulent jet flames. This study is divided into two parts: The first part presents a numerical investigation into mixing characteristics and the resulting concentration fields in unconfined, non-reacting multiple turbulent jets. A numerical study is performed to investigate the effects of the separation distance and momentum ratio on jet interaction and mixing in multiple jets using a modified version of a LES code called the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) developed by NIST. In the second part, a laboratory-scale furnace is constructed to test the reacting turbulent jet concept and experiments are conducted to find parameters that increase combustion efficiency and reduce pollutant emissions. Intense flue gas recirculation with buoyancy stabilized mixing is employed to reduce the flame temperatures and thus thermal NO. Local temperature, gas composition distributions and UV emission intensities are measured and analyzed for various oxidizer jet momentums, <b>oxygen</b> <b>enrichments,</b> and overall equivalence ratios. FDS is again used to simulate these confined reacting jets which are relevant for furnaces, and the computational results are compared with the experimental measurements to validate a code that can be used for designing furnaces. The computational results were found to be in good agreement with the measurements. Numerical investigations show that the large scale recirculation is well established for higher momentum of the oxidizer jet. The oxidizer jet momentum plays a very important role in mixing and achieving the homogeneous combustion condition. It was also found that the temporal UV emission is uniform with low intensity under homogeneous combustion conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Intrinsic S-type {{stars are}} thermal pulsing {{asymptotic}} giant branch (TP-AGB) stars. AGB stars have inert carbon-oxygen cores and undergo fusion both in an inner helium shell and an outer hydrogen shell. They are large cool M class giants. The thermal pulses, created by flashes from the helium shell, cause strong convection within the upper {{layers of the}} star. These pulses become stronger as the star evolves and in sufficiently massive stars the convection becomes deep enough to dredge up fusion products from the region between the two shells to the surface. These fusion products include carbon and s-process elements. [...] The s-process elements include zirconium (Zr), yttrium (Y), lanthanum (La), technetium (Tc), barium (Ba), and strontium (Sr), which form the characteristic S class spectrum with ZrO, YO, and LaO bands, as well as Tc, Sr, and Ba lines. The atmosphere of S stars already has almost as much carbon as <b>oxygen.</b> Carbon <b>enrichment</b> continues with subsequent thermal pulses until the carbon abundance exceeds the oxygen abundance, {{at which point the}} oxygen in the atmosphere is rapidly locked into CO and formation of the oxides diminishes.

40|$|Recent {{findings}} {{based on}} the oxygen isotope ratios of tree trunk cellulose indicate that the temperature of biomass production in biomes ranging from boreal to subtropical forests converge to an average leaf temperature of 21. 4 °C. The above conclusion has been drawn {{under the assumption that}} biochemically related isotopic fractionations during cellulose synthesis are not affected by temperature. Here we test the above assumption by heterotrophically generating cellulose at different temperatures and measuring the proportion of carbohydrate oxygen that exchange with water during cellulose synthesis and the average biochemical fractionation associated with this exchange. We observed no variation in the proportion of oxygen that exchange with different temperatures, which averaged 0. 42 as it has been observed in other studies. On the other hand, the biochemical oxygen isotope fractionation during cellulose synthesis is affected by temperature and can be described by a 2 (nd) order polynomial equation. The biochemical fractionation changes little between temperatures of 20 and 30 °C averaging 26 ‰ but increases at lower temperatures to values of 31 ‰. This temperature sensitive biochemical fractionation explains the pattern of cellulose oxygen isotope ratios of aquatic plants encompassing several latitudes. The observed temperature sensitive biochemical fractionation also indicates that divergent biochemical fractionation and not convergent leaf temperature explains the increase in <b>oxygen</b> isotope <b>enrichment</b> of cellulose across several biomes...|$|R

We review 3 ̆e 200 studies of hydrologic and gaseous fluxes and show how the interaction between land use and climate variability alters magnitude and frequency of carbon, nutrient, and greenhouse gas pulses in watersheds. Agricultural and urban watersheds respond similarly to climate variability due to headwater alteration and loss of ecosystem services to buffer runoff and temperature changes. Organic carbon concentrations/exports increase and organic carbon quality changes with runoff. Nitrogen and phosphorus exports increase during floods (sometimes by an order of magnitude) and decrease during droughts. Relationships between annual runoff and nitrogen and phosphorus exports differ across land use. CH 4 and N 2 O pulses in riparian zones/floodplains predominantly increase with: flooding, warming, low <b>oxygen,</b> nutrient <b>enrichment,</b> and organic carbon. CH 4, N 2 O, and CO 2 pulses in streams/rivers increase due to similar factors but effects of floods are less known compared to base flow/droughts.
