5|$|Established in 1667 by the German alchemist J. J. Becher, and {{modified}} by the chemist Georg Ernst Stahl by 1731, phlogiston theory stated that all combustible materials were made <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts.</b> One part, called phlogiston, was given {{off when the}} substance containing it was burned, while the dephlogisticated part {{was thought to be}} its true form, or calx.|$|E
5|$|A termite nest can be {{considered}} as being composed <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts,</b> the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the soil surface), and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.|$|E
5|$|Finale in {{moderate}} or fast tempo, and in sonata or rondo-sonata form. The {{themes of}} the finales are characterized by long passages of melody accompanied by relentless flowing rhythms. The exposition has no repeat written in. The development section is more ordinary in style {{than that of the}} first movement, with frequent modulations, sequences, and fragmentation of the exposition's first theme (or the main theme of the rondo). The recapitulation closely resembles the exposition, with the minimal harmonic changes needed to end the section in the tonic: the first theme returns in a shortened version; the second theme returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The coda is based on the exposition's first theme. It is composed <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts,</b> the first quiet and attenuated, creating a sense of expectation, the second animated, dissipating the final tension in decisive, agitated motion and ending with fortissimo tonic chords and octaves.|$|E

40|$|In a {{decentralized}} supply chain, {{raw material}} supply uncertainty, phantom orders of downstream firm {{as well as}} huge investment sunk costs leads to supplier's production capacity manipulation behavior. A supply chain consisting of a supplier and a retailer who faces a newsvendor problem is considered. The impact of supplier's production capacity manipulation on retailer's purchase decision is discussed. The retailer can adopt a menu <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>part</b> tariff contract regarding the terms of trade and capacity. Both supplier and retailer have prior belief about counterpart decision behavior. Then, we construct menus <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>part</b> tariff contract offered by the retailer to the supplier who has production capacity manipulation and type dependent reservation profits. Our results show that when capacity difference between type H supplier and type L supplier is higher than a critical threshold, the retailer offers <b>two</b> kinds <b>of</b> optimal menus <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>part</b> tariff contract in view of reservation profits difference between the type H supplier and type L supplier, and that both supplier and retailer's prior belief about counterpart decision behavior affect optimal menus <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>part</b> tariff contract. Finally, a case study shows our conclusions...|$|R

5|$|Hip hop is a {{cultural}} movement, of which music is a part, along with graffiti and breakdancing. The music is composed <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts,</b> rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals, and DJing, the production of instrumentation either through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism or beatboxing. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc {{is widely regarded as}} the progenitor of hip hop; he brought with him the practice of toasting over the rhythms of popular songs. In New York, DJs like Kool Herc played records of popular funk, disco and rock songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the songs and keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion breaks (the rhythmic climax of songs), thus producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over.|$|E
5|$|The Burnside Fountain is a non-functioning {{drinking}} fountain at {{the southeast corner}} of Worcester Common in Worcester, Massachusetts. It consists <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts,</b> a pink granite basin, and a bronze statue of a young boy riding a sea turtle. The basin was designed by architect Henry Bacon, who later designed the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., and the figure was created by sculptor Charles Y. Harvey. Harvey committed suicide before finishing the sculpture, and Sherry Fry completed the bronze. The Burnside Fountain was commissioned in 1905 by the city of Worcester after Harriet F. Burnside bequeathed US $5,000 to create a fountain to provide fresh water for people, horses and dogs, in the memory of her father, a prominent lawyer. The fountain was installed in 1912 in Central Square, then moved in 1969 to its current location on Worcester Common. In 1970 the statue was stolen, and was re-installed two years later. An attempted theft occurred in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Second Army was {{commanded}} by General Charles Huntziger, {{who was responsible}} for the defense of the Ardennes region of the frontier, including the Fortified Sector of Montmédy. The sector was composed <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts.</b> The eastern portion was defended by the Maginot positions of La Ferté, Chesnois, Thonnelle and Vélosnes, widely spaced and small, compared to the massive fortifications of other sectors like Thionville. The western portion of the Montmédy sector was even more lightly defended, with several lines of fortifications ranging from fortified houses near the border to small blockhouses farther back. None of the western defenses were of a scale sufficient to support La Ferté or to act as a significant block to an invading force without the organized support of mobile army formations. The relatively weak La Ferté position effectively acted as the western end of fixed fortifications.|$|E

5|$|There are 290 {{municipalities}} in Sweden, {{each with}} its own coat of arms. A local government reform in the 1960s–1970s made all cities part of a municipality. The city arms often—but not always—became the coat of arms of the new municipality. As some municipalities were created at this time by merging smaller communities, this led in some cases to arms consisting <b>of</b> <b>two</b> <b>parts,</b> each derived from one of the communities. Some new municipalities also lacked historical cities within, and therefore created wholly new coats of arms. Municipalities which carry the name of a city (with a few exceptions—see below) traditionally display a mural crown on top of their coat of arms. While no law forbids other municipalities from using the mural crown, it is customarily reserved for those bearing former city arms. Kalmar was the first to establish city arms in 1247, and Stockholm, Skara and Örebro were also among the first cities in Sweden to establish city arms. As recently as 2007, Härryda Municipality was among the last municipalities in Sweden to replace its logo with a newly registered coat of arms. Municipal arms may not use any colors (tinctures) other than argent, Or, gules, azure, sable and vert. As in other heraldic traditions, the rule of tincture applies and it is the blazon—not the image—that is legally registered.|$|E
