40|$|We {{introduce}} a scheme for creating continuous variable entanglement between an atomic beam and an optical field, by using squeezed light to <b>outcouple</b> atoms from a BEC via a Raman transition. We model the full multimode {{dynamics of the}} atom laser beam and the squeezed optical field, and show that with appropriate two-photon detuning and two-photon Rabi frequency, the transmitted light is entangled in amplitude and phase with the outcoupled atom laser beam. The degree of entanglement is controllable via changes in the two-photon Rabi frequency of the outcoupling process. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E

Predictions for the total <b>outcoupling</b> rate as a function of the radio-frequency and for the beam wave function are given. We establish a sum rule for the energy integrated <b>outcoupling,</b> which leads to a separate determination of the coupling strength between the atoms and the radiation field. For a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate analytic solutions are derived which are subsequently extended to include the effects of atomic interactions. The interactions enhance interference effects in the beam profile and modify the <b>outcoupling</b> rate of the atom laser. We provide a complete quantum mechanical solution which is in line with experimental findings and allows to determine the validity of commonly used approximative methods.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the feasible limits for realising a continuously evaporated atom laser with high-temperature sources. A plausible scheme for realising a truly continuous atom laser is to <b>outcouple</b> atoms from a partially condensed Bose gas, whilst continuously reloading the system with non-condensed thermal atoms and performing evaporative cooling. Here we use quantum kinetic theory to model this system and estimate feasible limits {{for the operation}} of such a scheme. For sufficiently high temperatures, the figure of merit for the source is shown to be the phase-space flux. The dominant process limiting the usage of sources with low phase-space flux is the three-body loss of the condensed gas. We conclude that certain double-magneto-optical trap (MOT) sources may produce substantial mean condensate numbers through continuous evaporation, and provide an atom laser source with a narrow linewidth and reasonable flux.

40|$|Diffractive optical {{elements}} (kinoforms) {{change the}} way light propagates, and can perform very complex tasks. They can split an incident beam into any number of outgoing, and possibly focused, beams (fan-out).

40|$|In {{the past}} 30 years, subwavelength {{gratings}} {{have been developed}} and produced as highly secured Diffractive Optical Variable Image Devices (DOVIDs). They allowed new distinct optical effects and dramatically lowered DOVIDs counterfeiting. In particular, subwalength gratings coated with a high refractive index dielectric are well-known and mass-produced to secure documents, such as the Diffractive Identification Devices (DIDs). These submicronic gratings are called Zero Order Devices or Filters (ZOD, ZOF) or diffractive microstructures designed for Zero-order read-out. Similar structures are called Resonant Waveguide Gratings (RWG) or Resonant Leaky Mode Waveguides, when optimized for different purposes. A study using time-resolved optical simulations can demonstrate and quantify how light is coupled and propagation in DIDs structure when observed across the gratings (in collinear incidence). The leaky resonant modes of the RWG are playing {{a significant role in}} the appearance of DIDs in collinear incidence, which has practical impacts on the engineering of such security elements.

While organic photovoltaic cells, organic semiconductor lasers, photodetectors and other organic electronics are still working to transition from the laboratory to commercialized products, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have found wide acceptance in small and medium, high-resolution displays, with signs of near-future adoption in TV panels and large-area lighting. The fundamentally different properties of the materials and principles of device operation offer great new possibilities in terms of energy-savings, color gamut, ease and cost of manufacturing, and novel form factors. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we review the operation and optics of OLEDs, focusing on the problem of extracting light trapped in the high refractive index regions of the device. Since nearly 80 % of generated light is lost before exiting in the forward viewing direction, detailed understanding of the underlying effects and methods to remedy the issue are necessary. We use 3 D finite-element modeling to investigate techniques to <b>outcouple</b> light in a typical OLED. Furthermore, we demonstrate a method of fabricating an embedded dielectric grid with an ultra-low refractive index as an effective means of enhancing outcoupling.

40|$|Terahertz (THz) {{technologies}} have numerous {{applications such as}} biological and medical imaging, security screening, remote sensing, and industrial process control. However, the lack of practical THz sources and detectors is still a significant problem limiting {{the impact of these}} applications. In this Thesis work, three novel THz radiation mechanisms are proposed and investigated, based on the distinctive electronic properties of charge carriers in 2 D single-layer graphene and related 1 D conductors (i. e., graphene nanoribbons and carbon nanotubes), combined with the use of nanoscale dielectric gratings. Numerical simulations as well as fabrication and characterization activities are carried out. The first proposed radiation mechanism is based on the mechanical corrugation of a single-layer sheet of graphene or 1 D carbon conductor, deposited on a lithographically-defined sinusoidal grating. In the presence of a dc voltage, carriers will therefore undergo periodic angular motion and correspondingly radiate (similar to cyclotron emission but without the need for any external magnetic field). My numerical simulations indicate that technologically significant output power levels can correspondingly be obtained at geometrically tunable THz frequencies. Initial graphene samples on sinusoidal gratings were fabricated and found to undergo significant strain redistribution, which affects their structural quality. Charge carriers moving in a flat sheet of graphene or linear 1 D carbon conductor parallel to a nanoscale grating can also produce THz radiation based on the Smith-Purcell effect. The role of the grating in this case is to diffract the evanescent electromagnetic fields produced by the moving electrons and holes so that THz light can be radiated. Once again, numerical simulations indicate that this approach is promising for the realization of ultra-compact THz sources capable of room-temperature operation. Initial experimental results with ultra-high-mobility graphene samples embedded in boron nitride films show promising THz electroluminescence spectra. The last approach considered in this Thesis involves graphene plasmons at THz frequencies, which can be excited through the decay of hot electrons injected with an applied bias voltage. A nearby grating can then be used to <b>outcouple</b> the guided electromagnetic fields associated with these collective charge oscillations into radiation.
