40|$|Haney, Michael W. In {{high-performance}} computing (HPC) systems, Moore's Law governs {{the density of}} integration and the switching speed of transistors on a chip. Moreover, optical interconnects are gradually becoming the majority of signal transmissions because of the higher bandwidth capacity, the low costs of polymer waveguides, and the immunity to electromagnetic interference. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) advances have enabled architecture that connects chips via an <b>opto-electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> board and a bridge chip to affect high-density inter-chip interconnects. This thesis uses FDTD simulation software to optimize the coupling efficiency between the bridge chip and the <b>opto-electronic</b> <b>circuit</b> board with microlens arrays. The {{two parts of the}} design are separated by the coupling design from a VCSEL to a waveguide and the coupling design from a transmission waveguide to a receiver waveguide. Also, the coupling design from a transmission waveguide to a receiver waveguide is separated by two different tapered waveguide couplers (the 45 o tapered waveguide coupler and the 37. 3 o tapered waveguide coupler). The two different designs of the tapered waveguide couplers are analyzed with the fundamental mode input and the multimode input. Therefore, we utilized simulations to analyze the coupling efficiencies and the alignment tolerances for those three designs.

40|$|Subject of study. A {{method of}} angular {{position}} measuring for point light {{source in the}} system with CCD arrays is proposed by converting of angle – time – code in low light conditions and at high signal / noise ratio. Assessment of the method potential accuracy is given. It is determined by instrumental irremovable random errors of measurement in terms of optimal processing of incoming information with a single reading it with CCD – arrays. Method. This work introduces an optoelectronic system circuit with CCD arrays with stretched sensing elements and a point of reference for angular position measuring. In this case the arrays have images projections of both the reference point source and the target point source, which angular position is measured with high precision. From the CCD array output the signals arrive at an optimal (or apt) linear filter, {{and then to the}} signal peak position detection circuit. The scheme provides minimum error due to the influence of noise. Pulse edges, corresponding to the signals maximum, make a time interval filled with high-frequency counting pulses. The number of pulses in this interval will correspond to the measured angular position of the target point source. Main results. Analysis of random errors has been carried out in terms of statistical decision theory. Analysis takes into account the spectral function of the signals defined by transfer functions of the optical system and a CCD array as an image analyzer. Research of measurement accuracy is carried out depending on the clock frequency of reading information from CCD arrays for different values of signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the surface}} {{acoustic}} waves (SAWs) and quantum well (QW) interdiffusion technologies are used to develop modulation devices including electrooptic and electro-absorption QW modulators. The modulation devices are crucial components for generating optical signals in <b>opto-electronic</b> <b>circuits</b> {{in the use of}} communication systems. The propagation of SAWs and it effects on a III-V semiconductor QW are modelled to determine the change of the QW subband structure. The change of optical properties is evaluated so that the optical modulators using SAWs can be studied and optimised. For the interdiffusion technology, the constituent atom composition after interdiffusion is modelled by solving the diffusion equations. The modifications of the QW subband structure which change the QW optical properties are studied here {{for the use of the}} QW modulators and lasers. SAWs are generated by interdigital transducers deposited on the top surface of device structures. Our aims here are to optimise the change of optical properties, including the change of the QW refractive index and absorption coefficient and to simplify the structure of the transducer by increasing and reducing the SAW wavelength and power respectively. The theoretical results show that by optimising the QW structures in a stack from a single QW to a diffused QW (DFQW) and pairs of asymmetric double QW (DQW), the optical change can be enhanced 100 times as compared to conventional bulk SAW modulators. Besides, the SAW frequency and power can be reduced to ~ 100 MHz and few mW per SAW wavelength respectively. Recently, SAWs with a frequency of ~ 100 MHz have been demonstrated in single QW by others. These suggest that SAW-QW modulators can be realised in the near future. DFQWs used as both the passive cladding regions and active region of modulation devices are studied here. The results show that an electro-optical phase modulator with disorder delineated optical confinement is comparable to existing phase modulators. We also propose to use DFQWs as the active region of optical devices to produce TE and TM modes polarisation insensitive optical properties in both AlGaAs/GaAs and InGaAsP/InP QWs. At the same time, InGaAsP DFQW have been demonstrated by others as the polarisation insensitive QW amplifiers.

This circuit is commanded by a sequential program stored as a spatial distribution of Fourier Holograms into a photorefractive crystal. The sequential program is conformed by instructions, which have been codified as binary pixels maps.

40|$|The {{spectral}} {{range of the}} existing CL spectrometer (#approx# 300 nm - 850 nm) was extended to the near infrared region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} by adding a liquid nitrogen-cooled germanium (Ge) diode detector. A special adapter was constructed in order to use both the existing and the near infrared apparatus in quick succession. The {{spectral range}} of the modified CL spectrometer was between #approx# 300 nm (4. 13 eV) and #approx# 1800 nm (0. 69 eV). The efficiency of the spectrometer was increased by #approx# 3 orders of magnitude by replacing the inefficient fibre-optic based connection with a more efficient aluminium mirror-based connection, by introducing a GaAs photomultipliers (PMT) and by carefully aligning the optical components. The efficiency of the near infrared CL spectrometer was increased by #approx# 3 orders of magnitude by adding a phase sensitive detection apparatus. The monochromator wavelength error was measured to be between #approx# - 1. 1 nm and + 1. 9 nm. The absolute response of the spectrometer was measured for the first time using a novel calibration procedure which correctly reproduced the throughput occurring during routine CL analysis. Using this spectrometer, quantitative measurements of CL intensity may be made with a precision of up to #approx# 7 % in the near infrared region of the spectrum. The modified CL spectrometer had a spatial resolution of up to #approx# 200 nm and was able to detect up to #approx# 1 in 6300 photons/s in the near infrared region of the spectrum. This quantitative CL spectrometer was used to measure the black-body temperature of tungsten-strip lamps with a precision of #approx# 1 - 2 %. The lamps may be used as tertiary radiance standards to measure the absolute response of spectrometers between #approx# 500 nm and #approx# 1050 nm. The CL spectrometer was used to study MOVPE grown InGaAsP/InP-based mesa overgrowths and InGaAsP/InP-based butt-coupled laser-waveguide devices, to be used for the fabrication of <b>opto-electronic</b> integrated <b>circuits</b> (OEICs). Growth induced defects (threading dislocations) produced by 'Grappe' defect clusters present in the substrate were identified in the overgrowths using spectral CL analysis. The measurements also showed that non-radiative recombination centres were present in the lasers and that significant compositional variation and significant elastic strain were present in the devices. These deleterious processes caused considerable light and carrier leakage in the butt-coupled structures. They were also thought to accelerate the operation-induced degradation mechanisms and to be responsible for high threshold currents in the laser structures. The modified CL spectrometer was used {{for the first time to}} estimate the quantum efficiency of heavily- dislocated bulk InP material: by comparing experimentally measured CL efficiencies with CL efficiencies calculated from Monte Carlo simulations. The quantum efficiency, which was as low as #approx# 0. 05 % was found to vary strongly with the beam energy. The estimated quantum efficiencies could be accounted for by the presence of a high dislocation density (N_d #approx# 1. 5 x 10 " 9 cm"-" 2) or by an absorption coefficient which was #approx# 10 times higher than the literature value.

40|$|In {{recent times}} {{the use of}} silicon for {{fabricating}} active photonic devices has received widespread attention. Many photonic devices such as lasers, amplifiers, modulators and wavelength converters which were once conceived to be impossible to fabricate in silicon have been demonstrated. These developments are promising {{from the point of}} view of photonic related applications as well as for <b>Opto-Electronic</b> Integrated <b>Circuits</b> (OEIC). The convergence of electronic and photonic components can result in a cost effective and compact silicon chip. The application areas of such an OEIC can range from optical communications, through optical interconnects in Integrated Circuits (IC's), digital signal processing and sensing to biomedicine. The experimental demonstrations of silicon based photonic devices are promising. However, the performance of these devices needs further improvement to challenge their commercially-available counterparts made from III-V group elements. To enable performance optimization, development of suitable device physics and mathematical models are indispensable. The physics of the silicon photonic devices is electro-optic in nature. However, the mathematical models reported in the literature optimize the device performance from the optical point of view and account for the associated electronics in a very limited sense. The inclusion of the associated electronics is usually done through an extremely simplified term G=N/'tau', i. e., generation rate (G) of the free-carriers is equal to the recombination rate (N/'tau'), with 'tau' being the effective carrier lifetime. The transport of the free carriers is mostly neglected from the modeling equations. Such simplification may be valid for short optical pulses of picoseconds or less. However, in devices where the optical beam is a continuous wave, such an approximation is invalid as shown in this thesis. Further, the fabrication of the P-i-N diode structure in the silicon waveguide is a common method to control the free-carrier density in the waveguiding medium. The applied bias controls the free carrier density via the transport of the free carriers into and out of the waveguide. Hence it is intuitively clear that the modeling of these devices should exhaustively account for both the electronic and the optical physics. To accomplish such a coupled electro-optic model, three tasks were systematically carried out. In Chapter 3, the physical phenomena coupling the electronic and optical device physics was thoroughly studied. The coupling phenomenon is the plasma dispersion effect (PLDE) omenclature{PLDE}{Plasma dispersion effect}. The PLDE relates the linear dielectric constant of silicon to the density of the free charge carriers. In Chapter 4, an extensive study of P-i-N photodiode device physics was carried out. A P-i-N diode rib waveguide used in silicon photonic applications closely resembles a P-i-N photodiode. Thus, a thorough understanding of the carrier transport modeling and the P-i-N photodiode device physics helped in developing physical insight into the electro-optic process. This assisted in developing a novel sliced waveguide model in Chapter 5. The model enabled solution of the initial-boundary value differential equations, describing the electro-optic device physics of silicon photonic devices. The model was validated by reproducing the results of published work in the literature. The model was used to study the influence of the inclusion/neglect of the carrier transport on the CW Raman amplification. The discrepancy observed between the modeling results and the published experimental data were examined. The potential causes of the discrepancy were studied in Chapter 6. In particular space charge electric field strength, diffusion in the rib region and the distribution of the electric field in the depletion region were examined. The analysis resulted in some practical guidelines which may be helpful in the performance enhancement of the silicon photonic devices...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the fabrication and {{the properties of}} five new semiconductor laser diode structures. All of these devices were grown from the GaAs-AlGaAs ternary system using the liquid phase epitaxial technique. In addition, a new low noise avalanche photodetector is proposed. The first example is a new technique for fabricating cleaved mirrors without cleaving through the substrate. This technique, called micro-cleavage, has potential applications for both <b>opto-electronic</b> integrated <b>circuits</b> and for the fabrication of short cavity length lasers. In this technique, cantilevers are formed by a sequence of etching steps. These cantilevers are subsequently cleaved using ultrasonic vibrations. Three devices related to high power single mode lasers are described. The first {{of these is the}} large optical cavity buried heterostructure window laser. The output power of semiconductor lasers, particularly during pulsed operation is limited by catastrophic mirror damage which occurs at power densities above a pulse width dependent damage threshold. The damage occurs due to local heating up to the melting point of the active region {{in the vicinity of the}} cleaved mirror facets. However, catastrophic mirror damage can be avoided by isolating the active layer from the cleaved mirrors, as is done in these window lasers. The second device related to high power that is described is the Inverted Strip Buried Heterostructure laser. These lasers combine many of the best features of both the buried optical guide lasers and the strip buried heterostructure that have been previously developed elsewhere. The inverted strip buried heterostructure lasers have significantly better beam quality than buried optical guide lasers and can be operated in the fundamental spatial mode for larger emitting areas (and therefore greater output power). The third device related to high power lasers is a variation of a buried heterostructure laser in which the injected current is confined to a narrow section in the center of the active layer. The optical gain is therefore also confined to a narrow section in the center of the active layer. By doing so the fundamental mode is much better matched to the optical gain than the higher order spatial modes. The result is that fundamental mode operation is possible for buried heterostructure lasers with active layer widths up to 8 µm. When the current is injected uniformly into the active layer, fundamental mode operation is possible only for active layer widths less than 2 µm. In addition to the descriptions of these devices a theoretical chapter on high power single mode lasers is included. The final laser structure that is described is a single liquid phase epitaxial growth laser structure in which the current is restricted to flow between two narrow stripes located above and below the active layer. This structure, which is fabricated using a meltback-growth technique allows the current injection to be restricted to a very narrow section of the active layer, which results in several interesting properties which are described and explained using a simple model. The final subject of this thesis is a multilayer avalanche photodetector (APD) which has been proposed for low noise applications. The noise generated by an APD is dependent on the statistics of the carrier multiplication process, since positive feedback effects, which exist when both electrons and holes produce secondary pairs, can greatly amplify any current fluctuations. Significantly more noise is generated if the electron and hole ionization rates ([alpha],[beta]) are equal than if only one carrier produces secondary pairs. The multilayer structure described and analyzed in this chapter is expected to have impact ionization which is dominated by electrons and therefore would be of importance for low noise applications. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} traffic {{data requirements}} in telecommunication services {{lead to a}} continuous need for higher transmission capabilities. In this scenario, fiber-optic communications {{have proven to be}} a very promising way of achieving such high bitrates. Nowadays, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems support transmission capabilities of about 10 Tbps, through multiplexing of several hundred wavelengths with a single channel bit rate of ∼ 40 Gbps. For pre- and post- processing of information, WDM requires <b>opto-electronic</b> signal conversion <b>circuits</b> individually set and operated for each different wavelength channel; therefore this evolution leads to an impractical increase of circuitry complexity and power consumption. Moreover, with the transmission-capacity increase in WDM systems, coherent technologies have attracted a large interest over the recent years. The motivation lies in finding methods for achieving the growing bandwidth demand with multilevel complex modulation formats. To implement high-order complex (amplitude and phase) modulation formats, the optical in-phase and quadrature (IQ) components of the information signal need to be synthesized, processed and detected independently, additionally requiring proper synchronization of these two IQ optical paths. Therefore, {{in spite of the fact}} that the combination of WDM and coherent technologies enables a more efficient use of the available spectrum, it also hinders the required circuitry in the transmitter, receiver and intermediate network nodes. In this Thesis, we present and experimentally demonstrate new concepts and signal processing techniques that remarkably simplify the required electro-optical circuitry (and consequently the power consumption) in coherent optical systems. Furthermore, we also develop new ultrafast all-optical signal processors, able to process the information directly in the optical domain at ultrafast speeds (ideally, with speeds into the THz regime). These optical processing systems are becoming increasingly important for a myriad of scientific and engineering applications, including not only high-speed optical telecommunications but also optical computing systems, ultrafast biomedical imaging, or ultrafast measurement and characterization systems. Their fundamental goal is to avoid current electronic-based processing, which severely limits the operation speeds below a few tens of GHz and entails a bottleneck for the effective use of the high bandwidth intrinsic to optics. The problem of simultaneously controlling the amplitude and phase of a complex electromagnetic signal has long been solved in the spatial domain. Holography was developed as a lensless interferometric imaging system that was able to record and subsequently reconstruct the original complex-valued information signal, in spite of the recording medium being sensitive to intensity-only variations. Holographic systems have been widely applied in a vast number of fields, such as 3 D imaging, spatial-domain signal processing, microscopy or security. The basics of classical (spatial domain holography) are reviewed in Chapter 3, paying special attention to those concepts that will serve as foundations for the original ideas presented through this work. In this Thesis, we propose and formulate for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, the exact time-domain counterpart of spatial domain holography, by means of the space-time duality. This method, which is described in Chapter 4, enables simultaneous control of the amplitude and phase of a temporal optical waveform with complex envelope using a simple setup composed of devices sensitive to intensity-only or phase-only variations. To prove its effectiveness, several applications of time-domain holography are experimentally demonstrated and the results are presented in this dissertation. First, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate generation of complex-modulated optical waveforms using a simple setup mainly composed of an electro-optical intensity modulator and a band-pass filter. Then, these complex-envelope waveforms are detected (in amplitude and phase) using a heterodyne scheme based on an intensity-only photodetector. Additionally, we propose and implement a simplified scheme to perform electro-optical temporal phase conjugation. This holographic method greatly simplifies previous electro-optical approaches, avoiding the need for detection and subsequent processing of the phase of the optical signal prior to the electronicbased conjugation process. Instead, the proposed approach uses intensity-only photodetection and modulation components, combined with a band-pass filter, thus reducing the complexity and potential cost of the setup, minimizing errors and simplifying the procedure. Finally, we demonstrate wavelength conversion of complex-envelope optical signals based on time-domain holography. In this case, an all-optical approach based on nonlinear cross-phase modulation is used. This technique exhibits important advantages with respect to all previous approaches that typically use four-wave mixing, as it avoids the stringent phase-matching condition and requires at least one order of magnitude less power in the employed pump signals. Using the Fourier-transform property of duality between the time domain and the frequency domain, we also propose and formulate, for the first time, the concept of spectral-domain holography, which is described in Chapter 5. This novel concept enables the simultaneous control of the amplitude and phase of an optical spectral response by just manipulating the amplitude spectrum. Spectral-domain holography is applied to the design of two kinds of signal processors. First, we implement complex-valued and non-symmetrical optical pulse shaping using a scheme based on time-domain spectral shaping, which achieves temporal resolutions in the sub-picosecond regime but has been typically restricted to symmetric and intensity-only pulse shaping operations. In this scheme, the modulating signal that performs the spectral shaping is a spectral hologram, enabling the synthesis of complex-envelope output waveforms using a setup identical to that of previous spectral shaping methods. The proposed methodology can be considered as the time-domain counterpart of (spatial domain) Vander-Lugt filters. Then, we apply spectral-domain holography to the implementation of non-minimum-phase optical pulse processors using fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) operating in transmission, which can be considered as optical linear filters with a minimum-phase spectral response. In this case, the complex-valued spectral response of the target filter is encoded in an amplitude-only spectral response (the spectral hologram). The use of FBGs operating in transmission has well-known advantages with respect to the reflective configuration. In this Thesis, we present and experimentally demonstrate an additional extraordinary advantage: an FBG operating in transmission is able to implement signal processing functionalities with bandwidths well in the THz regime (one order of magnitude higher than conventionally achieved bandwidths) thanks to the degree of freedom available in choosing the spectral phase in reflection. In particular, we propose the use of a quadratic spectral phase in reflection, which translates into a linear chirp, allowing the increase of the grating’s operation bandwidth without increasing the grating spatial resolution. The novel concepts of time- and spectral-domain holography can be foreseen as powerful tools for the development of new techniques for the generation, measurement and processing of ultrafast complex-envelope optical temporal waveforms. In this Thesis, we have demonstrated interesting methods aimed at (i) simplifying the current required setup in coherent systems, and (ii) allowing the implementation of simpler, arbitrary ultrafast optical signal processing devices, which are key components for future, low power-consumption high-capacity telecommunication networks. Moreover, the vast number of applications of spatial-domain holography allows us to predict a similar broad range of applications for the time/spectral-domain holography...|$|R
