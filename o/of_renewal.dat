40|$|ABSTRACT: For {{applying}} life-cycle costing, {{the total}} costs should be computed over a bounded or unbounded time horizon. In {{order to determine}} the expected costs <b>of</b> maintenance, <b>renewal</b> theory can be applied when we can identify renewals that bring a component back into the as-good-as-new condition. This paper presents useful computational techniques to determine the probabilistic characteristics <b>of</b> a <b>renewal</b> process. Because continuous-time renewal processes can be approximated with discrete-time renewal processes, it focusses on the latter processes. It includes methods to compute the probability distribution, expected value and variance of the number <b>of</b> <b>renewals</b> over a bounded time horizon, the asymptotic expansions for the expected value and variance of the number <b>of</b> <b>renewals</b> over an unbounded time horizon, the approximation of a continuous renewal-time distribution with a discrete renewal-time distribution, and the extension <b>of</b> the discrete-time <b>renewal</b> model with the possibility <b>of</b> zero <b>renewal</b> times (in order to cope with an upper-bound approximation <b>of</b> a continuous-time <b>renewal</b> process). ...|$|R

5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, it became {{apparent}} that the facilities at Hampden were in need <b>of</b> <b>renewal.</b> As an amateur club, Queen's Park could not possibly fund the works, while Glasgow District Council withdrew funding and the UK Government decided not to fund it either. Queen's Park considered selling Hampden, but a public appeal and minor repair work kept Hampden open during the 1980s. The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, as alcohol was banned from football stadia in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting {{as a kind of}} regenerative insurance.|$|E
5|$|The next ruler was K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, {{a son of}} K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil.

He built a new version of Temple26, with the Hieroglyphic Stairway being reinstalled on the new stairway and doubled in length. Five life-size statues of seated rulers were installed seated upon the stairway.

5|$|His {{character}} {{took on a}} {{more sinister}} direction on the November 27, 2009, episode of SmackDown when he revealed that he had converted Luke Gallows, who had previously been portrayed as the mentally incompetent wrestler Festus, to the straight-edge lifestyle which had rid him of his mental troubles. Continuing to espouse his straight-edge philosophy, Punk began to present himself as a cult-like savior to the crowd, growing the hair on his head, face and chest in an allusion to Jesus. Through January 2010, Punk began to convert planted {{members of the audience}} to a straight-edge lifestyle, making them take a pledge of allegiance to him and shaving their head as a sign <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> and devotion. After converting many people who were not seen again, convert Serena began accompanying Punk and Gallows to form the Straight Edge Society. As well as leading this alliance, Punk was also the mentor of WWE NXT rookie Darren Young who flirted with the idea of becoming straight-edge before refusing just before his head was to be shaved.|$|E
5|$|In terms <b>of</b> <b>renewal,</b> Eliot {{believed}} that suffering {{was needed for}} all of society before new life could begin. The original Little Gidding community was built for living on monastic lines, but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646. The church, {{the centre of the}} community, was restored in 1714 and again in 1853. The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air-raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world. This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit, Pentecost, communion with the dead, and the repetition of history. The theme is also internal to Eliot's own poems; the image of the rose garden at the end Little Gidding is the image that begins Burnt Norton and the journey is made circular. Also, the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family Reunion.|$|E

25|$|Egyptian texts {{typically}} {{treat the}} dissolution of the world as a possibility to be avoided, and for that reason they do not often describe it in detail. However, many texts allude to the idea that the world, after countless cycles <b>of</b> <b>renewal,</b> is destined to end. This end is described in a passage in the Coffin Texts and a more explicit one in the Book of the Dead, in which Atum says that he will one day dissolve the ordered world and return to his primeval, inert state within the waters of chaos. All things other than the creator will cease to exist, except Osiris, who will survive along with him. Details about this eschatological prospect are left unclear, including the fate of the dead who are associated with Osiris. Yet with the creator god and the god <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> together in the waters that gave rise to the orderly world, there is the potential for a new creation to arise {{in the same manner as}} the old.|$|E

40|$|Consider {{a finite}} renewal {{process in the}} sense that interrenewal times are {{positive}} i. i. d. variables and the total number <b>of</b> <b>renewals</b> is a random variable, independent of interrenewal times.

This problem is motivated by traffic measurements in the Internet in order to characterize flows of packets (which can be seen as finite renewal processes) and where the use of packet sampling is becoming prevalent due to increasing link speeds and limited storage and processing capacities.
