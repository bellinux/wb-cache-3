5|$|Among the {{agricultural}} activities practised {{during the dry}} season, which halts work in the rice fields, the most traditional are those related to the exploitation of African <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> (Elaeis guineensis), which provides two products which are very popular in the region: palm oil and palm wine. Palm oil is an essential ingredient in local cuisine. As a carefully preserved condiment, it is combined with plain rice on holidays. The oil comes from the fruit clusters which are picked by men and then deseeded, allowed to dry, crushed in a mortar, and boiled by women.|$|E
5|$|The first Bintulu {{palm oil}} refinery, Bintulu Edible Oil Sdn Bhd, was {{established}} in June 1991.

However, as of 2015, Wilmar no longer buys raw palm oil produced from cleared forests and peat swamps in Sarawak because of environmental concerns.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysia, {{large areas}} of {{rainforest}} were felled {{to make way for}} <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding, the barn owl population, with its ability to control rodent pests, diminished. The provision of two hundred nest boxes in a trial saw almost one hundred percent occupancy and as the programme expanded, the plantations supported one of the densest barn owl populations in the world. Similarly, providing nesting boxes has increased the number of barn owls in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop. However, although barn owl numbers have increased in both these instances, it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of the rats is as compared to the trapping and baiting that occurred previously.|$|E

50|$|In 2014 {{the average}} total annual {{production}} of biofuels in Australia is approximately 800 million litres. This includes new ventures into biodiesel and algae-based biofuels. The cultivation of West African <b>oil</b> <b>palms</b> in the South East Asian jungles was first tabled by Australian botanists in the 1930s, {{but only in}} recent decades has there been cultivation of West African <b>oil</b> <b>palms</b> in South East Asian jungles.

30|$|Fertilizers {{are also}} major inputs for the {{production}} of <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> (Mohd and Mohd 2009), providing a direct link between crude <b>oil</b> prices and <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> prices. During periods of high prices for crude oil biofuel, and biodiesel in particular, have become alternative substitutes for crude oil. While the use of <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> for biodiesel production is still relatively small, this new economic relationship might give rise to transmission effects between crude <b>oil</b> and <b>palm</b> <b>oil.</b> Despite these theoretical links, findings of previous studies investigating the relationship between crude <b>oil</b> and <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> are contradictory. Yu et al. (2006) and Campiche et al. (2007) found that there was no co-integration relationship between crude <b>oil</b> and <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> for data up to 2007. Weak dependence between the growth rates of <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> and crude oil prices were found in a more recent study, using futures prices and extreme value theory (Chuangchid et al. 2012). However, Amna and Fatimah (2009) found that there was co-integration between <b>oil</b> and <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> prices, for the period from 1983 to 2008.|$|R
5|$|Open country species, which {{comprise}} {{the majority of}} bee-eaters, have mostly expanded in range as more land is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or limed, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.|$|E
5|$|By 1901 {{there were}} so few rubber plants left in the {{concession}} that the Free State authorities granted permission for the villagers to cut down the remaining plants and grind their bark to retrieve the rubber. Once this process was completed the rubber tax was abolished. The Abir company merged with the Société Anversoise in May 1911 to form the Compagnie du Congo Belge and now focussed on the management of rubber plantations and the gathering of rubber from them. However, later that year it agreed with the Belgian government {{to reduce the size}} of its operations and its monopoly status. In July 1911 it was banned from collecting rubber within the confines of its old concession for 18 months and was subject to new laws introduced by the Free State. The later history of the company is unknown but it continued to operate until at least 1926 when it split off its <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> concessions into the Maringa company.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, {{and this is the}} main means of prey location in the <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E

40|$|<b>Palm</b> <b>oil</b> (β-Carotene) was {{evaluated}} {{for its ability}} to inhibit/ ameliorate the aflatoxin β 1 -induced toxicity in six groups of experimental rats thus (water control, aflatoxin β 1 -treated, <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> treated, <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> and aflatoxin β 1 -alternate group, <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> and aflatoxin β 1 and aflatoxin β, and <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> treated groups). <b>Palm</b> <b>oil</b> (1. 4 μg β-carotene as <b>Palm</b> <b>oil)</b> was given orally while aflatoxin β 1 (2 mg kg‾ 1 body weight) was given up to eight days and γ-glutamyl transferase (E. C. 2. 3. 2. 2) activities were assayed in the liver and sera samples. The treatment with the <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> caused a significant decrease in γ-glutamyl transferase activities in the <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> treated groups compared with aflatoxin-treated controls in both liver and sera samples suggesting that <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> contains antioxidant principles. Also treatment with <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> ameliorated the histopathological lesion like fatty degeneration and necrosis induced by aflatoxin β 1 thus suggesting that <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> was cytoprotective. It is concluded that pretreatment with <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> was necessary for maximum inhibition of aflatoxin β 1 -induced toxicity. The mechanism of inhibition by <b>palm</b> <b>oil</b> appeared to be inhibition of propagation of free radicals.

5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} the storm's passage, the Government of Thailand began distributing {{relief goods}} to {{residents}} throughout the affected provinces. Despite the effort by the government, 2,500 people from Pa Thiew and Tha Sae demonstrated for additional and more intensive aid on 9 November. These protests were soon dispersed. Following considerable criticism for downplaying {{the impact of the}} typhoon, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan delayed his visit to the United States to oversee relief efforts. By 15 November the United States pledged to donate US$25,000 for recovery operations. Telephone connection was restored from Bangkok to Prachuap Khiri Khan by this time; however, areas further south remained disconnected. Generators were brought in to keep hospitals and government offices running since much of Chumphon Province remained without electricity for more than two weeks. As the scale of damage became more apparent, a request for international aid was made by 17 November to the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. Upon the announcement of the request, six countries pledged to provide nearly US$510,000 in funds collectively. Agriculture across Surat Thani Province was severely affected by the typhoon in the long-term as well. In the four years following Typhoon Gay, land use for orchards, rubber, and <b>oil</b> <b>palm</b> plantations decreased from 33.32percent to 30.53percent.
