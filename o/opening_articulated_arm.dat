Firstly, a quasi-spherical coordinate system is put forward based on DH method {{according to the}} special structure of the <b>articulated</b> <b>arm</b> flexible CMM. This calibration method is presented to determine and separate machine parameters and errors in a creative way based on multiple reversal technology. Experiments were carried out for a Faro Platinum 4 ft <b>articulated</b> <b>arm</b> CMM by using a Chameleon 9159 5 Q orthogonal CMM. The results prove the feasibility of the proposed method for <b>articulated</b> <b>arm</b> CMM calibration, and all parameters are separated completely. It provides a theoretical base for introducing error compensation and improves the measurement accuracy of the <b>articulated</b> <b>arm</b> CMM...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe <b>Articulated</b> <b>Arm</b> Coordinate Measuring Machines (AACMM) have {{gradually}} evolved and are increasingly used in mechanic industry. At present, measurement uncertainties {{relating to the}} use of these devices are not yet well-quantified. The work carried out consists on determining the measurement uncertainties of a mechanical part by an <b>Articulated</b> <b>Arm</b> Coordinate Measuring Machine. The studies aiming to develop a model of measurement uncertainties are based on the Monte Carlo method developed in Supplement 1 of the Guide to Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement [1] but also identifying and characterizing the main sources of uncertainty. A Multi-level Monte Carlo approach principle has been developed which allows characterizing the possible evolution of the <b>Articulated</b> <b>Arm</b> CMM during the measurement and quantifying in a second level the uncertainty on the considered measurand. The first Monte Carlo level is the most complex and is thus divided into 3 sub-levels, namely characterization on positioning error of a point, estimation of calibration errors and evaluation of fluctuations of the “localization point”. The global method is thus presented and results of the first sub-level are particularly developed. The main sources of uncertainty, including AACMM deformations are exposed...|$|R
