40|$|Within {{the field}} of {{microbiology}} there {{is a group of}} bacteria termed, anaerobic, because of their aversion to oxygen. Clinical and industrial interest in these bacteria has made the use of anaerobic systems necessary for widespread testing and research. The glove-less anaerobic chamber has become the premier method for successful cultivation of anaerobic isolates. A prototype anaerobic chamber design contains new features and different anaerobic techniques formed around additional specifications given by microbiologists. Through testing and discussion of the anaerobic systems of this prototype, the design is evaluated based on its anaerobic performance. The three chamber systems that maintain the anaerobic environment are: the circulation system, the passbox, and the <b>operator</b> <b>access</b> armports. The prototype’s techniques for these three systems are compared to a previous prototype’s. The new prototype successfully meets the microbiologist’s specifications but in doing so has significantly changed the systems of the chamber. This evaluation has shown that this chamber’s unique systems successfully maintain anaerobic conditions, but their design has limitations...|$|E
40|$|The {{installation}} of essential systems into aircraft wings involves numerous labour-intensive processes. Many human operators {{are required to}} perform complex manual tasks {{over long periods of}} time in very challenging physical positions due to the limited access and confined space. This level of human activity in poor ergonomic conditions directly impacts on speed and quality of production but also, in the longer term, can cause costly human resource problems from operators' cumulative development of musculoskeletal injuries. These problems are exacerbated in areas of the wing which house multiple systems components because the volume of manual work and number of operators is higher but the available space is reduced. To improve the efficiency of manual work processes which cannot yet be automated we therefore need to consider how we might redesign systems installations in the enclosed wing environment to better enable <b>operator</b> <b>access</b> and reduce production time. This paper describes a recent study that applied design for assembly and maintainability principles and CATIA v 5 computer aided design software to identify small design changes for wing systems installation tasks. Results show positive impacts for ergonomics, production time and cost, and maintainability, whilst accounting for aircraft performance and machining capabilities...|$|E

40|$|From the {{operator}} perspective, reliable data gathered from strategic network locations {{make all the}} difference for a number of applications, such as quality and SLA monitoring, network planning or security purposes (threat identification and profiling, violation of terms of use, etc.). Operators still follow classic approaches based on a limited number of standalone probes and filters positioned along strategic places on their own core network, that gather information about specific trends and patterns [1]. However, this model is not scaling properly with the sheer increase of traffic flow volume and diversity [2] – a consequence of access technologies such as DSL and optical fiber and applications such as IPTV, video-on-demand, voice and P 2 P. In order to solve this, we suggest moving the monitoring probes to the edges of the access network. More specifically, we propose to place monitoring probes in the borderline between the <b>operator</b> <b>access</b> network and the home network of each subscriber. By massively distributing the monitoring process (from a limited number of probes in the core network to thousands of probes) each probe deals with a much smaller traffic flow, making it possible to apply fine-grained processing techniques. It also becomes possible to use already available network equipment: the broadband routers the subscribers already installed and paid for. The advantages of such a...|$|E

40|$|The Arctic is a {{challenging}} environment for making in-situ radiation measurements. A standard suite of radiation sensors is typically {{designed to measure}} the total, direct and diffuse components of incoming and outgoing broadband shortwave (SW) and broadband thermal infrared, or longwave (LW) radiation. Enhancements can include various sensors for measuring irradiance in various narrower bandwidths. Many solar radiation/thermal infrared flux sensors utilize protective glass domes and some are mounted on complex mechanical platforms (solar trackers) that rotate sensors and shading devices that track the sun. High quality measurements require striking a balance between locating sensors in a pristine undisturbed location free of artificial blockage (such as buildings and towers) and providing accessibility to allow operators to clean and maintain the instruments. Three significant sources of erroneous data include solar tracker malfunctions, rime/frost/snow deposition on the instruments and operational problems due to limited <b>operator</b> <b>access</b> in extreme weather conditions. In this study, a comparison is made between the global and component sum (direct [vertical component] + diffuse) shortwave measurements. The {{difference between these two}} quantities (that theoretically should be zero) is used to illustrate the magnitude and seasonality of radiation flux measurement problems. The problem of rime/frost/snow deposition is investigated in more detail for one case study utilizing both shortwave and longwave measurements. Solutions to these operational problems are proposed that utilize measurement redundancy, more sophisticated heating and ventilation strategies and a more systematic program of operational support and subsequent data quality protocols...|$|E
