5|$|The dock {{was used}} for fitting out vessels, and the crane would lift engines and boilers into ships. The lifting {{capacity}} of the Titan, and the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> at {{the confluence of the}} River Clyde and River Cart, contributed to the success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> as it could build extremely large ships.|$|E
5|$|North of Ontario Avenue, the {{buildings}} surrounding NY61 become more {{commercial and industrial}} in nature as the route approaches the CSX Transportation Niagara Yard.

The Niagara Falls Amtrak station, which Hyde Park Boulevard passes by but provides no access to, is located just off Lockport Road on 27th Street.|$|E
5|$|The Recreation Yard was {{the yard}} used by inmates {{of the prison}} between 1934 and 1963. It is located {{opposite}} the dining hall south {{of the end of}} D-Block, facing the mainland on a raised level surrounded by a high wall and fence above it. Guard Tower #3 lay just to the west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> The gun gallery was situated in the yard, mounted on one of the dining hall's exterior walls.|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> {{demographics}} changed, <b>the</b> paper {{struggled to}} remain {{relevant to the}} neighborhood population. The focus shifted away from Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards.</b> Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> Community Council tried to persuade the Journal to adapt a biligual approach, but the publisher believed that doding so wouldn't be profitable for the paper.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> Journal was {{established}} in January 1937. Originally designed to serve Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards,</b> its coverage gradually expanded to ethnic white neighborhoods further west. The paper was headquartered at the strip mall near 47th and Damen.|$|R

5|$|In 1908, the Royal Edward Dock {{was built}} in Avonmouth and in 1972 the large deep water Royal Portbury Dock was {{constructed}} {{on the opposite side}} of the mouth of the Avon, making the Bristol City Docks in the floating harbour redundant as a freight dock. In 1977 Charles Hill & Sons, the last shipbuilder at the Albion Yard, closed after delivering the 1541 tonne beer tanker Miranda Guinness. Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> reopened in 1980 when Abels Shipbuilders began operating, who still produce a steady stream of small ferries, survey vessels, tugs and other craft.|$|E
5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E
5|$|Just beyond East Norwood, the Pennsylvania built McCullough Yard in 1927, {{improving}} switching {{operations for}} the growing industrial base in Norwood. A connection was included to the Pennsylvania's Chicago-bound Richmond Branch, which the CL crossed over north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard.</b> In Butler County, north of Brecon, the CL curved abruptly northeast onto the original line, partially graded in the 1850s between Sharonville and Lebanon. Just beyond, it began to descend slowly through Mason to Hageman, where it crossed the Middletown Branch, and then rose slightly, alongside Turtle Creek, to Lebanon. The Pennsylvania tore down the original Lebanon passenger station in 1960, replacing it (for freight purposes) with a smaller building from Kings Mills on the Little Miami Railroad. The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs acquired the land in 1972, tore down the freight depot, and erected {{a replica of the}} old passenger depot in its place, with a gift shop inside.|$|E
50|$|In August 2007, Malone {{acquired}} <b>the</b> Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> Journal {{and moved}} its headquarters to City Newshound's location. By this point, the paper's coverage primarely focused on Brighton Park, Archer Heights, McKinley Park and Bridgeport. In February 2007, Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> Journal was renamed Journal News to reflect that.|$|R
50|$|In 1939, Alinsky {{successfully}} organized <b>the</b> Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> {{neighborhood in}} <b>the</b> slums <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stockyards area <b>of</b> Chicago. His Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> Neighborhood Council successfully fought for major civic improvements and {{stands as a}} landmark success in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Alinsky's organizing. It still exists today. An important reason for <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> Alinsky and <b>the</b> Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards</b> Council was <b>the</b> strong support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Catholic Diocese of Chicago, with its advocacy of social activism. Auxiliary Bishop Bernard Sheil championed Alinsky's work in <b>the</b> Back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yards,</b> and such other notable Chicago Roman Catholic Church leaders as Cardinal Samuel Stritch and Monsignor John Egan would continue to provide him with invaluable moral and financial support. In short, Alinsky's methods of community organizing would be rooted in socially active churches, most notably Roman Catholic.|$|R

The yard consists of four groups of sidings: arrival roads, two groups of classification roads, and departure tracks.

50|$|Galesburg is <b>the</b> home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Railroad Days festival held on <b>the</b> fourth weekend <b>of</b> June. <b>The</b> festival {{began in}} 1977 as {{an open house}} to the public from the then Burlington Northern. Burlington Northern gave train car tours <b>of</b> their <b>yards.</b> <b>The</b> City <b>of</b> Galesburg started having street fairs to draw more people to town. In 1981, the Galesburg Railroad Museum was founded and opened during Railroad Days. For a while, {{the city and the}} {{railroad}} worked together on planning the annual celebrations. In 2002, the railroad backed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> festival and there were no tours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b> In 2003 <b>the</b> city worked with local groups to revamp the festival and the Galesburg Railroad Museum resumed bus tours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b> <b>The</b> Galesburg Railroad Museum has continued to provide tours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards</b> since then. In 2010, the Galesburg Railroad Museum started offering a VIP tour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards,</b> in which a select group of riders would be allowed in the Hump Towers and Diesel Shop and see the BNSF at work.
