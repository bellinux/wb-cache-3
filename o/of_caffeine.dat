5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may {{be likely to}} have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, {{but it also has}} been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
25|$|Doses <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> {{equivalent}} to the amount normally found in standard servings of tea, coffee and carbonated soft drinks appear to have no diuretic action. However, acute ingestion <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> in large doses (at least 250–300mg, {{equivalent to}} the amount found in 2–3 cups of coffee or 5–8 cups of tea) results in a short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals who have been deprived <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> {{for a period of}} days or weeks. This increase is due to both a diuresis (increase in water excretion) and a natriuresis (increase in saline excretion); it is mediated via proximal tubular adenosine receptor blockade. The acute increase in urinary output may increase the risk of dehydration. However, chronic users <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> develop a tolerance to this effect, and experience no increase in urinary output.|$|E

50|$|Although {{a common}} {{technique}} of discarding a short (30- to 60-second) steep {{is believed to}} much reduce <b>caffeine</b> content <b>of</b> a subsequent brew {{at the cost of}} some loss of flavor, research suggests that a five-minute steep yields up to 70% <b>of</b> the <b>caffeine,</b> and a second steep has one-third the <b>caffeine</b> <b>of</b> the first (about 23% <b>of</b> the total <b>caffeine</b> in the leaves).|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effect <b>of</b> the initial <b>caffeine</b> concentration (1 - 8 g/L) on growth and caffeine consumption by Aspergillus tamarii as well as pellet morphology, in submerged fermentation. Caffeine was used as sole nitrogen source. At 1 g/L <b>of</b> initial <b>caffeine</b> concentration, caffeine degradation was not affected, resulting in a production of 8. 7 g/L of biomass. The highest biomass production (12. 4 - 14. 8 g/L) was observed within a range of 2 to 4 g/L <b>of</b> initial <b>caffeine</b> concentration. At these initial caffeine concentrations, after 96 h of fermentation, 41 - 51 % <b>of</b> the initial <b>caffeine</b> was degraded. Using an initial <b>caffeine</b> concentration <b>of</b> 2 - 3 g/L, the highest specific growth rate was observed (mu = 0. 069 1 /h).

25|$|Caffeine is also {{a common}} {{ingredient}} of soft drinks, such as cola, originally prepared from kola nuts. Soft drinks typically contain 0 to 55 milligrams <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> per 12 ounce serving. By contrast, energy drinks, such as Red Bull, can start at 80 milligrams <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> per serving. The caffeine in these drinks either originates from the ingredients used or is an additive derived from the product of decaffeination or from chemical synthesis. Guarana, a prime ingredient of energy drinks, contains large amounts <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> with small amounts of theobromine and theophylline in a naturally occurring slow-release excipient.|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} the simultaneous determination <b>of</b> catechins and <b>caffeine</b> in green, black tealeaves and canned tea-drink using micellar electrokinetic chromatography. The catechins analyzed include(+) -catechin, (-) -epicatechin, (-) -epigallocatechin, (-) -epicatechin gallate and (-) -epigallocatechin gallate. Using UV absorption method at 280 nm, {{the limits of}} detections <b>of</b> catechins and <b>caffeine</b> are 10 (- 6) mol/L, which is suitable for the real sample determination. Using this analytical method, the extraction of these compounds from the tealeaves with hot water is compared under different temperatures. The effects of temperature on the amount <b>of</b> catechins and <b>caffeine</b> extracted are evident, showing that (-) -epigallocatechin gallate is the most easiest to be extracted at 100 degreesC. The stability <b>of</b> catechins and <b>caffeine</b> in stocking solution of tea-drink at 4 degreesC is also compared on five consecutive days. The contents <b>of</b> catechins and <b>caffeine</b> in green and black teas are discussed and the difference of the content between different tealeaves can provide a reference {{for the assessment of}} tea quality...|$|R

25|$|Chocolate {{derived from}} cocoa beans {{contains}} {{a small amount}} <b>of</b> <b>caffeine.</b> The weak stimulant effect of chocolate {{may be due to}} a combination of theobromine and theophylline, as well as caffeine. A typical 28-gram serving of a milk chocolate bar has about as much caffeine as a cup of decaffeinated coffee. By weight, dark chocolate has one to two times the amount <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> as coffee: 80–160mg per 100g. Higher percentages of cocoa such as 90% amount to 200mg per 100g approximately and thus, a 100 gram 85% cocoa chocolate bar contains about 195mg caffeine.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance varies for daily, regular {{caffeine}} {{users and}} high caffeine users. High doses <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> (750 to 1200mg/day {{spread throughout the}} day) {{have been shown to}} produce complete tolerance to some, but not all of the effects <b>of</b> <b>caffeine.</b> Doses as low as 100mg/day, such as a 6 oz cup of coffee or two to three 12 oz servings of caffeinated soft-drink, may continue to cause sleep disruption, among other intolerances. Non-regular caffeine users have the least caffeine tolerance for sleep disruption. Some coffee drinkers develop tolerance to its undesired sleep-disrupting effects, but others apparently do not.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine {{can have}} {{multiple}} effects at the cellular level but is primarily notable for the alertness effect {{that it has}} on people. Research has been performed involving phonological priming and TOTs in which participants took either 200mg <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> or a placebo. The participants answered 100 general knowledge questions, each with one correct answer. For each question, participants read 10 priming words that were displayed on a monitor {{for a short period}} of time. Each list of 10 priming words had between two and eight words that were phonologically related to the correct answer of the question, with the remaining words being unrelated. Caffeinated participants had fewer TOT experiences than the placebo group, suggesting better memory recall. However, in the unrelated condition, the caffeinated group did not do as well as the placebo group in their ability to retrieve words. The results suggest that this dose <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> (equivalent to two cups of coffee) can temporarily hinder a person’s short-term recall of certain words. Moreover, the general advantageous effect <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> on attention can be ruled out.|$|E
50|$|Decaffeination is {{the process}} <b>of</b> extracting <b>caffeine</b> from green coffee beans prior to roasting. The most common decaffeination process used in the United States is {{supercritical}} carbon dioxide (CO2) extraction. In this process, moistened green coffee beans are contacted with large quantities of supercritical CO2 (CO2 maintained at a pressure of about 4,000 pounds force per square inch (28 MPa) and temperatures between 90 and 100 C), which removes about 97% <b>of</b> the <b>caffeine</b> from the beans. The caffeine is then recovered from the CO2, typically using an activated carbon adsorption system.|$|R

25|$|Caffeine {{overdose}} {{can result}} in a state of central nervous system over-stimulation called caffeine intoxication (DSM-IV 305.90). This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts <b>of</b> <b>caffeine,</b> well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400–500mg at a time). The symptoms <b>of</b> <b>caffeine</b> intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation. In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, disinhibition, delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Caffeine</b> {{is capable}} <b>of</b> {{increasing}} work capacity while individuals perform strenuous tasks. In one study, caffeine provoked a greater {{maximum heart rate}} while a strenuous task was being performed compared to a placebo. This tendency is likely due to caffeine's ability to increase sympathetic nerve outflow. Furthermore, this study found that recovery after intense exercise was slower when caffeine was consumed prior to exercise. This finding is indicative <b>of</b> <b>caffeine's</b> tendency to inhibit parasympathetic activity in non-habitual consumers. The caffeine-stimulated increase in nerve activity is likely to evoke other physiological effects as the body attempts to maintain homeostasis.|$|R
