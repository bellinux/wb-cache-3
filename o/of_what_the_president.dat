Talleyrand he come round to Hundred and Eighteen {{in a day or two}} to thank Toby for his kindness. I didn't mention the dice-playing, but I could see that Red Jacket's doings had made Talleyrand highly curious about Indians--though he would call him the Huron. Toby, as you may believe, was all holds full of knowledge concerning their manners and habits. He only needed a listener. The Brethren don't study Indians much till they join the Church, but Toby knew 'em wild. So evening after evening Talleyrand crossed his sound leg over his game one and Toby poured forth. Having been adopted into the Senecas I, naturally, kept still, but Toby 'ud call on me to back up some of his remarks, and by that means, and a habit he had of drawing you on in talk, Talleyrand saw I knew something of his noble savages too. Then he tried a trick. Coming back from an emigre party he turns into his little shop and puts it to me, laughing like, that I'd gone with the two chiefs on their visit to Big Hand. I hadn't told. Red Jacket hadn't told, and Toby, of course, didn't know. 'Twas just Talleyrand's guess. [...] "Now," [...] he says, [...] "my English and Red Jacket's French was so bad that I am not sure I got the rights <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> really said to the unsophisticated Huron. Do me the favour of telling it again." [...] I told him every word Red Jacket had told him and not one word more.

40|$|Scholars have debated {{extensively}} {{the impact}} of presidential rhetoric on public opinion and congressional behavior, but have largely ignored the determinants <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> actually says. This inattention is partly {{the result of the}} difficulty of acquiring systematic observations of presidential speech crafting. We devise a method of quantifying White House staff influence over the composition of rhetoric that captures the multistage negotiations between the president’s speechwriters and his policy advisors and provides a framework for future studies on the determinants of presidential rhetoric. We employ our method to study influence over the writing of President George H. W. Bush’s announcement of his veto of a tax bill. Presidential rhetoric is hardly an understudied phenomenon in American politics. Since Richard Neustadt (1990) famously defined presidential power as the power to persuade, political scientists have evaluated and analyzed the empirical evidence sup-porting this claim. Scholarly treatments of the subject have ranged from the development and normative consequences of the “rhetorical presidency ” perspective (Tulis 1987) and the strategic considerations behind “going public ” (Kernell 1997) to the impact o...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} 20 years nine colleges and {{universities}} have revamped their intercollegiate athletics programs by moving their teams to Division III of the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). In most cases, these schools had participated previously in Division I, or had some combination of teams in Division I and Division II. Moving from Division I to III is {{the exception rather than the}} rule. During the same time period that these schools made the switch, at least four times that amount moved from Division III or II to Division I. ^ Division I is oftentimes referred to as 2 ̆ 7 big time 2 ̆ 7 college athletics. Many Division I programs are characterized by huge football stadiums, big budgets, and head football and basketball coaches that are paid several multiples <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidents</b> <b>of</b> their institutions earn. In addition, these are the programs that are better known by the general public and are responsible for providing the majority of professional basketball and football players to the National Basketball Association, the Women 2 ̆ 7 s National Basketball Association and the National Football League. On the other hand, Division III schools usually have smaller stadiums and budgets, and pay their coaches much less than their presidents. Schools that participate in Division III are usually smaller than their Division I counterparts and are often private. Division I includes many large state flagship universities such as Ohio State plus nationally known private universities like Notre Dame and Stanford. ^ On the other hand, there are nationally known universities that do compete in Division III including the University of Chicago and New York University. This study will review the change in sports programs at two institutions which moved their athletics teams to Division III. It will attempt to discover and describe the motivations for the change in athletics program and the decision making process by which those changes were made. It will also describe any long-term effects and determine whether the athletics switch was an isolated move or was part of a larger strategy at each institution. ^ Knowledge gained from this study could be used by other institutions to help inform a decision to switch athletics programs from Division I to Division III. ...|$|R

40|$|On December 20, 1860, South Carolinians {{voted to}} abandon the Union and sparked the deadliest war in American history. Led by a proslavery {{movement}} that viewed Abraham Lincoln’s place {{at the helm of}} the federal government as a real and present danger to the security of the South's system of slavery, southerners—both slaveholders and nonslaveholders—willingly risked civil war by seceding from the United States. Rather than staying within the fold of the Union and awaiting <b>the</b> new <b>president’s</b> conduct regarding slavery in the territories and in the slave states, secessionists took bold action to change their destiny. By acting on their expectations <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> new <b>president</b> would do instead of waiting for his actual policy initiatives, they wagered on the possibility of a different future. This dissertation contends that the southern fear of slave insurrection, which was influenced by the Haitian Revolution, and the belief that northern antislavery forces would use violent uprising to end southern slavery shaped the planter ethos over the arc of the antebellum period, affecting national politics. Furthermore, this project explains why secessionists viewed Abraham Lincoln's support of the Wilmot Proviso as a valid reason for disunion...|$|R

500|$|The debt-ceiling {{crises of}} 2011 and 2013 raised <b>the</b> {{question}} <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is <b>the</b> <b>President's</b> authority under Section 4. Some, such as legal scholar Garrett Epps, fiscal expert Bruce Bartlett and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, {{have argued that}} a debt ceiling may be unconstitutional and therefore void {{as long as it}} interferes with the duty of the government to pay interest on outstanding bonds and to make payments owed to pensioners (that is, Social Security and Railroad Retirement Act recipients). Legal analyst Jeffrey Rosen has argued that Section 4 gives <b>the</b> <b>President</b> unilateral authority to raise or ignore the national debt ceiling, and that if challenged the Supreme Court would likely rule in favor of expanded executive power or dismiss the case altogether for lack of standing. Erwin Chemerinsky, professor and dean at University of California, Irvine School of Law, has argued that not even in a [...] "dire financial emergency" [...] could <b>the</b> <b>President</b> raise <b>the</b> debt ceiling as [...] "there is no reasonable way to interpret the Constitution that [...] ".

40|$|For decades, presidential {{scholars}} have posed various theories <b>of</b> <b>what</b> makes <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States {{an institution of}} such magnitude and influence. Executive power has long been taken as a given {{in the study of}} American institutions, but quantifying this power and determining what it looks like in practice {{has proven to be a}} more vexing endeavor. One particularly fruitful avenue of research into the study of presidential influence focuses on unilateral powers whereby the chief executive can set policy essentially without interference from Congress or the courts (though with some important exceptions). This dissertation expands upon our understanding of presidential power in the context of the unilateral executive by asking the following central research question: how effective are unilateral exercises of authority by <b>the</b> <b>president?</b> Assuming that an order given by <b>the</b> <b>president</b> is an order implemented, while appealing to those who would favor a strong activist chief executive, is a deeply flawed proposition. The United States federal apparatus, like many other hierarchical organizations, is subject to the same kinds of costs that have led so many bureaucratic scholars to study the impact of principal-agent theory; <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> too, faces these considerable obstacles. Using executive orders as the bedrock of the analyses herein, I expound upon the conditions that make directives appealing to <b>presidents</b> and when <b>the</b> bureaucracy will (and will not) respond to these orders as <b>the</b> <b>president</b> wishes. <b>The</b> two central conclusions are that presidents must develop a strategy in their usage of executive orders and that federal agencies have wide latitude in implementing directives. Extant theories of unilateral power must take these limitations into account as scholars continue to build towards a more comprehensive understanding of presidential power...|$|R
40|$|Founded at {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, the {{irrigated}} colony at Mexicali, Baja California was established by Chinese farmers and merchants as a cotton-growing enclave. This dissertation recuperates the marginalized history of this community's development and uncovers why this historical narrative has been erased. I use a diverse array of U. S. and Mexican archival sources to examine the frontiers of U. S. imperialism, explore Mexican racial formations, and trace changes to a trans-national Chinese community. Through different types of historical evidence I make four arguments. First, that a trans-Pacific conceptual framework helps to better understand the role that Chinese communities played in the formation of the U. S. -Mexico border. I details how the conquest of Mexico and imperial aggression in East Asia allowed the U. S. to usurp the colonial circuits of the trans-Pacific Spanish Galleon trade. Through the simultaneous assault in Asia and Mexico the Pacific became crossed with pathways that encouraged the Chinese to settle in the U. S. -Mexico borderlands. Second, that migrating Chinese merchants and farmers were central to the development of Mexicali. I illustrate how their expertise in China's cotton industry prepared them well to turn the desert border region into an irrigated colony. I trace their transnational geographies and social networks of this diasporic Chinese community in order to show how Mexicali became a Chinese place. Third, I contend that the racial boundaries of post-Revolutionary Mexican nationalism considered the Chinese community in Mexicali an immanent threat. I describe how definitions <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> one-time <b>president,</b> Abelardo Rodriguez, called "genuine Mexican colonization" racially segregated the economic development and political integration of Baja California. Lastly, I demonstrate how a series of racial programs of Mexicanización sought to undermine the Chinese community and expunge them from historical narratives of the region. Baja California historiography, Mexicali's public spaces, and a museum illustrate different modes of erasure and reconfiguration in narratives about the history of Mexicali's Chinese community...|$|R
