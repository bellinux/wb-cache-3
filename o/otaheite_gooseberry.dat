It is also found in wine, in vanilla, in Macrotyloma uniflorum (horse gram) and in Phyllanthus acidus (<b>Otaheite</b> <b>gooseberry).</b>|$|E
50|$|Phyllanthus acidus, {{known as}} the <b>Otaheite</b> <b>gooseberry,</b> Malay gooseberry, Tahitian gooseberry, Country gooseberry, Star gooseberry, Starberry, West India gooseberry, or simply Gooseberry tree, {{is one of the}} trees with edible small yellow berries fruit in the Phyllanthaceae family. Despite its name, the plant does not {{resemble}} the gooseberry, except for the acidity of its fruits. It is mostly cultivated for ornamentation.|$|E
50|$|At {{the summit}} of Mt Ciremai there is a 4.5 &times; 5 km wide caldera. Eruptions are {{relatively}} infrequent in historical time but explosive activity and lahars from the summit have been recorded. Mount Ceremai is especially significant {{because it is the}} highest mountain in the province of West Java. The name Cereme or Ciremai is derived from Sundanese word for <b>Otaheite</b> <b>gooseberry.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{bilimbi tree}} reaches 5-10 m in height. Its trunk {{is short and}} quickly divides up into ramifications. Bilimbi leaves, 3-6 cm long, are {{alternate}}, imparipinnate and cluster at branch extremities. There are around 11 to 37 alternate or subopposite oblong leaflets. The leaves are quite {{similar to those of}} the <b>Otaheite</b> <b>gooseberry.</b> The trunk and branches of tree has to be exposed to sunlight for fruits to form (traditional knowledge), which is achieved by removing leaves except from branch end.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Otaheite</b> <b>gooseberry</b> prefers moist soil. It can be {{cultivated}} {{in a variety}} of ways—budding, cutting and air-layering—in addition to the usual seed growth. The tree is cultivated for its ornamental value, but also for food and medicinal purposes. While it produces some fruit throughout the year, it is mainly harvested in January except in South India, where it bears crops in April-May and again in August-September. As the fruit does not soften when ripe, it is harvested when the fruit begins to drop.|$|E
50|$|The Phyllanthus acidus is an {{intermediary}} between a shrub and tree, reaching 2 to 9 m (6½ to 30 ft) high. The tree's dense and bushy crown {{is composed of}} thickish, tough main branches, {{at the end of}} which are clusters of deciduous, greenish, 15-to-30-cm long branchlets. The branchlets bear alternate leaves that are ovate or lanceolate in form, with short petioles and pointed ends. The leaves are 2-7.5 cm long and thin, they are green and smooth on the upperside and blue-green on the underside. In general, the <b>Otaheite</b> <b>gooseberry</b> tree very much looks like the bilimbi tree.|$|E
