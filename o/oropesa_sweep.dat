50|$|The {{need for}} a skilled {{minesweeping}} force was recognised {{to be a part}} of modern naval warfare and the Royal Navy later commissioned one flotilla of fleet minesweepers for the instruction of ratings and junior officers. Three trawlers were then added to the group along with the re-introduction of training in the Trawler Section of the Royal Naval Reserve and, under the new name of the Royal Naval Patrol Service courses in training began at Portland. As tensions mounted in the years before the Second World War training intensified for officers and ratings and experiments and developments in sweeping methods and equipment were carried out, including improvements made to the <b>Oropesa</b> <b>Sweep,</b> named after the trawler that first tried the method in 1918.|$|E
5000|$|For minehunting operations, Diamantina uses three [...] Riva Calzoni azimuth {{thrusters}} {{to provide}} a maximum speed of 6 kn: two are located at the stern, while the third is sited behind the variable-depth sonar. Mines are located with the minehunting sonar, and can be disposed of by the vessel's two Double Eagle mine disposal vehicles, the <b>Oropesa</b> mechanical <b>sweep,</b> the Mini-Dyad magnetic influence sweep, or the towed AMASS influence sweep (which is not always carried). To prevent damage if a mine is detonated nearby, the ships were built with a glass-reinforced plastic, moulded in a single monocoque skin with no ribs or framework. As the ships often work with clearance divers, they are fitted with a small recompression chamber.|$|R
