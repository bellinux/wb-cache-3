5|$|Cid {{is confronted}} by Vaan, Balthier and {{company at the}} Draklor Laboratory, which results in a fight that Cid loses. Cid survives the {{encounter}} and flees. Cid goes to the Pharos lighthouse to invoke the Sun-Cryst's full power, revealing himself to the main characters there once Gabranth is defeated. Enraged, Gabranth tries to attack Cid, who teleports <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> Venat throws the judge against a wall. Cid fights Vaan, Balthier {{and the rest of}} the party once again, and again loses. Cid dies after the battle, dissolving into energy absorbed by the Sun-Cryst before it is destroyed and fully activates his final airship, the Bahamut. A character named Cid appears or is mentioned in every main Final Fantasy. He made his debut appearance in Final Fantasy II, though this appearance is the first Final Fantasy game to feature a Cid character as a villain. Cid was voiced by John Rafter Lee in English and by Chikao Ōtsuka in Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Seleucus {{nominated}} his son Antiochus I as his co-ruler and viceroy of {{the eastern}} provinces in 292 BC, the vast extent of the empire seeming to require a double government. In 294 BC Stratonice married her stepson Antiochus. Seleucus reportedly instigated the marriage after discovering that his son {{was in danger of}} dying of lovesickness. Seleucus was thus able to get Stratonice <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>as</b> her father Demetrius had now become king of Macedonia.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Vito Genovese was angling {{to become}} boss of all bosses, and {{believed}} that Gambino would support him. Gambino, however, had his own mind. He secretly joined forces with Charles Luciano and Frank Costello to get Genovese <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> well. Gambino helped trick Genovese into a lucrative drug deal, then paid a small-time Puerto Rican dealer to testify against him. In April 1959, Genovese was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison, where he died in 1969.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, a major {{incident}} occurred during their first concert at the Oakland Coliseum on 23 July 1977. Upon arrival at the stadium, it was alleged that Bindon pushed a member of promoter Bill Graham's stage crew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> the band entered the stadium via a backstage ramp. Tension had been simmering between Graham's staff and Led Zeppelin's security team during the day, and as Grant and Bindon were walking down the ramp near {{the end of the}} concert, words were exchanged with stage crew chief Jim Downey, which resulted in Bindon knocking Downey unconscious.|$|E
25|$|With {{no other}} recourse, Charles Heidsieck {{set out for}} New Orleans seeking {{repayment}} directly from the merchants that received the Champagne. With the conflict of war, Heidsieck had to travel in secrecy into the South. This meant going as far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> Kansas to avoid detection by the Union Army. Upon his arrival in April 1862, he found the city to be nearly bankrupt and incapable of paying their debts financially. One merchant did have a warehouse full of cotton that was in high demand in Europe due to the shortages caused by the Union blockade. Heidsieck accepted the cotton as payment and attempted to smuggle the cotton out of the port in Mobile, Alabama {{with the use of}} two blockade runners. Despite ordering the ships to take different routes in hopes that at least one would make it past the blockade, both ships were intercepted and sunk with all cargo destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Unusually, Small Heath led at half-time {{at home to}} Sheffield United. Charlie Letherbarrow, in {{only his}} second {{appearance}} for the club, scored after ten minutes and again approaching the interval to regain the lead. Between the two legitimate scores, he hit a swerving shot which looped up off the chest of goalkeeper William Foulke and into the net, but the referee judged that the ball had been played in from behind the goal-line. In the second half, Wheldon converted a penalty kick when Foulke pushed Hallam <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> he attempted to reach a cross from Tommy Hands, and Letherbarrow completed his hat-trick as Small Heath won 4–1. Jack Oliver received a good reception {{when he returned to}} his former club– Small Heath were introduced as [...] "Oliver's team"– but Sunderland took no pity, winning 7–1. At Liverpool, an exciting game produced a 3–1 defeat. The three home forwards worked as one, putting extra pressure on the centre of the visiting midfield, and the defence was unable to hold them out. The game was rough at times, Liverpool's Joe McQue attracting particular attention because of an incident in the corresponding match the previous season when Caesar Jenkyns was sent off for his violent reaction to McQue kicking Frank Mobley in the abdomen.|$|E

2500|$|Carter {{was quick}} to attack racism as well as colorism in her columns. [...] "Children, you hear a great deal said about color by those around you, see {{attention}} given white persons by your friends that is wholly unmerited, while those of darker skin are treated with cool neglect. Such are wrong, and that you may avoid like mistakes I write this for you to read. Let your motto be, civility to all, servility to none. Those reminders of bondage we must get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> soon as possible; and while we would treat all with respect, we should not talk about color, light and dark, black and white." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enigk confessed in an {{interview}} in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of LP2, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; [...] "We broke up and we just felt like we were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat down to write them, because we just wanted to get it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations".|$|E
2500|$|Tom Bombadil is an NPC in the MMORPG game , {{serving as}} a main {{character}} in Book 1 of the epic quests. He also makes an appearance in EA Games' [...] as a summonable hero for the forces of light (except the dwarves) where his only real use is skipping through the battlefield, kicking enemy troops <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> he goes. Tom is a usable model in The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game produced by Games Workshop. In this, he is invincible, in that he can never be harmed in any way, but neither can he cause harm to any of his opponents. He can only be played in the Old Forest, as {{in keeping with his}} story.

2500|$|Even {{before the}} war, Nazi Germany {{maintained}} {{a supply of}} slave labour. This practice started {{from the early days}} of labour camps of [...] "undesirables" [...] (...) , such as the homeless, homosexual and criminals as well as political dissidents, communists, Jews, and anyone that the regime wanted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>As</b> the war progressed, the use of slave labour experienced massive growth. Prisoners of war and civilian [...] "undesirables" [...] were brought in from occupied territories. Hundreds of thousands of Poles, Jews, Slavs and other conquered peoples were used as slave labourers by German corporations such as Thyssen, Krupp, IG Farben and even Fordwerke—a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company. By 1944, slave labour made up one quarter of Germany's entire work force, and the majority of German factories had a contingent of prisoners. The Nazis also had plans for the deportation and enslavement of Britain's adult male population {{in the event of a}} successful invasion.|$|E
2500|$|The prologue [...] "Under New Management," [...] in 2000 AD #1649, {{sets the}} scene for [...] "Tour of Duty," [...] {{which began in the}} next issue. It is the first day in the term of office of new Chief Judge Dan Francisco, who in an earlier story has won an {{election}} for chief judge after campaigning on an anti-mutant platform. He exiles his predecessor as chief judge, Judge Hershey, and Judge Dredd from the city, due to their strong support for mutant rights. Francisco stops mutant immigration into Mega-City One and begins a policy of encouraging mutants to leave the city and live in four townships being built in the Cursed Earth, the inhospitable, radioactive desert outside the city. Dredd is put in charge of overseeing the construction and development of the townships, ostensibly because he is the best man for the job, but really in order to keep him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way.</b> <b>As</b> a further punishment, Dredd's protégé Judge Beeny is sent with him as his deputy.|$|E
2500|$|He {{signed to}} drive the No. 36 M's-sponsored Pontiac Grand Prix for MB2 Motorsports. In his first year of competition, Schrader had two top 10s and {{finished}} 18th in the standings. He posted five top 10s in 2001, but dropped to 19th in the standings. While competing in the Daytona 500, {{he was involved in}} a final-lap crash where Dale Earnhardt crashed into the wall and died. The image of Schrader peering into Earnhardt's car, only to jump back and frantically signal for assistance, is etched into the minds of many racing fans; his interview with Jeanne Zelasko during Fox Sports' post-race show was the first sign to many that something was wrong with the seven-time Winston Cup champion, as he appeared visibly shaken and upon being asked if Earnhardt was okay, he said [...] "I don't really know. I'm not a doctor. I got the heck <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> soon as they got there." [...] In 2002, Schrader did not finish in the top 10 in a single race, the first time since 1984. Following that season, he departed MB2.|$|E

2500|$|Up {{until the}} Arena Naucalpan 38th Anniversary Show on December 20, 2015 Danny Casas and Toscano had teamed up on several {{occasions}} without any signs of issues between the two. At the Arena Naucalpa Anniversary Show Casas, Toscano, Tortuga Rafy and Veneno lost to the team of Máscara Año 2000 Jr., Negro Navarro, Pirata Morgan and Trauma II. After the loss Toscano blamed Danny Casas for the loss, pushing him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> he left the ring. A week after the Anniversary show Toscano challenged Danny Casas to a singles match, which the veteran wrestler Toscano won by bending the rules. Following hs victory Toscano challenged Danny Casas to a Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match", with both wrestlers putting their hair on {{the line at the}} IWRG 20th Anniversary Show. In the main event, Toscano played the rudo part throughout the match, although all three falls ended cleanly. In the end Danny Casas pinned Toscano to win the third and deciding fall. Afterwards Toscano had all his hair shaved off while {{in the middle of the}} ring. After the match Toscano shook Danny Casas' hand and walked off. The storyline between Casas and Toscano ended at the anniversary show, the two faced off during the preliminary round of the 2016 El Protector tournament but showed no signs of animosity.|$|E
2500|$|The game also {{features}} a cast of secondary characters. Albert Genette is a freelance reporter on assignment to cover the Sand Island Squadron; he narrates much of the game's story. Captain Marcus Snow ("Swordsman") is a pilot on board the Osean aircraft carrier Kestrel, which is commanded by Captain Nicholas Andersen, a sea-worn veteran commander. Peter N. Beagle ("Pops") is the Wardog squadron's mechanic. Pops is a former Belkan pilot (actual name, Col. Wolfgang Huckebein) who during the previous war had been assigned the task of dropping a nuclear warhead on a Belkan city. He instead went AWOL and defected to Osean forces, at which time Bartlett found him and arranged a cover story protecting him from reprisal by both Osean and Belkan forces. Captain Allen C. Hamilton serves as the Sand Island Base Adjutant Commander, but in truth, he is a co-conspirator with the Belkans who trained under the antagonist [...] "8492nd Squadron." [...] Hamilton answers to base commander Colonel Orson Perrault, a portly and pompous Osean Air Force veteran who is blinded by Hamilton's influence over his decisions. The 48th President of the Osean Federation is Vincent Harling, a calm-natured pragmatist who struggles to restore the peace {{at the beginning of}} the war, but is later captured by the Belkans and kept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> a threat to the Belkans' plans to play off the superpowers against each other.|$|E
