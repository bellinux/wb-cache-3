25|$|Mouse and rat poison* {{ingestion}} {{is common}} in dogs. Most rodenticides in the United States are anticoagulant by depleting Vitamin K. This type is the most frequent cause of poisoning in pets. Third generation products contain brodifacoum or bromadiolone and are toxic after a single ingestion. Signs include spontaneous and excessive bleeding internally and externally. Treatment is with Vitamin K supplementation. <b>Other</b> <b>rodenticides</b> may contain cholecalciferol which causes hypercalcemia and leads to heart and kidney problems. Newer rodenticides may contain bromethalin which causes central nervous system signs such as seizures, muscle tremors, and depression.|$|E
50|$|In some countries, fixed three-component rodenticides, i.e., {{anticoagulant}} + antibiotic + vitamin D, are used. Associations of a second-generation anticoagulant with {{an antibiotic}} and/or vitamin D {{are considered to}} be effective even against most resistant strains of rodents, though some second generation anticoagulants (namely brodifacoum and difethialone), in bait concentrations of 0.0025% to 0.005% are so toxic that resistance is unknown, and even rodents resistant to <b>other</b> <b>rodenticides</b> are reliably exterminated by application of these most toxic anticoagulants.|$|E
50|$|Similar to <b>other</b> <b>rodenticides,</b> the {{preparation}} requires 3-7 days to be effective. Rather than killing rodents through internal haemorrhaging as anticoagulants do, PCC affects a rodent’s digestive system, causing acute dehydration {{due to its}} extremely absorptive nature (corn cob {{has been used in}} applications such as oil spills in water bodies, seed drying and de-icing). Physiological digestive pathways are disrupted, preventing normal regulation of water and salt levels, leading to hypovolemic circulatory shock through reduced blood volume and blood pressure, oxygen deprivation of the blood, and ultimately death.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the loss}} of DDT, Vacor (DPL 787) and <b>other</b> acute <b>rodenticides</b> and the serious use {{restrictions}} placed upon strychnine and 1080 for field use, it has become quite apparent that control of field rodents, more particular pine and meadow voles, with standard anticoagulants has become a difficult task, {{and in some instances}} impossible. Bell Laboratories, Inc. has chosen to take a very serious look at many of the older compounds and rework and reformulate these compounds into palatable and efficacious finished baits.

40|$|Abstract: The {{fundamental}} idea of IPM {{is to put}} nature’s own regulatory mechanisms to maximum use {{in order to prevent}} damage, which {{is in the best interest}} of manufacturers, society at large and the environment. However, Haines (2000) assessed stored products IPM still insufficiently developed at the end of the 20 th century. Support to IPM development in stored agricultural products is the use of natural compounds to control rodent pests. One of such compounds is cellulose, whose mode of action differs from the modes of <b>other</b> <b>rodenticide</b> active ingredients. As resistance to I and II generation anticoagulant rodenticides has been reported worldwide, we have introduced for the first time anywhere in the world a rodenticide based on Se (0. 1 % sodium selenite) with a mode of action based on the replacement of SH groups of functional enzymes with S-S groups. We also tested products based on vitamin D 3 with a known mechanism of action. The new Se-based products achieved good efficacy against rat (91. 10 % and 87. 50 %) and mouse (97. 60 % and 98. 40 %), and cellulose-based product against mouse (91. 66 %), compared to products based on vitamin D 3 in rat (90. 00 % and 90. 30 %) and mouse control (98. 60 % and 98. 2 %), bromadiolone in rat (93. 80 % and 90. 7 %) and mouse control (92. 86 % and 91. 9 %) and brodifacoum in mouse control (97. 06 %). The products based on Se, vitamine D 3 and cellulose have good toxicological and ecological properties and the fact that there have been no known cases of resistance make them recommendable for use against rodents in storage facilities.

40|$|The second-generation anticoagulants, difenacoum, bromadiolone and brodifacoum, {{have taken}} over a {{considerable}} part of the rodenticidal market during the last six to eight years. This {{is partly due to}} the higher efficiency against a larger spectrum of rodent pest species and partly to the increasing problem of physiological resistance to the older anticoagulants. Resistance of practical importance has, however, now been encountered to difenacoum and bromadiolone in Europe, i. e., UK and Scandinavia. Brodifacoum, in spite of the evidence of a somewhat increased tolerance in some commensal rodent populations, still must be considered a highly effective rodenticide against almost all important rodent pest species. Research leading to the synthesis of similar potent anticoagulant molecules or <b>other</b> slow-acting <b>rodenticides</b> should be encouraged in order to cope with the possible development of resistance also to brodifacoum in the future...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} investigating {{the efficacy of}} Prozap (zinc phosphide), Ramik Green, and Ramik Brown (diphacinone) rodenticides on woodrats infesting citrus. Based primarily on using feeding activity {{as an indication of}} population density, Zinc phosphide (ZP) provided a rapid knockdown of the rat population, and offered 60 to 75 % control. However, this product is known to cause "bait-shyness" following the initial application so additional control with subsequent applications of ZP targeting the same rat population would not likely result in a significant increase in control. Ramik Green and Ramik Brown are slow acting anticoagulant rodenticides, and performed similarly to each <b>other.</b> Anticoagulant <b>rodenticides</b> are not known to cause bait-shyness. In this study, these products only offered 20 to 38 % control, but it is possible that these values may be artificially low since the rats may have been preferentially feeding on stored oat groats used to gauge feeding activity rather than consuming the anticoagulant baits...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of the newly developed anticoagulant rodenticide WBA 8119 was evaluated against the house mouse (Mus musculus L.) using individual and family groups of warfarin-resistant animals. WBA 8119 at 0 - 002 %, 0 - 005 % and 0 - 01 % in pinhead oatmeal bait gave complete kills of mice in 'no-choice' feeding tests carried out in cages and small pens. In replicated 21 -day treatments on families of mice confined in larger pens conditioned to feeding on plain foods, the overall mortalities obtained using the three formulated poison baits were 71 / 72, 62 / 63 and 57 / 57 respectively. The results of the WBA 8119 toxicity tests are considered in relation to previous findings on <b>other</b> anticoagulant <b>rodenticides,</b> particularly difenacoum. In equivalents tests, WBA 8119 performed better than difenacoum.

40|$|The acute oral {{toxicity}} of the anticoagulant rodenticide diphacinone {{was found to be}} about 20 times greater to American kestrels (LD 50 = 97 mg/kg) than to northern bobwhite (LD 50 = 2, 014 mg/kg). Several precise and sensitive clotting assays (prothrombin time, Russell’s Viper venom time, thrombin clotting time) were adapted for use in these species, and this combination of assays is recommended to detect effects of diphacinone and <b>other</b> <b>rodenticides</b> on coagulation. Oral administration of diphacinone over a range of doses (sublethal to the extrapolated LD 15) prolonged prothrombin time and Russell’s Viper venom time within 24 to 48 hrs post-exposure. Prolongation of in vitro clotting time reflects impaired coagulation complex activity and was detected before or at the onset of overt signs of toxicity and lethality. These data will assist {{in the development of a}} pharmacodynamic model to assess and predict rodenticide toxicity to non-target avian species...|$|E

40|$|Epizootics {{of sudden}} death in tammar {{wallabies}} (Macropus eugenii) occurred at six research facilities and zoological gardens in New SouthWales, Australia, in late 1998 {{and at one}} Queensland research facility in March 1999. There were 120 confirmed tammar wallaby deaths during this period; however, population censuses indicated that up to 230 tammar wallabies may have died. The majority of animals died without premonitory signs. A small proportion of wal-labies exhibited increased respiratory rate, sat with a lowered head shortlybeforedeathorwerediscovered in lateral recumbency,mori-bund and with muscle fasciculations. Gross postmortem findings consistently included massive pulmonary congestion, mottled hepatic parenchyma and subcutaneous oedema throughout the hindlimbs and inguinal region. Approximately 30 % of the animals examined also had extensive haemorrhagewithin the fascial planes and skeletal muscle of the hindlimb adductors, inguinal region, ventral thorax, dorsal cervical region and perirenal retroperitoneal area. The tissues of affected animals became autolytic within a short period after death. Bacteriological examination of tissues from 14 animals did not provide any significant findings. Toxicological examination of the gastric and colonic contents of four animals did not reveal evidence of brodifacoume or <b>other</b> <b>rodenticides.</b> Viruses from the Eubenangee serogroup of the Orbivirus genus were iso-lated from the cerebral cortex of nine, and the myocardium of two, tammar wallabies and the liver and intestine of another tammar wallaby.
