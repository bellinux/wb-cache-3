40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{establish}} some {{results for the}} increasing convex comparisons of generalized order statistics. First, we prove that if the minimum of two sets of generalized order statistics are <b>ordered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> increasing convex <b>order,</b> then the remaining generalized order statistics are also <b>ordered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> increasing convex <b>order.</b> This result is extended to the increasing directionally convex comparisons of random vectors of generalized order statistics. For establishing this general result, we first prove a new result in that two random vectors with a common conditionally increasing copula are <b>ordered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> increasing directionally convex order if <b>the</b> marginals are <b>ordered</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> increasing convex <b>order.</b> This latter result is, of course, of interest in its own right...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Few {{school districts}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States have {{policies}} relating to do not resuscitate (DNR) <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school setting. School administrators are the gatekeepers of policy develop-ment. Little {{is known about}} administrator attitudes related to DNR <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school setting. School nurses need to understand administrator attitudes <b>in</b> <b>order</b> to facilitate DNR policy devel-opment. This study explored the attitudes of 15 administrators about DNR <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school setting through structured interviews. Administrators were asked their attitudes about DNR <b>orders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> school setting and about DNR policy implementation. The majority of administrators be-lieved that DNR policies should not be developed for the school setting because of the emotions involved and lack of administrator knowledge related to DNR orders. The majority of administra-tors did agree that having a DNR policy would clarify how staff should respond to DNR orders at school...|$|R
