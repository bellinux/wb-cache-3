40|$|International audienceFluid {{pressure}} has significant {{effects on the}} mechanical behaviour of fault zones, because it can change dramatically throughout the earthquake cycle. Here, we discuss how the heterogeneity of the fault materials affects the fluid transfer and slip processes in and around a fault zone. We present a numerical analysis {{of the interaction between}} fluid, stress and the development of slip in a fault zone with heterogeneous hydromechanical characteristics through the brittle seismogenic portion of the crust. In the model, the fault core, characterized by a low permeability and Young's modulus, is surrounded by a high permeability and more rigid damage zone with spatial variations of the hydromechanical properties. Strain-dependent porosity and permeability equations are specified, and the inelastic response of the material is described by a Coulomb criterion. This study shows various evolutions of fluid <b>overpressure,</b> <b>stress,</b> and slip along the principal shear zone depending on the heterogeneity of the fault. The analysis suggests that a pressure pulse can trigger earthquakes by reducing the effective normal stress of the fault, and that the size of the slip zone and the magnitude of the slip are significantly affected both by the reduction in fault effective strength and by the increase in fault porosity and permeability...|$|E
40|$|A 2 -D {{model of}} stress {{distribution}} within bulk solids, with circular arc principal stress orientation, in a wedge hopper {{was developed in}} a previous paper [Matchett, O'Neill, & Shaw, Stress distributions in 2 -dimensional, wedge hoppers with circular arc stress orientation - a co-ordinate-specific Lamé-Maxwell model, Powder Technology, 187 (2008) 298 - 306]. This model worked in an orthogonal, curvilinear co-ordinate system co-incident with the principal stress trajectories: (x - ψo) space. This paper presents an equivalent model in (x - ε) space. This allows backward numerical integration of the force balance equations, enabling surface and wall boundary conditions to be modelled. This was not possible in the original model. The equations are first-order, and boundary conditions can only be specified at single surfaces. Thus, if a stable, cohesive arch is proposed, the surface overpressure {{is determined by the}} model. Calculated overpressures have reasonable physical values. The present model was integrated backwards from the surface downwards and {{it was found that the}} integration was very sensitive to the surface <b>overpressure</b> <b>stresses.</b> Likewise, wall boundary conditions were specified with backwards integration in ε. The minimum outlet for flow was calculated from the model and compared with the experimental data of Berry et al. Wall normal stresses in a wedge hopper from Schulze and Schwedes were also compared to model predictions. In both cases there was reasonable agreement between measurements and model predictions...|$|R
40|$|Variability in the Lower Bowland shale {{microstructure}} is investigated here, for {{the first}} time, from the centimetre to the micrometre scale using optical and scanning electron microscopy (OM, SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Total Organic Carbon content (TOC) measurements. A significant range of microtextures, organic-matter particles and fracture styles was observed in rocks of the Lower Bowland shale, together with the underlying Pendleside Limestone and Worston Shale formations encountered the Preese Hall- 1 Borehole, Lancashire, UK. Four micro-texture types were identified: unlaminated quartz-rich mudstone; interlaminated quartz- and pyrite-rich mudstone; laminated quartz and pyrite-rich mudstone; and weakly-interlaminated calcite-rich mudstone. Organic matter particles are classified into four types depending on their size, shape and location: multi-micrometre particles with and without macropores: micrometre-size particles in cement and between clay minerals; multi-micrometre layers; and organic matter in large pores. Fractures are categorized into carbonate-sealed fractures; bitumen-bearing fractures; resin-filled fractures; and empty fractures. We propose that during thermal maturation, horizontal bitumen-fractures were formed by <b>overpressuring,</b> <b>stress</b> relaxation, compaction and erosional offloading, whereas vertical bitumen-bearing, resin-filled and empty fractures may {{have been influenced by}} weak vertical joints generated during the previous period of veining. For the majority of samples, the high TOC (> 2 wt%), low clay content (50 wt%) and the presence of a multi-scale fracture network support the increasing interest in the Bowland Shale as a potentially exploitable oil and gas source. The microtextural observations made in this study highlight preliminary evidence of fluid passage or circulation in the Bowland Shale sequence during burial...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{document}} {{the shape of}} dikes from well exposed field locations in the Isle of Rum, Scotland, 14 and Helam Mine, South Africa. The basaltic Rum dikes crop out {{on a smaller scale}} than the 15 Helam kimberlite dikes and have a smaller length to thickness ratio (~ 100 : 1 Isle of Rum, 16 ~ 1000 : 1 Helam Mine). We compare dike thickness field measurements with the geometry 17 predicted by elastic theory, finding best-fit models to estimate magma overpressure and regional 18 stress gradients at the time of dike emplacement. Most of the dike shapes fit poorly with elastic 19 theory, being too thick at the dike ends and too narrow in the middle. Our calculated 20 <b>overpressures</b> and <b>stress</b> gradients are much larger than independent estimates based on rock 21 strength. Dike shape can be explained by a combination of host rock inelastic deformation and 22 magma chilling at the dike’s tapering edges preventing its closure as magma pressure declines 23 during emplacement.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between formation overpressures and porosity, and <b>overpressures</b> and <b>stress</b> regime can differ significantly {{depending on the}} geological setting and mechanisms responsible for generating overpressures. Therefore, {{the most important aspect}} in modeling over-pressures becomes a thorough study of the mechanisms and geological settings of a particular basin. A new velocity–effective stress model capable of estimating other sources of overpressures besides under compaction from velocity data was proposed and used in this paper with the objective of determining and accounting for overpressures from multiple sources. Data obtained from wells with a variety of geological settings within the basin were used to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} major causes of overpressures in the Niger Delta basin. This study has revealed the presence of velocity hysteresis (i. e., unloading effects) in several wells in the basin. Most overpressures in the basin occurred within the depth range of 6000 ftss to 13000 ftss with top of hard overpressures (> 0. 60 psi/ft) having a regional mean of 12000 ftss. Similarly, results revealed a correlation of depth to high overpressures with zones of hydrocarbon maturation and smectite- to –illite transformation. The hard overpressures observed at depth in the Niger delta coincided with the time- temperature related fluid expansion mechanisms resulting principally from unloading. These findings therefore have shown that under compaction is not the sole overpressure generation mechanism in the basin as has been widely believed...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying the {{eruption}} {{potential of a}} restless volcano requires the ability to model parameters such as overpressure and calculate the host rock stress state as the system evolves. A critical challenge is developing a model-data fusion framework {{to take advantage of}} observational data and provide updates of the volcanic system through time. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) uses a Monte Carlo approach to assimilate volcanic monitoring data and update models of volcanic unrest, providing time-varying estimates of <b>overpressure</b> and <b>stress.</b> Although the EnKF has been proven effective to forecast volcanic deformation using synthetic InSAR and GPS data, until now, it has not been applied to assimilate data from an active volcanic system. In this investigation, the EnKF is used to provide a “hindcast” of the 2009 explosive eruption of Kerinci volcano, Indonesia. A two-sources analytical model is used to simulate the surface deformation of Kerinci volcano observed by InSAR time-series data and to predict the system evolution. A deep, deflating dike-like source reproduces the subsiding signal on the flanks of the volcano, and a shallow spherical McTigue source reproduces the central uplift. EnKF predicted parameters are used in finite element models to calculate the host-rock stress state prior to the 2009 eruption. Mohr-Coulomb failure models reveal that the host rock around the shallow magma reservoir is trending toward tensile failure prior to 2009, which may be the catalyst for the 2009 eruption. Our results illustrate that the EnKF shows significant promise for future applications to forecasting {{the eruption}} potential of restless volcanoes and hind-cast the triggering mechanisms of observed eruptions...|$|R

40|$|Accelerated {{testing in}} environments {{aggressive}} {{for the specific}} material have shown that fastener threads that are rolled after strengthening heat treatments have improved resistance to SCC initiation. For example, intergranular SCC was produced in one day when machined (cut) threads of high strength steel (ASTM A 193 B- 7 and A 354 Grade 8) were exposed to an aggressive aqueous environment containing 8 weight % boiling ammonium nitrate and stressed to about 40 % of the steel's yield strength (120 ksi, 827 MPa). In similar testing conditions, fasteners that had threads rolled before heat-treatment (quench and temper) had similar susceptibility to SCC. However, threads rolled after strengthening, exhibited no SCC {{after a week of}} exposure, even when stressed to 100 % of the B- 7 alloy yield strength. Similarly, intergranular SCC was produced in less than one day when machined (cut) threads of nickel-base alloys (X- 750 and aged 625) were exposed to an aggressive 750 F doped steam environment (containing 100 ppm of chloride, fluoride, sulfate, nitrate and a controlled hydrogen <b>overpressure)</b> and <b>stressed</b> to about 80 % of the alloy yield strength (117 ksi, 807 MPa). In similar testing conditions, threads rolled after strengthening exhibited no SCC after 50 days of exposure. This beneficial effect of the optimum thread rolling process (i. e., threads rolled after strengthening) is due to the retention of large residual compressive stresses in the thread roots (notches) which mitigate the applied notch tensile stresses resulting from joint design pre-loads. use of these material specific aggressive environments can provide an accelerated test to verify that threads were produced by the optimum thread rolling process. These tests could support fastener acceptance criteria or failure analysis of fasteners with unknown or uncertain manufacturing processes.

40|$|We present {{analytical}} derivations and 2 -D numerical simulations that quantify magnitudes of deviatoric <b>stress</b> and tectonic <b>overpressure</b> (i. e. {{difference between}} the pressure, or mean stress, and the lithostatic pressure) by relating them to lateral variations in the gravitational potential energy (GPE). These predictions of tectonic <b>overpressure</b> and deviatoric <b>stress</b> associated with GPE differences are independent of rock rheology (e. g. viscous or elastic) and rock strength. We consider a simple situation with lowlands and mountains (plateau). We use a numerical two-layer model consisting of a crust with higher Newtonian viscosity than that in the mantle, and also a three-layer model in which the two-layer lithosphere overlies a much less viscous asthenosphere. Our results (1) explain why estimates for the magnitude of stresses in Tibet, previously published by different authors, vary {{by a factor of}} two, (2) are applied to test the validity of the thin sheet approximation, (3) show that the magnitude of the depth-integrated tectonic overpressure is equal to the magnitude of the depth-integrated deviatoric stress if depth-integrated shear stresses on vertical and horizontal planes within the lithosphere are negligible (the thin sheet approximation) and (4) show that under thin sheet approximation tectonic overpressure is required to build and support continental plateaus, such as in Tibet or in the Andes, even if the topography and the crustal root are in isostatic equilibrium. Under thin sheet approximation, the magnitude of the depth-integrated tectonic overpressure is equal to the depth-integrated horizontal deviatoric stress, and both are approximately 3. 5 × 1012 N m− 1 for Tibet. The horizontal driving force per unit length related to lateral GPE variations around Tibet is composed of the sum of both tectonic <b>overpressure</b> and deviatoric <b>stress,</b> and is approximately 7 × 1012 N m− 1. This magnitude exceeds previously published estimates for the force per unit length required to fold the Indo-Australian Plate south of India, and hence the uplift of the Tibetan plateau could have folded the Indian Plate. We also discuss the mechanical conditions that are necessary to achieve isostasy, for which the lithostatic pressure is constant at a certain depth. The results show that tectonic overpressure can exist at a certain depth even if all deviatoric stresses are zero at this depth, because this tectonic overpressure is related to horizontal gradients of vertical shear stresses integrated across the entire depth of the lithosphere. The magnitude of the depth-integrated tectonic overpressure of 3. 5 × 1012 N m− 1 implies that the pressure estimated from observed mineral assemblages in crustal rocks is likely significantly different from the lithostatic pressure, and pressure recorded by crustal rocks is not directly related to depth. In case of significant weakening of the entire lithosphere by any mechanism our analytical and numerical studies provide a simple estimation of tectonic overpressure via variations in GP...|$|R

This contribution reports the application to a natural case (the Bighorn Basin) of recent methodological advance to access fluid (over) pressure level prevailing in strata during sub-seismic fracture development. The fluid pressure evolution in the Mississippian- Permian MadisonePhosphoria limestone reservoir is tentatively reconstructed from the early Sevier Layer Parallel Shortening to the Laramide folding in two basement-cored folds: the Sheep Mountain Anticline and the Rattlesnake Mountain Anticline.

40|$|International audienceMany natural {{examples}} of complex joint and vein networks in layered sedimentary rocks are hydro-fractures that form {{by a combination}} of pore fluid <b>overpressure</b> and tectonic <b>stresses.</b> In this paper, a two-dimensional hybrid hydro-mechanical formulation is proposed to model the dynamic development of natural hydrofractures. The numerical scheme combines a Discrete Element Model (DEM) framework that represents a porous solid medium with a supplementary Darcy based pore-pressure diffusion as continuum description for the fluid. This combination yields a porosity controlled coupling between an evolving fracture network and the associated hydraulic field. The model is tested on some basic cases of hydro-driven fracturing commonly found in nature i. e., fracturing due to local fluid overpressure in rocks subjected to hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic tectonic loadings. In our models we find that seepage forces created by hydraulic pressure gradients together with poroelastic feedback upon discrete fracturing {{play a significant role in}} subsurface rock deformation. These forces manipulate the growth and geometry of hydrofractures in addition to tectonic stresses and the mechanical properties of the porous rocks. Our results show characteristic failure patterns that reflect different tectonic and lithological conditions and are qualitatively consistent with existing analogue and numerical studies as well as field observations. The applied scheme is numerically efficient, can be applied at various scales and is computational cost effective with the least involvement of sophisticated mathematical computation of hydrodynamic flow between the solid grains...|$|R

40|$|Fluid {{injection}} in deep geological formations usually induces microseismicity. In particular, industrial-scale {{injection of}} CO 2 may induce {{a large number}} of microseismic events. Since CO 2 is likely to reach the storage formation at a lower temperature than that corresponding to the geothermal gradient, both overpressure and cooling decrease the effective stresses and may induce microseismicity. Here, we investigate the effect of the stress regime on the effective stress evolution and fracture stability when injecting cold CO 2 through a horizontal well in a deep saline formation. Simulation results show that when only overpressure occurs, the vertical total stress remains practically constant, but the horizontal total stresses increase proportionally to <b>overpressure.</b> These hydro-mechanical <b>stress</b> changes result in a slight improvement in fracture stability in normal faulting stress regimes because the decrease in deviatoric stress offsets the decrease in effective <b>stresses</b> produced by <b>overpressure.</b> However, fracture stability significantly decreases in reverse faulting stress regimes because the size of the Mohr circle increases in addition to being displaced towards failure conditions. Fracture stability also decreases in strike slip stress regimes because the Mohr circle maintains its size and is shifted towards the yield surface a magnitude equal to overpressure minus the increase in the horizontal total stresses. Additionally, cooling induces a thermal stress reduction in all directions, but larger in the out-of-plane direction. This stress anisotropy causes, apart from a displacement of the Mohr circle towards the yield surface, an increase {{in the size of the}} Mohr circle. These two effects decrease fracture stability, resulting in the strike slip being the least stable stress regime when cooling occurs, followed by the reverse faulting and the normal faulting stress regimes. Thus, characterizing the stress state is crucial to determine the maximum sustainable injection pressure and maximum temperature drop to safely inject CO 2. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons LtdV.

40|$|It has {{generally}} been assumed that porosity reduction during mechanical compaction of a sediment {{is controlled by the}} increase in vertical effective stress. But the theory of mechanical compaction shows that it is the mean effective stress which controls porosity reduction. According to published data, horizontal <b>stresses</b> increase with <b>overpressure,</b> as well as with depth, so mean stress and vertical stress profiles are poorly correlated in overpressured sections. In this study, a new methodology was developed whereby mudrock pore pressures were estimated principally by comparison of void ratios calculated from wireline log response with hydrostatic mean effective stress (the mean effective stress assuming the pore pressure is hydrostatic). These pressure estimates in the low permeability units were compared to the direct measurements in the aquifer units and an interpretation is made as to the origin of the excess pressure. The results of analysis of seven wells from SE Asia are presented including one study where seismic velocity analysis and basin modelling were performed to assess the pore pressure. The main conclusions of the study are: The proposed new methodology for estimating shale pore pressure from void ratio and mean effective stress analysis appears to be more consistent with the data and represents an improvement on previous methodologies using porosity and vertical effective stress or depth. Analysis of the mudrocks in this study indicates that the shales often appear to have significantly higher pressures than the adjacent aquifer units. The results of using mean (as opposed to vertical) effective stress analysis indicates that the pressure profiles in the wells studied, the profiles disequilibrium compaction can account for all or nearly all of the encountered overpressures. Evidence has been found for significant overpressure generated by fluid expansion in one of the seven wells studied. « Further work to refine the Breckels and Van Eekelen (1982) relationship between <b>overpressure</b> and horizontal <b>stress</b> is proposed to improve the accuracy of the methodology used in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{volcanic}} activity that built up the Monte dei Porri stratocone (Salina Island) was reconstructed using new stratigraphic data, which allowed seven eruption units to be distinguished. Alternating Strombolian/Vulcanian to sub-Plinian/Plinian explosive and effusive activity emplaced fall and pyroclastic density current deposits and lava flows {{that formed the}} volcanic cone. The minimum erupted bulk volumes were assessed at 100 × 106 m 3 each for EU 1, EU 2, EU 3 and EU 6, while that of EU 4 is ca. 200 × 106 m 3. Rough estimation of EU 7 volume yields values around 150 × 106 m 3. The calculation of volume was not possible for the EU 5 deposits. The magmas that fed the different eruption units of the Monte dei Porri succession range in composition from basalt to andesite, {{with the exception of}} dacites erupted in the initial phase of activity. SEM image analyses on coarse ash from the different pyroclastic units suggest that hydromagmatic fragmentation cannot be the cause of the large variations in explosivity observed throughout the stratigraphic succession. Based on the lithic component of pyroclastic deposits and xenolith contents of lava flows, the plumbing system that fed the different eruption units of Monte dei Porri was split into a deep magma storage level (15 – 20 km) and shallower magma batches (3 – 5 km). Our calculations indicate that the volumes of erupted material can account for magmatic triggering (injection of new magma) of eruptive units from the shallower feeding system, but they are not sufficient for suggesting magmatic initiation of the eruption units from the deeper feeding system. It is therefore assumed that the eruptions from the deep magma reservoir necessitate a favourable lithostatic stress, likely calling for a reduction of the local tectonic forces. A qualitative model explaining the eruptive style transitions among and within the different eruption units is presented, taking into account the relation between magmatic <b>overpressure</b> and lithostatic <b>stress...</b>|$|R
40|$|New volcanological studies allow {{reconstruction}} of the eruption dynamics of the Pomici di Mercato eruption (ca 8, 900 cal. yr B. P.) of Somma-Vesuvius. Three main Eruptive Phases are distinguished based on two distinct erosion surfaces that interrupt stratigraphic continuity of the deposits, indicating that time breaks occurred during the eruption. Absence of reworked volcaniclastic deposits {{on top of the}} erosion surfaces suggests that quiescent periods between eruptive phases were short perhaps lasting only days to weeks. Each of the Eruptive Phases was characterised by deposition of alternating fall and pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits. The fallout deposits blanketed a wide area toward the east, while the more restricted PDC deposits inundated the volcano slopes. Eruptive dynamics were driven by brittle magmatic fragmentation of a phonolitic magma, which, because of its mechanical fragility, produced a significant amount of fine ash. External water did not significantly contribute either to fragmentation dynamics or to mechanical energy release during the eruption. Column heights were between 18 and 22 km, corresponding to mass discharge rates between 1. 4 and 6 x 10 (7) kg s(- 1). The estimated on land volume of fall deposits ranges from a minimum of 2. 3 km(3) to a maximum of 7. 4 km(3). Calculation of physical parameters of the dilute pyroclastic density currents indicates speeds of a few tens of m s(- 1) and densities of a few kg m(- 3) (average of the lowermost 10 m of the currents), resulting in dynamic pressures lower than 3 kPa. These data suggest that the potential impact of pyroclastic density currents of the Pomici di Mercato eruption was smaller than those of other Plinian and sub-Plinian eruptions of Somma-Vesuvius, especially those of 1631 AD and 472 AD (4 - 14 kPa), which represent reference values for the Vesuvian emergency plan. The pulsating and long-lasting behaviour of the Pomici di Mercato eruption is unique in the history of large explosive eruptions of Somma-Vesuvius. We suggest an eruptive scheme in which discrete magma batches rose from the magma chamber through a network of fractures. The injection and rise of the different magma batches was controlled by the interplay between magma chamber <b>overpressure</b> and local <b>stress.</b> The intermittent discharge of magma during a large explosive eruption is unusual for Somma-Vesuvius, as well as for other volcanoes worldwide, and yields new insights for improving our knowledge of the dynamics of explosive eruptions...|$|R
