40|$|Quite often {{grounds in}} urban areas are {{subjected}} to contamination due to leaks from underground storage tanks of gas stations and of heating oil, {{as well as from}} spills of trucks and tankers carrying crude <b>oil,</b> heating <b>oil</b> <b>or</b> <b>gasoline.</b> Moreover the ever growing urban population pushes city boundaries to areas where industries had operated and the ground is heavily contaminated by petroleum and/or its derivatives. These contaminants reduce the load carrying capacity of the soil, thus compromising the stability of structures. A laboratory investigation has been carried out to determine the undrained shear strength of completely saturated contaminated clay. The undrained shear strength, Su, is the parameter required in the total stress analysis (TSA) of foundations emphasis is placed on the experimental determination of the undrained total stress analyses (short term analysis) parameters. Specifically, the effect of contaminants on the undrained shear strength Su, must be determined in order to verify the following two requirements: 1. A foundation must not collapse or become unstable under any conceivable loading. 2. Settlement of the structure must be within tolerable serviceability limits. Indeed experimental tests, as well as a statistical model developed in this study confirm that contaminants deteriorate the undrained shear strength of the soil and have significant effects on the elastic moduli. Consequently the immediate bearing capacity of the soil is affected and the integrity or serviceability of the foundation may be jeopardized. A statistical random field model, based on the undrained shear strengths obtained in the laboratory, was used to model the contaminated soil. A method was developed to predict the statistical properties of the excursion set of the Gaussian random field above high thresholds. A new heavy tailed random field called the Student Random Field was also introduced, for which the distribution of the size of one cluster of its excursion set was derived. The tail distribution of its supremum was also approximated. Finally, as previously mentioned, this random field theory is applied to real data obtained from a series of triaxial tests with 2, 4 and 6...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} convenience yields in {{the petroleum}} market. The implied convenience yield for petroleum and petroleum products {{is found to}} be driven by a non-stationary and mean reverting long memory process. The theoretical implication of this finding is established. It is suggested that this might be attributed {{to the fact that the}} market is expecting mean reversion in the spot prices. It is demonstrated that crude oil and unleaded gasoline are driven by similar mean reversion processes whereas heating oil exhibits a more seasonal pattern. This suggests that the market expects a more seasonal fluctuation in heating oil than crude <b>oil</b> <b>or</b> unleaded <b>gasoline</b> prices. Furthermore, the volatility process and its relation with the mean process has been found to be in accordance with the prediction of the theory of storage, i. e. positive convenience yields tend to be more volatile. In addition, it is argued that, consistent with implications of the theory of storage, higher convenience yields tend to cause higher volatility. However, the asymmetric nature of this causality implies that positive convenience yields are more likely to cause higher volatility than negative. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe sample {{preparation}} {{was carried out}} by emulsion-based sampling, using about 200 mg of samples (crude <b>oil,</b> diesel <b>or</b> <b>gasoline),</b> 125 μL of hexane (only for crude oil) and 7. 5 mL of Triton X- 100 (20 % vv− 1). The mixture was stirred manually for few seconds, submitted to ultrasound bath for 30 min, and diluted to 25 mL with high-purity water. The combination of NbC as permanent modifier to avoid the formation of thermally stable SiC and 20 μg of Pd as co-injected chemical modifier to avoid losses of volatile silicon was mandatory for the success of the proposed method. In these conditions, the sensitivity of silicon was increased around six times and the relative standard deviation was decreased around 10 times. After heating program optimization, the pyrolysis and atomization temperatures were 1300 °C and 2600 °C, respectively. The limit of detection, limit of quantification and characteristic mass were, respectively, 2. 6 μgL− 1, 8. 6 μgL− 1 and 141 pg. The relative standard deviation was lower than 1 % for 100 μgL− 1 of Si. The accuracy was checked by the analysis of oil-based Si standards and the found values are in accordance with the reference values at 95 % confidence level.
