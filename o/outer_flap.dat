25|$|This tent is {{most often}} seen in a yellow/blue-grey stripe, but were also {{available}} in red/white, orange/blue, orange/white, and green/white. The tent's frame mounts to brackets {{on the roof and}} bumpers. The front bumper mount is a flat plate of steel bent into an open S or Z shape. Tent poles are steel, either black or grey, around 2cm in diameter, and there are fourteen sections that must be assembled to create a rectangular, peaked awning with support rods leading to the bumpers. Once the awning has been set up, curtains can be attached to the three outer sides (with Tenax lift-the-dot fasteners) to achieve a weatherproof - though windowless and floorless - portable shelter. Leather straps secure the sidewalls to the support poles, and stakes hold the bottom edges down as with the small tent. An additional set of poles and stakes were available to permit the <b>outer</b> <b>flap</b> to be extended horizontally as a second awning, resulting in a large shaded space {{on the side of the}} bus.|$|E
500|$|The LT vz. 34 was {{assembled}} from {{a framework}} of steel [...] "angle iron" [...] beams, to which armor plates were riveted. A [...] firewall separated the engine compartment from the crew. A door allowed access to the engine from the crew compartment. It also had ventilation openings that could be closed. The driver sat {{on the right side}} using a [...] observation port protected by two flaps. The inner flap had an episcope with a 25° field of view. It was connected to the armored <b>outer</b> <b>flap</b> so that opening one closed the other. The <b>outer</b> <b>flap</b> had a [...] slit.

The radio operator sat on the left and had his own [...] vision port with [...] of bulletproof glass and an armored shutter. His radios were mounted on the left wall of the hull. The hull machine gun was between the driver and radio operator in a ball mount with 30° of traverse. It could elevate 25° and depress 10°. Most of the machine gun's barrel protruded from the mount and was protected by an armored trough. The mount had a spotting telescope or open sights could be used if the plug {{at the top of the}} ball mount was removed.

50|$|The 55° {{swept wing}} {{had a slight}} {{negative}} camber, and was fitted {{with a pair of}} aerodynamic fences to prevent the spanwise flow of air away from the wing roots. The leading edge of the wing incorporated a pair of PVD leading edge slats. Flaps and ailerons were mounted on the trailing edge of the wing. The <b>outer</b> <b>flaps</b> were aligned with the trailing edge forward sweep and the inner flaps were perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was predominantly made from aluminium, with some stainless steel {{used for the}} wing ribs, controls and fittings. The two-place side-by-side cockpit was made from fibreglass. Its four-piece 60.75 ft span high aspect ratio wing employed a modified Wortmann FX-61-163/35SF airfoil. The Fowler flaps occupied the entire trailing edge of the wing and accounted for 35% of the wing chord. In cruise the flaps were retracted, reducing the wing area. While climbing, the flaps were extended, producing a high lift coefficient of 2.2. For glidepath control when landing the flaps deployed to 80° to create aerodynamic drag. The <b>outer</b> <b>flaps</b> acted as slotted ailerons for roll control.|$|R
25|$|The Sperrin {{employed}} a traditional straight wing, although the wing's {{fixed leading edge}} was slightly swept and featured curved fillets at the junction with the engine nacelles. The trailing edge had simple flaps inboard of the nacelles and large ailerons outboard; the <b>outer</b> <b>flaps</b> were to incorporate air brakes, but this was replaced with split-brakes prior to the first flight. Both the flaps and air brakes were primarily operated hydraulically, an independent system for emergency actuation was also present. Up to 6,170 imperial gallons of fuel could be housed {{in a total of}} 22 fuel tanks, 14 of these being contained within the wings and a further 8 within the fuselage; these tanks were pressurized to prevent collapse during fast dives and other manoeuvres. The wing was fixed to the fuselage at a mid-wing position, located between the bomb bay and fuselage fuel tanks.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe coupled {{numerical}} simulation of flow field, solid temperature field, species concentration field and gas radiation transfer/ energy field based on statistical narrow-band correlated-k (SNBCK) model, is employed to accurately predict aerothermodynamic characteristic of aircraft exhaust system. A series of methods to increase computational efficiency and descend computational resources {{make it possible}} to finish the calculation in PC. The parameters of narrow-band model are evaluated by HITEMP line-by-line database. Three examples have proved the accuracy of using these methods to solve flow heat transfer coupled problem and radiation transfer/energy equation, which are the calculation of temperature distribution of water-cooling nozzle in rocket engine, the calculation of carbon dioxide absorptivity at 4. 3 micron band, and the gas radiation heat transfer evaluation of the cylindrical furnace. Finally, the inner flaps temperature distribution of ejecting nozzle with floating <b>outer</b> <b>flaps</b> is computed, under high-altitude, high-speed and afterburning conditions. Two completely different air-inlet schemes of ejecting channel almost achieve the same effect in cooling inner flaps...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of {{aircraft}} development numerical approaches are gaining more and more importance. Not only steady flight conditions need to be modelled but also dynamic derivatives and {{last but not least}} realistic flight maneuvers. In particular in the case of delta-wing aircrafts a small change in the flight conditions can strongly influence the vortex dominated flow field about the wings and thus result in large changes of the aerodynamic loads. Numerical tools that are developed for predicting such behaviours need to be validated by experimental data. In order to obtain a data base for validation ground-based simulations of complex maneuvers of a model of the X- 31 aircraft have been performed in the low-speed wind tunnel NWB of the German-Dutch Wind Tunnels DNW. In the wind tunnel tests a newly installed novel test rig with six degree of freedoms (DOF) was used for the first time for moving the model. Furthermore, the model was equipped with eight remotely controlled moving flaps. In this manner realistic flight maneuvers could be reproduced in a ground-based facility. Both, the specific technical equipment of the model and the novel six DOF test rig will be reviewed. Thereafter, experimental results obtained will be discussed and compared with numerical results. The X- 31 is a single-engine, single-place cockpit, delta-wing aircraft. For control the aircraft had a small, forward-mounted canard; single vertical tail with conventional rudder, wing leading flaps and trailing-edge flaps (elevons). A fully equipped wind tunnel model of the X- 31, the so-called X- 31 remote-control model, was developed and built to a scale of about 1 / 7. 25 at the German Aerospace Center DLR (cf. Fig. 1). The model is made from steel and carbon fiber reinforced plastic. Its control surfaces can be moved via a remote control system. The main part of the X- 31 model is a wing-fuselage section including eight servo motors for changing the angles of canard, leading-edge inner and <b>outer</b> <b>flaps,</b> trailing-edge flaps and rudder. Dynamic surface pressures are measured by miniature piezo-resistive pressure sensors located at 60...|$|R
50|$|Existing {{photographs}} of the engine bay of the final pre-production version of this system clearly show the liquid coolant from both separators was piped along the bottom {{left side of the}} engine compartment and into the right wing. The header tanks were located in the outer wing panels ahead of the main spar and immediately outboard of the main landing gear bays. The tanks extended over the same portion of the outer panel's span as the <b>outer</b> <b>flaps.</b> Coolant from the right wing header tank was pumped by a separate, electrical pump to the left wing header tank. Along the way from the right to left wing, the coolant passed through a conventional radiator mounted {{on the bottom of the}} fuselage. That radiator was retractable and intended for use only during ground-running or low-speed flight. Nevertheless, coolant passed through it whenever the engine was running and regardless of whether it was extended or retracted. In the retracted position, the radiator offered little cooling, but some heat was exchanged into the aft fuselage. Finally, a return tube connected the left wing's header tank to that on the right. This allowed the coolant to equalize between the two header tanks and circulate through the retractable radiator. The engine drew coolant directly from both header tanks through two separate pipes that ran through the main landing gear bays, up the firewall at the back of the engine compartment, and into the usual coolant intakes located at the top rear of the engine.|$|R

50|$|Concern {{was also}} raised over the {{possibility}} of loss of gas through the valves, which were of an innovative design by Michael Rope. Airship valves are intended primarily to vent gas automatically if pressure in the bag rises {{to the point that}} the bag might rupture; they are also used to adjust lift for handling. Some concern was expressed over the valves opening because of either the airship rolling heavily or localised low pressure caused by the <b>outer</b> cover <b>flapping,</b> but after an examination of their operation F. W. McWade, the Air Inspectorate Department inspector at Cardington, concluded that their operation was satisfactory and they were not likely to have been the cause of any significant loss of gas.|$|R
500|$|In 1944, the Sukhoi design bureau (OKB) began {{designing}} a twin-engined fighter powered by two Lyulka TR-1 turbojets, known internally as the Samolyet or Izdeliye (item or product) K. The ultimate design was very probably {{influenced by a}} captured Messerschmitt Me 262, but the Su-9 was not {{a copy of the}} German aircraft. The Su-9 had an oval cross-section, all-metal stressed skin monocoque fuselage that housed a single cockpit. The pilot was protected by armor plates to his front, an armored seat back and a bulletproof windscreen for the bubble canopy. He was provided with an ejection seat, copied from that used in the Heinkel He 162 [...] The aircraft carried a total of [...] of fuel in two bladder tanks, one each ahead and behind the pilot. The low-mounted, straight wing had a single-spar and a slight dihedral of 4°20'. The <b>outer</b> <b>flaps</b> were split and could act as air brakes. The Su-9 was the first Soviet aircraft to use hydraulic powered controls. A Soviet copy of the Junkers Jumo 004B turbojet, known as the RD-10, was hung under each wing in a streamlined nacelle. The aircraft had a tricycle undercarriage that retracted into the fuselage. The Su-9 was designed with a very high wing loading which increased the aircraft's speed and reduced its dimensions. This consequently increased the take-off and landing speeds so it was equipped with a provision for two JATO bottles (11.27kN (530lbf) thrust for 8 seconds) mounted {{on the sides of the}} fuselage. These reduced the take-off distance by nearly 50 percent and a braking parachute was fitted to reduce the landing distance.|$|R

40|$|A flight {{dynamics}} evaluation {{was performed in}} order to analyse {{the ability to use}} the <b>outer</b> <b>flap</b> for roll control as well. Based on the A 350 flap system architecture, where the <b>outer</b> <b>flap</b> can be deployed independently from the inner flap by using an active differential gear box, two different concepts were identified as potentially benefitial for the desired purpose. In both concepts the inner ailerons were removed in order to save weight and system complexity and the <b>outer</b> <b>flap</b> performs (all speed) roll control together with the outer (low speed) aileron. Concept 1 comprises the usual flap geometry and the outer aileron, whereas concept 2 comprises an <b>outer</b> <b>flap,</b> which is extended in spanwise direction by the length of the inner aileron. The flight dynamic evaluation revealed that {{for the use of the}} outer flaps for regular roll control flap dynamics are necessary of at least 16 °/s flap deflection rate in order to fulfill requirements from certification specification CS- 25 and handling quality criteria. A system analysis showed that the existing active differential gear box from A 350 is unfortunately only able to deflect the flap with a maximum rate of 0. 43 °/s, or with slight modifications of the existing active differential gear box a maximum deflection rate of 1. 4 °/s could be feasible. These values showed to be insufficient for regular roll control. Nevertheless, in case of dual loss of hydraulic power the only available roll control could be performed by one remaining pair of ailerons, which are driven by an electrical back-up hydraulic actuator at the A 350. In order to still enable roll control, if these electrical back-up hydraulic actuators fail additionally, it was analysed whether the <b>outer</b> <b>flap</b> could be used as emergency roll control with the aforementioned feasible flap dynamics. The results showed that the handling qualities with this flap system ensuring roll control are barely controllable. However, it appears feasible to reach degraded but acceptable handling qualities if the system dynamics could be slightly increased...|$|E
40|$|Finite element, three {{dimensional}} relaxation {{methods are}} {{used to calculate the}} development of vortex wakes behind aircraft for a considerable downstream distance. The inclusion of a self-induction term in the solution, dependent upon local curvature and vortex core radius, permits calculation of finite lifetimes for systems for which infinite life would be predicted two dimensionally. The associated computer program is described together with single-pair, twin-pair, and multiple-pair studies carried out using it. It is found, in single-pair studies, that there is a lower limit to the wavelengths at which the Crow-type of instability can occur. Below this limit, self-induction effects cause the plane of the disturbance waves to rotate counter to the vortex direction. Self induction in two dimensionally generated twin spiral waves causes an increase in axial length which becomes more marked with decreasing initial wavelength. The time taken for vortex convergence toward the center plane is correspondingly increased. The limited parametric twin-pair study performed suggests that time-to-converge increases with increasing flap span. Limited studies of Boeing 747 configurations show correct qualitative response to removal of the <b>outer</b> <b>flap</b> and to gear deployment, as compared with wind tunnel and flight test experience...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft {{wings are}} usually {{optimized}} {{for a specific}} mission design point. However, since they operate {{in a wide variety}} of flight conditions, some of these have conflicting impacts on aircraft design process, as a single configuration may be efficient in one instance but perform poorly in others. A shape-shifting surface, or usually referred as 'morphing', potentially enables transport aircraft to reach maximum performance in any flight conditions. Within the framework of the Joint Technology Initiative Clean Sky (JTI-CS) project, and during the first phase of the Green Regional Aircraft Integrated Technological Demonstration (GRA-ITD), the authors focused on the design and technological demonstration of an innovative bi-modal morphing <b>outer</b> wing <b>flap</b> to be installed on the next generation open rotor green regional aircraft. A novel active rib layout was designed to enable the articulation of the entire flap structure by means of multi-box arrangement. In order to prove structural load-carrying capabilities with the reference to a relevant environment, the full-scale morphing flap was properly analyzed by means of detailed finite element model analysis. To the authors' knowledge, there is no morphing concept in literature based on a similar architecture based on distributed servo-mechanical actuators. Hence, a rational review of the potential problems associated with actuators off-design conditions has been conducted to investigate the maturity of the concept and safety issues concerning the flap ground static test. In addition, useful insights have been provided to effectively detect potential failure conditions in service...|$|R
40|$|Resume : In {{work package}} 2. 3. 1 "LNC Application Studies for 130 -seat Regional A/C" of the Clean Sky GRA LNC project, Fraunhofer proposes a {{high-lift}} wing having {{a leading edge}} depressed downwards (a. k. a. droop nose) for reducing noise radiated from the leading edge. As opposed to the precedent wing models, the current model has a droop nose extended almost over the entire wing from 18 % to 98 % span. Good aerodynamic performance (cl max = 2. 6 at 15 degree angle of attack) of this model has been estimated in CFD analysis conducted in a full-scale condition. Due to the Reynolds number effect, CFD analysis in a 1 : 6 -scaled condition has shown smaller cl max = 2. 0, smaller angle of attack and less abrupt stall behavior. The current study aimed {{to confirm that the}} same performance expected in the scaled condition is actually observed in a wind tunnel. For this purpose, a 1 : 6 -scaled half wing model was first designed and manufactured {{so that it can be}} set in three different configurations: (1) clean wing,(2) high-lift baseline having deployed TE flaps but no droop nose leading edge and (3) full high-lift with droop nose. WT tests with this model were performed in an automotive WT facility in Weissach, Germany. Flow speed was set at 40 m/s. Aerodynamic forces and moments were measured by a six-component balance at various angles of attack ranging from - 6 to 20 degrees with 2 degree step. In these tests, the model was placed upright on a platform covering a balancerig raised above the WT floor in order not to disturb the flow. In the tests with a transition tripping strip attached on the suction side near the LE, cl max of 1. 0 at AoA of 10 degree for the clean wing, cl max of 1. 7 at AoA of 8 degree for the high-lift baseline and cl max of 1. 9 at 12 degree angle of attack for the droop-nose configuration. All the configurations have less abruptstall behavior as expected. These results are in good agreement with those of the CFD analysis. In the test without the transition tripping strip, very similar results were observed in the clean wing and high-lift baseline configurations. In the droop nose configuration, however, a large cl max of 2. 5 at a very large stall angle of 20 degree was observed during the WT test. This results hould be more investigated. In addition to aerodynamic examination, aeroacoustic noise sources were also examined with an acoustic beamforming system during the WT tests. No noise sources would be detected for the clean wing. For both high-lift configurations, these were found at few points on the leading edge, at the <b>outer</b> <b>flap</b> and at one of the stay supporting the inner flap. No qualitative difference insource distribution could be found between these two configurations...|$|E

The driving motivation for the investigation on such a technology was found in the opportunity to replace a conventional double slotted flap with a single slotted camber-morphing flap assuring similar high lift performances -in terms of maximum attainable lift coefficient and stall angle- while lowering emitted noise and system complexity. Studies and tests were limited to a portion of the flap element obtained by slicing the actual flap geometry with two cutting planes distant 0. 8 meters along the wing span. Further activities were then addressed in order to increase the TRL of the validated architecture within the second phase of the CS-GRA. Relying upon the already assessed concept, an innovative and more advanced flap device was designed in order to enable two different morphing modes on the basis of the A/C flight condition / flap setting: Mode 1, Overall camber morphing to enhance high-lift performances during take-off and landing (flap deployed); Mode 2, Tab-like morphing mode. Upwards and downwards deflection of the flap tip during cruise (flap stowed) for load control at high speed. A true-scale segment of the <b>outer</b> wing <b>flap</b> (4 meters span with a mean chord of 0. 9 meters) was selected as investigation domain for the new architecture in order to duly face the challenges posed by real wing installation. Advanced and innovative solutions for the adaptive structure, actuation and control systems were duly analyzed and experimentally validated thus proving the overall device compliance with industrial standards and applicable airworthiness requirements...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the writers {{deal with the}} life history and habits of three species of the genus Cypselurus; C. heterurus doderleini, C. opisthopus hiraii and C. starksi. One of these, C. opisthopus hiraii, {{constitutes}} the most part of the flying-fish catch and is economically important on the Amakusa Islands in Kyushu. These adult fishes appear in this region from early May to late September for spawning, and the fishing is {{carried out in the}} coastal waters with the gill net from May to July. In external appearance the differences of these species are slight, although they are distinguishable from the vertebral count : 47 - 49 (including urostyle) in C. heterurus doderleini, 45 - 46 in C. opisthopus hiraii and 43 - 44 in C. starksi. Most of the fish for this study were taken with the gill net, and the young, juvenile and larval forms were captured mainly by a dip net with the aid of flood light at night. We have studied on various items, throughout the fishing season, as the vertical distribution, aggregation density and movement of the flying fish during the night-time. In every species the distribution is limited to the upper surface layer, its lower limit seldom exceeding 3 meters in depth. For example the vertical distribution and movement of C. opisthopus hiraii are given in Fig. 5. It should be noted that this species occurred in great abundance between the water surface and 50 centimeter layer and showed a more or less continuous vertical distribution. The upward movement commenced just after sun-set and the density became maximum from 9. 00 to 11. 00 p. m., and by 1. 00 a. m. it begun to descend and was quite decreased before sunrise. The majority of the captured fish were impelled with the direct current toward the gill nets. The catched samples showed a predominance of males. The spawning of C. heterurus dOderleini and C. opisthopus hiraii takes place in May, June and July and that of C. starksi is later than the others. The number of eggs carried from an adult female of C. heterurus doderleini varied from about 8, 500 to 10, 000, of C. opisthopus hiraii from about 4, 000 to 7, 500 and of C. starksi from about 4, 000 to 8, 000. The eggs are spherical with about 50 long tendrils distributed over the whole surface. The oil globule is absent. The difference of the eggs of these three species is slight in external appearance, but the size is different on average : 1. 86 mm in diameters in C. heterurus doderleini, 1. 66 mm in C. starksi and 1. 47 mm in C. opisthopus hiraii. The eggs were stripped and inseminated easily with the milt from the male and the embryonic development was observed. The incubation of C. heterurus doderleini and C. opisthopus hiraii required about 2 weeks at 20 °- 22 ℃ water temperature, and of C. starksi about 5 - 7 days at 26 °- 28 ℃. The hatch-out took place several hours after the sun-set and at once they can swim under their own power close to the water surface. In the aquarium the hatched larvae were reared, with the nauplii of brine shrimp. Those of various developmental stages were captured from the sea. They were described and figured (Fig. 13, 14, 15). In about 3 days the larvae showed a tendency to attach to the seaweeds (Fig. 9), in about one month they occassionally made short, sporadic flights and surface skips. In the developmental stages of these species, there are differences in the shape of body, and also in the distribution of pigment over the body and fins. In the juvenile stages, C. heterurus doderleini has a pair of yellow barbels with the <b>outer</b> black <b>flap,</b> and C. opisthopus hiraii has a black single barbel, but C. starksi has not a barbel at all on the lower jaw (Fig. 17, 20). The larva, juvenile and half-grown fish are found in this region from early June to early October. These young have a tendency to leave this region to migrate towards the southern waters in autumn. According to the plotting frequency distribution of the various body sizes, their growth is very rapid and they require one year to reach their sexual maturity and the commercial size (Fig. 22). The great fluctuation of commercial catch seems to be due to the occasional production of one year 2 ̆ 7 s class composing most of the catch. 1) 天草西海岸においてトビウオ類の漁業生物学的調査を行い, トビウオ類 13 種を認めたが, 漁業の対象となつているものはハマトビウオ属のホソトビ・アリアケトビウオ・ツクシトビウオで, そのうちホソトビが大部分を占めるが, これら 3 種の生態・生活史を明らかにした. 2) これら 3 種のうちツクシトビウオが最も大形で, ホソトビ・アリアケトビウオと小形になるが, これらは外観Lは極めて類似する. しかし脊椎骨(ツクシトビウオ: 47 ～ 49, ホソトビ: 45 ～ 46, アリァケトビウオ: 43 ～ 44) その他で区別出来る. 3) 天草西海岸には, ホソトビ。ツクシトビウオは 5 月上旬より 8 月上旬, アリアケトビウオは 6 月上旬より 9 月下旬に産卵のため来游するが, 雌魚に比して雄魚が多く, 雌魚の体長は雄魚に比してやや大きい. 4) 浮刺網による漁獲試験の結果では, 夜間における活動は日没とともに活発となり, 午後 9 時から 11 時の間に最も盛んで, これより日の出まで漸次減少する. 又游泳方向と潮流との関係は, 潮流の方向から網にささるものが多い. 5) 産卵の盛期は, ホソトビ・ツクシトビウオが 5 ～ 7 月, アリアケトビウオは 7 ～ 8 月で, 人工受精による卵発生の観察及び孵化仔魚の飼育を行つた. 孵化に要する時間は, ホソトビ・ツクシトビウオが約 2 週間(水温 20 ～ 22 ℃), アリアケトビウオが 5 ～ 7 日(水温 26 ～ 28 ℃) であつた. 6) 卵は何れも沈性纏絡卵で球形をなし, 約 50 本の長い纏絡糸を有する. 卵径はツクシトビウオが平均 1. 86 mmで最も大きく, アリアクートビウオが 1. 66 mm, ホソトビが 1. 47 mmで最も小さい. 産卵は 1 回で, 産卵数はツクシトビウオが平均 9, 580, ホソトビが 5, 890, アリアケトビウオは 5, 300 である. 7) 仔稚魚には体色・斑紋等に 3 種の差が認められ,ツクシトビウオには下顎に 1 対の, ホソトビには 1 個のひげを生ずるが, アリアケトビウオにはひげを生じない. 何れも群をなし, 流れ藻及び集魚灯下に集まる習性が見られ, 約 1 ヶ月で空中に飛びあがる習性を生ずる. 8) 3 種ともその成長は速やかで, 九州西岸の水温の下降とともにその年の発生群は適温を追つて南下し, 満 1 年で成魚となり, 翌年産卵のため来遊する. 又漁獲の対象が満 1 年魚で, 前年の発生及び成長量が次年の来遊量に直接影響して, 漁獲に大きい変動を与えると思われる...|$|R

40|$|We are {{continuing}} our investigations on Hokkaido. Up {{to the present}} date, we have investigated 31, 691 school children and 309 ambulatory patients with ringworm as indicated {{at the beginning of}} this report. - During our investigations we have obtained 157 cultures of a new species, which is found all over Hokkaido except in the eastern region. As an interesting result of our research, we have an entirely new set of figures on house cats which indicates the presence of a new epidemic. Parallel to our investigation on school children, we conducted an investigation in regards to their pets. As a result, and by the statements of the school children it has been revealled that the figures of "Cats with localized alopecia' comes to 106 / 321. We have discovered, as a fact, that on culture beds the material obtained, from a large number of investigated cats, 'contains the same fungi species. The deseased localities of cats are mainly on the facial parts especially the ear <b>flaps,</b> <b>outer</b> top sides of the eyes lids, and from the forhead to the parietal part. Besides the above, deseased areas may be seen on the outer sides of the forlegs, knees and on the back parts. On the mottled and deseased spots where the bristles have become detatched, a mixture of down like fur and bran-like squarma may be observed and at times squamous surface is bared. From these parts, as in the cases of deseased persons, it is possible to pluck deseased hairs with spore-sheaths. Thus we have discovered evidence of an epidemic among cats by this fungi, and also have been able to inoculate cats in our laboratory. It is notable that cats are more readily inoculated than any other animals. Moreover, mycologically it has all the qualifications of microsporun d'organe animale. In other words, we have noted that in both children (Adults are also susceptible; note additional report) and cats a close similarity in regards to the findings, also we have proved the presence of the same etiology, and we have reason to suspect the presence of a. 3 way exchange, between children, among cats, and between childen and cats. To this date no reports have been made in Japan concerning a ringworm epidemic from microsporun of animal origin. Previously, in documents a few confined cases have been reported. However such an interesting fact as ours has not been reported. Pondering the reason we arrive at the conclusion that, with the exception of Takahashi, the said fungi species have not been reported from any other locality or land. More tnan probably this particular species has existed in its present north-most end of Japan and its neighbouring localities, Takatsuki's stub was discovered at Odomari, Saghalien. Takahashi's stub, in this original report states "ditch digger in Karifuto," Hokkaido. However according to a statement by Komuro who cultured 'Takahashi's stub, it was a Korean ditch digger (Doko) called Yamashita. It can easily be imagined that the said laborer had moved from one project to another as is the nature of the "Doko". Thus it would be difficult to pin its origin to Karifuto. However by the date of the disease the locality in which it had been contracted could have been either Hokkaido or Saghalien. At the beginning of the discovery of this epidemic, with the possibility of its emigration from Saghalien in mind, we centered our investigation on Saghalien repatriates. Especially in the case of T. school in Sapporo where half or more of the children are repatriates, we made a concentrated research on repatiate children, comparative percentage between repatriates of infection comparative percentage of presence of said fungi, date of repatriation and date of infection. However we regret to say we were unable to obtain any reasonable data to prove the migration of our species. We must reconsider this later, after the area around Wakkanai and north most points closest to Saghalien have been investigated. We should also include a report in regard to the correlativity with the Ainu (aborigines of Hokkaido) but no data is available. In conclusion we suspect that our species have a parasitifer prior to its attachment to the cat. Also there is a suspiscion that this fungi could possibly, have been originated in a certain species of wild animal and by importation to cats relayed to man. However we can not make a judgement on this subject as yet. Though mycologically, our results are more or less the same as that of Takahashi and Takatsuki, we find that the details concerning the said fungi, after our numerous encounters and experiences with it in this epidemic, do not coincide in certain aspects. Especially by the various organs originating in this species, we have data by which we could possibly make statements concerning the nature of nodular organs and comb-like organs. However we prefer to conclude our report by merely classifying Microsporon Sapporense as follows...|$|R
