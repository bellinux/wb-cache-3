5|$|Group 18 Structure 2 is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Its {{earliest}} phase dates to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west. A later construction phase was built over this. It consisted of a rectangular platform that supported a bench. A small pyrite disc was found near the front wall. Obsidian prismatic blades were found on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform,</b> together with pieces of a thin earthenware bowl. Burial 69 was found in front of the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 16 June 2011, a welding {{accident}} {{caused a}} fire at Hallingskeid Station, causing the complete destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b> This caused a seven days long closure of the line.|$|E
5|$|Platform C7 is an L-shaped {{platform}} that closes {{the east side}} and northeast corner of the East Plaza. Steps run the entire length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{final section}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> running towards Edinburgh are {{slightly}} higher, have larger edging stones {{and a different}} construction suggesting that they were built at a different date than <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
50|$|This is an {{elevated}} station near Koyambedu vegetable market. The station {{will be able}} to handle about 23,000 passengers an hour. Elevation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> will be about 15 m from the ground level and <b>the</b> total length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> will be 140 m.|$|R

5|$|Architecturally, smaller churches {{will feature}} bright lighting, large windows, a simple {{platform}} with a pulpit in the center, and an altar ("a bench {{across the front}} of the church below the platform"). Larger churches will have direct access from the balcony to the main sanctuary near the platform so that respondents to altar calls can easily come forward, a large open area in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> to accommodate altar call gatherings, and the platform itself is usually large to accommodate a large choir and musical instruments. Because the Assemblies of God practice baptism by immersion, many churches will include a baptistry at the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
5|$|For the {{restoration}} of the Gamla stan metro station in 1998 the artist Göran Dahl furnished the walls and floors with motifs from various medieval textiles and manuscripts, including the Överhogdal tapestries and the 14th-century Nobilis humilis (Magnushymnen) from the Orkney Islands. Vädersolstavlan is prominently featured on the eastern wall just south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> where the terrazzo wall depicts the emblematic sun dog arcs interwoven with enlarged fragments of textiles.|$|E

50|$|It {{consists}} of two insular <b>platforms</b> while <b>the</b> western one is broader and more heavily used. There are 4 tracks available. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> are connected to each other with the pedestrian bridge. In <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> semi-transparent roofs are installed. <b>The</b> south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platforms</b> is curved. <b>The</b> <b>platforms</b> are surrounded by the depot tracks so the only way in and out is via the bridge.|$|R
5|$|In August 2016, Twitter {{stated that}} it had banned 235,000 {{accounts}} {{over the past six}} months, bringing the overall number of suspended accounts to 360,000 accounts in the past year, for violating policies banning use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> to promote extremism.|$|E
5|$|Just before 8 o'clock I saw Henry Wood take up his {{position}} {{behind the curtain}} at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> – watch in hand. Punctually, on the stroke of eight, he walked quickly to the rostrum, buttonhole and all, and began the National Anthem... A few moments for the audience to settle down, then the Rienzi Overture, and the first concert of the new Promenades had begun.|$|E
5|$|Stadium Station was {{proposed}} in 1998 {{as part of}} the segment between the Downtown Seattle and Beacon Hill tunnels and subsequently deferred months later. It was reinstated in 2005 and construction of the station was completed in May 2006, several years before Link light rail service began on July 18, 2009. Trains serve the station 20 hours a day on most days; the headway between trains is 6 minutes during peak periods, with less frequent service at other times. Stadium Station is also served by several Sound Transit Express and King County Metro buses that stop on the SODO Busway west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform,</b> as well as the Seattle Greyhound station east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E

5|$|Structure C12 is a south-facing {{platform}} {{built from}} pumice. It divides the West Plaza in two. The upper surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> {{is marked by}} a circle of burnt clay formed by the burning of incense.|$|E
5|$|The basic story {{elements}} unfold as the protagonist, Tim, {{attempts to}} rescue a princess from a monster. Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations and motivations. The game features traditional aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> genre while integrating various powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.|$|E
5|$|The early Spectrum models' {{great success}} as a games {{platform}} came {{in spite of its}} lack of built-in joystick ports, primitive sound generation, and colour support that was optimised for text display: the hardware limitations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> required a particular level of creativity from video game designers.|$|E

5|$|The {{platform}} bay at Paddock Wood {{from which}} most of the line's trains departed is now part of a car park, with the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> fenced off. Parts of the line are still visible, such as the embankment through Swig's Hole valley and the approach to Horsmonden tunnel. Some bridges still remain, although the plate girder bridge over Goudhurst Road, Horsmonden has been removed.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{left the}} Cuckoo Line at Hellingly Station. Although the railway joined the Cuckoo Line {{at both the}} {{northern}} and southern ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform,</b> virtually no through trains ran. Due to the arrangement of the lines at the junction with the Cuckoo Line, passenger trains to and from the hospital reversed south of Hellingly station.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} retiled in the 1980s, with murals {{designed}} by Allan Drummond that reference the British Museum. These murals reference Egyptian and Roman antiquities, with sarcophagi, statues and trompe-l'œil columns {{on the walls}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E

5|$|By early 2016, delays as {{a result}} of {{overcrowding}} were up to more than 20,000 every month, four times the amount in 2012. The overcrowded trains have resulted in an increase of assaults because of tense commuters. With less platform space, more passengers are forced to be on the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> resulting in the increased possibility of passengers falling on the track. One possible solution that the MTA is considering is platform screen doors, which exist on the AirTrain JFK to prevent passengers from falling onto the tracks. In order to prevent hitting passengers who could fall onto the tracks, train operators are being instructed to go into stations at lower speeds. The increased proximity of riders could result in the spread of contagious diseases.|$|E
5|$|Devolution {{continued}} to be part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform</b> of the Labour Party which, in May 1997, took power under Tony Blair. In September 1997, the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum was put to the Scottish electorate and secured a majority in favour of {{the establishment of a}} new devolved Scottish Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh. An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012 Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Oracle Corp. support lawsuit, court {{documents}} unsealed by a Santa Clara County Court judge revealed that in 2008, Hewlett-Packard had paid Intel around $440 million to keep producing and updating Itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014. In 2010, {{the two companies}} signed another $250 million deal, which obliged Intel to continue making Itanium CPUs for HP's machines until 2017. Under {{the terms of the}} agreements, HP has to pay for chips it gets from Intel, while Intel launches Tukwila, Poulson, Kittson, and Kittson+ chips in a bid to gradually boost performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|E
