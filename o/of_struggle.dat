40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{multiple}} case study was to {{develop an understanding of}} the writing <b>of</b> <b>struggling</b> readers/writers in a single, inclusive writers 2 ̆ 7 workshop program. The study focused on the writing development <b>of</b> three <b>struggling</b> readers/writers in one inclusive third grade classroom for six months. In order to describe the writing development of the informants, the researcher used qualitative techniques of participant-observation, fieldnotes, interviews, documents of the informants 2 ̆ 7 writing, and notes or quotes from conversations with the secondary informant (classroom teacher). ^ The results {{of this study indicate that}} the writing development <b>of</b> <b>struggling</b> readers/writers was influenced by an inclusive writers 2 ̆ 7 workshop program. Five major themes pertaining to the writing <b>of</b> <b>struggling</b> readers/writers in a writers 2 ̆ 7 workshop program emerged from the data collected. Emerging themes were: classroom routines; teacher as facilitator; students teaching others; following the leader; and writing as a social activity. ^ The conclusions drawn were: (1) Classroom routines encouraged writing development in struggling readers/writers; (2) The teacher as a facilitator had a positive affect on the writing development <b>of</b> <b>struggling</b> readers/writers; (3) Students teaching each other contributed to the writing development <b>of</b> the <b>struggling</b> readers/writers; (4) Students in the classroom influenced the writing development <b>of</b> <b>struggling</b> readers/writers; (5) Writing was considered a social activity during Writers 2 ̆ 7 Workshop. ^ This study has significance for classroom teachers, reading specialists, school administrators, and university professors who work with pre-service teachers in illustrating the potential for inclusive writers 2 ̆ 7 workshop programs. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{battle was}} {{one of the largest in}} Medieval Europe and is {{regarded}} as the most important victory in the histories of Poland and Lithuania, also it's widely celebrated in Belarus. It has been used as a source of romantic legends and national pride, becoming a larger symbol <b>of</b> <b>struggle</b> against foreign invaders. During the 20th century the battle was used in Nazi and Soviet propaganda campaigns. Only in recent decades have historians moved towards a dispassionate, scholarly assessment of the battle, reconciling the previous narratives, which differed widely by nation.|$|E
5|$|The five Gefion {{passages}} seem {{to highlight}} the championing of a new order antagonistic to goddess worship. In light of {{what appears to be}} an elaborate thematic statement about patrilineage in the poem, the new order may also have entailed a change in kinship systems. Grendel and his mother may stand as types of earlier, matrilineal tribes. Further the hall which is the object <b>of</b> <b>struggle</b> between Beowulf and the first two monsters may symbolize the consolidation of new hierarchical social organization among the northern Germanic peoples.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of governor has {{developed over the}} course of two centuries.

Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their counterparts in most other states.|$|E

Both versions by Seeger feature him singing and playing the banjo without any additional accompaniment. In the live version, the crowd's clapping and singing along can be heard. Folk bands in the Pittsburgh area, such as the NewLanders, have both recorded and performed Seeger's version of the song.|$|E
5|$|While at Landsberg, Hitler {{dictated}} most of {{the first}} volume of Mein Kampf (My Struggle; originally entitled Four and a Half Years <b>of</b> <b>Struggle</b> against Lies, Stupidity, and Cowardice) to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book, dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart, was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race. Some passages imply genocide. Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926, it sold 228,000 copies between 1925 and 1932. One million copies were sold in 1933, Hitler's first year in office.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rise}} of the {{imperial}} Chalukyas of Badami, the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the cause of their overlords against the Pallavas of Kanchi. The Chalukyas were replaced by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta in 753 CE as the dominant power in the Deccan. After a century <b>of</b> <b>struggle</b> for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes, the Chola Dynasty of Tanjavur. In the late 10th century, north of Tungabhadra river, the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the Kaveri river. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} the New York Court of Appeals opened the doors for {{physicians}} to prescribe contraceptives, Sanger opened a second birth control clinic, which she staffed with physicians to make it legal under that court ruling (the first clinic had employed nurses). This second clinic, the Clinical Research Bureau (CRB), opened on January 2, 1923. To avoid police harassment the clinic's existence was not publicized, its primary mission was stated to be conducting scientific research, and it only provided services to married women. The existence of the clinic was finally announced {{to the public in}} December 1923, but this time there were no arrests or controversy. This convinced activists that, after ten years <b>of</b> <b>struggle,</b> birth control had finally become widely accepted in the United States. The CRB was the first legal birth control clinic in the United States, and quickly grew into the world's leading contraceptive research center.|$|E
5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy <b>of</b> <b>struggle</b> was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of the morality of Darwin's views.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after he}} {{finished}} his education, he served for two years as rector of the collegiate school at St. John's Church in Warsaw. From October 1557 he tutored Jan Tęczyński, son of magnate Andrzej Tęczyński, and visited Vienna with his pupil, where he likely became closely acquainted with the Society of Jesus, a key order of the counter-reformation. He then returned to Poland, which {{emerged as one of}} the main terrains <b>of</b> <b>struggle</b> between the Protestant Reformation movement and the Catholic Church's counter-reformation. From 1562 he served as a parson in Rohatyn, and around 1564 he took holy orders. That year he became a canon, and the following year he also served as chancellor of the Lwów chapter. From 1566 to 1567 he was chaplain at the court of castellan Jan Krzysztof Tarnowski (the royal secretary to King Sigismund II Augustus); after Tarnowski's death he returned to Lwów, taking up the position of the cathedral preacher.|$|E

5|$|In 1071, {{the sixth}} Count of Flanders, Arnulf III, {{was killed in}} the first Battle of Cassel by the forces of Robert the Frisian in a dispute over the {{succession}} to the title of count. Although Arnulf was numerically superior and was supported by King Philip I of France, Robert was able to defeat his rival's army and took the title of Count of Flanders with the acquiescence of Philip I after a further five years <b>of</b> <b>struggle.</b> The town was re-fortified, possibly by Robert, with a castle and a new set of walls built on the remains of the old Roman walls. The castle does not survive today – it was already in ruins by the early 18th century – but is depicted on old engravings as a large square tower, the Tour Grise, dominating the western flank of the hill.|$|E
5|$|In 1992–93, {{the inaugural}} {{season of the}} English Premier League, Norwich City led the league {{for much of the}} season, having been among the {{pre-season}} favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, Manchester United, and Aston Villa. They had shown that they were {{a force to be reckoned}} with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over an Arsenal side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by Manchester United. This was a big surprise not least to the media and pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season <b>of</b> <b>struggle.</b>|$|E
5|$|In February 1897, he {{was sentenced}} without trial to three years' exile in eastern Siberia.

His journey to eastern Siberia took 11 weeks, for much of which he was accompanied by his mother and sisters. Deemed only a minor threat to the government, he was exiled to a peasant's hut in Shushenskoye, Minusinsky District, where he was kept under police surveillance; he was nevertheless able to correspond with other revolutionaries, many of whom visited him, and permitted to go on trips to swim in the Yenisei River and to hunt duck and snipe.|$|E
