They are identifiable by their tinctorial properties, especially by their vital staining with Janus green, and by their size, shape, number, and disposition within cells. They are visible in living cells, especially {{with the aid of}} phase microscopy. They are by no means static, but move, grow, divide and recombine, and, in general, change in appearance from moment to moment. In size, they range from elongated objects several micra in length down to the limit of resolution with ordinary microscopy. With the application of electron microscopy to tissues, and particularly to tissue sections, mitochondria were quickly identified by their characteristic sizes, shapes, and cellular distributions. In the earliest published micrographs, the <b>organdies</b> appeared merely as ovoid or filamentous objects of considerable density.

40|$|We {{previously}} described {{the isolation of}} mutants of the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha that are defective in peroxisome biogenesis. Here, we describe the characterization {{of one of these}} mutants, per 8, and the cloning of the PER 8 gene. In either methanol or methylamine medium, conditions that normally induce the <b>organdies,</b> per 8 cells contain no peroxisome-like structures and peroxisomal enzymes are located in the cytosol. The sequence of PER 8 predicts that its product (Per 8 p) is a novel polypeptide of 34 kD, and antibodies against Per 8 p recognize a protein of 31 kD. Analysis of the primary sequence of Per 8 p revealed a 39 -amino-acid cysteine-rich segment with similarity to the C 3 HC 4 family of zinc-finger motifs. Overexpression of PER 8 results in a markedly enhanced increase in peroxisome numbers. We show that Per 8 p is an integral membrane protein of the peroxisome and that it is concentrated in the membranes of newly formed <b>organdies.</b> We propose that Per 8 p is a component of the molecular machinery that controls the proliferation of this organelle. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Endosomes are prelysosomal <b>organdies</b> {{that serve}} as an {{intracellular}} site for the sorting, distribution, and processing of receptors, ligands, fluid phase components, and membrane proteins internalized by endocytosis. Whereas the overall functions of endosomes are increasingly understood, {{little is known about}} endosome structure, composition, or biogenesis. In this paper, we describe a rapid procedure that permits analytical and preparative isolation of endosomes from a variety of tissue culture cells. The procedure relies on a combination of density gradient centrifugation and free flow electrophoresis. It yields a fraction of highly purified, functionally intact <b>organdies.</b> As markers for endosomes in Chinese hamster ovary cells, we used endocytosed horseradish peroxidase, FITC-conjugated dextran, and [35 S]methionine-labeled Semliki Forest virus. Total postuuclear superuatants, crude microsomal pellets, or partially purified Golgi fractions were subjected to free flow electrophoresis. Endosomes and lysosomes migrated together as a sin-NDOSOMES comprise a heterogeneous population of vacuoles and tubules to which receptors, receptorbound ligands, and extracellular solutes are delivered after endocytosis (see Helenius et al., 1983; Hopkins, 1983; Steinman et al., 1983; Brown et al., 1983; Pastan and Willingham...|$|R

Spermatogenesis in the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans uses unusual organelles, {{called the}} fibrous body-membranous organdie (FB-MO) complexes, to prepackage and deliver macromolecules to spermatids during cytokinesis that accompanies the second meiotic division.

When I got there Mrs. Allan {{met me at the}} door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink <b>organdy,</b> with dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a seraph. I really think I'd like to be a {{minister}}'s wife when I grow up, Marilla. A minister mightn't mind my red hair because he wouldn't be thinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to be naturally good and I'll never be that, so I suppose there's no use in thinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others are not. I'm one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I'm full of original sin. No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success of it as those who are naturally good. It's a good deal like geometry, I expect. But don't you think the trying so hard ought to count for something? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her passionately. You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs. Allan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are others, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. You know you OUGHT to love them because they know so much and are such active workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of it all the time or else you forget. There was another little girl at the manse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday school. Her name was Laurette Bradley, and she was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a kindred spirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I think I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs. Allan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too. Mrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the Sunday-school choir after this. You can't think how I was thrilled at the mere thought. I've longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir, as Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to. Lauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the White Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it. Lauretta says that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White Sands people to recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself someday. I just gazed at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I had a heart-to-heart talk. I told her everything--about Mrs. Thomas and the twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and my troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs. Allan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. You don't know how that encouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what do you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it's a lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn't that a romantic name? Mrs. Lynde says they've never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she thinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid to have a lady teacher, and I really don't see how I'm going to live through the two weeks before school begins. I'm so impatient to see her." ...|$|E
