Testaroli remains a very popular dish in Pontremoli, a small city in the {{province of}} Massa and Carrara, where it is served at virtually every restaurant in the city, during both mornings and evenings.

5|$|Like Castile soap, {{the chief}} {{ingredients}} of Nabulsi soap are virgin olive oil, water, and an alkaline sodium compound. The compound {{is made by}} mixing the powdered ashes of the barilla plant (qilw) which grows {{along the banks of}} the River Jordan with locally supplied lime (sheed). The sodium compound is then heated with water and the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> large copper vats over fermentation pits. The solution of water and the sodium compound becomes increasingly concentrated in a series of 40 cycles repeated over eight days. During that time, an oar-shaped wooden tool known as a dukshab is used to stir the liquid soap continuously. The liquid soap is then spread in wooden frames to set. After setting, it is cut into the classic cube shape of Nabulsi soap and stamped with the company's trademark seal. The soap cubes then undergo a drying process which can last from three months to a year and involves stacking them in ceiling-high structures resembling cones with hollow centers which allow the air to circulate around the cubes.|$|E

Two sets of blends were prepared by mixing an extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> with both refined and mild deodorized <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> <b>in</b> increasing amounts. The obtained data highlighted that the triacylglycerol oligopolymers were absent or present in traces in the extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> while their mean amount was equal to 0. 04 g/ 100 g and 0. 72 g/ 100 g in mild deodorized and refined <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> respectively.

The extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> (EVOOs) were analyzed as a whole and as phenolic extract by NMR.

Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord.

2500|$|The Judaic dietary law, Kashrut, forbade lard as {{a cooking}} medium, and butter, too, was proscribed as an {{alternative}} since Kashrut also prohibited mixing meat and dairy products. Jewish cuisine used <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> the Mediterranean, and sesame oil in Babylonia, but neither cooking medium was easily available in Western and Central Europe, so poultry fat (known in Yiddish as schmaltz), which could be abundantly produced by overfeeding geese, was substituted in their stead. The delicate taste of the goose's liver was soon appreciated; Hans Wilhelm Kirchhof of Kassel wrote in 1562 that the Jews raise fat geese and particularly love their livers. Some Rabbis were concerned that eating forcibly overfed geese violated Jewish food restrictions. The chasam sofer, Rabbi Moses Sofer, contended {{that it is not}} a forbidden food (treyf) as none of its limbs are damaged. This matter remained a debated topic in Jewish dietary law until the Jewish taste for goose liver declined in the 19th century. Another kashrut matter, still a problem today, is that even properly slaughtered and inspected meat must be drained of blood before being considered fit to eat. Usually, salting achieves that; however, as liver is regarded as [...] "(almost) wholly blood", broiling is the only way of kashering. Properly broiling a foie gras while preserving its delicate taste is difficult, and therefore rarely practiced. Even so, there are restaurants in Israel that offer grilled goose foie gras. [...] Foie Gras also bears resemblance to the Jewish food staple, chopped liver.|$|E
