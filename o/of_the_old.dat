5|$|All {{copies of}} Hymn {{are found in}} manuscripts of the Historia ecclesiastica or its {{translation}}, where they serve as either a gloss to Bede's Latin translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English poem, or, in the case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English version, a replacement for Bede's translation in the main text of the History. Despite this close connection with Bede's work, the Hymn {{does not appear to}} have been transmitted with the Historia ecclesiastica regularly until relatively late in its textual history. Scribes other than those responsible for the main text often copy the vernacular text of the Hymn in manuscripts of the Latin Historia. In three cases, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Laud Misc. 243, Oxford, Bodleian Library, Hatton 43, and Winchester, Cathedral I, the poem is copied by scribes working a quarter-century or more after the main text was first set down. Even when the poem is in the same hand as the manuscript's main text, there is little evidence to suggest that it was copied from the same exemplar as the Latin Historia: nearly identical versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English poem are found in manuscripts belonging to different recensions of the Latin text; closely related copies of the Latin Historia sometimes contain very different versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English poem. With the exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> English translation, no single recension of the Historia ecclesiastica is characterised by the presence of a particular recension of the vernacular poem.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things that}} made Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Republic great was the story and the companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E

5|$|Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Republic II was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts. It is the sequel to BioWare's Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Republic, and it uses the same Odyssey Engine as the original game. BioWare suggested that Obsidian should be offered the Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Republic license due to their familiarity with Obsidian's past work and the good {{relationship between the two}} developers, as well as due to finding LucasArts' development schedule for the sequel to be too tight. The game was released in PC and Xbox versions, but due to the Xbox version being released two months prior to the PC version, it has multiple unfixed bugs.|$|E

5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Republic to the second, saying that it isn't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first Knights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Republic to the second, but {{that this is a}} good thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members.
