25|$|After the 1965 India-Pakistan War, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Foreign {{minister}} at that time, began {{to lobby for}} a nuclear weapons option. 'If India builds the bomb, we will eat grass or leaves, even go hungry, but we will get <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>own.</b> We have no other choice'. 'In October 1965, Bhutto visited Vienna to attend the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting. While there, he met with Munir Ahmad Khan, and other Pakistani scientists working at IAEA. Pakistani IAEA scientists briefed Bhutto on the rapid development of Indian nuclear programme. According to Munir Ahmad Khan, the nuclear facility at Trombay consisted of a plutonium production reactor, a reprocessing plant, and other facilities associated to weapon production. Bhutto quickly arranged a meeting with Ayub Khan. After this meeting, Ayub Khan remained unconvinced, and rejected the proposal made by Munir Ahmad Khan. Khan notified Bhutto immediately and told him about what had happened.|$|E

Tchaikovsky was in Saint Petersburg because his opera Eugene Onegin was being {{performed at the}} Mariinsky Theater. Glazunov later wrote that while the nationalists' circle [...] "was no longer so ideologically closed and isolated {{as it had been}} earlier", they [...] "did not consider P.I. Tchaikovsky <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>own.</b> We valued only a few of his works, like Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, Francesca [...] and the finale of the Second Symphony. The rest of his output was either unknown or alien to us". Tchaikovsky's presence won over Glazunov and the other young members present, and his conversation with them [...] "was a fresh breeze amid our somewhat dusty atmosphere... Many of the young musicians present, including Lyadov and myself, left Balakirev's apartment charmed by Tchaikovsky's personality.... As Lyadov put it, our acquaintance with the great composer was a real occasion." ...|$|E

Though Hashimoto was himself known to be innocent of any war crimes and was generally treated well by his guards, he spoke little English and was subject to derision in the press. Among the public responses, socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean sent an angry telegram to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal to complain, and U.S. Representative Robert L. Doughton publicly stated, [...] "It is the most contemptible thing I ever heard of to summon a Jap officer to testify against <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> officers. I made my living practicing law before Navy courts and boards for 25 years, and this reaches an all-time low in courts, board or congressional investigation." [...] Columnist Robert Ruark accused the Navy of using Hashimoto to [...] "hype up" [...] the court martial. Even after his departure his testimony remained controversial, and the Chicago Sun criticized his trip, which it estimated to have cost $1,820.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Mussenden {{was hired}} as casting director, and held casting calls {{throughout}} the United States including San Antonio, Texas, Miami, Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles. Casting calls began on March 16, 1996 and concluded on March 23. Over 21,000 people auditioned for the title role, becoming the second largest audition since the search for Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind (1939). Casting turnouts reached 10,000 in Los Angeles and 5,000 in Chicago, while turnouts reached 8,000 in San Antonio. Mussenden chose 10-year-old Becky Lee Meza of Harlingen to portray young Selena, her acting debut. [...] Mexican actress Salma Hayek was invited to test the role of Selena by Esparza. Hayek turned the role down; she said she felt it was [...] "too early" [...] to base a movie on Selena {{and that it would}} be emotional because Selena's death was still being covered on U.S. television. Abraham discovered an actress in Los Angeles and wanted her for the role as Selena, despite her inability to convince the casting crew. He later had a change of heart when American actress and dancer Jennifer Lopez had showed up for the audition. Lopez found the audition process an elaborated procedure and was asked to sing, dance, and act out the elopement scene in front of the casting crew and Abraham. Within three takes of the elopement scene, Lopez convinced the entire casting crew who believed her performance was [...] "among the strongest". Lopez had previously worked with Nava in My Family (1995). Screen testing was described as [...] "grueling" [...] and required [...] "nine minutes of singing and dancing and eight pages of script." [...] After the announcement that Lopez would portray Selena, news media and fans criticized Abraham for choosing Lopez, a New York City native born to Puerto Rican parents, was selected to play a Texan of Mexican descent. The Mexican media disapproved the film and were outraged that Lopez was chosen for the title role. Lopez received backlash from the media and fans because she was not a Mexican American. The Hispanic community began protesting for a recast. During pre-production, Lopez stated: [...] "I know a few people were protesting, but in Corpus [...] everyone has been really supportive". Nava admitted that the backlash was [...] "a little hurtful", and felt the protesters [...] "should be celebrating that we have an all-Latino cast and that Lopez, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> is becoming a star." [...] The announcement was described as the [...] "role of a lifetime." [...] from news outlets and Lopez's salary for the film was reported at $1 million, which made Lopez the highest paid Hispanic actress in history.

Multicast is a well-known technology that, although requiring significant involvements of all participants, provides a scalable method to offer such services.

40|$|Both {{plants and}} animals respond to stress by using adaptations that help them evade, tolerate, or recover from stress. In a {{synthetic}} paper A. D. Bradshaw (1972) noted that basic biological differences between {{plants and animals}} will have diverse evolutionary consequences, including those influencing how they deal with stress. For instance, Bradshaw argued that animals, because they have relatively well-developed sensory and locomotor capacities, can often use behavior and movement to evade or ameliorate environmental stresses. In contrast, he predicted that plants will have to emphasize increased physiological tolerance or phenotypic plasticity, and also that plants should suffer stronger selection and show more marked differentiation along environmental gradients. Here we briefly review the importance of behavior in mitigating stress, the behavioral capacities of animals and plants, and examples of plant responses that are functionally similar to behaviors of animals. Next, we try to test some of Bradshaw’s predictions. Unfortunately, critical data often proved non-comparable: plant and animal biologists often study different stressors (e. g., water versus heat) and measure different traits (photosynthesis versus locomotion). Nevertheless, {{we were able to}} test some of Bradshaw’s predictions and some related <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>own.</b> As Bradshaw predicted, the phenology of plants is more responsive to climate shifts than is that of animals and the microdistributions of non-mobile, intertidal invertebrates (‘‘plant’’ equivalents) are more sensitive to temperature than are those of mobile invertebrates. However, mortality selection is actually weaker for plants than for animals. We hope that our review not only redraws attention to some fascinating issues Bradshaw raised, but also encourages additional tests of his predictions. Such tests should be informative. ...|$|R
