It also required the appointment of a formal Auditor with prescribed qualifications to audit such records. In order to act as an auditor a person had to acquire a <b>restricted</b> <b>certificate</b> from the local government upon such conditions as may be prescribed. The holder of a <b>restricted</b> <b>certificate</b> was allowed to practice only within the province of issue and in the language specified in the <b>restricted</b> <b>certificate.</b> In 1918 a course called Government Diploma in Accountancy was launched in Bombay (now known as Mumbai). On passing this diploma and completion of three years of articled training under an approved accountant, a person was held eligible for grant of an unrestricted certificate. This certificate entitled the holder to practice as an auditor throughout India. Later on the issue of <b>restricted</b> <b>certificates</b> was discontinued in the year 1920.|$|R

The set of self-adjoint operators in h, i. e. p − 1 (1), parametrises the relatively prime extensions. Any (Π, Θ) ∈ E(h) determines a boundary condition in the domain of the corresponding extension AΠ,Θ and explicitly appears in the formula for the resolvent (−AΠ,Θ + z) − 1.
