40|$|For carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) to {{be exploited}} in electronic applications, the growth of high quality material on conductive substrates at low temperatures (< 450 °C) is required. CNT quality {{is known to be}} strongly degraded when growth is conducted on metallic surfaces, particularly at low temperatures using conventional chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Here, the production of high quality vertically-aligned CNTs at low substrate temperatures (350 – 440 °C) on conductive TiN thin film using photo-thermal CVD is demonstrated by confining the energy required for growth to just the catalyst using an array of <b>optical</b> <b>lamps</b> and by optimizing the thickness of the TiN under-layer. The thickness of the TiN plays a crucial role in determining various properties including diameter, material quality, number of shells, and metallicity. The highest structural quality with a visible Raman D- to G-band intensity ratio as low as 0. 13 is achieved for 100 nm TiN thickness grown at 420 °C; a record low value for low temperature CVD grown CNTs. Electrical measurements of high density CNT arrays show the resistivity to be 1. 25 × 10 - 2 Ω cm representing some of the lowest values reported.

5000|$|Searchlight signals {{were the}} most often used signal type in the U.S. until recently, {{although}} these have become less popular due to vandalism. In these, a single incandescent light bulb is used in each head, and either an A.C. or D.C. relay mechanism is used to move a coloured spectacle (or [...] "roundel") {{in front of the}} lamp. In this manner, gravity (fail safe) returns the red roundel into the <b>lamp's</b> <b>optical</b> path. In effect, this mechanism is very similar to the colour light signal that is included in an electrically operated semaphore signal, except that the omission of the semaphore arm allows the roundels to be miniaturized and enclosed in a weatherproof housing. An elliptical reflector focuses the lamp through the roundel, a small lens and then a larger single or compound lensing arrangement is employed.

The PBR was illuminated by combinative light sources including side-light optical fibers (internal light source) as well as external irradiation of halogen lamp and/or tungsten filament lamp. A fill and draw (F/D) operation of PBR was shown to improve the performance of photoH(2) production over the performance of batch and continuous cultures under similar operation conditions. For medium improvement, the PBR was conducted under different concentrations of carbon source (acetate) and nitrogen source (glutamic acid).

SEM/EDS analysis showed that although the analyzed parts of the lamps have slightly different elemental compositions, they are all made out of yellow brass (Cu 70 % and Zn 30 %, in w. t.) and soft-solder (Pb-Sn alloy). The lamp bases alloys also contain tin, which increases the dezincification resistance, and lead was also found in one of the lamps, which is known to increase malleability and reduce the melting point of the alloy. Metallographic procedures were performed on two selected components of a lamp. Observation of as-cast and wrought brass microstructures support the main processing techniques used in manufacturing of this kind of objects.

Optical consideration includes only the luminous flux, not light quality parameters like CCT and CRI. Bulb-G {{has the highest}} CCT, {{despite the fact that}} it has satisfying results for manufacturer’s and consumer’s other primary concerns. Bulb-B with very high efficacy and low combined resistances has very good results; although it has the highest thermal resistance, which normally compromises reliability and life time. However, bulb-B is supposed to have a very long lifetime according to the information provided by manufacturer. It can be explained with the high quality of driver electronics and LEDs. Intricate surface of heat sink is not desired from vendor in common but it does not directly mean that this will bring unacceptable time increase or price jump for the production. It is also possible to make this advantageous, when the lighting manufacturers have access for the development of the production technology. While these FOMs provide a tool to compare various design options, manufacturing and cost of the thermal solution should be considered together. FOMs provide a good general view from many aspects. Some or all of them can be case-based used for a detailed analysis and comparison. It should be remarked that the evaluation method is not only based on cooling approaches or heat sink performances of lamps.

RESULTS: Secondary epimacular membrane formation was found in one eye in group A, and seven eyes in group B after vitrectomy, the difference was significant. Central macular thickness was 188. 36 ± 45. 53 μm in group A, and 220. 42 ± 53. 15 μm in group B after the removal of silicone oil, the difference was significant. Macular edema was comparatively mild in group with ILM peeling. Image of macular morphology in OCT was more similar to the normal in group A. The final logMAR visual acuity was 1. 38 ± 0. 60 in group A and 1. 61 ± 0. 51 in group B, the difference was not significant between these two groups.

40|$|Photocuring of {{polymers}} and polymer composites, from {{epoxy resin}} based formulations, {{has been of}} growing interest {{over the past two}} decades. The photocuring occurs when an epoxy formulation is exposed to electromagnetic radiation, usually ultraviolet (UV) radiation. This process has been explored widely and it can be described as an open mould process by which the epoxy formulation is exposed directly to the radiation. However, for a closed mould process, thermal curing, rather than radiation curing, typically is employed. The potential of using photocuring for a closed mould process has not yet been investigated in detail. The challenge in photocuring of polymers and polymer composites in a closed mould is directing the radiation into the mould to activate the photocuring process, which is not possible using the conventional methods. Hence, for this reason the present work is focused on the development of a closed mould photocuring system using side emitting optical fibres. This photocuring system using side emitting optical fibres relies upon the optimisation of epoxy based resins. As a result, an extensive characterisation of different types of UV curable cationic epoxy resins is carried out using two pre-formulated commercial resins, formulations from bisphenol A/F, and formulations from cycloaliphatic epoxy. The formulations showed different reactivity and hardness. An important result is that the cycloaliphatic epoxy resin formulations cured much faster than the other bisphenol A/F formulations, having a more uniform hardness distribution and UV radiation transparency during the curing. Side emitting optical fibres are adopted to photocure epoxy in a closed mould. Different types of side emitting optical fibres are characterised to determine irradiation efficiency. The optical fibres had either a silica core or a PMMA core. The silica core fibres have a silicone cladding containing radiation scattering particles (either ZnO or Al 2 O 3) and diffuser (either PA 6 or ETFE). The PMMA core polymer optical fibres (PMMA POFs) have a PVDF cladding with micro-perforations as a side emission mechanism. Silica core fibres with the Al 2 O 3 scattering particles and the PMMA core fibre are more suitable for the closed mould application as they transmitted efficiently in the UV radiation band. The high side emission characteristics of the PMMA POF compared to the silica core fibre showed higher potential for use in the closed mould photocuring process. As the polymerisation speed is influenced by the amount of flux density of the radiation source, a high flux lamp (Hg lamp, 40 W/cm 2) is coupled to the side emitting <b>optical</b> fibres. This <b>lamp</b> caused thermal degradation to the PMMA POF at the launch point when in use. A cooling device is made to minimise the thermal degradation generated by radiation absorption. After improving the optical transmission stability of the PMMA POF, its side emission is enhanced by various treatments, such as permanent modification of the fibre geometry with adjusted bend radii as well as by mechanically embedding silica scattering particles into the fibre and applying micro-cuts. The developed, closed mould photocuring system consists of: enhanced side emitting PMMA POF, a cooling device, high emission Hg lamp, and a closed mould setup. 1. 5 mm and 5 mm thick components, made from an optimised epoxy formulation (based on cycloaliphatic epoxy), are cured using the photocuring system. The 1. 5 mm thick component (20 mm wide and 245 mm long) is cured in 45 minutes using a single PMMA POF treated with silica particles (side emission of ~ 81 % of the total launched emission). The 5 mm thick component (75 mm wide and 170 mm long) partly cured in 45 minutes by simultaneously using three PMMA POFs treated with silica particles and geometric modification (side emission of ~ 96 % of the total launched emission). This sample eventually cured with time (up to 36 hours) due to dark reaction. The efficiency of the developed closed mould photocuring system is validated by curing a 1. 5 mm thick component made from a pre-formulated polyester resin formulation. This component cured in 7 minutes (30 mm wide and 245 mm long) using a single PMMA POF treated with silica particles. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|One {{purpose of}} this paper is to present new studies on the effect of {{bandwidth}} and the coherence properties of the excitation source on the decay and the dephasing of isolated large molecules. A detailed study of the system pentacene in a p-terphenyl matrix is presented utilizing three different excitation sources, a single mode dye laser (60 KHz– 6 MHz bandwidth depending on the time scale of the experiment) a multimode dye laser (240 GHz bandwidth), and an incoherent N 2 flash <b>lamp.</b> <b>Optical</b> T 1 (the longitudinal relaxation time) and T 2 (the transverse relaxation time) are measured from the coherent and incoherent transients observed either in the forward direction of the laser or at right angles to the exciting beam. At 1. 8 °K, the optical transition (1 A 1 g [...] > 1 B 2 u) of pentacene in p-terphenyl exhibits four sites, the lowest of which at 16 887 cm− 1 has the following parameters: T 2 = 44 ± 2 nsec; T 1 = 24. 9 ± 2 nsec, and µ= 0. 7 ± 0. 1 D. The transition moment µ, is obtained directly from the optical nutation, which exhibits a Rabi nutation time (h-slash/µ·epsilon) of 27. 3 nsec, and is corrected for the effect of the Lorentz local field inside the terphenyl crystal. The experiments presented here are categorized into two time regimes for theoretical analysis; a transient coherence regime where the observed decay is comparable with (h-slash/µ·epsilon) and T 2, and a steady-state coherence regime where transient dephasing is complete and the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix have decayed to their steady-state values in the presence of the field of amplitude epsilon. Using the Wilcox–Lamb method, rate equations (with T 2 expressions) describing the population flow in the ''complete'' level structure of pentacene (ground|| 0 >, singlet ||p>, and triplet {||l}) are derived from the density matrix equations of motion. When these equations are averaged over the inhomogeneous width of the optical transition and the measured Gaussian transverse profile of our laser we obtain T 1 p 0 = 24. 9 ± 2 nsec and T 1 pl= 15. 7 µsec, the time constants by which pentacene spontaneously decays to || 0 > or crosses over into l, as well as the averaged population at time t. In an effort to be complete, attention is placed upon the relationship between theory and the experimental findings. First, expressions for the OFID and nutation in the solid are presented for the pentacene case in order to relate T 1, T 2, and µ to the level structure. Second, at low temperatures (1. 8 °K), the origin of dephasing is identified as spontaneous emission from p [...] > 0 since experimentally T 2 ? 2 T 1, in agreement with other work. At higher temperature, however, a strongly temperature dependent dephasing process with an onset at 3. 7 °K takes place. Armed with these observations we present a theoretical treatment of these distinct dephasing channels and their temperature dependences. A discussion regarding the influence of ''accepting'' phonon modes (either optical or acoustic) on optical dephasing is also given. The results indicate that the treatment of Jones et al. can (1) explain the observed temperature dependence of T 2 in pentacene; (2) distinguish dephasing as a result of scattering by acoustic phonons from that due to resonance or quasilocalized phonons with clear connections to gas and liquid state theories, but without invoking more than two approximation levels. (3) explain both the level shift and line width changes as a result of ''conventional'' dephasing or dephasing by exchange mechanisms; and (4) relate the pure dephasing term to an anisotropy in the scattering amplitudes (between the ground and excited states in the system) which contribute largely to the homogeneous width of the transition. Optical site selection of these transitions is also reported and discussed in relation to vibrational relaxation and to both homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings. The studies of the homogeneous broadening of the vibronic origin (267 cm− 1) indicate that vibrational relaxation is fast (psec) in the excited singlet manifold of pentacene. Finally from more than ten independent experiments including single and multimode excitation, on- and off-resonance scattering, Zeeman effect and the transient decay as a function of excess energy in the molecule, a more complete picture of the pentacene level structure {||l>} is given. With this in mind, the influence of the laser bandwidth and coherence properties on state preparation and subsequent dephasing and decay is concluded. It is proposed that the slow decay, (~ 15 µsec) observed during narrow-band excitation represents intersystem crossing to nearby triple manifolds after the transient coherence of the 0 p subsystem is decayed. In addition, the decay of the primary state prepared in these experiments is not sensitive to the bandwidth or the correlation time of our excitation sources...|$|R
