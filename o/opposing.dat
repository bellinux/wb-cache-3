5000|$|In Star Wars and Philosophy, William Stephens {{compares the}} Jedi to Stoicism To recap, the virtues the Jedi shares with the Stoic sage are patience, timeliness, deep commitment, {{seriousness}} (as <b>opposed</b> to frivolity), calmness (as <b>opposed</b> to anger or euphoria), peacefulness (as <b>opposed</b> to aggression), caution (as <b>opposed</b> to recklessness), benevolence (as <b>opposed</b> to hatred), joy (as <b>opposed</b> to sullenness), passivity (as <b>opposed</b> to agitation), and wisdom.

5|$|As an {{expansion}} pack for Half-Life, <b>Opposing</b> Force is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of <b>Opposing</b> Force does not significantly differ {{from that of}} Half-Life: players are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance. The game continues Half-Lifes methods of an unbroken narrative. The player sees everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains {{in control of the}} player character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Progress through the game's world is continuous; although the game is divided up into chapters, the only significant pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment. <b>Opposing</b> Force also features an extended multiplayer, incorporating the various new environments and weapons into the original deathmatch mode used in Half-Life. After release, a new capture the flag mode with additional levels, items and powerups, was created by Gearbox for the game.|$|E
