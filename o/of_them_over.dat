Discussions between the three <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>over</b> the following year or so, led to the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899. Lady Gregory undertook fundraising, and the first programme consisted of Martyn's The Heather Field and Yeats's The Countess Cathleen.|$|E

After retiring from the Air Force, he spent several more years as the commandant of cadets at the New Mexico Military Institute, a junior college that prepares students to enter the service academies.|$|E

5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, {{though she is}} well aware <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Over</b> the years, she has learned how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though some}} of his {{soldiers}} came within 60 meters of the pillbox, after 19 <b>of</b> <b>them</b> (<b>over</b> a third) were killed and the sun began rising in the horizon, Kotzer decided to retreat, unable to receive official permission due to communication problems. He ordered all of his troops to collect the wounded and any weapons they could carry, helping with the task himself. The dead were left in the field, including the medics (not a single medic survived). The injured were brought under fire into the wadi and at about 07:00 the force {{made its way to}} an unoccupied two-storey building on the east bank. After the Egyptians started shelling the building with mortars, Kotzer's company began to move towards Gan Yavne.|$|E
5|$|Michael kidnaps Laurie {{and takes}} {{her back to}} their old home. He tries to show Laurie that she is his sister, {{presenting}} a picture of them with their mother. Unable to understand, Laurie stabs Michael with his own knife before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but Loomis arrives and shoots him. Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie before she can leave and heads back to the house. Loomis again intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on a balcony and charges her head-on, knocking both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>over</b> the railing. Laurie finds herself {{on top of an}} unconscious Michael. Aiming Loomis' gun at his face, she fires just as Michael awakens.|$|E

Some hockey legends often recalls that he was the best goaltender of them all. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1958, with the help of Senator Chubby Power, once a teammate. He is still the earliest goaltender in HHOF, starting his senior hockey venture in 1901.|$|E

25|$|Large {{land-based}} turbines required {{high efficiency}} and increased superheat, so the marine pattern was revised to the distinctive land-based Yarrow boiler. This became asymmetrical. One wing was enlarged and received {{most of the}} gas flow.

It is clear that most of the lendmenn—the nobility of the time—sided with King Magnus, but Sverre also quickly won several <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>over</b> to his side.

25|$|New Testament {{references}} {{show that}} the earliest Christians used the Psalms in worship, and the Psalms have remained {{an important part of}} worship in most Christian Churches. The Eastern Orthodox, Catholic, Presbyterian, Lutheran and Anglican Churches have always made systematic use of the Psalms, with a cycle for the recitation of all or most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>over</b> the course of one or more weeks. In the early centuries of the Church, it was expected that any candidate for bishop would be able to recite the entire Psalter from memory, something they often learned automatically during their time as monks.|$|E

In March 2016 a group of homeless women attempted to squat in one of about nine houses in Bendigo Street Collingwood that remained vacant, but were evicted by the state government.
