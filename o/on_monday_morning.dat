5|$|<b>On</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning,</b> {{the storm}} had moved {{northeast}} of London, Ontario, dragging lake effect blizzards in its wake. An additional 17inches (43cm) of snow were dumped on Cleveland, Ohio that day, filling the streets with snowdrifts 6feet (2m) high. Streetcar operators stayed with their stranded, powerless vehicles for two nights, eating whatever food was provided by local residents. Travelers were forced to take shelter and wait for things to clear.|$|E

The London Gazette just managed to put out its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames.

5|$|Sunday was a rest day, and {{the match}} resumed <b>on</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning.</b> In the third over of the day, Lindwall {{was the last}} man out at 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Bradman's men had added only one run to its {{overnight}} score of 457/9. Bedser took the final wicket as Lindwall edged, and Crapp took the catch low down in the slips with his left hand. Bedser ended with 3/92 and Laker 3/113, while Pollard and Yardley ended with two wickets each. England's use of Cranston as an all rounder had not been successful; he conceded almost four runs per over without taking a wicket. Although England only had a slight lead, Australia had the disadvantage of being a bowler short due to Toshack's injury. This meant Johnston and Johnson among the slower bowlers were left to exploit the wearing pitch.|$|E
5|$|When Davidson {{returned}} home {{he found that}} Molly was six months pregnant. The dates of his service leave during 1918 made it apparent {{that he was not}} the father. A daughter was born on 21 June 1919; the likely father was a Canadian army colonel, Ernest Doudemain, a friend from Davidson's schooldays who had lodged at the rectory {{in the latter part of}} 1918. Although deeply upset by his wife's infidelity, Davidson accepted the child—who bore some resemblance to him—as his own. To escape the poisoned atmosphere in Stiffkey he applied for a year's posting as chaplain to a hill station at Simla in India, but the opportunity fell through. Instead, Davidson resumed his pre-war routine of spending his weeks in London, departing early <b>on</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning</b> and returning late on Saturday. Sometimes, through a missed rail connection or other mishap, he was barely in time for the Sunday morning service at Stiffkey, and sometimes he would fail to arrive at all.|$|E

25|$|The {{instrument}} landing system was operational from 1 August 1986 and on 12 August Coast Aero Center started their two routes, using a ten-seat Beechcraft Super King 200 One week later, the ministry changed the concession for the Oslo and Skien route, so it was also awarded to Coast Aero Center. The service started on 24 October 1986. By November the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration had approved the landing lights and other upgrades to the instrument system, which cost NOK3.9 million, causing the airport to have to borrow money. It also bought a used fire engine from Sola. The need for transport was extra high <b>on</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning</b> and Friday afternoon, when weekly commuters were flown in.

It was only on Sunday in the early afternoon that Spock's influence on his behavior would fade off and he would feel more himself again—only to start the cycle over again <b>on</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning.</b> Years after the show he observed Vulcan speech patterns, social attitudes, patterns of logic, and emotional suppression in his own behavior.|$|E

25|$|The Northern Command {{was trying}} to put {{together}} a command reserve, but could only assemble the survivors of the 53rd Battalion. The Barak Brigade had almost ceased to exist: Its commander and key staff officers were dead, and almost all of its troops and equipment were absorbed into other brigades. Lieutenant-Colonel Yossi Ben Hanan arrived the night before to take command of what was left of it. He had been the commander of the 53rd Battalion until two weeks earlier, and was on his honeymoon when the war started. He was sent to reorganize the brigade. He teamed with Erez, who had escaped from Tel Faris <b>on</b> <b>Monday</b> <b>morning,</b> and Shmuel Askarov, the 53rd Battalion's deputy commander, to start repairing tanks. At 1800, he reported to his division commander, General Rafael Eitan that he was ready to bring forward the thirteen Centurions he had repaired thus far, and was ordered to head for Nafakh.

Erdoğan could not become Prime Minister as he was still banned from politics by the judiciary for his speech in Siirt. Gül became the Prime Minister instead. In December 2002, the Supreme Election Board canceled the general election results from Siirt due to voting irregularities and scheduled a new election for 9 February 2003. By this time, party leader Erdoğan was able to run for parliament due to a legal change made possible by the opposition Republican People's Party. The AKP duly listed Erdoğan as a candidate for the rescheduled election, which he won, becoming Prime Minister after Gül handed over the post.|$|E
