60|$|In {{an age of}} reminiscences, {{is there}} room for the confessions of a veteran, who remembers {{a great deal about}} books and very little about people? I have often {{wondered}} that a Biographia Literaria has so seldom been attempted--a biography or autobiography of a man in his relations with other minds. Coleridge, to be sure, gave this name to a work of his, but he wandered from his apparent purpose into a world of alien disquisitions. The following pages are frankly bookish, and to the bookish only do they appeal. The habit of reading has been praised as a virtue, and has been denounced as a vice. In no case, if we except the perpetual study of newspapers (which cannot fairly be called reading), is the vice, or the virtue, common. It is more innocent than <b>opium-eating,</b> though, like <b>opium-eating,</b> it unlocks to us artificial paradises. I try to say what I have found in books, what distractions from the world, what teaching (not much), and what consolations.|$|E
60|$|Lessingham, {{fighting}} for his consciousness, deafened and half stunned by {{the roar of the}} waters about him, still felt the exhilaration of that great struggle. He looked once into seas which seemed to touch the clouds, drew himself stiff, and plunged into the depths of a mountain of foaming waters, whose summit seemed to him like one of those grotesque and nightmare-distorted efforts of the <b>opium-eating</b> brain. Then the roar sounded all behind him, and {{he knew that he was}} through the breakers. He swam to the side of the ship and clutched hold of a chain. It was Sir Henry's out-stretched hand which pulled him on to the deck.|$|E

For {{your stories}} has been {{reserved}} a boundless popularity, and that highest success--the {{success of a}} perfectly sympathetic translation. By this time, of course, you have made the acquaintance of your translator, M. Charles Baudelaire, who so strenuously shared your views about Mr. Emerson and the Transcendentalists, and who so energetically resisted all those ideas of 'progress' which 'came from Hell or Boston.' On this point, however, the world continues to differ from you and M. Baudelaire, and perhaps there is only the choice between our optimism and universal suicide or universal <b>opium-eating.</b> But to discuss your ultimate ideas is perhaps a profitless digression from the topic of your prose romances.|$|E

6000|$|Who was {{the opium}} hag, the Princess Puffer? Mr. Cuming Walters writes: [...] "We make a guess, for Dickens gives us no solid facts. But when we {{remember}} {{that not a}} word is said throughout the volume of Jasper's antecedents, who he was, and where he came from; when we remember that but for his nephew he was a lonely man; when we {{see that he was}} both criminal and artist; when we observe his own wheedling propensity, his false and fulsome protestations of affection, his slyness, his subtlety, his heartlessness, his tenacity; and when, above all, we know that the opium vice is HEREDITARY, and that a YOUNG man would not be addicted to it unless born with the craving; {5} then, it is not too wild a conjecture that Jasper was the wayward progeny of this same <b>opium-eating</b> woman, all of whose characteristics he possessed, and, perchance, of a man of criminal instincts, but of a superior position. Jasper is a morbid and diseased being while still in the twenties, a mixture of genius and vice. He hates and he loves fiercely, as if there were wild gipsy blood in his veins. Though seemingly a model of decorum and devoted to his art, he complains of his [...] "daily drudging round" [...] and [...] "the cramped monotony of his existence." [...] He commits his crime with the ruthlessness of a beast, his own nature being wholly untamed. If we deduce that his father was an adventurer and a vagabond, we shall not be far wrong. If we deduce that his mother was the opium-eater, prematurely aged, who had transmitted her vicious propensity to her child, we shall almost certainly be right." ...|$|E

The boxes were unlighted… In these boxes were women, one in some, more in others. … Women with dresses reaching nearly to the point above their knees, with stained and sweaty tights, with bare arms and necks uncovered halfway to their waists ...|$|E
5000|$|If Jane Austen wrote Royal Navy yarns, {{they might}} read like this sequel to Master and Commander and Post Captain (which Norton issues in {{paperback}} in August). In the early 1800s, Captain Jack Aubrey, unjustly drummed out of service, is now {{master of the}} [...] "letter of marque" [...] (privateer) frigate Surprise, secretly owned by Stephen Maturin, ship's doctor/naturalist/abandoned husband/opium-eater and intelligence agent. The major events here are two great sea victories that make Jack a rich folk-hero, and Stephen's winning back {{of his wife and}} breaking his laudanum habit. Jack's seamanship and heroism are complemented by Stephen's absent-minded brilliance, their friendship cemented by their shared music-making (violin and cello, respectively). The early-19th-century locutions are fascinating, as are the evocation of period shipboard life (including ship-provisioning and naval lingo), Whitehall politics (rotten boroughs, etc.) and drug addiction (coca leaf-chewing as well as <b>opium-eating).</b> Seafarers and landlubbers alike will enjoy this swift, witty tale of money and love.|$|E

40|$|From {{the start}} of his writing career, Thomas De Quincey was so densely {{surrounded}} by literary culture that it was difficult for him to write as he pleased. He had been forced to meet various editorial requirements and be sensitive to readers' response. This biographical fact should be considered when interpreting the Confessions of an English Opium-Eater and its long history along with some critical appreciation of the generic characteristics of the Confessions as a work of modern autobiography. In 1821 the Confessions was published in London Magazine, and in a few months it circulated again in a book form. Then, in 1856 the work reappeared in orie of the volumes of De Quincey's authorized collected writings. This history of the Confessions is also that of the author's revisionary endeavour, through which the revised version emerged quite differently from the original. And that is where the dynamics of these two vectors one originating from literary culture, and the other from the author's concern over his future identity as a writer holds a special significance for the Confessions itself. Although De Quincey's revisionary works can be traced more explicitly in the Confessions of 1856,its book form version also has a newly added section, which proves to be significant for the future course of the work. From that time on the author shows off his identity not as a common, anonymous magazine contributor but as an identifiable writer with his own personal background. In the revised version of the Confessions there can be discerned that his long-held desire to become an independent writer with his own name is realized. However, the reconsideration of his contemporary literary culture reveals that this achievement was also {{in the interests of the}} literary market consisting of the publisher and the numerous readers. Thus, the revised Confessions was a success, as a literary work and as a commercial product for the author and the literary market, respectively. Yet, the chance to be an original, creative writer was lost for De Quincey, because he had chosen, through his prosaic treatment of the extraordinary experiences of his <b>opium-eating,</b> to become primarily a commercial writer...|$|E
