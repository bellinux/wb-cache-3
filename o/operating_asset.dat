40|$|This study {{examines}} restructuring {{in which a}} firm divests an <b>operating</b> <b>asset</b> in exchange for another <b>operating</b> <b>asset.</b> Since liquidity, capital structure, and distributional issues are not immediately associated with tax-free asset-for-asset exchanges, they are well suited for examining the competing hypotheses related to divestitures. We find that the abnormal returns associated with asset exchanges are generally smaller than those associated with other divestiture restructurings except when indications of value are provided. Our analysis identifies positive valuation effects for firms undertaking focus-enhancing exchanges, but a dominating consideration is whether {{the value of the}} units traded is indicated.

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} {{documented}} that accruals {{of companies are}} less persistent than cash flow as both are components of company profitability and their differing implication for future profitability of the companies are not properly comprehended by the investors when they make their investment decisions. Accruals are component of both profitability and growth in net <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> of the company. We can segregate growth in net <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> into accruals and growth in long term net <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> just like segregation profitabilityinto accruals and cash flow from operations. In order to check the impact of accruals and growth in long term net <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> on one year ahead profitability, regression has been applied on the variables. Our results revealed that after controlling current profitability, both components of growth in net <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> i. e., accruals and growth in long term net <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> have negative impact on one year ahead future profitability...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the {{financial}} performance of retail firms with fiscal years ending on or around December 31, 2008 and 2009 (the recession years) with retail firms with fiscal years ending on or around December 31, 2006 and 2007 (the non-recession years). As with Little, Little, and Coffee (2008), the modified Du Pont model of financial ratio analysis is used to identify the drivers of financial success under alternative business strategies. Firms in the retail industry are categorized according to their high/low relative net operating income to sales and <b>operating</b> <b>asset</b> turnover ratios. Firms with high relative net operating income to sales and low relative <b>operating</b> <b>asset</b> turnover are assumed to be pursuing a differentiation strategy and those with high relative <b>operating</b> <b>asset</b> turnover and low relative net operating income to sales are assumed to be pursuing a cost leadership strategy. The performance variable used is return on net operating assets. One stream of prior research suggests that a firm could, in theory, perform well following either strategy. Little, Little, and Coffee (2008) suggest that retail firms using a differentiator strategy outperform (based on return on net operating assets) those using a cost leader strategy. However, the findings of this research suggest that retail firms pursuing a differentiation strategy are not more likely to achieve a higher return on net operating assets than those firms pursuing a cost leadership strategy in a recessionary period...|$|E
40|$|I {{find that}} the total asset (TA) growth anomaly (Cooper et al. 2008) is a noisy manifestation of the net <b>operating</b> <b>asset</b> (NOA) growth anomaly {{documented}} earlier in the accounting literature. To better understand {{the underlying causes of}} the growth anomalies, I decompose TA growth into NOA growth and two additional components. Out of the three components, the TA growth anomaly appears to be driven only by the market???s misunderstanding of NOA growth???s negative implications for future profitability. The two additional components fail to predict future abnormal returns and, in fact, substantially dilute the predictability of NOA growth. This study suggests that it is not sufficient to decompose asset growth only by asset types or liability types in order to capture the differential implications of asset growth components. It is important for us to further decompose asset growth by financing sources within a given type of assets. This decomposition allows us to consider the interaction between asset types and liability types and to bridge the ???left??? side and the ???right??? side of balance sheet in financial statement analysis...|$|E
40|$|Key {{performance}} indicators (KPI) are tools {{for measuring the}} progress of a business towards its goals. Although wind energy is now a mature technology, {{there is a lack}} of well-defined best practices to asses the performance of a wind farm (WF) during the operation and maintenance (O&M) phase; processes and tools of asset management, such as KPIs, are not yet well-established. This paper presents a review of the major existing indicators used in the O&M of wind farms (WFs), as such information is not available in the literature so far. The different stakeholders involved in the O&M phase are identified and analysed together with their interests, grouped into five categories. A suggestion is made for the properties that KPIs should exhibit. For each category, major indicators that are currently in use are reviewed, discussed and verified against the properties defined. Finally, we propose a list of suitable KPIs that will allow stakeholders to have a better knowledge of an <b>operating</b> <b>asset</b> and make informed decisions. It is concluded that more detailed studies of specific KPIs and the issues of their implementation are probably needed...|$|E

40|$|Measuring bank {{efficiency}} {{is difficult because}} there is no satisfactory definition of bank output. Neither the number of accounts nor total assets, total loans, nor total deposits provide a good index of output. Moreover, the value added of banks - given by their labor costs and profits - measures both the output and cost of banking. Many analysts use accounting data on bank margins, costs and profits as measures of bank efficiency. But the usefulness of such data is undermined by substantial structural and accounting differences across countries, among individual banks and over time. Great caution and extensive knowledge of local banking conditions are required to interpret bank ratios. The author uses three sets of operating ratios to discuss the impact of differences in structure and practice on bank performance: <b>operating</b> <b>asset</b> ratios; operating income ratios; and operating equity ratios. The author also uses return-on-equity (ROE) analysis to highlight the effects of differences in banking structure and practice. The author's analysis is applied to the performance of banks in OECD countries in the 1980 s. The analysis has major implications for assessing bank performance in developing countries, where inflation, higher risk, and operating inefficiencies often cause cost and other bank ratios to be generally higher than in OECD countries.

40|$|Direct {{farm land}} {{investment}} and ownership by non-traditional institutional, private equity, and sovereign wealth funds {{has increased in}} recent years as investors find attractive characteristics in this asset class such as favorable risk adjusted returns, an inflation hedge, and a negative correlation with many other asset classes. Investors encounter difficulties valuing these real assets where idiosyncratic knowledge and farm management performance are central to the assetâ€™s performance. Research into the drivers of farm performance {{has been the subject of}} substantial research, and good farms can be differentiated from poor ones. Unfortunately the proper valuation for direct investment in a real <b>operating</b> <b>asset</b> requires two key elements, an understanding of the relative performance of one investment to another, and the persistence of these peer rankings over time. Research to date has omitted these two key performance components of proper valuation. Using several logistic regressions, the analysis leads to conclude that the drivers of persistence of performance are linked to managerial, structural and environmental (exogenous factors). This thesis also shows that unfortunately for the investor there are high year to year movements of farms in the distribution of returns and efficiency in two samples of soybean farms, in Illinois and in Mato Grosso, Brazil. This has significant negative implications for an investor trying to value a farm asset...|$|E
40|$|Purpose â€“ This paper aims {{to analyze}} the {{statistical}} characteristics of changes in property forward prices. As highlighted in a survey conducted at the MIT Center for Real Estate in 2006, the relatively weak understanding in their prices {{is one of the}} most important barriers in their use. In this context, the analysis of the forward price term structure is essential. Do the short- and long-term forward prices behave similarly? Do property derivatives behave like other derivative assets or other related assets? This study also investigates the leadâ€“lag relationship between spot and forward returns for different maturities. Design/methodology/approach â€“ Using four years and nine months of data on the UK Investment Property Databank (IPD), all property total return swaps are examined. We strip the swaps into their forwards and study their statistical characteristics (the first four moments and their autocorrelation levels). The relationships among the forward contracts, the underlying asset (IPD index and IPD unsmoothed) and other assets (risk-free rate, listed real estate) are explored. Using the Yiu et al. (2005) methodology, the leadâ€“lag relationship between the spot and the forwards is assessed. Findings â€“ The index appears to be significantly less volatile and less efficient, in terms of correlation than its own derivative contracts. Moreover, changes in forward prices are leading indicators of the IPD index. Their risks tend to converge with the implied volatility of the REITâ€™s <b>operating</b> <b>asset</b> but without being affected by the general stock market risks. Regarding the forward priceâ€“discovery function, investors should collect information not only from the spot market but also, maybe primarily, from the derivative market. Originality/value â€“ In this paper, we use a never-exploited database that is relative to the quotes of the UK IPD swaps. It is the first attempt {{to analyze the}} statistical characteristics of their changes. Our results show that these prices are clearly superior to the spot series, in terms of risks but without behaving affected by the tyranny of the past values. These findings may conduct to consider new methods to unsmooth current real estate indices. Characterized by a strong sensitivity to the changes in the information set, property derivative-based indicators should lead to increased efficiency in the spot market...|$|E

40|$|When {{cumulative}} net {{operating income}} (accounting value added) outstrips cumulative free cash flow (cash value added), subsequent earnings growth is weak. In this circumstance, we argue that investors with limited attention overvalue the firm, because naÃ¯ve earnings-based valuation disregards the firmâ€™s relative lack of success in generating cash flows in excess of investment needs. The normalized level of net <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> is therefore {{a measure of the}} extent to which operating/reporting outcomes provoke excessive investor optimism. Consequently, if investor attention is limited, net <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> will predict negative subsequent stock returns. In our 1964 - 2002 sample, net <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> scaled by beginning total assets is a strong negative predictor of long-run stock returns.

50|$|Net <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> (NOA) are a business's <b>operating</b> <b>assets</b> minus its <b>operating</b> liabilities.
