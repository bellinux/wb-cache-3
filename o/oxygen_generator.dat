5|$|Several {{accidents}} occurred which {{threatened the}} station's safety, {{such as the}} glancing collision between Kristall and Soyuz TM-17 during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents occurred during EO-23. The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO-22 to EO-23, when a malfunction occurred in the backup Vika system, a chemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator</b> later known as solid-fuel <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator</b> (SFOG). The Vika malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut Jerry Linenger insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Some of the fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} newer modules were immovable.|$|E
5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator</b> and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
5|$|The fire, {{caused by}} the {{malfunction}} of a backup solid-fuel <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator</b> (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between 90 seconds and 14 minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, {{but some of the}} respirator masks initially worn were broken. Fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of the}} modules were immovable. The fire occurred during a crew rotation, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three. Access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats was blocked, which would have prevented escape by half of the crew. A similar incident had occurred on an earlier Mir expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for only a few seconds.|$|E

25|$|On flight day 9, mission {{specialist}} Greg Chamitoff and pilot Greg Johnson conducted {{a series of}} interviews with media outlets around the United States, including KPIX-TV, KGO-TV and KFBK. Later in the day, commander Mark Kelly and {{mission specialist}}s Mike Fincke and Chamitoff conducted interviews with The Daily, KDKA, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review and KTRK-TV. Johnson and mission specialist Roberto Vittori also completed some more equipment transfers between the station and shuttle, and began to clean up and organize the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) Leonardo. The STS-134 crew furthermore completed some work on the <b>Oxygen</b> <b>Generator</b> System (OGS) and Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA). Drew Feustel, joined by Fincke and Chamitoff, spent most of the day preparing the tools for the following day's EVA. At the end of their day, the shuttle crew and Expedition 28 flight engineer Ron Garan conducted an EVA procedures review in preparation for the third spacewalk on flight day 10.|$|E

500|$|STS-86 {{performed}} the seventh Shuttle–Mir docking, {{the last of}} 1997. During Atlantiss stay crew members Titov and Parazynski conducted the first joint US–Russian extravehicular activity during a Shuttle mission, and the first in which a Russian wore a US spacesuit. During the five-hour spacewalk, the pair affixed a [...] Solar Array Cap to the Docking Module, for a future attempt by crew members to seal off the leak in Spektrs hull. The mission returned Foale to Earth, along with samples, hardware, and an old Elektron <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator,</b> and dropped Wolf off on the Station ready for his 128-day Increment. Wolf had originally been scheduled {{to be the final}} Mir astronaut, but was chosen to go on the Increment instead of astronaut Wendy Lawrence. Lawrence was deemed ineligible for flight because of a change in Russian requirements after the Progress supply vehicle collision. The new rules required that all Mir crew members should be trained and ready for spacewalks, but a Russian spacesuit could not be prepared for Lawrence in time for launch.|$|E

[...] Some submarines in the class are capable of delivering SEALs through either the dry deck shelter system or the advanced SEAL delivery system (program canceled in 2006 and rendered unusable in 2009). [...] A variety of atmospheric control devices are used to allow the vessel to remain submerged {{for long periods of time}} without ventilating, including an electrolytic <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator,</b> which produces oxygen for the crew and hydrogen as a byproduct.

50|$|Simpler gas {{separation}} technologies, such as membranes or {{molecular sieves}} used in {{pressure swing adsorption}} or vacuum swing adsorption are also used to produce low purity air gases in nitrogen <b>generators</b> and <b>oxygen</b> plants.

50|$|Industrial oxygen {{concentrators}} are {{sometimes referred to}} as oxygen generators within the oxygen and ozone industries to distinguish them from medical {{oxygen concentrators}}. The distinction is used in an attempt to clarify that industrial oxygen concentrators are not medical devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and they are not suitable for use as bedside medical concentrators. However, applying the <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator</b> nomenclature can lead to confusion. The term, <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator,</b> is a misnomer in that the oxygen is not generated as it is with a chemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator,</b> but rather it is concentrated from the air.|$|E

50|$|Commercial {{aircraft}} provide {{emergency oxygen}} to passengers {{to protect them}} from drops in cabin pressure. Chemical <b>oxygen</b> <b>generators</b> are not used for the cockpit crew, who are typically supplied using compressed oxygen canisters also known as oxygen bottles. In narrow body airliners, for each row of seats there are overhead oxygen masks and <b>oxygen</b> <b>generators.</b> In some wide-body airliners, such as the DC-10 and IL-96, the canisters and oxygen masks are mounted in the top portion of the seat backs, since the ceiling is too high above the passengers. If a decompression occurs, the panels are opened either by an automatic pressure switch or by a manual switch, and the masks are released. When the passengers pull down on the mask they remove the retaining pins and trigger the production of oxygen.|$|R

40|$|The partial {{electrochemical}} reduction {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) using ceramic <b>oxygen</b> <b>generators</b> (COGs) is well known and widely studied. However, complete reduction of metabolically produced CO 2 (into carbon and oxygen) {{has the potential of}} reducing oxygen storage weight for life support if the oxygen can be recovered. Recently, the University of Florida devel- oped novel ceramic <b>oxygen</b> <b>generators</b> employing a bilayer elec- trolyte of gadolinia-doped ceria and erbia-stabilized bismuth ox- ide (ESB) for NASA's future exploration of Mars. The results showed that oxygen could be reliably produced from CO 2 at temperatures as low as 400 C. The strategy discussed here for advanced life support systems employs a catalytic layer com- bined with a COG cell so that CO 2 is reduced all the way to solid carbon and oxygen without carbon buildup on the COG cell and subsequent deactivation...|$|R

It uses canisters of solid lithium perchlorate, which are burned to create gaseous oxygen. Each canister can supply the oxygen needs of one crewmember for one day.|$|E
50|$|Advances in {{technology}} have provided industrial <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator</b> systems for use where air is available {{and a higher}} concentration of oxygen is desired. Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) incorporates a material called molecular sieve for gas separation. In the case of oxygen generation a zeolite-based sieve forces preferential adsorption for nitrogen. Clean, dry air is passed through the sieve beds on the <b>oxygen</b> <b>generator,</b> producing an oxygen-enriched gas. Nitrogen separation membrane equipment is also used.|$|E
