500|$|Evil Dead-actor Bruce Campbell was Kripke's {{first choice}} {{to portray the}} character. However, Campbell was unavailable, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan {{eventually}} received the role. Due {{to the fact that}} Morgan's scene in the pilot episode takes place 22 years before the series, Morgan expected to be replaced by an older actor for subsequent episodes. Being only 12 years older than Jensen Ackles, who portrays the eldest son Dean, Morgan was surprised when he was asked to reprise the role. Ackles and Jared Padalecki often teased him about the age difference during filming. Throughout the season, Morgan became frustrated at times due to his character's avoidance of his sons, stating, [...] "It pissed off everybody, it pissed off us as actors, it pissed off the audience watching, because none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> knew where we were gonna go." [...] However, he reasoned that John's motivation for his actions was due to having knowledge that nobody else had.|$|E
500|$|Absence as a lyrical {{theme is}} common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also {{explored}} unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt {{with the loss of}} youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: [...] "The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling." [...] Waters commented: [...] "it's about none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> being there... should have been called Wish We Were Here".|$|E
2500|$|The band's {{first song}} written {{together}} was [...] "Conspiracy", which was later used on their debut album. At this time, they were touring the southeast, usually {{being driven by}} Williams' parents. She commented that [...] "Back then, I guess we were all thinking, after school we'll go {{to the house and}} practice. It was what we loved to do for fun, and still do! I don't think any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> knew this {{would turn out to be}} what it's become." ...|$|E

5000|$|Cử {{felt that}} Diệm was not focused enough on {{fighting}} the Vietcong, but was preoccupied with maintaining power. He criticised the Americans {{for their support}} for Diệm, which he felt had stifled the war effort, saying [...] "I felt that the Americans had slammed the door on those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who <b>really</b> wanted {{the fight against the}} Communists." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{new album}} {{is made of}} 11 metal songs from which two singles stand out: ‘Confession’ and ‘Strongest of Them All’. To the band’s rhythm guitarist Diogo Cardão “ODDS AND LIES is a deeply {{emotional}} record for all <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> We're <b>really</b> proud <b>of</b> this work and can't wait {{to go out on}} tour and share it with everyone!” ...|$|R
2500|$|On October 11, 2002, Hagel, {{along with}} 76 other Senators, {{voted in favor}} of the Iraq Resolution. Hagel, a later critic of the war, commented on his vote authorizing {{the use of force against}} Iraq saying, [...] "How many <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> know and {{understand}} much about Iraq, the country, the history, the people, the role in the Arab world? I approach the issue of post-Saddam Iraq and the future of democracy and stability in the Middle East with more caution, realism, and a bit more humility." ...|$|E
2500|$|Droste and Bear were {{subsequently}} joined by bass guitarist and producer Chris Taylor, and performed four shows {{together as a}} three-piece. Regarding these shows, Droste noted, [...] "We've never played without the four <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> <b>really.</b> The first couple shows we did before we knew Dan , we did with three of us {{and they kind of}} sucked. From the get-go, when we were trying to put together a live show, that's when we discovered our sound and that's why I think {{that was the beginning of}} the band." ...|$|E
2500|$|The studio {{increased}} the budget from $6.7 to $8.7 million and gave Linklater {{six months to}} finish the film. Pallotta took charge and instituted a more traditional Disney-esque production ethic that included a style manual, strict deadlines, and breaking the film up into smaller segments. The animation process lasted 15 months. Linklater said, {{in regard to the}} post-production problems, [...] "There's a lot of misinformation out there... Changes took place during the early stages <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> getting going on this had everything to do with management and not art. It was a budgetary concern, essentially." ...|$|E
5000|$|Paul Petersen, {{a former}} child actor and {{president}} of A Minor Consideration—an organization that deals with issues affecting child actors—stated: [...] "Speculations as to the underlying cause of this tragedy are exactly that: speculations. It serves no purpose to leap to conclusions for none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> will <b>really</b> know what led Jonathan to his decision to take his life." ...|$|R
60|$|This thing {{ran along}} until some <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> the <b>really</b> very best {{boys in the}} organization, decided that these corrupt {{practices}} must stop, and {{for the purpose of}} stopping them we organized a third party. We had a name, but we were never known by that name. Those who didn't like us called us the Anti-Doughnut party, but we didn't mind that.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{reorganization}} {{and before the}} national publicity, 8 of 11 freshman women who received invitations to join Delta Zeta during formal recruitment chose not to become members. One said, [...] "We all got together and talked about it and tried to have an open mind. But all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were <b>really</b> against what they did, and we didn't want {{to be associated with}} it." ...|$|R
2500|$|A poll in late May 1988 {{found that}} a {{majority}} of voters were not concerned with whether or not a candidate had a controversial member within their family - a reference to Rosenberg's brother Erhard. The poll, conducted by Chapman University's Chapman College Survey group for The Orange County Register, showed Cox leading in the Republican primary with 15 percent to Rosenberg's 13 percent. 57 percent of voters polled were undecided. Of those that were decided, 36 percent supported Cox, while 30 percent supported Rosenberg. [...] "I think the undecideds will break out {{along the lines of the}} people who have already decided," [...] he said. [...] "We'll get the lion's share. The momentum is all going in the right direction," [...] said Cox. Rosenberg commented on the large number of undecided voters: [...] "What it points out is none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> has gotten our message out," [...] he said. [...] "Not one candidate has been strong enough to break out of the pack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowling {{has stated}} that Harry's {{character}} flaws include anger and impulsiveness; however, Harry is also innately honourable. [...] "He's not a cruel boy. He's competitive, and he's a fighter. He doesn't just lie down and take abuse. But he does have native integrity, which makes him a hero to me. He's a normal boy but with those qualities most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> admire." [...] For the most part, Harry shows humility and modesty, often downplaying his achievements; though he uses a litany of his adventures as examples of his maturity early in the fifth book. However, these very same accomplishments are later employed {{to explain why he}} should lead Dumbledore's Army, at which point he asserts them as having just been luck, and denies that they make him worthy of authority. After the seventh book, Rowling commented that Harry has the ultimate character strength, which not even Voldemort possesses: the acceptance of the inevitability of death.|$|E

2500|$|In his Introduction to the Exhibition of Beauford Delaney opening December 4, 1964 at the Gallery Lambert, James Baldwin wrote, [...] "the {{darkness}} of Beauford's beginnings, in Tennessee, many years ago, was a black-blue midnight indeed, opaque {{and full of}} sorrow. And I do not know, nor will any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> ever <b>really</b> know, what kind of strength it was that enabled him to make so dogged and splendid a journey." ...|$|R
60|$|And yet, {{notwithstanding}} all this, neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> ever <b>really</b> {{became a}} Bostonian. We never got beyond {{a feeling for}} the beauty, the picturesqueness and the charm of our surroundings. The East caused me to cry out in admiration, {{but it did not}} inspire me to write. It did not appeal to me as my material. It was rather as a story already told, a song already sung.|$|R
5000|$|The title, [...] "No Gravity" [...] {{comes from}} the feeling that musicians feels while playing. [...] "The further we know and {{dominate}} the rational and mathematical part of the music, the intuitive parts take control <b>of</b> <b>us</b> and <b>really</b> take <b>us</b> to 'travel' with the music we're playing. It's {{this point that the}} musician wanna hit the people, but he must achieve with himself first. For this feeling I have chosen this term: 'No Gravity'" ...|$|R

6000|$|We hear a {{great deal}} about repentance, and how {{necessary}} it is for a man to repent of his sins; for unless a man repent, he cannot be forgiven. But do we all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> know what repentance means? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} a flash," [...] said Marjorie. [...] "We have intimations. Neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> understands.

5000|$|Though, Dubois' {{opposition}} to polygamy {{seems to have}} been born out of convenience: [...] "Those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who <b>really</b> understood the situation were not nearly so much opposed to polygamy as we were the political domination of the church. We realized however that we could not make those who did not come actually in contact with it understand what this political domination meant. We made use of polygamy in consequence as our great weapon." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "each one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> has {{a system}} of his own.

60|$|I don't {{know whether}} any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> grasp {{what we are}} saying when we talk of greater {{educational}} efficiency in the future.

500|$|Foster {{talked about}} Hannibal in an {{interview}} with Total Film in late 2005. She said: [...] "The official reason I didn't do Hannibal is I was doing another movie, Flora Plum. So I get to say, in a nice dignified way, that I wasn't available when that movie was being shot... Clarice meant so much to Jonathan and I, she really did, and I know it sounds kind of strange to say {{but there was no way}} that either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> could <b>really</b> trample on her." ...|$|R
2500|$|Alice Bailey: [...] "But those <b>of</b> <b>us</b> who <b>really</b> {{studied it}} {{and arrived at}} some {{understanding}} of its inner significance have a basic appreciation of the truth that no other book seems to supply. HPB said that the next interpretation of the Ageless Wisdom would be a psychological approach, and , which I published in 1925, is the psychological key to The Secret Doctrine. None of my books {{would have been possible}} had I not at one time made a very close study of The Secret Doctrine." ...|$|R

I know the Nebraska widow does, for she says that unless you have genius it isn't the least use.

I know he does behind our backs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We did not suspect at first, sahib. We quite {{took you}} {{for one of}} ourselves. No, the cheerfulness with which you bore your hardships, and your {{readiness}} to assist anyone, surprised us.

None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>really</b> understands consciousnesses with their outsides all hulled off as John is doing with those seeds which he drops into the basin.

5000|$|By December 2005, {{the band}} had written five songs for The Suffer & the Witness. The {{rest of the}} songs were written in January 2006, in a {{practice}} space in West Side, Chicago. McIlrath noted that the band procrastinated writing the songs for several weeks, leaving them with only a three-week period in which to write the entire album. The band was not affected by this added pressure however; according to McIlrath: [...] "It went great, the songs just flowed out <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> There were <b>really</b> few questions and the song lyrics would just come out <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> it went <b>really</b> well and everyone really liked them."
