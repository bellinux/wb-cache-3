5|$|A {{statutory}} {{board is}} an autonomous {{agency of the}} Government that is established by an Act of Parliament and overseen by a government ministry. The Act sets out the purposes, powers and rights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency.</b> Unlike ministries and government departments that are subdivisions of ministries, statutory boards may not be staffed by civil servants and have greater independence and flexibility in their operations. They are managed by boards of directors whose members usually include businessmen, professionals, senior civil servants and officials of trade unions. The Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), the Central Provident Fund Board (CPF), the Housing and Development Board (HDB), the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), the Land Transport Authority (LTA), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the National Heritage Board (NHB), and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) are all statutory boards.|$|E

5|$|In late May 1938, Chandler's {{campaign}} manager publicly claimed that federal relief agencies—especially the Works Progress Administration—were openly working for Barkley's re-election. Although the WPA administrator in Kentucky denied the charges, veteran reporter Thomas Lunsford Stokes launched {{an investigation of}} the agency's activities in the state and eventually raised twenty-two charges of political corruption in a series of eight articles covering the Barkley-Chandler campaign. Federal WPA administrator Harry Hopkins claimed an internal investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> refuted all but two of Stokes' charges, but Stokes was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1939 for his investigation. In the wake of the investigation Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939 to limit the WPA's involvement in future elections.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Allied air raids that crippled aircraft production, Adolf Hitler authorised {{the creation of a}} Jägerstab, a governmental task force composed of Reich Aviation Ministry, Armaments Ministry and SS personnel. Its aim was to ensure the preservation and growth of fighter aircraft production. The task force was established by the 1 March 1944 order of Speer, with support from Erhard Milch of the Reich Aviation Ministry. Speer and Milch {{played a key role in}} directing the activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency,</b> while the day-to-day operations were handled by Chief of Staff Karl Saur, the head of the Technical Office in the Armaments Ministry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency,</b> {{the only means of}} {{transportation}} were bullock-carts known as jhatkas along with palanquins. The roads connecting Madras to Calcutta in the north and the kingdom of Travancore in the south served as lines of communication during wars. From the early 20th century onwards, bullock-carts and horses were gradually replaced by bicycles and motor vehicles, while motor buses were the main means of private road transportation. Presidency Transport and the City Motor Service were pioneers, operating buses manufactured by Simpson and Co. as early as 1910. The first organised bus system in Madras city was operated by Madras Tramways Corporation between 1925 and 1928. The 1939 Motor Vehicles Act imposed restrictions on public-owned bus and motor services. Most of the early bus services were operated by private agencies.|$|E
5|$|Just Cause 2 is a third-person action-adventure game {{in which}} players control Rico Rodriguez, a major {{operative}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agency,</b> {{in an effort to}} overthrow the island dictatorship of Panau: an open world for players to explore. The game has three types of missions. Agency missions advance the story and are the game's main campaign; faction missions task players to assist the game's three factions, and stronghold missions task players to infiltrate government bases and liberate them for the factions. To advance through the campaign missions a player must earn chaos points, a progression system introduced in the game. Players earn chaos points for completing missions and destroying designated government property. As the number of chaos points increases, the factions gain influence and the government begins to collapse. In addition to typical missions, Just Cause 2 has race challenges which give players cash.|$|E

5|$|On November9, {{an area of}} disorganized convection, or thunderstorms, persisted about 1175km (730mi) {{southeast}} of Palau. The system consisted of a broad circulation, affected to its detriment by moderate wind shear. Moving west-northwestward, the convection persisted and organized into the circulation, indicative of an increased potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Late on November10, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA), meaning the agency anticipated a tropical depression would develop within 24hours. Shortly thereafter, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Zoraida after the system entered its area of responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency.</b> At 1200UTC on November11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated that a tropical depression formed about halfway between Palau and the Philippine island of Mindanao, although operationally the agency had classified the system two days prior.|$|E
5|$|In September 1985, the Board of Governors of the World Bank {{endorsed}} the Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. MIGA was established and became operational on April 12, 1988 {{under the leadership}} of then-Executive Vice President Yoshio Terasawa, becoming the fifth member institution of the World Bank Group. MIGA initially had $1 billion ($1.94 billion in 2012 dollars) in capital and 29 member states. All members of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) were eligible to become members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency.</b> MIGA was established as an effort to complement existing sources of non-commercial risk insurance for investments in developing countries, and thereby improve investor confidence. The agency's mandate to be apolitical has been said to be an advantage over private and national risk insurance markets. By serving as a multilateral guarantor, the agency reduces the likelihood of confrontations among the investor's country and the host country.|$|E
