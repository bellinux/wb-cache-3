The winners of these three-game series advance to the Final Stage to face each league's regular-season champion in a six-game series, which the regular-season champion starts with a one-game advantage.

5|$|Bears may mark {{territory}} by rubbing against {{trees and}} other objects which may serve to spread their scent. This is usually accompanied by clawing and biting the object. Bark may be spread around {{to draw attention to}} the marking post. Pandas are known to mark objects with urine and a waxy substance from their anal glands. Polar bears leave behind their scent in their tracks which allow individuals to keep track of <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> the vast Arctic wilderness.|$|E

Rather, these two elements contrast sharply with <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> an immaterial balance.|$|E

In Russian LARP events, weapons made of hard plastic, metal or wood are used. The alternative to using simulated weapons is to pause role-play and determine the outcome of an action symbolically, for example by rolling dice, playing rock-paper-scissors or comparing character attributes.|$|E

5|$|A third North American genus called Stegomus {{was named}} by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1896. Marsh had a long-time rivalry with Cope {{that was made}} famous in the Bone Wars of the late 19th century, {{in which the two}} tried to out-compete <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> the field and in {{scientific}} literature. Unlike Cope's aetosaurs, Stegomus was found from the eastern United States in Connecticut. Marsh also recognized Stegomus as an aetosaur rather than a phytosaur in his initial description of the genus. Like Cope, many paleontologists tended to consider aetosaur scutes to belong to phytosaurs during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Andriamasinavalona died in 1710 {{when one}} of his wives, Rasolomananambonitany, {{inadvertently}} pushed him from the elevated bed where they slept. He was buried in the royal tombs located at the Rova of Antananarivo. In opposition to Andriamasinavalona's intentions, after the king's death his sons forsook the concept of unity and instead fought <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> an effort to expand their realms. As a consequence of this decision, Imerina fragmented and was wracked with conflict for 77 years, until the kingdom was once again united during the reign of Andrianampoinimerina (17871810).|$|E

5|$|By nightfall {{some of the}} {{remaining}} French ships had entered Donegal Bay with Canada, Melampus and Foudroyant still in pursuit. The two forces repeatedly passed <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> the dark, and Canada almost drove ashore. Back at the battle site, Warren had ordered Robust to tow Hoche into Lough Swilly—this order later came under criticism, as Robust was in a battered state herself and the storms of the previous week had not abated. When a gale struck the pair on 13 October, Hoche lost several masts and broke her tow, only being prevented from foundering by the combined efforts of the British prize crew and their French prisoners. Eventually, on 15 October, Doris appeared and took Hoche in tow, arriving in Lough Swilly without further incident a few days later. Meanwhile, Ethalion saw Bellone safely into port, and Magnanime and Amelia brought in Coquille and Embuscade respectively.|$|E
5|$|Following {{two decades}} of uneasy peace, Britain and France {{declared}} war against <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> 1689. Despite the 1669 Treaty of Whitehall, in which European forces agreed that Continental conflicts would not disrupt colonial peace and neutrality, the war was fought primarily by proxy in New France and New England. The British of New York prompted local Iroquois warriors to attack New France's undefended settlements. While the British were preparing to engage in acts of warfare, the inhabitants of New France were ill-prepared to defend against the Indian attacks” due to {{the isolation of the}} farms and villages. Denonville was quoted as saying “If we have a war, nothing can save the country but a miracle of God,”.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Montreal-based {{publisher}} Drawn and Quarterly {{began with}} an anthology title also named Drawn and Quarterly. It quickly picked up {{a number of other}} titles, such as Julie Doucet's semi-autobiographical, bilingual Dirty Plotte, which, like Yummy Fur, had started out as a minicomic; Seth's Palookaville; illegal resident from the US Joe Matt's Peepshow; and Yummy Fur, which made the jump with its twenty-fifth issue. At the time, an autobiographical comics trend took place. Brown, Seth and Matt in particular were thought of as a Toronto comics rat pack, depicting <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> their comics and doing signings and interviews together.|$|E

As a result, it was announced in January 2010 that a single-elimination tournament would be held to determine a new champion. The tournament began on the January 4 episode of Raw, when Maryse advanced to the semi-finals by defeating Brie Bella. She was followed into the semi-finals by Gail Kim, Alicia Fox, and Eve, who defeated Jillian Hall, Kelly Kelly, and Katie Lea Burchill respectively. In the semi-finals, Maryse defeated Eve and Kim defeated Fox. It was then announced on the February 8 episode of Raw that Maryse and Kim would face <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> the final at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, several {{historians have}} noted that within the Gaelic-language genealogies and praise-poetry {{concerning}} the MacLeods, Leod's great-grandfather's name appears to equate to the Old Norse Ölvir, Olvér; rather than the Old Norse Óláfr. There {{are considered to be}} four significant Gaelic-language genealogies which concern Leod's ancestry. These pedigree roughly agree with <b>one</b> <b>another</b> <b>in</b> the three generations after Leod. The greatest similarity between these genealogies are the names of Leod's great-grandfather, variously spelt Oilmoir, Olbair Snaige, Olbuir Snaithe, and Olbair Snoice. Taking into account variances in spelling, these names are now considered to represent the literary Gaelic Olbhar, and the vernacular Gaelic Olghair; both which are in turn forms of Ölvir.|$|E
5|$|In the July 15, 2008 Democratic primary election, Jones won a {{plurality}} of votes in the Democratic primary.

On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin {{by a margin of}} 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the runoff.|$|E
