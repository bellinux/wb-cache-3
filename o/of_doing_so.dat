5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E

40|$|<b>Do</b> <b>so</b> {{anaphora}} is {{a fairly}} widely used in English, but has received relatively little treatment in the literature (especially when compared with verb phrase ellipsis). There are, how- ever, two aspects of this anaphor that have gained prominence: i) its use as a test for constituency within the verb phrase, and ii) the semantic restriction it places on its antecedent. Though these two properties {{have been the most}} prominent, their analyses have not been uncontroversial. In this dissertation, I investigate these properties and give them a more complete analysis. The first part of the dissertation is devoted to a discussion of the the use <b>of</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> as a test for constituency in the verb phrase, and the second part is devoted to understanding the semantic restriction that <b>do</b> <b>so</b> places on its antecedent. The behavior <b>of</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> anaphora has been used to argue both hierarchical structure (Lakoff and Ross 1976) and flat structure within the verb phrase (Culicover and Jackendoff 2005). In chapter 2, however, I argue that <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> not have any bearing on the debate about the internal structure of the verb phrase. The arguments put forth by these authors are predicated on <b>do</b> <b>so</b> being a surface anaphor in terms of Hankamer and Sag (1976). Instead I argue that <b>do</b> <b>so</b> is in fact a deep anaphor and that its purported surface anaphor properties fall out from independent semantic and pragmatic properties of the anaphor. As a deep anaphor, <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> not replace any structure in the verb phrase, but rather forms a verb phrase in its own right {{from the beginning of the}} derivation. Therefore, the use <b>of</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> to argue for or against hierarchical structure in the verb phrase has been misguided. I approach the semantic restriction that <b>do</b> <b>so</b> places on its antecedent from two angles. In chapter 3, I review the previous analyses of this restriction, and test their claims against a corpus of over 1000 naturally occurring examples extracted from the American National Corpus. None of the previous analyses are supported by the data, and I present a novel analysis that utilize three semantic parameters (agentivity, aktionsart, stativity) to predict which antecedents are possible with <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> One striking property of the counterexamples found in the corpus is that they instantiate particular syntactic structures. The majority <b>of</b> them contain <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in a nonfinite form (usually in the infinitive), and in others, the antecedent is contained in a relative clause modifying the subject <b>of</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> In chapter 4, I present experimental evidence that shows that these two syntactic environments lessen the effects of the restriction that <b>do</b> <b>so</b> normally places on its antecedent. I attribute this amelioration of the semantic restriction to the unavailability of verb phrase ellipsis in these syntactic environments. The analysis falls out from the nonmonotonic interaction of the two restrictions: the syntactic restrictions on ellipsis force the use <b>do</b> <b>so</b> to the detriment of the semantic restriction that <b>do</b> <b>so</b> normally places on its antecedent. I then situate this amelioration effect into the typology of coercion effects in general and argue that <b>do</b> <b>so</b> displays a novel type of coercion: subtractive coercion...|$|R

5|$|At {{the time}} Nixon {{took office in}} 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7percent—its highest rate since the Korean War. The Great Society had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> was to end the war. This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency). According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through {{the first year of}} his presidency.|$|E
5|$|Based {{around the}} {{overflow}} of volunteers for the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, {{a core of}} personnel for a second Southern Rhodesian expeditionary unit was in place by November 1914. This was made into the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment (2RR) during December 1914 and January 1915. The 1st Rhodesia Regiment's lack of combat experience thus far influenced those men in Southern Rhodesia who were yet to enlist; many Rhodesian colonials were keen to fight on the front lines, and some resolved {{that they might have}} to travel to Europe to be sure <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b> Aware of this competition with the Western Front for the colony's manpower, recruiters for the 2nd Rhodesia Regiment took great care to assure potential inductees that they would definitely see combat, in Africa, if they signed up for the new unit. The 2nd Rhodesia Regiment ultimately had a paper strength of 500 men, the same as the 1st. Thirty black scouts, recruited in Southern Rhodesia, were also attached to the regiment.|$|E

Armstrong Whitworth plated over the openings for the undelivered elevators on the flight deck (which had been cancelled when they could not meet the specifications), finished the rear funnel, removed the torpedo tubes, and plated over the forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to the Royal dockyard at Portsmouth for the modifications necessary for the trials on 20April 1920. Only two of her boilers, converted to run on fuel oil only, could be used during the trials.|$|E

Eventually the cathedral chapter was allowed to perform an election, and Blois was elected about 6 July 1203 and consecrated on 24 August 1203 at Canterbury. The consecration was performed by William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise, the Bishop of London, because Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury was ill and unable to perform the service which would normally have been his right.|$|E
