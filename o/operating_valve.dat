Three valve configurations are considered: open orifice, open valve, and <b>operating</b> <b>valve.</b> Measurements of axial and tangential velocity components have been taken at various axial and radial positions for one compression ratio (7 : 1) and one rpm level (31). The measurements show that the intake stroke (in both two and four stroke operations) result in a recirculating flow with substantial turbulence generation even at the low rpm value. The four-stroke results in an axisymmetric design are novel and especially significant since the ability exists to make comparisons with theoretical, axisymmetric, turbulent results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Pressure {{safety relief}} valve is the key {{component}} in any system where pressure rising could be hazardous to safety of the workers as well as plant. Though electronically operated safety controls are there, but {{to take care of}} any malfunctioning in it, mechanically operated relief valve is necessary. In oil refinery sector, safety is of prime important. The clay canisters are used to refine the oil. Sometimes these canisters get clogged and pressure rising may take place. The key requirement of process is to relieve this pressure rise in no time. Conventional valves are unable to fulfill that requirement. This paper focuses on design and analysis of an emergency safety valve by Design by Analysis (DBA) approach. From the data given by the client, suitable valve is designed using FEA. The working environment is hazardous & explosive; hence ASME code is used to design. This valve is a onetime <b>operating</b> <b>valve</b> used as tertiary safety arrangement for critical applications...|$|E

It comprises about 20 % of the city’s water-distribution network and serves a population of some 60, 000 from two sources. The hydraulic simulation model of the network has 126 pipes, 112 nodes, 9 storage tanks, 1 <b>operating</b> <b>valve</b> and 17 pumps in 5 discrete pumping stations. The complex energy tariff structure changes with hours of the day and days of the year. For a dynamically rolling operational horizon of 24 h ahead, the real-time, near-optimal control strategy is calculated by a software package that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer with an artificial neural network (ANN) predictor, the latter having replaced a conventional hydraulic simulation model to achieve the computational efficiency required for real-time use. This paper describes the Haifa-A hydraulic network, the ANN predictor, the GA optimizer and the demand- forecasting model that were used. Thereafter, it presents and analyses the results obtained for a full (simulated) year of operation in which an energy cost saving of some 25 % was achieved in comparison to the corresponding cost of current practice. Conclusions are drawn regarding the achievement of aims and future prospects...|$|E
40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Tier 4 Emission control versus {{conventional}} engine {{design is}} what every design engineer???s challenge {{to be dealt}} with. To design an engine to current market standards and requirements has become very intricate. In order to make such an explicit design which meets the standards, every component of the engine plays as a vital role. Every component design and development to current engineering standards pushes the envelope of manufacturability to new limits, which constraints {{the cost of the}} product across the ease of manufacturability of it. In consideration of the complexity to be attained, every component design contributes to the existence of a complete standardized engine, such as integrated valve cover. With the new tier 4 final regulations for engine manufactures, every new engine produced needs to meet those regulations. Caterpillar Inc regulated to produce tier 4 final compatible engines for the market. The new drive for development of new engines identified the objective of this project to design a new integrated breather valve cover for large power engines. Valve Cover, the noun by name explains it covers valves. In explanation to the definition of the valve cover, it covers the cylinder head mechanism;this is a high speed <b>operating</b> <b>valve.</b> Valve Cover not only covers the head mechanism and should also be persistent to pressure, stress and heat dissipated during the operation of the engine. Valve cover design initiates and explains the intricacy of a complete engine design. All the functional requirements of valve cover would be designed, analyzed and validated in this project, that drive the process of execution of the project to several phases of product development. Process identified for execution initiates with correct manufacturing technique, design intent and analysis. Caterpillar Inc. Engineering standards have been taken as a reference for defining all form fit functions. Pro engineering, Abaqus, Gambit and Fluent are the computer aided design tools used in this project for the execution of design intent. Identification of a proper manufacturing technique, processed execution of design requirements and analysis of concepts of design are validated across the requirements in this project with a justification of value added solutions are notified in the project.

In this article, we present a novel {{pressure wave}} generator design based on cam <b>operated</b> <b>valves</b> for use with pulse tube refrigerators.

In a single stage double inlet pulse tube using this type of pressure wave generator, refrigeration power of about 6 W at 77 K and a no load temperature of about 42 K were obtained. The above results are comparable to those obtained with pulse tube systems based on other two types of pressure wave generators. While the rotary valve based pressure wave generator is prone to developing leaks at the rotating seal, the solenoid valve based system cannot be operated continuously due to coil failure. The cam <b>operated</b> <b>valve</b> based pressure wave generator overcomes the above shortfalls of rotary valve and solenoid valve type pressure generators and is well suited for continuous operation of the refrigerator...|$|R
