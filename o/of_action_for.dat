40|$|Abstract: This paper copes with freight {{transport}} network design, {{particularly in the}} selection of the most feasible set of infrastructure projects. The problem involves investment planning, which can be transformed to a combinatorial optimisation problem of identifying and selecting the best set <b>of</b> feasible <b>actions</b> from a number <b>of</b> possible <b>actions.</b> A mathematical model is developed within the framework of bi-level programming problem, where a multimodal multi-user assignment technique is incorporated within the lower level problem and the combination <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> capacity expansion is optimised using genetic algorithm-based procedures in the upper level problem. Model application to the actual {{freight transport}} network in Indonesia reveals that the model can adequately select the best combination <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> <b>for</b> designing the optimal multimodal freight network...|$|R
