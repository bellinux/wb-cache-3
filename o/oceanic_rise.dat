40|$|Abstract (First part: Volcanic, tectonic and oceanic systems). The simple {{application}} {{of the principle of}} the constancy of the average power to the examined volcanic, tectonic and oceanic systems, has allowed the long term forecasting of their critical state. The same results were obtained by means of the {{application of the}} Palumbo map and of its orbit. Both the models emphasize the importance of small events in releasing energy and thence in procrastinating and reducing the intensity of the extreme events. When a system is in a critical state small external excitations may trigger a catastrophe. Such external sources have been identified and their triggering effects were verified in the occurrence of many large events when they were in critical state. These triggering forces are: earth tides, geomagnetic tides, solar activity and seismic waves. Earth tides trigger earthquakes, but their effects may be evidenced on]y on local sìtes. When many globally distributed earthquakes are considered no significant effect is discernible, since any effect is blurred by a multiplicity of unidentified fault orientations and stress regimes. The same does not hold for geomagnetic tides. The significant correlation obtained between geomagnetic tides and large scale earthquakes Is thus attributed to a magnetostrictive effect caused by the external geomagnetic fields and their variations (see the paper: Gravitational and geomagnetic tidal sources of earthquakes triggering). Such an effect may also explain the significant correlation obtained between the large scale earthquakes frequency and the solar activity related to geomagnetic activity. Seismic waves may trigger local earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, when they are in critical states. These has been proved for volcanic eruptions of Vesuvius, and recently for the anomalous frequency of large earthquakes following the very intense event of December 26 th in SE Asia. (Second part: a way to explode the myth of green house effect). Ten years ago, there was an international alert caused by the anthropogenic depletion of the ozone layer. It was shown that the phenomenon was due to natural sources (See book n. 1 : L’Ecosistema Terra… [...] ) and yet nowadays nobody talks about it any more. The same will happen for the green house effect. The global circulation models are not reliable, and the satellite observations show that the increase of global air temperature is very doubtful, mainly because the historical series of data were almost taken from the records of town stations largely affected by the urban heat island effect. We now propose two different mechanisms to explain the Sun-climate relationship: (i) max solar activity = > min ìncoming cosmic radiation => min clouds and their albedo => max T; (ii) max solar activity and max dynamo in the interior of Earth => max sea surface temperature=> max evaporation => max T. Moreover we will show that the elastic response of the climate system to the last little age, the large increase of solar activity, going on since the last two centuries, and the recent decrease of the largest volcanic eruptions are responsible for the secular variation of the observed global air temperature ‘T”. This would show a negligible influence of the other sources, Iike the green effect. On the other hand, should the greenhouse effect be actual, the increase would be even over than 3 °C in 2050, with an increase never recorded {{in the history of the}} Earth, that, therefore, could cause a catastrophe. Some geo-engineering remedies are proposed. The recent secular <b>oceanic</b> <b>rise,</b> attributed by the literature to the increase of green house gas concentration in the atmosphere, is found to be due to the rainfall, to the volcanic eruptions, to the fires and to the mankind waste water discharged in the oceans. Again, should the circulation models proposed by the literature be proved, then an increase around 30 cm should be expected in the next decades, with severe consequences for littorals areas like Venice and the mouths of the Nile...|$|E
40|$|The global ridge {{system is}} {{dominated}} by <b>oceanic</b> <b>rises</b> reflecting large variations in axial depth associated with mantle hotspots. The little studied Marion Rise is {{as large as the}} Icelandic, considering length and depth, but has an axial rift rather than a high nearly its entire length. Uniquely, along the SW Indian Ridge systematic sampling allows direct examination of crustal architecture over its full length. Unlike Iceland, peridotites are extensively exposed high over the rise. This shows for the 1 st time that the crust is generally thin, and often missing over a rifted rise. Thus the rise must be largely an isostatic response to ancient melting events that created low-density depleted mantle beneath the ridge rather than thickened crust and/or a large thermal anomaly. The likely origin for the depleted mantle is that emplaced into the African asthenosphere during the Karoo and Madagascar flood basalt events.

40|$|The low {{velocity}} zone in tectonic and oceanic regions is too pronounced to be {{the effect}} of high temperature gradients alone. Partial melting {{is consistent with the}} low velocity, low Q and abrupt boundaries of this region of the upper mantle and is also consistent with measured heat flow values. The inferred low melting temperatures seem to indicate that the water pressure is sufficiently high to lower the solidus about 200 ° C to 400 ° C below laboratory determinations of the melting point of anhydrous silicates. The mechanical instability of a partially molten layer in the upper mantle is probably an important source of tectonic energy. The top of the low-velocity zone can be considered a self-lubricated surface upon which the top of the mantle and the crust can slide with very little friction. Lateral motion of the crust and upper mantle away from <b>oceanic</b> <b>rises</b> is counterbalanced by the flow of molten material in the low-velocity layer toward the rise where it eventually emerges as new crust.

Research conducted during the 25th cruise of the R/V Dmitriy Mendeleyev indicates that the deep sea sediments covering the Zenith Plateau consist of calcareous ooze. One core, core 2036, recovered during that cruise penetrated 3 m of rather compact light pale yellow pelitic, coccolith-foraminiferal ooze. Radiocarbon dating of samples from the upper 50 cm of the core yielded dates ranging from 9790±750 to greater than 28,500 years radiocarbon. The average sedimentation rate calculated for sediments in this core is 4.1 mm to 4.3 mm per thousand years. According to these rates and the core description, the sediments covering this plateau are likely well-consolidated and possibly quite stiff.|$|R

We have assumed starting materials, beginning with mantle peridotite beneath the <b>oceanic</b> <b>rises,</b> and a series of processes involving partial fusion of mantle peridotite, crystallization, hydration, solid-solid phase transformations, dehydration, and partial fusion of the diverse materials in the subducted oceanic crust. Experimental petrology makes possible the testing of models and determination of the pressures and temperatures for the operation of these processes. Water is an important component. For processes at the oceanic ridges we do not know how much water is juvenile and how much is introduced from the ocean. The hydrated oceanic rocks are subducted and then dehydrated, but there remains some uncertainty about whether this water is carried deep enough to participate in the generation of calc-alkaline magmas, and possibly juvenile water is involved.

We suggest that the Tamu Massif could be the largest single volcano on Earth and that it is comparable in size to the largest volcano in the Solar System, Olympus Mons on Mars.

The integration of satellite telemetry, remotely sensed environmental data, and habitat/environmental modelling has provided for a growing understanding of spatial and temporal ecology of species of conservation concern. The Republic of Cape Verde comprises the only substantial rookery for the loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta in the eastern Atlantic. A size related dichotomy in adult foraging patterns has previously been revealed for adult sea turtles from this population with a proportion of adults foraging neritically, whilst the majority forage oceanically. Here we describe observed habitat use and employ ecological niche modelling to identify suitable foraging habitats for animals utilising these two distinct behavioural strategies. We also investigate how these predicted habitat niches may alter under the influence of climate change induced <b>oceanic</b> temperature <b>rises.</b> We further contextualise our niche models with fisheries catch data and knowledge of fisheries 'hotspots' to infer threat from fisheries interaction to this population, for animals employing both strategies. Our analysis revealed repeated use of coincident oceanic habitat, over multiple seasons, by all smaller loggerhead turtles, whilst larger neritic foraging turtles occupied continental shelf waters. Modelled habitat niches were spatially distinct, and under the influence of predicted sea surface temperature rises, there was further spatial divergence of suitable habitats. Analysis of fisheries catch data highlighted that the observed and modelled habitats for oceanic and neritic loggerhead turtles could extensively interact with intensive fisheries activity within oceanic and continental shelf waters of northwest Africa. We suggest that the development and enforcement of sustainable management strategies, specifically multi-national fisheries policy, may begin to address some of these issues; however, these must be flexible and adaptive to accommodate potential range shift for this species.

New structural data from the Nakasib suture show that the suture had evolved through three phases of deformation which gave rise to a fold and thrust belt. During the early two phases of deformation, SE-verging tight folds and thrusts were developed. The third phase of deformation refolded the earlier structures into NE-trending, upright, and horizontal antiforms and synforms and culminated in the development of NW-verging thrusts. The structural data are used, together with previous stratigraphic and geochemical data, to suggest a tectonic model for the evolution of the Nakasib suture. The suture followed a Wilson Cycle.

The joint inter- disciplinary project MERAMEX (Merapi Amphibious Experiment) was carried out to characterize the subduction of the Indo-Australian plate beneath Eurasia. Three marine wide-angle profiles are analyzed by combined forward- and inverse modeling of first and later arrival traveltimes and are integrated to- gether with gravity data. The {{results of this study}} are compared with former investigations off southern Sumatra, western Java and eastern Java to obtain a detailed image of the Java margin. The subduction of the <b>oceanic</b> Roo <b>Rise</b> plateau, located south of central Java, with its thickened and buoyant crust, strongly influences subduction dynamics. The trench is retreated about 60 km in a land- ward direction. Large scale forearc uplift is manifested in isolated forearc highs, reaching water depths of only 1000 m compared to 2000 m water depth off western Java, and results from oceanic basement relief subduction. The dip angle of the underthrusting oceanic lithosphere is 10 ◦ underneath the marine forearc and its crustal thickness increases eastward from 9 - 10 km over a distance of 100 km between both dip profiles off central Java, which is thicker than the global average of 7. 4 km. The incipient subduction of a broad band of seamounts off central Java causes frontal erosion of the margin here and leads to mass wasting due to oversteepening of the upper trench wall. The well-developed accretionary wedge off southern Sumatra and western Java diminishes into a small frontal prism with steep slope angles of the upper plate off central Java. This causes a persistent threat for generating tsunamis, which may also be triggered by smaller (Mw 8) earthquakes. The rough surface of the Indo-Australian plate with its volcanic edifices strongly influences the interplate coupling. A subducted and dismembered seamount is revealed on the eastern profile at the toe of the backstop in 15 km depth. This seamount and similar features present on the megathrust may potentially act as asperities or as barriers to seismic rupture, limiting lateral rupture propagation in the co-seismic phase.

The models, run in a centrifuge, consist of a lighter silicone (LDS), rising within a denser silicone (HDS) below a brittle layer simulating the oceanic lithosphere. Pre-cut fractures in the brittle layer simulate the initial configuration of <b>oceanic</b> ridges. The <b>rise</b> and lateral spreading of the LDS induce the propagation, widening, interaction and linkage of the fractures. We varied the offset and overlap between the fractures, obtaining 10 distinctive types of interaction. Variations in fracture overlap and offset define several interaction types. Increase of fracture overlap leads to interaction zones of lower aspect ratio, with fractures propagating at lower angles to the mean extension direction. Increase of offset leads to the elongation of the interaction zones with the new fractures propagating subparallel to the extension direction. The comparison with several examples of natural ridges shows close geometric similarities, confirming the existence of predominant types of ridge interaction. Among these, ridges with smaller offsets develop interactions similar to overlapping spreading centers, whereas ridges with larger offsets have geometries reminiscent of transform zones. The comparison between experimental and natural examples suggests that the observed wide spectrum of ridge interaction types in nature results from the initial configuration of the divergent plate boundary...|$|R

For nonlinear geophysical problems and in the presence of multiple local minima for a cost function, global optimization techniques are necessary to characterize the global minimum solution. Stochastic, model-based seismic inversion is a widely used global optimization technique and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is a natural choice to sample model parameters during the random walk. In this dissertation, I apply a sampling technique called reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (rjMCMC) to traverse the model space. A key property of this approach is that it automatically changes the layer thicknesses and number of layers, thereby predicting the optimum number of model parameters during inversion. The method applies Bayesian inversion, with rjMCMC sampling, so that it also quantifies the uncertainty in model parameters based on an ensemble of models. I apply Bayesian inversion with rjMCMC sampling for two applications. In the first application, I define upscaling velocity logs as an inversion problem to obtain optimal models and quantify uncertainty of upscaled models at the well location. The upscaled velocity at the well locations can be subsequently used to stabilize velocity inversion during Full waveform Inversion (FWI) for seismic imaging purposes. In the second application, I perform post-stack seismic inversion to obtain shallow impedance structure of the TAMU and Ori volcanoes at the Shatsky <b>Rise</b> <b>oceanic</b> plateau.

We analyse the basic properties controlling CO 2 export within the diffusive boundary layer around marine animals in an ocean changing in temperature (T) and CO 2 concentration in order to compare the challenges posed by O 2 uptake under stress with the equivalent problem of CO 2 expulsion. The problem is more complex than that for a nonreactive gas, since with CO 2 the influence of the seawater carbonate acid-base system needs to be considered. These reactions significantly facilitate CO 2 efflux compared to O 2 intake at equal temperature, pressure and fluid flow rate under typical oceanic concentrations. The effect of these reactions can be described by an enhancement factor, similar to that widely used for CO 2 invasion at the sea surface. While organisms do need to actively regulate flow over their surface to thin the boundary layer to take up enough O 2, this seems to be not necessary to facilitate CO 2 efflux. Instead, the main impacts of <b>rising</b> <b>oceanic</b> CO 2 will most likely be those associated with classical {{ocean acidification}} science. Regionally, as with O 2, the combination of T,P and pH/pCO 2 creates a zone of maximum CO 2 stress at around 1000 m depth...|$|R
40|$|Oceanic {{plateaus}} {{are large}} igneous provinces formed by extraordinary eruptions that create thick oceanic crust, whose structure is poorly known {{owing to the}} lack of deep-penetration seismic data. Multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection and wide-angle refraction data allow us to show Moho structure beneath {{a large part of the}} Shatsky <b>Rise</b> <b>oceanic</b> plateau in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Moho reflectors in the two data sets can be connected to trace the interface from the adjacent abyssal plain across much of the interior. The reflectors display varied character in continuity, shape, and amplitude, similar to characteristics reported in other locations. Beneath normal crust, the Moho is observed at similar to 13 km depth (similar to 7 km below the seafloor) in MCS data and disappears at similar to 20 km depth (similar to 17 km below the seafloor) beneath the high plateau. Moho at the distal flanks dips downward towards the center with slopes of similar to 0. 5 degrees- 1 degrees, increasing to 3 degrees- 5 degrees at the middle flanks. Seismic Moho topography is consistent with Airy isostasy, confirming this widely-applied assumption. Data from this study show that crustal thickness between the massifs in the interior of the plateau is nearly twice normal crustal thickness, despite the fact that this crust records apparently normal seafloor spreading magnetic lineations. The Moho model allows improved estimates of plateau area (5. 33 x 10 (5) km(2)) and volume (6. 90 x 10 (6) km(3)), the latter assuming that the entire crust was formed by Shatsky Rise volcanism because the massifs formed at spreading ridges. This study is unique in showing Moho depth and structure over an extraordinarily large area beneath an oceanic plateau, giving insight to plateau structure and formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{geophysical}} data from two RV METEOR cruises M 6 - 6 (1988) and M 9 - 4 (1989) in the Equatorial South Atlantic {{was used to}} investigate the genesis of reflections in analogue and digital echosounder records. Analogue black-white paper records of the PARASOUND echosounder system (Krupp Atlas Elektronik) enable a qualitative description of sedimentation- and erosion processes. Three profiles from the Western African continental rise show a decreasing sharpness of the reflection pattern with increasing biogenie productivity and sedimentation rate. Echosounder records from pelagic regions like Walfish Ridge, Angola and Guinea Basin, Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Brasil Basin show clearly stratified reflection patterns, interrupted by topographie highs. Measurements of sediment physical properties on gravity cores allow to calculate synthetic seismogramms and to compare them with analogue PARASOUND echograms and digital PARASOUND seismograms. Detailled core descriptions enable to evaluate the influence of lithologie variations on the reflection patterns in the echosounder records. Acoustic properties like acoustic impedance and reflectivity are mainly controlled by P-wave velocity and wet bulk density. Therefore the dependance of these two parameters on porosity, carbonate and sand content was investigated. Physical properties allow to distinguish between five types of sediment from different depositional environments (continental <b>rise,</b> <b>oceanic</b> highs, deep-sea basins). Terrigeneous turbidite layers produce strong reflection horizons in synthetic seismograms. Smaller variations of the acoustic impedance are caused by carbonate, silt or sand content. Since the carbonate content is linked to glacial/interglacial cycles, acoustic impedance and reflection patterns can contain paleoclimatic signals. Generally {{there is a good}} correlation between the synthetic seismograms and analogue and digital PARASOUND records. Additionally, synthetic seismograms and digital echosounder signals provide some semi-quantitative information relating to the amplitudes of reflections, whereas the PARASOUND paper records alone merely shows the energy distribution with depth above a certain threshold level...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{work has}} made it {{possible}} to obtain two new Na/Li geothermometric relationships in addition to the three already known (Fouillac and Michard, 1981; Kharaka et al., 1982) and confirms that the Na/Li geothermometer, unlike the Na/K, Na/K/Ca, K/Mg and silica geothermometers, or the isotope δ 18 O (H 2 O-SO 4) geothermometer, also depends on the fluid salinity {{and the nature of the}} reservoir rocks reacting with the geothermal water. One of the relationships concerns the fluids derived from seawater-basalt interaction processes existing in emerged rifts such as those of Iceland (Reykjanes, Svartsengi, and Seltjarnarnes geothermal fields) and Djibouti (Asal-Ghoubbet and Obock geothermal areas), or in numerous <b>oceanic</b> ridges and <b>rises</b> (Mid-Atlantic and Middle-Valley ridges, East Pacific rise, etc.). The best adapted Na/Li relationship for geothermal fluids discharged from emerged rifts between 0 and 365 °C is: T(K) = 920 /[log(Na/Li) − 1. 105] (r 2 = 0. 994; n = 27) where Na and Li are the aqueous concentrations of these elements given in mol/L. The other Na/Li relationship was determined using dilute waters collected from wells located in different hightemperature (200 - 325 °C) volcanic geothermal areas of Iceland (Krafla, Námafjall, Nesjavellir and Hveragerdi). This relationship can be expressed as follows: T(K) = 2002 /[log(Na/Li) + 1. 322] (r 2 = 0. 967, n= 17). These two relationships give estimations of temperature with an uncertainty close to ± 20 °C. The second Na/Li relationship was also successfully applied to HT dilute geothermal waters from the East African Rift (Ethiopia, Kenya). Some case studies in the literature and thermodynamic considerations suggest that the Na/Li ratios for this type of fluids could be controlled by full equilibrium reactions involving a mineral assemblage constituting at least albite, K-feldspar, quartz and clay minerals such as kaolinite, illite (or muscovite) and Li-micas. Unlike the Na/Li ratios, no thermometric relationship using Li isotopes could be determined for this type of water. However, it was noticed that δ 7 Li values higher than 16 ‰ are always associated with low- to medium-temperature waters...|$|R
40|$|Two older {{granitic}} {{rocks and}} some selected Quaternary volcanic rocks from the Japanese Islands were analyzed in a reconnaissance {{study for the}} purpose of examining the relationships between Nd and Sr isotopic abundances and the megatectonic structure around the Japanese Islands. Model ages of ∼ 0. 9 AE were determined by the Nd and Sr methods on a Paleozoic gneiss which confirms that a relatively ancient acidic basement exists in the Japanese Islands. The Nd and Sr isotopic data show that the Cretaceous granodiorite is the result of partial melting of older crust. The Nd of tholeiitic rocks from the Izu arc gives ε_(Nd) ranging from 8. 3 to 9. 3 and with the corresponding ε_(Sr) from − 14. 5 to − 18. 5. These results are identical to those found for the Mariana arc. These values are distinctly lower than typical MORB by around 1 ∼ 2 εu. This difference in ε_(Nd) between arcs and MORB is attributed to the contribution of oceanic sediments to the partial melts produced during subduction of oceanic crust. The Hakone volcano is clearly confirmed as belonging to an oceanic source by Nd isotopic results. ε_(Sr) -ε_(Nd) values of the volcanics from a section along the Fossa Magna show a clear indication that they are a blend of oceanic mantle material and continental crustal material. The crustal component clearly increases in going from south to north. Volcanics across the Northeast Japan arc also show a distinct correlation of ε_(Sr) -ε_(Nd) related to the position relative to the active subduction zone but with the opposite trend. These relationships of the present isotopic pattern and the zonal arrangement relative to the subduction zone suggest the former existence of a local spreading center in the Japan Sea. In general there appear to be regular isotopic relationships between the Izu-Mariana oceanic island arc and the continental island arc of Japan which indicates that partially melted or assimilated older continental basement is admixed with young <b>rising</b> <b>oceanic</b> arc magmas...|$|R
40|$|The 30 % {{decrease}} in atmosphericarbon dioxide during glacial maxima must {{be driven by}} some change in the chemicalcirculation of the ocean. Here, a new model for late Quaternary CO 2 variability is presented which resolves some problems occurring in previous models (including the timing of carbon dioxide response {{and changes in the}} oxygen content of the deep ocean). The primary driving factor in this model is a rearrangement of chemical distributions in the ocean whereby labile nutrients and metabolic CO 2 are concentrated in deep waters rather than in intermediate waters as observed in the modern ocean. This new "bottom-heavy " chemical structure does not affect atmosphericarbon dioxide directly. Instead, CO 2 -induced acidity lowers the deep ocean carbonate ion concentration and temporarily increases carbonate dissolution rates. <b>Oceanic</b> alkalinity then <b>rises</b> until the deep ocean carbonate ion is restored to its steady state value. The resulting increase in oceanic alkalinity draws CO 2 out of the atmosphere into the ocean. Alkalinity and atmospheric CO 2 lag several thousand years behind the change in oceanic chemical structure; this delayed response is determined by the limited rate of continental weathering and deep ocean carbonate dissolution relative to the oceanic alkalinity inventory. It is proposed that characteristic deglacial and preglacial states of the ocean are leading factors driving glacial-interglacial climate changes. This concept reinterprets the carbon isotope contrast between surface water and deep waters [Aõ 13 C(P-B) ] as due to a shift of light metabolic carbon from intermediate waters into deep waters. The process is illustrated here by a simple equilibrium five box ocean model. The observed intermediatedepth nutrient depletion is not sufficient in itself to determine which of several possible mechanisms are operating, and some mechanisms are not as effective in changing atmospheric CO 2 as others. The largest response is seen from deepening the regeneration cycle of organi carbon; the least response is seen from converting North Atlantic Deep Water into intermediate water...|$|R
40|$|Thermometers such as Silica, Na/K, Na/K/Ca, Na/K/Ca/Mg or delta 18 O (H 2 O-SO 4), {{based on}} {{empirical}} or semi-empirical laws derived from chemical equilibrium reactions between water and minerals {{in the deep}} reservoirs, are commonly used in geothermal exploration in order to estimate the reservoir temperatures. Unfortunately, these estimations are not always concordant because of processes which can perturb the chemical composition of the fluids during their ascent {{up to the surface}} (water mixing, fluid cooling, etc.). Given these discordances, auxiliary thermometers such as Na/Li, based on statistical relationships, were also developed. As Li is rather lowly reactive, the use of this thermometer can give more reliable temperature estimations. Presently, three different Na/Li relationships ([1], [2]) are mainly available according to the fluid salinity and the geological environment (volcanic/granitic and sedimentary rocks). This study carried out in the framework of the European HITI project (HIgh Temperature Instruments for supercritical geothermal reservoir characterization and exploitation) with the collaboration of ISOR Iceland Geosurvey proposes two new Na/Li thermometric relationships. The first concerns the fluids derived from high-temperature seawater-basalt interaction processes existing in the <b>oceanic</b> ridges and <b>rises</b> {{as well as in the}} emerged rifts such as those of Iceland (Reykjanes, Svartsengi and Seltjarnarnes geothermal fields) and Djibouti (Asal-Ghoubbet and Obock geothermal areas). It can be expressed as follows: Log (Na/Li in mol/l) = 920 /(T°K) + 1. 105 (r 2 = 0. 994). The second relationship, developed using dilute fluids collected only from Icelandic geothermal wells in the 100 - 325 °C range and surprisingly close to that determined by Fouillac and Michard (1981) for volcanic saline fluids at temperatures higher than 200 °C, is: Log (Na/Li in mol/l) = 1786 /(T°K) - 0. 936 (r 2 = 0. 976). The uncertainty on temperature estimation is ± 25 °C for both relationships. These results confirm that the Na/Li ratios not only depend on temperature but also on other parameters. The nature of the reservoir rocks and fluid seems to be the most influent one. Some case studies in the literature and thermodynamic considerations suggest that the Na/Li ratios could be controlled by chemical equilibrium reactions involving different mineral assemblages where illite and micas would be, however, always presen...|$|R
40|$|The facies architecture, {{sedimentary}} {{dynamics and}} palaeogeographic evolution were reconstructed {{for a number}} of middle–late Frasnian carbonate mounds from {{the south side of the}} Dinant Synclinorium (Belgium). Nine facies were recognized in the buildups, each characterized by a specific range of textures and assemblage of organisms: spiculitic wackestone with stromatactis (facies Pm 1), which becomes progressively enriched in crinoids and corals (Pm 2); grey or pinkish limestone with stromatactis, corals and stromatoporoids (A 3 –L 3, Pm 3); grey limestone with corals, peloids and dasycladales (A 4 –L 4, Pm 4); grey, microbial limestone (A 5 –L 5, Pm 5); grey limestone with dendroid stromatoporoids (A 6 –L 6); grey, laminar fenestral limestone, (A 7 –L 7); and grey, bioturbated limestone (A 8 –L 8). Sedimentological evidence suggests that facies Pm 1 and Pm 2 correspond to iron bacteria– sponge-dominated communities, developing in a quiet aphotic and hypoxic environment. A 3 –L 3 developed between storm and fair-weather wave base, in an oligophotic environment. Facies A 5 –L 5 developed close to fair-weather wave base. Facies A 6 –L 6 and the fenestral limestone A 7 –L 7 correspond to an environment with slightly restricted water circulation. Facies A 8 –L 8 developed at subtidal depths in a quiet, lagoonal environment. The main differences between the middle and late Frasnian mounds concern facies architecture, and are a consequence of different palaeoceanographic settings. The large flattened middle Frasnian Arche and Lion buildups show limited vertical differentiation, large-scale progradation features, extensive exportation of material towards off-reef environment and development of inner lagoonal facies. They grew offshore from a well-developed carbonate platform with a healthy carbonate factory. Middle Frasnian sea-level fluctuations were relatively mild, and sedimentation was able to keep up with sea-level rise. At the opposite extreme, during the late Frasnian, severe eustatic rises, together with <b>rising</b> <b>oceanic</b> hypoxic conditions, were responsible for frequent collapses of the carbonate factory, drowning of the middle Frasnian carbonate platform, and development of buildups with relatively limited lateral extension, high vertical facies differentiation, low potential for material exportation and high content in microaerophilic iron bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Shatsky Rise {{is one of}} {{the largest}} oceanic plateaus, a class of {{volcanic}} features whose formation is poorly understood. It is also a plateau that was formed near spreading ridges, but the connection is unclear. The geologic structure and morphology of Shatsky <b>Rise</b> <b>oceanic</b> plateau provides key observations that can help understand its formation. Deep penetrating 2 D multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection profiles and high-resolution multi-beam sonar data were acquired over the southern half of Shatsky Rise on R/V Marcus G. Langseth during two cruises. The MCS profiles allow us to image Shatsky Rise's upper crustal structure and Moho structure with unprecedented detail, and the multi-beam bathymetry data allow us to produce an improved bathymetric map of the plateau. MCS profiles and bathymetry data show that two of the volcanic massifs within Shatsky Rise are immense central volcanoes. Tamu Massif, the largest (~ 450 ? 650 km) and oldest (~ 145 Ma) volcano, is a single central volcano with rounded shape and shallow flank slopes (< 0. 5 o- 1. 5 o), characterized by lava flows emanating from the volcano center and extending hundreds of kilometers down smooth, shallow flanks to the surrounding seafloor. Ori Massif is another large volcano that is similar, but smaller in size than Tamu Massif. The morphology of the massifs implies formation by extensive and far ranging lava flows emplaced at small slope angles. The relatively smooth flanks of the massifs imply that the volcanoes were not greatly affected by rifting due to spreading ridge tectonics. Several down-to-basin faults observed on the flanks of the massifs are not parallel to magnetic lineations, suggesting that they were not formed by seafloor spreading. The Moho of Shatsky Rise starts shallow (~ 6 - 7 km) beneath normal crust at the distal flanks and dips (~ 3 o- 5 o) towards the center of plateau massifs, reaching maximum thickness of ~ 30 km. Shatsky Rise crustal structure is consistent with the Moho topography of isostatically compensated crustal structures, which is why the plateau exhibits a small free-air gravity anomaly signature. Shatsky Rise was built on young oceanic lithosphere with little rigidity, so the plateau formed in isostatic equilibrium with a deep crustal root...|$|R
