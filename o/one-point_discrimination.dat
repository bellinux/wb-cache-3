40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} nipple-areola complex sensation at 48 -month follow-up following superolateral pedicled reduction mammaplasty using the pressure-specified sensory device. Methods: Data regarding nipple-areola complex sensation for static and moving one- and two-point discrimination were collected from 30 active group hypertrophic-breasted patients undergoing superolateral pedicled reduction mammaplasty preoperatively, at 6 months, and at 48 months, and from a control group of 30 unoperated women with normal-sized breasts. Breast volume was assessed using the BREAST-V instrument. Results: For the nipple, static <b>one-point</b> <b>discrimination</b> showed that mean pressure thresholds for the active group at 48 months were 4. 10 and 4. 19 times higher than preoperatively and in the control group (p < 0. 001), respectively; moving <b>one-point</b> <b>discrimination</b> showed that mean pressure thresholds for the active group at 48 months were 4. 08 and 3. 23 times higher than preoperatively and in the control group (p < 0. 001), respectively. For the areola, static <b>one-point</b> <b>discrimination</b> showed that mean pressure thresholds in the active group at 48 months were 4. 12 and 4. 83 times higher than preoperatively and in the control group (p < 0. 001), respectively; moving <b>one-point</b> <b>discrimination</b> showed that mean pressure thresholds from the active group at 48 months were 4. 56 and 4. 46 times higher than preoperatively and in the control group (p < 0. 001), respectively. Conclusions: Despite a slight worsening at 6 months after surgery, patients who had undergone superolateral pedicled reduction mammaplasty showed significant nipple-areola complex sensibility reduction at 48 -month follow-up. Although the nipple-areola complex of hypertrophic-breasted patients was seen to be nonsignificantly less sensitive than normal-sized breasts, a significant decrease of sensation was observed following reduction mammaplasty.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The authors {{performed}} a prospective study quantifying nipple-areola complex sensibility by computer-assisted neurosensory testing in breast hypertrophy {{before and after}} superolateral breast reduction. METHODS: A superolateral pedicle breast reduction was performed on 30 macromastia patients. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 46 years. The cup sizes of the patients were as follows: D, 14 patients; E, 12 patients; and EE, four patients. Ptosis was 3 degrees in 12 and 4 degrees in 18; nipple elevation ranged from 4 to 18 cm; glandular resection ranged from 379 to 1850 g. Static and moving one- and two-point discrimination was tested preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively at the nipple-areola complex, evaluating the impact of breast hypertrophy (D versus E and EE cups), nipple elevation (< 9 cm versus ≥ 9 cm), and glandular resection (< 900 g versus ≥ 900 g). RESULTS: Statistical analyses revealed preoperatively significant higher pressure thresholds in the nipple-areola complex of larger versus smaller hypertrophies and in the nipple of longer nipple-areola complex transposition breasts for static and moving <b>one-point</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Postoperatively, worsening of sensibility was more significant in the nipple-areola complex of smaller versus larger hypertrophies and of shorter versus longer nipple-areola complex transposition breasts for moving <b>one-point</b> <b>discrimination.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that macromastia patients present a reduced breast sensibility, which is not necessarily worsened by reduction mammaplasty. After reduction mammaplasty with the superolateral pedicle technique, nipple-areola complex sensibility might be slightly reduced, which is less detectable in large-breast hypertrophy because of lower preoperative levels of sensibility and less of a postoperative decrease. © 2007 American Society of Plastic Surgeons...|$|E
40|$|The deep {{inferior}} epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap {{is considered}} the definitive standard for autologous breast reconstruction because {{of its ability to}} restore shape, its consistency, and its static and dynamic symmetry, but the degree of spontaneous sensory recovery is still widely discussed. To clarify the real need for sensitive nerve coaptation, return of sensibility in DIEP flaps was investigated using a pressure-specifying sensory device. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients with breast cancer scheduled for modified radical mastectomy, axillary node dissection, and immediate reconstruction with cutaneous-adipose DIEP flaps without nerve repair were enrolled in the study. Sensibility for one and two points, static and moving, was tested preoperatively on the breasts and abdomen, and postoperatively at 6 and 12 months on the DIEP flaps. A t test was used for comparison of paired data and to investigate which factors affected sensory recovery. RESULTS: Preoperative healthy breast and abdomen pressure thresholds were lower for two-point than <b>one-point</b> <b>discrimination</b> and for moving discriminations compared with static ones at 6 and 12 months. Although they were significantly higher than those for contralateral healthy breasts (p < 0. 05), pressure thresholds in DIEP flaps at 12 months were lower than at 6 months, showing a significant progressive sensory recovery (p < 0. 05). At 12 months postoperatively, the best sensibility recovery was found at the inferior lateral quadrant, the worst at the superior medial quadrant. Age and flap weight were factors related to the performance of sensory recovery. CONCLUSIONS: DIEP flap transfer for immediate breast reconstruction undergoes satisfactory progressive spontaneous sensitive recovery at 6 and 12 months after surgery, and operative time spent dissecting sensitive perforator branches and their coaptation in recipient site could be spared...|$|E
40|$|Background: Research has not {{adequately}} examined the potential {{negative effects of}} perceiving routine discrimination on general healthcare utilization or health status, especially among reproductive-aged women. We sought to evaluate the association between everyday discrimination, health service use, and perceived health among a national sample {{of women in the}} United States. Materials and Methods: Data were drawn from the Women's Healthcare Experiences and Preferences survey, a randomly selected, national probability sample of 1078 U. S. women aged 18 ? 55 years. We examined associations between everyday discrimination (via a standardized scale) on frequency of health service utilization and perceived general health status using chi-square and multivariable logistic regression modeling. Results: Compared with women who reported healthcare visits every 3 years or less (reference group), each <b>one-point</b> increase in <b>discrimination</b> score was associated with higher odds of having healthcare visits annually or more often (odds ratio [OR]?=? 1. 36, confidence interval [95 % CI]?=? 1. 01 ? 1. 83). Additionally, each <b>one-point</b> increase in <b>discrimination</b> score was significantly associated with lower odds of having excellent/very good perceived health (OR?=? 0. 65; 95 % CI?=? 0. 54 ? 0. 80). Conclusion: Perceived discrimination was associated with increased exposure to the healthcare setting among this national sample of women. Perceived discrimination was also inversely associated with excellent/very good perceived health status...|$|R
