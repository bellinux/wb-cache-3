2500|$|A second {{cylinder}} {{was added to}} Hyper No. 1 to make a horizontal-opposed engine for evaluation of an opposed-piston 12-cylinder engine. After running the modified engine with different combinations of cylinder bore and stroke, {{it was found that}} the high coolant temperatures required to maintain the required output were impractical.

This <b>one-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> was designated [...] "Hyper No. 2", and became the test bed for developing the cylinders that would become the Continental O-1430 ("O" [...] for [...] "opposed") engine. It would require a ten-year development period which changed the layout to first an upright V-12 engine and later, an inverted V-12 engine, before becoming reliable enough to consider for full production as the Continental I-1430 in 1943.|$|E

50|$|The American Junior {{was made}} by American Motor Vehicle Company of Lafayette, Indiana from 1916 to 1920. Also known simply as the American, it was an ultra-light two-seat vehicle with a <b>one-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b> It was mainly {{intended}} to be sold for children.

50|$|The first {{models were}} three-wheeler trucks {{derived from the}} Blitzkarren {{previously}} built by Borgward. The first passenger car was the Goliath Pionier in 1931, which still had three wheels and a <b>one-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b> Until 1934, 4,000 of these small cars were produced in various types of body. The Pionier was considered as a forerunner of the Hansa models 400 and 500.|$|E
5000|$|The {{three-wheeled}} Cyklon Cyklonette {{was made}} for 1902. It was a three-wheeler with a single wheel in the front to steer, and to provide propulsion from a 450 cc <b>one-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> mounted directly above it. This made the Cyklonette {{one of the earliest}} front-wheel drive cars. Power was [...] in the first models. Later models were equipped with a 1.3 L two-cylinder engine producing , though some had a straight-four.

5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1902 by Joseph Wyss and changed its name from Schweizerische Automobil Fabrik Berna (S.A.F.B.) to Motorwerke Berna AG in 1906.

Berna was also involved {{in the development of}} the Tank [...] "Nahkampfkanone 1" [...] Berna's first car, made in 1902, was the Berna Vis-à-Vis Idéal. Another model was powered by <b>one-cylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> which were placed on the rear. In 1903, a new car called the Unicum was produced with the engine placed on the front and the back wheels were powered by chains. By 1905, Berna was also building trucks/lorries.|$|R
5000|$|The Hanomag 2/10 PS was {{an economy}} car {{manufactured}} by Hanomag from 1924 to 1928. It {{was one of}} the first cars with envelope styling. It was affectionately referred to as the [...] "Kommissbrot" [...] or [...] "Loaf of Rye Bread" [...] due to its small squarish shape. The 2/10 PS (two taxable / ten brake horsepower) had a single-cylinder half litre engine at the rear. The rear axle was chain-driven, with no differential. With a fuel consumption of [...] it was the world's most fuel efficient mass-production car between the two World Wars due to the low-friction <b>one-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> and its very light weight.|$|E
50|$|By 1889, de Dion was {{becoming}} convinced the future {{lay in the}} internal combustion engine, and the company had built a ten-cylinder two-row rotary. After Trépardoux resigned in 1894, the company became De Dion, Bouton et Compagnie. For 1895, Bouton created a new 137 cc (8.4 in3) <b>one-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> with trembler coil ignition. Proving troublesome at its designed speed of 900 rpm (throwing bearings and running rough), when Bouton increased the revs, the problems vanished. In trials, it achieved an unprecedented 3500 rpm, and was usually run at 2,000 rpm, a limit imposed by its atmospheric valves and surface carburettor. Inlet and exhaust valves were overhead, and a flywheel was fitted to {{each end of the}} crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} King Midget was a single-passenger kit designed {{to resemble a}} midget racer. The kit included the chassis, axles, steering assembly, springs, instruction manual, plus dimensioned patterns for the sheet metal, all for a cost of $270.00. It would accept any <b>one-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b> By 1947, the Model 1 was also available in assembled form, powered by a 6 hp (4.5 kW) Wisconsin engine. Since adding a differential would have increased the cost, the car was driven by the right rear wheel only. It used a centrifugal clutch designed by Orcutt. The pair began to develop a two-passenger micro car in 1947. In total, nine separate prototypes were built until the designers met their goals of simplicity, lightness, and economy. The result was the Model 2.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the weight {{reduction}} and the achievement of a more homogeneous stress distribution of a <b>one-cylinder</b> <b>engine’s</b> crankshaft, developed for the Formula Student series. In order to achieve this goal, a series of static FEM analysis were performed on the crankshaft. For the FEM analyses, the critical loading and kinematic boundary conditions of the crankshaft were calculated with two different methods. The loads were determined analytically and were verified by Creo Mechanism software. The calculations were done for different engine speeds and- as a result-the critical engine speed, where the highest loads appear could be determined. An essential weight reduction and a more homogeneous stress distribution were achieved on the crankshaft {{as the result of}} FEM analysis...|$|R
