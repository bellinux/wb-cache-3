40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{continuation}} of the work started in [FG 92] on combining temporal logics. In this work, four combination methods are described and studied with respect to the transference of logical properties from the component <b>one-dimensional</b> temporal <b>logics</b> to the resulting two-dimensional temporal logic. Three basic logical properties are analysed, namely soundness, completeness and decidability. Each combination method is composed of three submethods that combine the lan-guages, the inference systems and the semantics of two <b>one-dimensional</b> temporal <b>logic</b> <b>systems,</b> generating families of two-dimensional temporal languages with varying ex-pressivity and varying degree of transference of logical properties. The temporalisation method and the independent combination method are shown to transfer all three basic logical properties. The method of full interlacing of <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> generates a consid-erably more expressive language but fails to transfer completeness and decidability in several cases. So a weaker method of restricted interlacing is proposed and shown to transfer all three basic logical properties. The connections of our work with more generic works on combininbg (any) <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> are unfortunately absent from the current version of this paper but will be present in its nal version. ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} work of using {{simulated}} annealing to design more efficient fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> to model problems with associated uncertainties. Simulated annealing is used within this work as a method for learning the best configurations of type- 1 and type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> to maximise their modelling ability. Therefore, it presents the combination of simulated annealing with three models, type- 1 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems,</b> interval type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> and general type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> to model four bench-mark problems including real-world problems. These problems are: noise-free Mackey-Glass time series forecasting, noisy Mackey-Glass time series forecasting and two real world problems which are: the estimation of the low voltage electrical line length in rural towns and the estimation of the medium voltage electrical line maintenance cost. The type- 1 and type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> models are compared in their abilities to model uncertainties associated with these problems. Also, issues related to this combination between simulated annealing and fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> including type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> are discussed. The thesis contributes to knowledge by presenting novel contributions. The first is a novel approach to design interval type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> using the simulated annealing algorithm. Another novelty {{is related to the}} first automatic design of general type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>system</b> using the vertical slice representation and a novel method to overcome some parametrisation difficulties when learning general type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems.</b> The work shows that interval type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> added more abilities to modelling information and handling uncertainties than type- 1 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> but with a cost of more computations and time.

This type of fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> is a significant improvement of the existing fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> of type 1. Fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> type 2 are based on the application of new interval fuzzy numbers that consider undetermined relative to classic fuzzy numbers in a better way.

Thereby, the existing methodology is used as a cornerstone in the developed model. Also, the model is significant for persons engaged in decision-making in other areas because it is a method that has not been extensively applied in science and practice, and whose development is at the beginning...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to discern the effects of introducing uncertainty representation into a set-based design process with applications in ship design. The hypothesis was that introduction of design uncertainty would enhance the facilitation of set-based design practices. A presentation of three fuzzy logic agent based methods for facilitation of set-based ship design practices is offered. The first method utilized a type- 1 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>system</b> to facilitate set-based design practices and possessed no uncertainty modeling. The next two methods included representation of design uncertainty in the set-based design space. Of these two methods, one utilized a novel approach that harnessed techniques of randomization to model an interval type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>system,</b> the other method made use of general type- 2 fuzzy logic methods that were well-known, but still relatively under-utilized in academics and industry when compared to type- 1 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems.</b> Comparisons of the newly developed fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> with each other, and the type- 1 agent based fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>system</b> provided the basis for conclusions as to the effects of introducing uncertainty modeling into a set-based design process. The results of this experimental research have shown that the inclusion of uncertainty modeling in the set-based design process for the negotiation of design variables enhances the overall set-based design progression, especially when working with highly constrained designs. In the case of a highly constrained design, the type- 1 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>system</b> was unable to promote set-convergence within the allotted experimental time without repeated design failures, while the use of uncertainty modeling allowed the interval type- 2 modeling and general type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> to achieve feasible set-based design convergence. When performing a simplistic, loosely constrained design, all three fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems</b> were capable of facilitating the principle practices of set-based design within the feasible solution space; specifically, the set-based practices of delaying design decisions and gradual reduction of the feasible solution space. This research has led to the enhancement of the set-based design process by providing capabilities to now represent uncertainty in the set-based design space though the use of either the newly developed interval type- 2 or general type- 2 fuzzy <b>logic</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
