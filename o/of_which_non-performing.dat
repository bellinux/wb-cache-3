It was an effort at resuscitating the bank. By all financial and operational yardsticks, the bank was in dire straits. Its total loan portfolio was ₦14.6 billion out <b>of</b> <b>which</b> 72% was <b>non-performing.</b> Within that category, ₦10.03 billion or 69% was classified as completely lost. This ensured the depletion of the bank's shareholders fund. It took considerable efforts to lay out the state of the affairs of the bank, as a result of poor record-keeping. In spite of a bloated staff headcount, significant skill gaps were identified in the system. Before his assumption of office, NEXIM Bank at that time lacked visibility in the banking and media spaces. All the woes can be summarized as resulting from ineffective risk management framework and non-adherence to corporate governance best practices.|$|R

The authors review cases in which countries employed alternative mechanisms to restructure their financial and corporate sectors. Countries typically apply a combination of tools, including decentralized, market-based mechanisms and government-managed programs. Market-based strategies seek to strengthen the capital base of financial institutions and/or borrowers {{to enable them to}} renegotiate debt and resume new credit supply. Government-led restructuring strategies often include the establishment of an entity to <b>which</b> <b>non-performing</b> loans are transferred or the government's sale of financial institutions, sometimes to foreign entrants. Market-based mechanisms can, in principle, resolve coordination problems countries face in the wake of massive debtor and creditor insolvency, with acceptably low direct and indirect costs, particularly when those mechanisms are effective in achieving the desirable objective of selectivity. However, these mechanisms depend for their success on an efficient judicial system, a credible supervisory framework and authority with sufficient enforcement capacity, and a lack of corruption in implementation. Government-managed programs may not seem to depend as much on efficient legal and supervisory institutions for their success, but in fact these approaches, in particular the transfer of assets to government-owned asset management companies, also depend on effective legal, regulatory, and political institutions for their success. Further, a lack of attention to incentive problems when designing specific rules governing financial assistance can aggravate moral hazard problems, unnecessarily raising the costs of resolution. These results suggest that policymakers in emerging market economies with weak institutions should not expect to achieve the same level of success in financial restructuring as other countries, and that they should design resolution mechanisms accordingly. Despite the theoretical attraction of some complex market-based mechanisms, simpler resolution mechanisms that afford quick resolution of outstanding debts, that improve financial system competitiveness, and that offer little discretion to governments are most effective.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{evolution}} of the Mexican economy between 1995 and 1998. The remarkable quick recovery seen in aggregate activity has not been uniform across the economy. The tradable sector has grown strongly, while the non-tradable sector has recuperated only sluggishly. This asymmetric response is intimately linked with the severe credit crunch that Mexico has experienced since 1995. Although fresh domestic bank lending dried up, tradable firms obtained financing in the international capital market. This was not the case in the non-tradable sector. A phenomenon that has gone {{hand in hand with the}} credit crunch is the steady increase in the share of non-performing loans. We analyze the reasons for this increase, the rationale for the partial bailout policy adopted in 1995, and we investigate why this policy stance did not solve the banking problem. An important lesson is that non-performing loans are unlikely to disappear on their own, even under a high GDP growth scenario. Furthermore, the existence of non-performing loans presents an obstacle for the banking system to adequately perform its functions. This raises the question of whether an alternative strategy under <b>which</b> all <b>non-performing</b> loans were recognized at once and the fiscal costs were all paid up-front would have been preferable. ...|$|R
