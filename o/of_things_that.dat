5|$|Leonardo {{was not a}} {{prolific}} painter, {{but he was a}} most prolific draftsman, keeping journals full of small sketches and detailed drawings recording all manner <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> took his attention. As well as the journals there exist many studies for paintings, some of which can be identified as preparatory to particular works such as The Adoration of the Magi, The Virgin of the Rocks and The Last Supper.|$|E
25|$|I believe President Bush {{is running}} deficits in Washington very deliberately. His {{plan is to}} finally run up so much debt that it inevitably creates {{pressure}} on the funding <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> count, {{in terms of the}} long-term strength of the society: educating kids, retirement security for American families. A mini version of that is going on in Sacramento.|$|E
25|$|Many Iranians use Divan of Hafez for fortune telling. Iranian {{families}} {{usually have}} a Divan of Hafez in their house, {{and when they get}} together during the Nowruz or Yaldā holidays, they open the Divan to a random page and read the poem on it, which they believe to be an indication <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> will happen in the future.|$|E

25|$|The art of divination is {{generally}} employed {{for the purpose}} of obtaining information that can guide the adept in his Great Work. The underlying theory states that there exists intelligences (either outside of or inside the mind of the diviner) that can offer accurate information within certain limits using a language of symbols. Normally, divination within Magick {{is not the same as}} fortune telling, which is more interested in predicting future events. Rather, divination tends to be more about discovering information about the nature and condition <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can help the magician gain insight and to make better decisions.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the most}} common places you will find women’s surfing would be California and Hawaii {{because they have the}} best {{conditions}} for surfing. Although you are able to surf in any place that has waves, surfing is mostly found all across the world from Peru, Australia, Indonesia, South Africa, France, Philippines, Ecuador, and anywhere else that has a shore and waves coming in. Although surfing can be found anywhere, there are a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> affect the waves. Tide, time of day, storms miles off shore, and weather can all affect the strength of the waves.|$|E

25|$|Because he {{was perhaps}} the philosopher most {{respected}} by European thinkers {{during and after the}} Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch. However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.|$|E
25|$|Forsyth's novels {{typically}} {{show the}} ways in which spies, gangsters, assassins, mercenaries, diplomats, business leaders and politicians go about their business behind the scenes; the sort <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> the average reader would not suspect while reading a simple headline. For example, the Jackal (The Day of the Jackal) does not simply attempt to shoot Charles de Gaulle. He prepares meticulously by researching his quarry at the British Museum library; he obtains papers for his various false identities; he travels around Paris to find a good location for a sniper's nest; he buys and tests his weapons; and so on.|$|E
25|$|Returning to São Paulo in 1922, Tarsila {{was exposed}} to many things after meeting Anita Malfatti, Oswald de Andrade, Mário de Andrade, and Menotti Del Picchia. Prior to her arrival in São Paulo from Europe, the group had {{organized}} the Semana de Arte Moderna ("Week of Modern Art") {{during the week of}} February 11–18, 1922. The event was pivotal in the development of modernism in Brazil. The participants were interested in changing the conservative artistic establishment in Brazil by encouraging a distinctive mode of modern art. Tarsila was asked to join the movement and together they became the Grupo dos Cinco, which sought to promote Brazilian culture, the use of styles that were not specifically European, and the inclusion <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were indigenous to Brazil.|$|E

25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
25|$|After Ying-Ying finally {{resolved}} {{her years}} of trauma, Lena shows Ying-Ying around her new apartment {{with her husband}} Harold (Michael Paul Chan), who is also Lena's boss. Ying-Ying learns that Lena is uncomfortable with her financial arrangements with Harold. They split the costs of their life evenly with a list <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they share, making their home life contentious. Seeing that Lena is unhappy with her marriage, Ying-Ying reasserts herself by knocking over {{a table in the}} bedroom and causing the vase to fall from the table and break. Hearing the sudden noise, Lena goes to her mother and admits her unhappiness. Ying-Ying replies that Lena should leave and not come back until Harold gives her what she wants. At June's farewell party, Lena is shown to have a new vibrant fiancé, who has given Lena what she wants and is accepting of Ying-Ying.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} framework {{has more}} recently been {{put forward by}} Wilken and Ma (2004) who suggest that apparent capacity limitations in VSTM are caused by a monotonic decline {{in the quality of}} the internal representations stored (i.e., monotonic increase in noise) as a function of set-size. In this conception capacity limitations in memory are not caused by a limit on the number <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can be encoded, but by a decline in the quality of the representation of each thing as more things are added to memory. In their 2004 experiments, they varied color, spatial frequency, and orientation of objects stored in VSTM using a signal detection theory approach (see also the closely related work by Palmer, 1990). The participants were asked to report differences between the visual stimuli presented to them in consecutive order. The investigators found that different stimuli were encoded independently and in parallel, and that the major factor limiting report performance was neuronal noise (which is a function of visual set-size).|$|E

500|$|I {{live the}} life that most would die for, but there's a lot <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> come with this life. People don't take that into consideration. There {{are a lot of}} things in this life that I would trade in a minute just for a slice of normalcy [...] I just listed a few things that they {{probably}} never viewed from that particular perspective. Because I think people need to see things another way; they need to see it other than just celebrity.|$|E
500|$|Ranged System - Ranged combat {{exists in}} nearly all LARP systems and is {{represented}} in different ways. Different types <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> could be seen within LARPs are; bows, crossbows, siege weapons, thrown weapons, , NERF guns, paintball guns, and Airsoft guns. Ranged weapons can fit into every combat system except the 'No-Touch' system. There are LARPs that are ranged combat only, although {{a majority of the}} rules widely vary, a majority of ranged only LARPs follow the base rule of one hit kill.|$|E

500|$|Beginning in February 2007, Nielsen {{began playing}} a small {{role as a}} doctor in the humorous yet {{educational}} television show Doctor*Ology. The show chronicles real-life medical techniques and technology, on the Discovery Channel. Nielsen said: [...] "There are any number <b>of</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> you think about when you ponder if you hadn't been an actor, what would you be, and I've always said I'd {{like to be an}} astronaut or a doctor.
