2500|$|So called [...] "new" [...] organs {{have been}} {{recently}} built, mainly from parts of other theatre organs, with some {{construction of new}} pipework, windchests and consoles. Among the largest of these are the 5-manual (keyboard), 80-rank (sets of pipes) organ at the Sanfilippo Residence in Barrington, Illinois; the 4-manual, 78-rank organ at the <b>Organ</b> <b>Stop</b> Pizza Restaurant in Mesa, Arizona; the 5-Manual 108-rank organ at the Adrian Phillips Residence in Phoenix, Arizona: and the 4-manual, 77-rank organ of the Nethercutt Collection at San Sylmar in Sylmar, California.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the song}} is in simple triple metre ( [...] time), but the chorus is in [...] time. The song modulates between musical keys, using the key of A major for verses, B major for the pre-chorus, and G major for the chorus. It is sung by Lennon over an {{increasingly}} complicated underlying arrangement which features a tamboura, played by George Harrison, lead electric guitar put through a Leslie speaker, played by Harrison, and a counter melody on Lowrey organ played by McCartney and taped with a special <b>organ</b> <b>stop</b> sounding [...] "not unlike a celeste". Session tapes from the initial 1 March 1967 recording of this song reveal Lennon originally sang the line [...] "Cellophane flowers of yellow and green" [...] as a broken phrase, but McCartney suggested that he sing it more fluidly to improve the song.|$|E
2500|$|Cocteau {{acknowledged}} {{in the introduction}} to the script that the play was motivated, in part, by complaints from his actresses that his works were too writer/director-dominated and gave the players little opportunity to show off their full range of talents. La Voix humaine was written, in effect, as an extravagant aria for Madame Berthe Bovy. Before came Orphée, later turned into one of his more successful films; after came La Machine infernale, arguably his most fully realized work of art. [...] La Voix humaine is deceptively simple — a woman alone on stage for almost one hour of non-stop theatre speaking on the telephone with her departing lover. It is full of theatrical codes harking back to the Dadaists' Vox Humana experiments after World War One, Alphonse de Lamartine's [...] "La Voix humaine", part of his larger work Harmonies poétiques et religieuses and the effect of the creation of the Vox Humana ("voix humaine"), an <b>organ</b> <b>stop</b> of the Regal Class by Church organ masters (late 16th century) that attempted to imitate the human voice but never succeeded in doing better than the sound of a male chorus at a distance.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} the stopped flute pipe (of which gedackt is a prime example) is almost as old as organ construction. As early as 1600, in Germanic <b>organs,</b> <b>stopped</b> flutes were common {{additions}} to the specification. Besides giving a distinct flute-like tone (in contrast to the more open and expressive tone of the diapason, the organ's basic voice) the stopped flutes offer a perfect ensemble stop for making combinations. Stopped flutes like the gedackt are extremely versatile in an organ specification. Certain types of <b>organ</b> <b>stops</b> {{go in and out}} of fashion over the centuries, but the stopped flute ranks like the gedackt are always present on instruments of all sizes. Even the very smallest pipe organs frequently have some form of stopped flute in the specification.|$|R
