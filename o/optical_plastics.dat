40|$|Micro {{structured}} <b>optical</b> <b>plastics</b> {{components are}} intensively used i. e. in consumer electronics, for optical sensors in metrology, innovative LED-lighting or laser technology. Injection moulding {{has proven to}} be successful for the large-scale production of those parts. However, the production of those parts still causes difficulties due to challenges in the moulding and demoulding of plastics parts created with laser structured mould inserts. A complete moulding of the structures often leads to increased demoulding forces, which then cause a breaking of the structures and a clogging of the mould. An innovative approach is to combine PVD-coated (physical vapour deposition), laser structured inserts and a variothermal moulding process to create functional mic 8 iuro structures in a one-step process. Therefore, a PVD-coating is applied after the laser structuring process in order to improve the wear resistance and the anti-adhesive properties against the plastics melt. In a series of moulding trials with polycarbonate (PC) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) using different coated moulds, the mould temperature during injection was varied in the range of the glass transition and the melt temperature of the polymers. Subsequently, the surface topography of the moulded parts is evaluated by digital 3 D laser-scanning microscopy. The influence of the moulding parameters and the coating of the mould insert on the moulding accuracy and the demoulding behaviour are being analysed. It is shown that micro structures created by ultra-short pulse laser ablation can be successfully replicated in a variothermal moulding process. Due to the mould coating, significant improvements could be achieved in producing micro structured <b>optical</b> <b>plastics</b> components...|$|E

Geometrical characterizations of the molded DOEs were demonstrated using different optical metrology techniques. The DOE molding experiments discussed in this paper were performed on a Toshiba GMP 211 V machine at the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology (IPT). The glassy carbon wafers used in this research were manufactured by Tokai Carbon Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The glassy carbon wafers were optically polished before the diffractive pattern was fabricated in the cleanroom. The proposed strategy for DOE fabrication has several inherited advantages over existing technologies. First, it is flexible in that there are several hundred optical glasses available versus only a few <b>optical</b> <b>plastics.</b> Second the molded DOEs can preserve the optical quality of the mold surfaces, therefore, no post molding processes are needed, i. e., it is a net shape manufacturing process. Third, this method {{can be applied to}} fabricating many different optical components thus making it a very powerful tool to mass produce various optical elements at low cost which opens the door for enhanced and more affordable optical systems.

To deal with bandwidth limitations of POF and IR links, a power-variable rate-adaptive low-density parity-check (LDPC) -coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme is used, while {{to deal with}} atmospheric turbulence, the spatial diversity is used.

40|$|An {{automotive}} headlamp {{is exposed}} to thermal variations together with low air exchange. The possibility of humidity entering the headlamp will therefore increase the risk for condensation to form on the lamps inner surface. The automotive industry today is highly competitive and tends {{to focus more on}} reducing costs together with consumers demanding more advanced features and styling characteristics such as transparent <b>optical</b> <b>plastics</b> and low energy emitting lamps. This will cause problems if dew is formed and visible from the outside. Physical testing and validation are not available until late in the development process and are expensive to perform. Therefore it is of great importance for the car manufacturer to be able to simulate the risk for condensation early in the design stage and thereby also reduce the cost. Thus, the goal in this thesis is to develop a numerical method with help of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) that will predict if and where condensation will form in an automotive headlamp. Engineers at Saab Automobile AB today rely fully on physical testing obtained from climate tunnel experiments, pushing the headlamp to its limits during extreme weather conditions and thereby visualizing the behavior of condensation. The purpose is to evaluate if a numerical method is possible to include the condensation phenomena and compare the dew pattern formed during the climate tunnel experiments to the numerical model. Furthermore, a numerical model was successfully developed and predictions of condensation were found to be within an acceptable range, though with a slight deviation. It was also found that the possible source of deviation may lie in how scattering of light is treated in the numerical model, foremost the boundary conditions governed by it. Hence, further work is imposed to solve this...|$|E
40|$|Presently, {{solar cells}} {{are covered with}} Ce-doped microsheet cover glasses that are {{attached}} with Dow Corning DC 93 - 500 silicone adhesive. Various antireflection coatings are often applied to the cover glass to increase cell performance. This general approach has been used {{from the beginning of}} space exploration. However, it is expensive and time consuming. Furthermore, as the voltage of solar arrays increases, significant arcing has occurred in solar arrays, leading to loss of satellite power. The cause has been traced to differential voltages between strings and the close spacing between them with no insulation covering the edges of the solar cells. In addition, this problem could be ameliorated if the cover glass extended over the edges of the cell, but this would impact packing density. An alternative idea that might solve all these issues and be less expensive and more protective is to develop a coating that could be applied over the entire array. Such a coating must be resistant to atomic oxygen for low earth orbits below about 700 km, it must be resistant to ultraviolet radiation for all earth and near-sun orbits and, of course, it must withstand the damaging effects of space radiation. Coating flexibility would be an additional advantage. Based on past experience, one material that has many of the desired attributes of a universal protective coating is the Dow Corning DC 93 - 500. Of all the potential <b>optical</b> <b>plastics,</b> it appears to be the most suitable for use in space. As noted above, DC 93 - 500 has been extensively used to attach cover glasses to crystalline solar cells and has worked exceptionally well over the years. It is flexible and generally resistant to electrons, protons and ultraviolet (UV and VUV) radiation; although a VUV-rejection coating or VUV-absorbing ceria-doped cover glass may be required for long mission durations. It can also be applied in a thin coating (< 25 m) by conventional liquid coating processes. Unfortunately, when exposed to atomic oxygen (AO) DC 93 - 500 develops a frosty surface. Such frosting can lead to a loss of light transmitted into the cells and destroy the essential clarity needed for a concentrator lens...|$|E
