5|$|Rothbard wrote {{extensively}} on Austrian business cycle theory {{and as part}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach,</b> strongly opposed central banking, fiat money, and fractional-reserve banking and advocated a gold standard and a 100% reserve requirement for banks.|$|E
5|$|The goal <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> is twofold: {{to enable}} deeper {{inspection}} of the code at compile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution, and to simplify processor design and reduce energy consumption by {{eliminating the need for}} runtime scheduling circuitry.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, even single neurons {{appear to}} be complex and capable of {{performing}} computations. So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources. However, the Human Brain Project is {{trying to build a}} realistic, detailed computational model of the entire human brain. The wisdom <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> has been publicly contested, with high-profile scientists {{on both sides of the}} argument.|$|E

5|$|The first stealth liposomes were passively {{targeted}} at tumor tissues. Because tumors induce rapid and uncontrolled angiogenesis they are especially “leaky” and allow liposomes {{to exit the}} bloodstream {{at a much higher}} rate than normal tissue would. More recently work has been undertaken to graft antibodies or other molecular markers onto the liposome surface in the hope of actively binding them to a specific cell or tissue type. Some examples <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> are already in clinical trials.|$|E
5|$|The {{practicality}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> {{is questionable}} with modern material science, but cannot yet be ruled out. A 100% reflective statite deployed around the Sun {{would have an}} overall density of 0.78 grams per square meter of sail. To illustrate the low mass of the required materials, consider that the total mass of a bubble of such material 1 AU in radius would be about 2.17 kg, {{which is about the}} same mass as the asteroid Pallas. Another illustration: Regular printing paper has a density of around 80 g/m2.|$|E

His dislike of the {{defensive}} nature of limited-over cricket led to the Australians placing a full slips cordon for the new ball and employing Test-match style tactics in the tournament.

5|$|One inefficient {{approach}} {{to finding the}} GCD of two natural numbers a and b is to calculate all their common divisors; the GCD is then the largest common divisor. The common divisors can be found by dividing both numbers by successive integers from 2 to the smaller number b. The number of steps <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> grows linearly with b, or exponentially {{in the number of}} digits. Another inefficient approach is to find the prime factors of one or both numbers. As noted above, the GCD equals the product of the prime factors shared by the two numbers a and b. Present methods for prime factorization are also inefficient; many modern cryptography systems even rely on that inefficiency.|$|E
5|$|People with {{hypothyroidism}} who do {{not feel}} well despite optimal levothyroxine dosing may request adjunctive treatment with liothyronine. A 2012 guideline from the European Thyroid Association recommends that support should be offered {{with regards to the}} chronic nature of the disease and that other causes of the symptoms should be excluded. Addition of liothyronine should be regarded as experimental, initially only for a trial period of 3 months, and in a set ratio to the current dose of levothyroxine. The guideline explicitly aims to enhance the safety <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>approach</b> and to counter its indiscriminate use.|$|E

TfL had {{announced that it would}} bid in late 2012 to have more involvement in these services after the expiration of Southeastern's franchise in early 2014, but the DfT announced in March 2013 that Southeastern's franchise was being extended until mid-2018.|$|E
