5|$|According to {{the initial}} description, the eye socket of Euchambersia is rather small. The {{branches}} of the postorbital and jugal that usually surround the back and bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> socket in therocephalians appear to be either very reduced or absent entirely. Meanwhile, the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> socket is formed by the prefrontal, and the frontal is also small. The skull does not bear a pineal foramen. Like Whaitsia, the pterygoid and palatine of the palate are not separated from the transpalatine, further {{to the side of}} the jaw, by any sort of opening.|$|E
5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b> He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye,</b> its tubular shape, {{large numbers of}} closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cone cells, since rod cells have {{superior}} light sensitivity. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity. Unlike diurnal birds of prey, owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in daytime hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{the reasons for}} postvitrectomy diabetic vitreous hemorrhage (PDVH), and to analyze <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> PDVH onset, <b>the</b> treatment <b>of</b> PDVH, <b>the</b> visual outcome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatment, and factors that affect visual acuity after treatment. Materials and Methods: Overall, 292 eyes from 236 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) underwent vitrectomy from 2006 to 2010. Fifty eyes out of 43 patients had severe postoperative vitreous hemorrhage. The average follow-up duration was 6. 8 ± 3. 8 months (range, 2 - 12 months). Results: Recurrent vitreous hemorrhage (VH) after primary vitrectomy occurred in 40 eyes (80 %) with an average time of VH onset of 62. 5 ± 32. 8 days (range, 3 - 170 days). VH occurred after silicone oil removal occurred in 10 eyes (20 %), with an average time of VH onset of 27. 4 ± 20. 3 days (range, 1 - 60 days). The reasons for PDVH included chronic errhysis from retinal neovessels (47. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> residual fibrous vascular membrane (12. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> fibrovascular ingrowth at sclerotomy sites (4. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> iris neovessels and neovascular glaucoma (4. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> retinal vein occlusion (2. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> retinal tears (8. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> retinotomy (1. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> epichoroidal bleeding (1. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> polycythemia rubra vera (1. 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> hypoperfusional retinopathy (4. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes),</b> and unknown reasons (12. 8 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes).</b> Visual acuity increased in 43 eyes (86 %) after surgical or nonsurgical treatment. The improvement in visual acuity after treatment was not affected by age, sex, duration of diabetes, time of PDVH onset, frequency of surgery, or treatment methods. Conclusion: Postvitrectomy diabetic vitreous hemorrhage commonly occurs two months after vitrectomy. Residual epiretinal neovascularization {{is the most common}} cause of PDVH. Active surgical or nonsurgical treatment for severe vitreous hemorrhage can obviously improve the patients′ visual prognosis...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim. Cataract surgery {{has become}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safest {{procedures}} in medicine thanks to advances in technology and surgical techniques. Although minimal, we still witness different complications. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} compare visual outcome and complication rate in different techniques of cataract surgery, ie in cataract surgeries with various corneal incision width. Methods. The study included 3, 457 consecutive patients, ie 4, 670 eyes that had undergone cataract surgery. The used surgical techniques were: extracapsular cataract extraction, phacoemulsification/ forceps IOL implantation, phacoemulsification/ injector IOL implantation, microincision cataract surgery (MICS). Patient follow up was 6 months. Patients were evaluated for: visual aquity, corneal astigmatism, cellular reaction in the anterior chamber, IOL position. Results. Uncorrected visual aquity 30 days postoperatively was ≥ 0. 5 in 30 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> - ECCE; 54. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> - phacoemulsification/forceps IOL implantation; 63. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> - phacoemulsification/injector IOL implantation; 5 / 8 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> - MICS. Endophthalmitis was detected in 0. 15 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> - ECCE and 0. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> - phacoemulsification/forceps IOL implantation. In eyes with phacoemulsification/injector IOL implantation or microincision cataract surgery (MICS) there were no cases of endophthalmitis. After a 6 -month period intraocular lens were dislocated in 7. 2 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> - ECCE, and 0. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> - phacoemulsification/PMMA IOL. There was no IOL dislocation in other surgical techniques. Conclusion. Shorter corneal incision implies less complications, less operative trauma, faster visual rehabilitation and better visual outcome...|$|R

5|$|Cataracts {{can affect}} any breed of dog {{and is the}} same {{condition}} as seen in humans. Here the lens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> hardens and is characterised by cloudiness in the eye.

5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis).

40|$|Purpose. To {{analyze the}} risk factors {{associated}} {{with a series of}} ectasia cases following photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and all published cases. Methods. In a retrospective study on post-PRK ectasia patients, 9 eyes of 7 patients were included, in addition to 20 eyes of 13 patients from <b>the</b> literature. Risk <b>of</b> post-PRK ectasia was calculated using the ectasia risk score system (ERSS) for laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) patients. The percent tissue altered (PTA) was also evaluated. Results. ERSS scoring of zero for age, RSB, and spherical equivalent was found in 66 %, 86 %, and 86 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> respectively. Pachymetry risk score was 2 in 60 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and 3 or 4 in 16 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> Topography risk score was 3 in 41 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and 4 in 21 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> Cumulative ectasia risk score was ≥ 4 (high risk) in 77 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> and ≥ 3 (medium and high risk) in 86 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes.</b> Average PTA was 23. 2 [*]±[*] 7. 0 %. All eyes but one had a PTA[*]<[*] 40 %. Conclusions. Preoperative corneal topographic abnormalities and thin corneas may be significant risk factors for developing ectasia following PRK. Post-LASIK ectasia risk scoring also has relevance in the risk for developing post-PRK ectasia...|$|R

Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown that represent the two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as an Upper Egyptian counterpart of Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt.|$|E
