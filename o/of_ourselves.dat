5|$|Yeah, we {{were over}} the moon. We don't play ourselves, {{because most people}} won't know who we are, but they'll look like yellow {{versions}} <b>of</b> <b>ourselves.</b> We play counsellors at an arts camp that Lisa's going to. It's pretty fun. We just went to a studio and recorded it, but, yeah, we were really flattered.|$|E
25|$|Made a searching and fearless moral {{inventory}} <b>of</b> <b>ourselves.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'A Frenchman, {{or a man}} of French descent. Isn't that characteristic! In {{the whole}} great Abbey the one {{monument}} which has impressed us with its genius and imagination is by a foreigner. We haven't got it in us. We are too much afraid <b>of</b> letting <b>ourselves</b> go and <b>of</b> giving <b>ourselves</b> away. We are heavy-handed and heavy-minded.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I am afraid,” Lady Cochrane {{said with}} a smile, “that we shall have very little {{opportunity}} <b>of</b> availing <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> your services. When we once get out there you will be carried off by Lord Cochrane, and he will never set foot on shore again unless when absolutely driven to it.” ...|$|R

25|$|This life– A {{concern for}} this life (as {{opposed to an}} afterlife) and a {{commitment}} to making it meaningful through better understanding <b>of</b> <b>ourselves,</b> our history, our intellectual and artistic achievements, and the outlooks of those who differ from us.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, our {{knowledge}} of ancient Maya thought must represent {{only a tiny fraction}} of the whole picture, for of the thousands of books in which the full extent of their learning and ritual was recorded, only four have survived to modern times (as though all that posterity knew <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> were to be based upon three prayer books and Pilgrim's Progress).|$|E
25|$|However, {{these figures}} do not {{distinguish}} between people at a low or healthy weight who are in fact overweight, between those whose self-perception as being overweight is incorrect and those whose perception of being overweight is correct. Recent developments, such as the Body Volume Index have addressed this problem in part by measuring weight distribution, but although 3D images <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> help to improve body perception, an objective appraisal of our own body image remains a difficult task for us to undertake.|$|E
60|$|At this we both {{broke out}} into an exclamation of dismay, and {{explained}} that we should as soon think <b>of</b> overthrowing <b>ourselves.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{did you not}} go in {{with the}} others, Ralph? We have no chance <b>of</b> {{defending}} <b>ourselves,</b> here. We have only our revolvers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And the {{marriage}} should be immediate and secret--or, at least, not spoken <b>of</b> outside <b>ourselves.</b> Would {{the young lady}} be agreeable to that proceeding?" ...|$|R
25|$|Self-esteem {{may make}} people {{convinced}} they deserve happiness. Understanding this is fundamental, and universally beneficial, since {{the development of}} positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect, benevolence and goodwill, thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones. For Erich Fromm, love of others and love <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> are not alternatives. On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found in all those {{who are capable of}} loving others. Self-esteem allows creativity at the workplace, and is a specially critical condition for teaching professions.|$|E
25|$|The {{formaldehyde}} {{surrounding the}} shark, Hirst says, {{is the process}} of death and decay. Though formaldehyde is used as a preservation means, over time, the object being preserved will soon wilt, flake, and wrinkle. Because the sculpture itself was made in 1991, the shark is very much rotting and deformed due to the formaldehyde taking its toll on the corpse. With the corpse rotting away, it symbolizes that no matter how well we take care <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> or how timeless we think we are, our mind will start to fade away and we slowly will begin to forget.|$|E
25|$|According to Kant, {{we think}} <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> as having free will. This lets us make {{judgments}} such as “you {{ought to have}} done that thing {{that you did not}} do.” Kant argues that this notion of freedom cannot be derived from our experience. We can be sure that this concept of freedom doesn't come from experience because experience itself contradicts it. Our experience is of everything in the sensible world and in the sensible world, everything that happens does so in accord with the laws of nature and {{there is no room for}} a free will to influence events.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at present; I have no {{definite}} plans just now. All I {{know is that}} we must possess <b>ourselves</b> <b>of</b> the rascal's {{person as}} well as of Gilda without the risk <b>of</b> compromising <b>ourselves.</b> In this, <b>of</b> course, we have now Jan's valuable help; he is a splendid leader and entirely trustworthy where the cause of his own hatred against the Prince is served." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But come," [...] he cried, [...] "we {{must get}} out <b>of</b> here <b>ourselves,</b> or {{we shall be}} shut off," [...] and the party hastened toward Clayton's car.|$|R
6000|$|... "Men {{before now}} {{have been killed}} by landslides," [...] said Tom Dillon. [...] "And just remember, we ain't out <b>of</b> it <b>ourselves,</b> yet," [...] he added, gravely.|$|R
25|$|In 1998, Maus {{left his}} {{hometown}} of Austin, Minnesota to study experimental music at the California Institute of the Arts. When he befriended and began to work alongside classmate Ariel Rosenberg (Ariel Pink), he took a greater interest in pop music. Much of his initial lo-fi work was created using a cassette multi-track recorder and an early 1990s synthesizer soundbank. It {{was not until the}} success of his third album, We Must Become the Pitiless Censors <b>of</b> <b>Ourselves</b> (2011), that he grew more widely accepted as an outsider artist. On stage, he is known for his intense displays of emotion while performing.|$|E
25|$|It is {{in those}} two {{functions}} that the real life of the ego is manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> and of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In it we cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, we feel pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are {{the sense of being}} one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.|$|E
25|$|In section three, Kant {{argues that}} we have a free will and are thus morally self-legislating. The fact of freedom means that we are bound by the moral law. In the course of his discussion, Kant {{establishes}} two viewpoints from which we can consider ourselves. We can view ourselves as members of the world of appearances – which operates according to the laws of nature – or we can view ourselves as members of the intellectual world, which is how we view ourselves when we think <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> as having free wills and when we think about how to act. These two different viewpoints allow Kant to make sense of how we can have free wills, {{despite the fact that the}} world of appearances follows laws of nature deterministically. Finally, Kant remarks that whilst he would like to be able to explain how morality ends up motivating us, his theory is unable to do so. This is because the intellectual world - in which morality is grounded - is something that we cannot make positive claims about.|$|E

60|$|And first, a {{thorough}} practice of this duty <b>of</b> subjecting <b>ourselves</b> to the wants and infirmities {{of each other}} would utterly extinguish in us the vice of pride.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most likely you'll {{find that}} the stock of water is quite as low. We're penned up here without a chance <b>of</b> helping <b>ourselves</b> unless we're willing to stand a regular battle." ...|$|R
500|$|Humans are [...] "systematically self deceived. Each {{one of us}} thinks <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> as more {{competent}} and benevolent than we are." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Drummond admitted: [...] "We didn't {{listen to}} 1987 What The Fuck's Going On {{for a long}} time, and when we did we were embarrassed by {{it because it was}} so badly recorded. But I still felt {{we were able to get}} a lot out <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> through it." ...|$|E
500|$|... that puny humans like {{us could}} be [...] "together"—not {{only in the}} {{specific}} neural melding that must take place between the two Jaeger co-pilots but also, more generally speaking, in a fractal web of resemblance, filling the world with copies <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> at varying orders of magnitude and {{with varying degrees of}} re-expression, beginning with the shoes on our feet.|$|E
50|$|We, the {{citizens}} <b>of</b> Singapore,pledge <b>ourselves</b> as one united people,regardless of race, language or religion,to build a democratic society,based on justice and equality,so as to achieve happiness, prosperityand progress for our nation.|$|R
5000|$|Postman {{was accused}} of Luddism, despite his {{statement}} in the conclusion <b>of</b> Amusing <b>Ourselves</b> to Death that [...] "We must not delude ourselves with preposterous notions such as the straight Luddite position." ...|$|R

500|$|Other critics {{hailed the}} {{environmental}} perspective. Chauncey Mabe of the South Florida Sun-Sentinel calls the book [...] "one {{of the most}} satisfying environmental books of recent memory, one devoid of self-righteousness, alarmism or tiresome doomsaying". Tom Spears of the CanWest News Service concludes [...] "it's more a portrait <b>of</b> <b>ourselves,</b> taken through an odd lens" [...] and [...] "ometimes an obituary is the best biography".|$|E
500|$|James Cameron {{has said}} that he [...] "tried to make a film that would touch people's spirituality across the broad spectrum." [...] He also stated that one of the film's {{philosophical}} underpinnings is that [...] "the Na'vi represent that sort of aspirational part <b>of</b> <b>ourselves</b> that wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions <b>of</b> <b>ourselves,</b> the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences." [...] Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: [...] "Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair. [...] He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being. [...] After all, we are all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound. [...] Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone." ...|$|E
500|$|According to a {{news report}} by Canwest News Service, the Jonas Brothers' {{publicist}} specifically forbade reporters from asking {{the band members}} about the South Park episode. Nick Jonas told the Orlando Sentinel that the band {{had not seen the}} episode: [...] "We are always open to make fun <b>of</b> <b>ourselves.</b> For us, we're so focused on what we're doing with this tour and our album, we didn't have much time to see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have we {{no means}} <b>of</b> making <b>ourselves</b> heard?" [...] demanded the Alderman. [...] "Methinks {{the voice of}} a strong man might be sent thus far across the water when life is the stake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We speak like strangers {{about this}} and that, making talk to hide our [...] thoughts. We make a pretence <b>of</b> busying <b>ourselves</b> about {{whatever}} will [...] help us to keep apart from one another.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't mean to {{say that}} Miss Chubb and myself are to be put in the {{attitude}} <b>of</b> arraying <b>ourselves</b> against the constituted authorities--and, perhaps, Mr. Brimmer himself?" [...] asked Mrs. Brimmer, in genuine alarm.|$|R
