30|$|Geothermometers are {{temperature}} indicators using temperature dependent geochemical and/or isotopic compositions of geothermal waters (Gupta and Roy 2007). All geothermometers have limitations. The following {{assumptions are}} made when using geothermometers: (1) the <b>relevant</b> hydrothermal <b>minerals</b> in the reservoir are in equilibrium with the geothermal liquid; (2) the pore fluid {{pressure in the}} reservoir is fixed by coexistence of liquid and steam; (3) the geothermal liquid cools, either conductively or adiabatically, through steam separation at 100  °C; (4) the geothermal liquid does not mix with cold, shallow waters during the ascent towards the surface; (5) the geothermal liquid does not precipitate any <b>relevant</b> <b>minerals</b> along the upflow path (Marini 2004). In most situations {{it is difficult to}} prove that these assumptions are met (Ferguson et al. 2009).|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{work after}} completion of a three-year project and our current ongoing efforts. Research efforts at UC Davis have focused on establishing the thermodynamic properties of zirconolite and pyrochlore, and the synthesis of <b>other</b> <b>minerals</b> <b>relevant</b> to storage of nuclear material. Heat capacity, entropy, enthalpy of formation, and fkee energy of formation data were established for zirconolite, CaZrTi{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }, {{in the range from}} 0 to 1500 K. The heat capacity, entropy, enthalpy of formation, and free energy of formation at 298 K for zirconolite are 211. 9 J/K mol, 193. 3 J/K mol, - 3713. 8 kJ/mol, and - 35 14. 6 kJ/mol, respectively. Solution calorimetry experiments with cerium pyrochlore, Ca{sub 0. 8 }Ce{sub 1. 2 }Ti{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }, are complete. Heat capacity data and confirmation of the pyrochlore composition are required for final data analysis. Synthesis and characterization of CaHfTi{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }, CaZr{sub 0. 5 }Hf{sub 0. 5 }Ti{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }, Gd{sub 2 }Ti{sub 2 }O{sub 7 }, and CeTi{sub 2 }O{sub 6 } is complete. Research efforts at Los Alamos have focused on establishing synthesis techniques for actinide-bearing minerals and preparation of the calorimetry laboratory. The preparation of Pu-pyrochlore, nominally CaPuTi{sub 2 }O{sub 7 } has been achieved by Ebbinghaus at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. A sample of this material has been sent to Putnam at Los Alamos National Laboratory...|$|R
