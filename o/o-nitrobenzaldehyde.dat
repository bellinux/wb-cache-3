The synthesis started with a simple <b>o-nitrobenzaldehyde.</b> A Wittig-Claisen reaction sequence converted the starting material to a 4-pentenal derivative that could serve as a versatile intermediate for the synthesis of various natural products. In this case, the 4-pentenal derivative was further converted to the natural product horsfiline, the active ingredient of a traditional herbal medicine with analgesic effects.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effects of}} substituents on the diazoalkanes is {{reversed}} {{relative to the}} carbonyl reactants: electron-withdrawing substituents decrease the rate of reaction while electron-donating substituents accelerate it. For example, diazomethane is significantly more reactive than ethyl diazoacetate, though less reactive than its higher alkyl homologs (e.g. diazoethane). [...] Reaction conditions may also affect the yields of carbonyl product and epoxide product. In the reactions of <b>o-nitrobenzaldehyde,</b> p-nitrobenzaldehyde, [...] and phenylacetaldehyde with diazomethane, the ratio of epoxide to carbonyl is increased by the inclusion of methanol in the reaction mixture. The opposite influence has also been observed in the reaction of piperonal with diazomethane, which exhibits increased carbonyl yield {{in the presence of}} methanol.|$|E

40|$|A {{previously}} reported <b>o-nitrobenzaldehyde</b> (ONBA) degrading bacterium Pseudomonas sp. ONBA- 17 was further identified and characterized. Based on results of DNA base composition and DNA-DNA hybridization, the strain {{was identified as}} P. putida. Its degradation effect enhanced with increase of inoculum amount and no lag phase was observed. Higher removal rate was achieved under shaking conditions. All tested ONBA with different initial concentrations could be completely degraded within 5 d. In addition, degradative enzyme(s) involved was confirmed as intra-cellular distributed and constitutively expressed. Effects of different compounds on relative activity of degradative enzyme(s) within cell-free extract were also evaluated. Finally, 2 -nitrobenzoic acid and 2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoic acid were detected as metabolites of ONBA degradation by P. putida ONBA- 17, and relevant metabolic pathway was preliminary proposed.

40|$|With a {{combination}} of transient pump-probe IR spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics, the controversial pico- and nanosecond steps of the <b>o-nitrobenzaldehyde</b> (oNBA) photoreaction have been investigated in aqueous solution. In this way, the measured reaction kinetics have been complemented with an atomistic picture of the reactive events as obtained with unbiased simulations in explicit solvent. Our results allow for {{a detailed description of}} the oNBA proton photorelease, a process of fundamental importance and relevant to the use of oNBA as a proton cage in many experiments. In a first step, a stable ketene intermediate is formed on a subpicosecond time scale. This intermediate reacts in a solvent assisted way with an OH transfer to produce nitrosobenzoic acid with a characteristic time of 7 ps. Finally, in permitting pH conditions, this product molecule dissociates a carboxyl proton with a 21 ns time constant.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a timed explosive drug release from smart pH-responsive hydrogels by utilizing a phototriggered spatial pH-jump reaction. A photoinitiated proton-releasing reaction of <b>o-nitrobenzaldehyde</b> (o-NBA) was integrated into poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co- 2 -carboxyisopropylacrylamide) (P(NIPAAm-co-CIPAAm)) hydrogels. o-NBA-hydrogels demonstrated the rapid release of protons upon UV irradiation, allowing the pH inside the gel to decrease to below the pKa value of P(NIPAAm-co-CIPAAm). The generated protons diffused gradually toward the non-illuminated area, and the diffusion kinetics {{could be controlled}} by adjusting the UV irradiation time and intensity. After irradiation, we observed the enhanced release of entrapped L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) from the gels, which was driven by the dissociation of DOPA from CIPAAm. Local UV irradiation also triggered the release of DOPA from the non-illuminated area in the gel via the diffusion of protons. Conventional systems can activate only the illuminated region, and their response is discontinuous when the light is turned off. The ability of the proposed pH-jump system to permit gradual activation via proton diffusion may be beneficial {{for the design of}} predictive and programmable devices for drug delivery...|$|E

The sample homogenate is subjected to acid hydrolysis and derivatisation with <b>o-nitrobenzaldehyde,</b> followed by ethyl acetate / hexane extraction and detection by ELISA. The ELISA procedure has been validated using 0. 3, 1. 0 and 3 μg Kg- 1 of SEM in fortified samples. Detection capability (CCß) was set {{on the basis of}} the acceptance of 5 % false compliant results for a given concentration level according to Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, and was determined to be 0. 3 μg Kg- 1 with a respective limit of detection of 0. 13 μg Kg- 1.

40|$|The folding of a pH-sensitive leucine zipper, that is, a GCN 4 mutant {{containing}} eight {{glutamic acid}} residues, has been investigated. A pH-jump induced by a caged proton (<b>o-nitrobenzaldehyde,</b> oNBA) is employed {{to initiate the}} process, and time-resolved IR spectroscopy of the amide I band is used to probe it. The experiment has been carefully designed to minimize the buffer capacity of the sample solution so that a large pH jump can be achieved, leading to a transition from a completely unfolded to a completely folded state with a single laser shot. In order to eliminate the otherwise rate-limiting diffusion-controlled step {{of the association of}} two peptides, they have been covalently linked. The results for the folding kinetics of the cross-linked peptide are compared with those of an unlinked peptide, which reveals a detailed picture of the folding mechanism. That is, folding occurs in two steps, one on an ∼ 1 − 2 μs time scale leading to a partially folded α-helix even in the monomeric case and a second one leading to the final coiled-coil structure on distinctively different time scales of ∼ 30 μs for the cross-linked peptide and ∼ 200 μs for the unlinked peptide. By varying the initial pH, it is found that the folding mechanism is consistent with a thermodynamic two-state model, despite the fact that a transient intermediate is observed in the kinetic experiment...|$|E
40|$|Some of the {{variables}} in the Folin method for measurement of urinary creatine and creatinine were studied. The effects of varying the picric acid concentration, volume of solution, and heating time on the conversionof creatine to creatinine were investigated. A study was also made of the results obtained in the chromo-genic reaction by varying the concentration of picric acid and sodium hydroxide. The information from these experiments was utilized to modify the Folin pro-cedure to yield a more convenient method for the measurement of urinary creati-nine and creatine. THE METHOD OP F 0 LIN (1) has long been used for the measurement of creatine and creatinine because of its simplicity, {{in spite of the}} fact that it is well established that the color reaction is nonspecific (2 - 9). According to Van Pilsum (10), of the numerous procedures devised for the measurement of creatinine, the <b>o-nitrobenzaldehyde</b> procedure (11), the picric acid method employing Lloyd’s reagent (12), and the picric acid method coupled with iodine oxidation and ether extraction (13) are probably the most practical and satisfac-tory for both blood and urine analyses. Tanssky (14) has recently presented procedures for the measure-ment of urinary creatine and creatinine using ether extraction to eliminate interfering substances. This same author (14) has also provided a technic for the estimation of these compounds in the presence of phenolsulfonephthalein and sulfobromophthalein.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of proton {{transfer in}} Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) {{have been studied}} as a model system for characterizing the correlation between dynamics and function of proteins in general. The kinetics in EGFP (a variant of GFP) were monitored by using a laser-induced pH jump method. The pH was jumped from 8 to 5 by nanosecond flash photolysis of the “caged proton,” <b>o-nitrobenzaldehyde,</b> and subsequent proton transfer was monitored by following the decrease in fluorescence intensity. The modulation of proton transfer kinetics by external perturbants such as viscosity, pH, and subdenaturing concentrations of GdnHCl {{as well as of}} salts was studied. The rate of proton transfer was inversely proportional to solvent viscosity, suggesting that the rate-limiting step is the transfer of protons through the protein matrix. The rate is accelerated at lower pH values, and measurements of the fluorescence properties of tryptophan 57 suggest that the enhancement in rate is associated with an enhancement in protein dynamics. The rate of proton transfer is nearly independent of temperature, unlike the rate of the reverse process. When the stability of the protein was either decreased or increased by the addition of co-solutes, including the salts KCl, KNO 3, and K 2 SO 4, a significant decrease in the rate of proton transfer was observed in all cases. The lack of correlation between the rate of proton transfer and the stability of the protein suggests that the structure is tuned to ensure maximum efficiency of the dynamics that control the proton transfer function of the protein...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} and {{prevalent}} usually self-limited disorder. Topical medication {{is the main}} route for acne therapy. In this disorder {{the most widely used}} topical preparations are antibiotics such as Erythromycin and keratolytic agents such as Tretinoin. Excellent results with minimal side effects may be achieved by a fixed combination of Tretinoin and Erythromycin. This combination therapy increases efficacy and a faster response in the treatment of acne may be achieved. The purpose of this work was to assess a suitable formulation of Erythromycin and Tretinoin in a topical gel base. UV spectrophotometer analysis was chosen for Erythromycin and Tretinoin assay. This method was adapted to assay Erythromycin and Tretinoin in their combination. The proposed method for Erythromycin was the formation of a complex with <b>O-nitrobenzaldehyde,</b> in glacial acetic acid and in the presence of hydrochloric acid, which manifested maximum absorbance at 486 nm. For the measurement of Tretinoin, the absorption peak at 355 nm in acidic ethanol-water-isopropyl alcohol (IPA) mixture was suitable. In order to formulate the Erythromycin and Tretinoin in a gel base, gelling agents, plasticizers, solvents, cosolvents such as carbopol, HPC, HPMC, ethanol, propylene glycol (PG), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and water have been used. By using tertiary diagrams, the most proportionate percentage of gel constituents have been determined. The formulations have been controlled for rheological, organoleptic properties and physical and chemical stability under several conditions (4, 25, 40 °C). The release of drugs from the gels was studied using Franz diffusion cell and the best formulations were chosen. Drug release rates followed Higuchi’s law. The results indicated that Erythromycin and Tretinoin could be formulated in a gel base with a suitable release profile and presented to pharmaceutical market.
