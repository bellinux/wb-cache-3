25|$|In 2007, owners Absolute Leisure sold Tuxedo Princess {{to foreign}} investors. She was renamed Prince in 2008 and {{moved from the}} Tyne to Greece. Towed from her mooring on 27 July 2008, she was guided slowly down the Tyne at low tide by two tugs. She passed under the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, which had been {{designed}} to accommodate this move when installed in November 2000. Due to fog at the coast, she was moored overnight at Northumbria Quay, North Shields and left the next day, with an <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tug</b> towing her to Greece.|$|E
500|$|Wichita got {{underway}} {{to support a}} raid on Okinawa on 2 October. On 10 October, the fleet reached the waters off Okinawa and launched the strike. The following day, the fleet struck Aparri on Luzon. The fleet then raided Formosa, where they targeted Japanese airfields {{to prepare for the}} upcoming assault against the Philippines. On 13 October, Japanese bombers attacked the fleet and badly damaged the cruiser [...] Wichita took Canberra under tow, though she was relieved by the <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tug</b> [...] on 15 October. Wichita joined the screen for Canberra; the squadron was joined by the badly damaged cruiser [...] The ships were attacked again the following day, and Houston was torpedoed again. Wichita left the damaged ships on 21 October, after they had successfully reached safer waters. Wichita then rejoined the fleet off Luzon, assigned to Task Force 34 under Vice Admiral Willis A.

500|$|On 6 March 1862, {{the ship}} {{departed}} New York bound for Fort Monroe, Virginia, towed by the <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tug</b> Seth Low {{and accompanied by}} the gunboats [...] and [...] Worden, not trusting the seal between the turret and the hull, and ignoring Ericsson's advice, wedged the former in the up position and stuffed oakum and sail cloth in the gap. Rising seas that night washed the oakum away and water poured underneath the turret, {{as well as through}} the hawsepipe, various hatches, ventilation pipes, and the two funnels, so that the belts for the ventilation and boiler fans loosened and fell off and the fires in the boilers were nearly extinguished {{over the course of the}} next day; this created a toxic atmosphere in the engine room that knocked out most of the engine-room crew. First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them. Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above. One fireman was able to punch a hole in the fan box, drain the water, and restart the fan. Later that night, the wheel ropes controlling the ship's rudder jammed, making it near impossible to control the ship's heading in the rough seas. Monitor was now in danger of foundering, so Worden signaled Seth Low for help and had Monitor towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening. She rounded Cape Charles around 3:00pm on 8 March and entered Chesapeake Bay, reaching Hampton Roads at 9:00pm, well after the first day's fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded.|$|E

5000|$|During the [...] "Cod Wars" [...] between Britain and Iceland, unarmed fishing {{trawlers}} {{found themselves}} opposed by Icelandic Coastguard vessels and converted trawlers. As well as Royal Navy coastguard vessels, Britain sent large, <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tugs</b> and lightships {{to protect them}} and there were numerous ramming incidents against both sides, sometimes with very serious consequences.|$|R
2500|$|Because of the {{requirements}} necessary to help the Navy during World War I, many of the cutters acquired during the 1890s were outdated and unable to perform the missions the Navy envisioned for them during time of war. In addition, the Coast Guard had lost three cutters to enemy action during the war. While construction was suspended on cutters designed before the war {{due to a lack}} of yard capacity, Reynolds did manage to fund the construction of four new truly [...] "multi-mission" [...] large cutters. The , , , and [...] were designed for use in law enforcement, ice patrol, search and rescue, derelict destruction and towing and used newly developed steam powered turbo-electric drives that were similar to the Navy's main drive engines used on battleships of the period, however they were more compact because of the limited engineering spaces on the smaller cutters. In addition to the large cutters, , a [...] <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tug</b> was added to the fleet.|$|E

Shifted to the Maritime Administration (MARAD) lay-up facility at Olympia, Washington, the erstwhile <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tug</b> was towed to the MARAD facility at Suisun Bay, Calif., in 1971. She was disposed of sometime between 1972 and 1975.|$|E
50|$|On 1 December, {{she began}} an {{extensive}} refit. During the yard work, she was reclassified an <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tug</b> and redesignated AT-169 on 1 March 1944. The long overhaul was completed on 5 March, {{and the ship}} proceeded to Brisbane. Coming under the operational control of Commander, Service Force, 7th Fleet, Whippoorwill arrived at Brisbane on 20 March. For the next 10 days, 21 to 31 March 1944, she underwent final conversion to an <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tug.</b> This involved the removal of her minesweeping gear {{and the addition of}} a heavy-duty towing engine which had once been fitted on board Dobbin (AD-3).|$|E
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the accident, the South African Department of Transport {{realised}} that despite many Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) using the Cape sea route each year, the authorities did not have <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tugs</b> that were able to assist them in distress, and to protect sensitive marine areas by breaking up oil spills with chemical dispersants. [...] They therefore set up an oil spill prevention service known as Kuswag (Coastwatch) and commissioned two new salvage tugs, the John Ross and Wolrade Woltemade. [...] The two tugs, with their [...] engines, held the record as the world's largest salvage tugs.|$|R
50|$|After the 1906 {{earthquake}}, San Francisco Board of Supervisors {{voted to}} fill the creek with earthquake debris, reducing the creek to its present size. During World War II, it served as docking areas for large <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tugs.</b> The area also located the largest copra coconut processing plant in the United States West Coast. In fact, the abandoned five-story high copra crane, used to transport large amount of copras from ships to the plant as late as 1974, still remains on the creek bank preserved as a historic landmark. In the 1950s, Islais Creek was home to the largest sardine canning industry in the world. The deteriorated condition of the creek gradually improved after {{the construction of a}} water treatment plant in 1970.

50|$|Then ordered east, the <b>ocean-going,</b> {{auxiliary}} <b>tug</b> cleared San Pedro Bay in mid-July {{and entered}} San Francisco Bay on 17 August, {{two days after}} the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific. Overhaul took her into September; and, on the 12th, she resumed towing activities with a run from Astoria, Oregon, to Pearl Harbor. During October, she delivered barracks ships to Eniwetok. In November, she commenced target towing services for surface and aviation units training in Hawaiian waters.|$|R
2500|$|Hayward was towed {{back around}} to the Columbia river by the large <b>ocean-going</b> steam <b>tug</b> Escort, also known as Escort No. 2 (built 1882; 146 tons). [...] This {{was the first time}} in the history of the Northwest that a sternwheeler had made the voyage without a wheel in place and without having steam up. [...] Sternwheel propelled-boats, in {{addition}} to being lightly built for inland work, would have difficulty keeping the sternwheel in the water as ocean swells would lift the paddles clear from the water. [...] Towing was expected to alleviate these difficulties.|$|R

25|$|On 16 November 1958, Nyon was on {{a voyage}} from Leith, Midlothian to Dakar, Senegal when she ran aground at St. Abbs Head, Berwickshire. At the time there was dense fog in the area. Two forward holds were breached, {{with a total of}} five holes between them. The fishing boat Emulate of Eyemouth brought bags of cement to Nyon, which were used in an {{unsuccessful}} attempt to plug the holes. The British tugs George V and Beamish attempted to refloat the ship without success. On 20 November, 23 of the crew were taken off by a lifeboat. That day, {{the decision was made to}} cut the ship in two, salvaging the stern portion. Wijsmuller Salvage of the Netherlands were awarded the contract under Lloyd's Open Form rules. The <b>ocean-going</b> <b>tugs</b> Simson and Hector were despatched to Scotland. On 21 November, the operation to separate the two parts of the ship began. The sides were cut on 23 November, leaving just the bottom plates intact. Although all four tugs attempted to separate the two sections, they were unsuccessful. On 25 November, it was decided to use explosives to part the two sections of the ship. This was achieved on 27 November. The stern part of Nyon was towed to North Shields, Northumberland, arriving on 28 November. The bow section was left in situ and was destroyed in a gale some days later. Following further work to strengthen the stern section, it was towed to Bolnes, Zuid Holland, Netherlands, in February 1959. A new bow section was manufactured by NV Boeles Shipyards, Bolnes, and fitted on 8 June 1959.|$|R
