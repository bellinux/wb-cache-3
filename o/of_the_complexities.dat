5|$|As the {{reactors}} at Hanford came online, the Metallurgical Laboratory turned its {{attention back to}} theoretical designs. The discovery of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but the challenge was met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. Wigner was also intrigued {{by the possibility of}} doing away with much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of a reactor by having the uranium in solution or a slurry in heavy water. The Metallurgical Laboratory attempted to find a way of doing this.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E

25|$|Many {{programs}} added UTF-8 conversions for UCS-2 {{data and}} did not alter this UTF-8 conversion when UCS-2 was replaced with the surrogate-pair using UTF-16. In such programs each half of a UTF-16 surrogate pair is encoded as its own three-byte UTF-8 encoding, resulting in six-byte sequences rather than four bytes for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane. Oracle and MySQL databases use this, as well as Java and Tcl as described below, and probably many Windows programs where the programmers were unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of UTF-16. Although this non-optimal encoding is generally not deliberate, a supposed benefit is that it preserves UTF-16 binary sorting order when CESU-8 is binary sorted.|$|E

25|$|The {{captain of}} a cricket team, often {{referred}} to as the skipper, is the appointed leader, having several additional roles and responsibilities over and above those of the other players. As in other sports, the captain is usually experienced and has good communication skills, and is likely to be one of the most regular members of the team; indeed the captain often has a say in team selection. Before the game the captains toss for innings. During the match the captain decides the team's batting order, who will bowl each over, and where each fielder will be positioned. While the captain has the final say, decisions are often collaborative. A captain's knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of cricket strategy and tactics, and shrewdness in the field, may contribute significantly to the team's success.|$|E

500|$|This {{concept was}} still very new in the 1690s, and few new cities had had reason {{to be built in}} Europe [...] Christopher Wren's city plan after the Great Fire of London in 1666 having been turned down because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of land {{ownership}} there. There were some other examples such as Richelieu, and later Saint Petersburg. The prototype may well have been the new city of Terra del Sole, constructed in 1564. Another of the first towns to be planned using symmetry and order rather than an evolution of small alleys and streets was Alessandria in southern Piedmont. A little later, from 1711, this Baroque form of planning was favoured in the Hispanic colonies of South America, especially by the Portuguese in Brazil. In other parts of Europe, lack of finance, complex land ownership and divided public opinion made radical replanning after disaster too difficult: after 1666, London was rebuilt on its ancient plan, though new extensions to the west were partially on a grid system. In Sicily, public opinion (the public being anyone {{not a member of the}} ruling class) counted for nothing, and hence these seemingly revolutionary new concepts of town planning could be freely executed.|$|E
500|$|Suzuki {{described}} Miyazaki as {{a feminist}} {{in reference to}} his attitude to female workers. Miyazaki has described his female characters as [...] "brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart", stating that they may [...] "need a friend, or a supporter, but never a saviour" [...] and that [...] "any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man". Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly the protagonist Nausicaä. Schellhase noted that the female characters in Miyazaki's films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions. Schellhase also identified a [...] "coming of age" [...] element for the heroines in Miyazaki's films, as they each discover [...] "individual personality and strengths". Gabrielle Bellot of The Atlantic wrote that, in his films, Miyazaki [...] "shows a keen understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of what it might mean to be a woman". In particular, Bellot cites Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, praising the film's challenging of gender expectations, and the strong and independent nature of Nausicaä. Bellot also noted that Princess Mononokes San represents the [...] "conflict between selfhood and expression".|$|E
500|$|Edge of Darkness {{continues}} to be well regarded to this day. When it was repeated on BBC2 in 1992, Sean Day-Lewis wrote in The Daily Telegraph, “Edge of Darkness is a masterpiece. It {{is one of those}} very rare television creations so rich in form and content that the spectator wishes there was some way of prolonging it indefinitely”. Andrew Lavender, writing in British Television Drama in the 1980s, has said that Edge of Darkness “captured the spirit of its age but went far beyond the drama of its time. [...] It pushed against expectations attaching to the thriller form, often transcending the limits of the genre”. Fred Inglis, in his analysis of the serial in Formations: 20th Century Media Studies, takes it “as {{one of the most remarkable}} works of art made for British television”. According to Lez Cooke, in British Television Drama: A History, “In a reactionary climate, when the possibilities for the production of 'social issue' drama were limited, Edge of Darkness proved that, by adapting to changed circumstances and adopting a serialised thriller format, it was still possible to produce ambitious and progressive television drama in Britain in the mid-1980s”, a view echoed by Sean Cubit in EcoMedia who notes that “the series neatly echoed the chill that descended on radical politics in the Thatcher years in the United Kingdom”. The television historian Andrew Pixley has described the series as “possibly the finest BBC drama ever made” and “one of the few television programmes where every element can be said to have worked to complete effect”; John Hartley, in Tele-ology: Studies in Television, called it [...] "the best police drama series ever made for television" [...] and said that [...] "its method of investigative drama can unravel some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> of public life more truthfully than investigative journalism".|$|E
