5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths <b>of</b> <b>Gender,</b> explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view <b>of</b> <b>gender.</b> In Delusions <b>of</b> <b>Gender,</b> Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. It was {{inspired}} by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood familiarity with rehabilitation programs.

The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to stories <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> and sexual variance that are generally accepted by mainstream Hinduism, modern scholars and queer activists have highlighted LGBT themes in lesser known texts, or inferred them from stories that traditionally {{are considered to}} have no homoerotic subtext.

5|$|Like Mr. Krabs, Pearl {{has also}} been {{considered}} a stereotyped character; Sharon Lamb and Lyn Mikel Brown wrote in their 2007 book Packaging Girlhood that Pearl exhibits the traits of an archetypal girly girl.

5|$|Research is a {{priority}} in terms of improving women's health. Research needs include diseases unique to women, more serious in women and those that differ in risk factors between women and men. The balance <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> in research studies needs to be balanced appropriately to allow analysis that will detect interactions between gender and other factors. Gronowski and Schindler suggest that scientific journals make documentation <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> a requirement when reporting the results of animal studies, and that funding agencies require justification from investigators for any gender inequity in their grant proposals, giving preference to those that are inclusive. They also suggest it {{is the role of}} health organisations to encourage women to enroll in clinical research. However, there has been progress in terms of large scale studies such as the WHI, and in 2006 the Society for Women's Health Research founded the Organization for the Study of Sex Differences (OSSD) and the journal Biology of Sex Differences to further the study of sex differences.|$|E

5|$|The Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> inequality calculated by analyzing social institutions, societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society. By combining these sources of inequality, SIGI is able to penalize high levels of inequality {{in each of the}} applicable dimensions, allowing for only partial compensation by the gaps between the remaining dimensions and the highly inequitable one. Through its analysis of the institutional sources <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are controlled for.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the obligatory use <b>of</b> grammatical <b>gender</b> {{in the composition}} of turns in Greek conversation and its implications for the routine achievement <b>of</b> sociocultural <b>gender</b> as part <b>of</b> the taken-for-granted world. By drawing on sociolinguistics, I study the role <b>of</b> grammatical <b>gender</b> in ascribing sex to referents and constructing gender identities. Moreover, I argue that this social dimension <b>of</b> grammatical <b>gender</b> is related to covert assumptions shared by participants about referents as women or men. I explore empirically the relation between grammatical gender and culture by employing conversation analysis, in addition to the notion <b>of</b> the <b>gender</b> membership category...|$|R

5|$|The United Nations ranks India as a middle-income country.

The 2011 United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report ranked India 132 out of 187 in terms <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> inequality. The value of this multidimensional indicator, Gender Inequality Index (GII) is determined by numerous factors including maternal mortality rate, adolescent fertility rate, educational achievement and labour force participation rate. Gender inequality in India is exemplified by women’s lower likelihood of being literate, continuing their education and participating in the labour force.|$|E

5|$|Feminist economists {{often make}} a {{critical}} distinction that masculine bias in economics {{is primarily a}} result <b>of</b> <b>gender,</b> not sex. In other words, when feminist economists highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on its social beliefs about masculinity like objectivity, separation, logical consistency, individual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack of emotion, {{but not on the}} gender of authorities and subjects. However, the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.|$|E

The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other judgments on the legal recognition <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E
