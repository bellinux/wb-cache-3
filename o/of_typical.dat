5|$|Like the Coronation Necklace, these {{earrings}} {{have been}} worn by queens regnant and consort at every coronation since 1901. Made for Queen Victoria in 1858 using the diamonds {{from an old}} Garter badge, they are <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> design: a large brilliant followed by a smaller one, with a large pear-shaped drop. The drops were originally part of the Koh-i-Noor armlet. After they had been made, Victoria wore the earrings and matching necklace in the painting Queen Victoria by the European court painter, Franz Winterhalter.|$|E

5|$|Spiders {{can also}} be the prey of {{aggressive}} mimics. The assassin bug Stenolemus bituberus preys on spiders, entering their web and plucking its silk threads until the spider approaches.

5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA {{analysis}} showed that an enlarged Hirundo genus should contain all the mud-builder genera, including the Delichon house martins, a practice which few authorities follow. Although the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resembles those <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> Hirundo species like the barn swallow, the research showed that if Delichon, Cecropis and Petrochelidon are split from Hirundo, Ptyonoprogne should be also considered as a separate genus.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most North American institutions, the University of Toronto is a collegiate {{university}} with a {{model that}} resembles those of the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford in Britain. The colleges hold substantial autonomy over admissions, scholarships, programs and other academic and financial affairs, {{in addition to the}} housing and social duties <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> residential colleges. The system emerged in the 19th century, as ecclesiastical colleges considered various forms of union with the University of Toronto to ensure their viability. The desire to preserve religious traditions in a secular institution resulted in the federative collegiate model that came to characterize the university.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} {{a wide range of}} {{attachment}} difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E

5|$|Around {{this time}} he adopted his famous style of dressing, {{consisting}} of a knee-length one-piece Kafni robe and a cloth cap. Ramgir Bua, a devotee, testified that Sai Baba was dressed like an athlete and sported 'long hair flowing down {{to the end of}} his spine' when he arrived in Shirdi, and that he never had his head shaved. It was only after Baba forfeited a wrestling match with one Mohiddin Tamboli that he took up the kafni and cloth cap, articles <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> Sufi clothing. This attire contributed to Baba's identification as a Muslim fakir and was a reason for initial indifference and hostility against him in a predominantly Hindu village.|$|E
5|$|Following its predecessors, Brawl uses {{a battle}} system unlike that <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> {{fighting}} games. Players {{can choose from}} a large selection of characters, each attempting to knock their opponents off the screen as they fight on various stages. The characters in Brawl include most of the same ones as the predecessors, such as the well-known Mario and Pikachu. Instead of using traditional health bars that start at a maximum value and lose value, Brawl characters start the game with 0%; the value rises as they take damage and may rise over 100% {{to a maximum of}} 999%. As a character's percentage increases, the character flies further back when hit. When a character is knocked beyond a stage's boundary and disappears from the screen, the character loses either a life, a point, or coins, depending on the mode of play. Brawl includes a function which allows players to create profiles with personalized button configurations for each control method along with their chosen username.|$|E
5|$|Here Sheng Ruozi {{quotes a}} written {{selection}} about windmills from the 'Placid Retired Scholar', who is actually Yelü Chucai (1190–1244), a prominent Jin and Yuan statesman (after the Jin fell in 1234 to the Mongols). The passage refers to Yelü's journey to Turkestan (modern Xinjiang) in 1219, and Hechong Fu is actually Samarkand (in modern Uzbekistan). Afterwards, the Chinese applied the 'fore-and-aft' sail riggings <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> Chinese junk ships to horizontal windmills. These windmills {{were used to}} operate the square-pallet chain pumps used in Chinese irrigation since the ancient Han dynasty. Windmills of this nature were still in use during modern times in Tianjin and along the Yangtze River. The first European to view Chinese windmills was Jan Nieuhoff, who spotted them in Jiangsu while traveling along the Grand Canal in 1656, {{as part of the}} Dutch embassy to Beijing. The first European windmills written of were those of Dean Herbert of East Anglia in 1191, who competed with the mills of the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds.|$|E

In addition, new mechanics are introduced, such as enemies that wander around the table, wall jumping, {{and the ability to}} fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be used to nudge the pinball table and alter the ball's trajectory. The game consists of six pinball tables, each inspired by a different area of Metroid Prime. Each table is shown across both screens of the Nintendo DS. Only two tables are initially available for play: Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld. After playing either of the first two tables, the player unlocks two more tables: Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines. In either table, the player must battle a boss to complete it.|$|E
5|$|The Musée suisse de l'appareil photographique at Vevey holds around 1,000 {{photographs}} taken for test purposes {{during the development}} of Michel's camera. Most of the photos were taken with 16mm orthopanchromatic Agfa film with a speed of ISO 8/10°. The exposed format was 10mm × 34mm. The quality was sufficient for a tenfold magnification. In the catalog of the 2007 exhibition Des pigeons photographes? they are classified as test photos {{on the ground or}} from a window, human perspectives from the ground or from elevated points, aeroplane-based aerial photographs, aerial photographs of relatively high altitude that were probably taken by pigeons released from a plane, and only a small number <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> pigeon photographs.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} Parkinson's disease is {{generally}} unknown, but believed to involve both genetic and environmental factors. Those {{with a family}} member affected {{are more likely to}} get the disease themselves. There is also an increased risk in people exposed to certain pesticides and among those who have had prior head injuries, while there is a reduced risk in tobacco smokers and those who drink coffee or tea. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. This results in not enough dopamine in these areas. The reason for this cell death is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of proteins into Lewy bodies in the neurons. Diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> cases is mainly based on symptoms, with tests such as neuroimaging being used to rule out other diseases.|$|E

5|$|The {{clustering}} of {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects and raising of their perihelia is reproduced in simulations that include Planet Nine. In simulations conducted by Batygin and Brown swarms of planetesimals that began with large semi-major axis orbits at random orientations and initially interacting with Neptune were sculpted into collinear groups of spatially confined orbits by a distant planet if it is substantially more massive than Earth and on a highly eccentric orbit. These surviving objects were in orbits that were oriented with their long axes anti-aligned {{with respect to the}} massive planet and were roughly co-planar with it. The objects were also found to be in resonance with the massive planet. The resonances included high-order resonances, for example 27:17, and were interconnected, yielding an orbital evolution that was fundamentally chaotic, causing their semi-major axes to vary unpredictably on million-year timescales. The perihelia of these objects were also raised temporarily, producing Sedna-like orbits, before being returned to orbits more typical <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> trans-Neptunian objects after several hundred million years. Some of the eTNOs also evolved into orbits perpendicular to the plane of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The genus Ptyonoprogne {{is closely}} related to the larger swallow genus Hirundo, and is {{sometimes}} included within it since the nests of the Ptyonoprogne crag martins resemble those <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> Hirundo species like the barn swallow. However, a DNA analysis showed that if Hirundo is enlarged to contain the crag martins, it should include all the mud-builder genera. Conversely, if the Delichon house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Ptyonoprogne should also be split off. The pale crag martin's nearest relatives are {{the other members of the}} genus, the dusky crag martin P. concolor of southern Asia, the rock martin P. fuligula of Southern Africa, and the Eurasian crag martin P. rupestris.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{gameplay}} received mixed reviews. Some critics {{believed that}} the gameplay was enjoyable, serviceable and acceptable by modern standards, but most others agreed {{that some of the}} gameplay mechanics, such as the cover system, lacked polish and were flawed. Some critics considered the gameplay generic due to its inclusion <b>of</b> <b>typical</b> shooter elements such as on-rail and turret segments, and stated that such mechanics are unable to help the game differentiate itself from other shooters such as Gears of War, and give the game an identity crisis. Some critics lamented that gameplay occasionally disconnects players from the story, creating tonal dissonance. Many criticized the game for not having a roll mechanic. The artificial intelligence system was criticized for not being strong enough to make the game more gratifying, though some critics thought that the AI system for Adams and Lugo was well-crafted and did not suffer from severe or frequent technical problems, although {{they may not be able}} to carry out player's commands. Some critics criticized the game's low replay value, unbalanced difficulty level, and sudden difficulty spike.|$|E
