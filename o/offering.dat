5|$|Her mantra may be {{repeated}} ten thousand times, repeated one thousand times while <b>offering</b> flowers and ghee {{in a fire}} sacrifice, or repeated one hundred times while <b>offering</b> water (Arghya) or while <b>offering</b> food to Brahmin priests. Her yantra (sacred geometric diagram), whether physically constructed or mentally envisioned, is used in worship along with the mantra. <b>Offering</b> certain items to a fire sacrifice—particularly those performed at cremation grounds, river banks, forests, or crossroads—while repeating the mantra is said to fulfil specific goals. An <b>offering</b> of Bael leaves is said to result in kingship; salt gives the power to control; turmeric gives the power to paralyse; neem twigs bring wealth; and an <b>offering</b> of sandalwood, camphor and saffron together or a salt and honey mixture grants the power to attract people.

40|$|We {{report that}} {{traditional}} seasoned equity <b>offerings</b> (SEOs) {{are no longer}} firms' preferred choice for raising seasoned public equity. Traditional <b>offerings</b> have recently been surpassed by shelf-registered <b>offerings</b> {{in terms of both}} annual frequency and total capital raised. This represents a dramatic shift from the 1980 s, during which the overwhelming majority of firms favored traditional over shelf-registered <b>offerings.</b> We find that the growth in shelf use is related to firms increasingly valuing and using the option feature of shelf registration to defer <b>offerings.</b> Moreover, the evidence indicates that the way firms now use shelf <b>offerings</b> resolves the shelf under-certification problem and results in no larger market penalties and significantly lower underwriter fees relative to non-shelf <b>offerings.</b> Finally, firms often use universal shelf filings and choose between debt and equity <b>offerings</b> based on the prevailing relative market conditions. ...|$|R
