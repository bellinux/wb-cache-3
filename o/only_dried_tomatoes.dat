The effect of the following factors on the quality of <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> was evaluated: variety of tomato (Rio Grande and Débora Plus), geometry of pieces (1 / 2 and 1 / 4 to the fruit major axis), presence or absence of seeds and final moisture content (25 and 35 %) by means of instrumental texture, and color analysis and sensorial affective tests. The results showed that the variety Rio Grande presented better physical parameters but was more susceptible to darkness. Generally, the consumers preferred <b>dried</b> <b>tomatoes</b> at 35 % moisture content. The best final quality of <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> was obtained from the treatment performed with Rio Grande variety and 35 % final moisture content...|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: <b>Dried</b> <b>tomato</b> pomace may be {{considered}} as an alternative feedstuff in ruminant nutrition. The limited literature data that are available so far may be interpreted as indirect and suggestive evidence for diminished ruminal fermentation and bacterial synthesis after substitution of <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> pomace for soybean meal. Approach: Rumen-fistulated beef steers were used to address the questions whether the replacement of soybean meal by <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> pomace would affect feed intake, rumen fermentation and nitrogen metabolism. In a feeding trial with Latin-square design, the steers were fed total mixed rations containing either 3. 2, 8. 0 or 11. 2 % <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> pomace. Results: The replacement of dietary soybean meal by <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> pomace did not affect feed intake, but was found to change various indices of rumen fermentation. Increasing intakes of <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> pomace caused increasing ruminal pH values and ammonia concentrations in a dose-dependent fashion, but concentrations of volatile fatty acids and number of ruminal bacteria were left unchanged. Higher dietary inclusion levels of tomato pomace produced a linear, dose-related increase in blood urea concentrations. Apparent, total gastro-intestinal tract digestibilities of neutral and acid-detergent fiber were not influenced by tomato pomace. The feeding of tomato pomace raised fecal nitrogen excretion and lowered urinary nitrogen excretion. Conclusion: Substitution of tomato pomace for soybean meal influences rumen fermentation and nitrogen metabolism in beef cattle, but the impact on practical ruminant production cannot yet be assessed...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the effect of different levels of <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> seeds, DTS (10, 20 and 30 %) on the growth performance, digestibility, carcass traits and blood biochemical parameters of rabbits. Twenty four of New Zealand White rabbits of averaged 940 g body weight (6 weeks of age) were divided into four groups, of six each. The first group was fed a basal diet (0 %dried tomato seeds) and considered as control, while the other three groups were fed the basal diet after substituting part of the diet with <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> seeds at 10, 20 and 30 %, respectively. Weight gains and feed conversion were significant (P< 0. 05) differences between different treated groups. Digestion coefficients of ether extract and crude fibre recorded the highest values with diet contained 20 % <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> seeds compared to other treated groups, while dry matter and crude protein were not affected significantly. Dressing percentages of carcasses were affected significantly by levels of <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> seeds, while relative weight percentages of organs (liver, kidneys, heart and lungs) not affected. Total protein, albumin and globulin of the blood were not affected significantly by levels of <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> seeds, while urea was higher compared with control.

Numerical evaluation of the simplified Fick’s law for Fourier number showed that the effective moisture diffusivity increased from 0. 193 × 10 – 9 to 1. 893 × 10 – 9 m 2 /s, from 0. 059 × 10 – 9 to 2. 885 × 10 – 9 m 2 /s, and, from 0. 170 × 10 – 9 to 4. 531 × 10 – 9 m 2 /s for the 7, 9, and 11 mm thick slices as moisture content decreased. Application of FIR enhanced the flavour of the <b>dried</b> <b>tomatoes</b> by 36. 6 % when compared with the raw ones. The results demonstrate that in addition to shorter drying times, the flavour of the products can be enhanced with FIR. Therefore, FIR drying should be considered as an efficient <b>drying</b> method for <b>tomato</b> with respect to minimization of processing time, enhancement in flavour, and improvements in the quality and functional property of <b>dried</b> <b>tomatoes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to standardise the duration and temperatures of the conventional oven drying methods for best physical and sensory characteristics of <b>dried</b> <b>tomato.</b> The experiment consisted of two factor factorial design (3 * 2) with three levels of drying temperature (70 °C, 80 °C and 90 °C) and two levels of drying duration (7 and 8 hours) with three replications. An improved and high yielding variety (Cochoro) of tomato released in 2007 for processing and widely grown in Ziwai (Maki), Ethiopia was used. Prior to <b>drying,</b> individual <b>tomato</b> fruits were washed and sliced into uniform thickness (8 mm); then, the slices were placed on to the drying trays in a single layer to facilitate uniform drying in hot air oven set at predetermined temperatures per the respective treatments. Data were collected on different physical and sensory attributes and analysed using SAS software (version 9. 2). The results showed that titratable acidity, total soluble solids and water absorption capacity were significantly (p≤ 0. 001) increased due to the interaction of degree of temperature and duration of oven drying. In contrast, pH and water activity decreased as the drying temperature and duration increased. Drying at 70 °C for 7 hours produced <b>dried</b> <b>tomatoes</b> with the highest sensorial acceptability and physical attributes while higher temperatures (80, 90 °C) and longer duration (9 hours) significantly detract the quality of <b>dried</b> <b>tomato.</b> Hence, it is possible to add value and preserve <b>tomatoes</b> through oven <b>drying</b> at the right temperature and optimum duration...|$|R

In {{order to determine the}} safety of the <b>dried</b> <b>tomato,</b> the bacteria and mould loads were determined using three sliced thicknesses of solar energy dried samples. Two different types of agar culture media were used to culture the released bacteria and mould cells. Ascorbic acid and proximate tests were carried out to determine the nutritional value of the dried product as compared with the fresh products. To determine the wholesomeness of the dried product, the organoleptic properties in terms of colour (appearance) and taste (flavour) were examined and compared with those of three other tomato products. Results showed that the mean viable bacteria count ranged from 9 to 13 colonies/ml with the 25 mm thickness giving the highest value, followed by 20 mm thickness and the least value was from 15 mm thickness. The same pattern was observed for mould infection. The infection range for the three slice thicknesses was within the recommended safe limit of ≤ 30 colony forming unit/ml for bacteria and mould counts in food products. There was substantial drop in ascorbic acid content from 28. 2 mg/ 100 g for fresh ripe tomato to as low as 13. 6 mg/ 100 g for <b>dried</b> <b>tomato</b> of 25 mm slice thickness and highest value of 20. 6 mg/ 100 g for 20 mm thickness.

In the 12 week experiment, hens (27 to 38 weeks of age) were allocated to four dietary treatments being: DTP 0, DTP 50, DTP 100 and DTP 150 of 72 birds each, and received a diet ad libitum. The diet for DTP 0 treatment had no DTP (control), while those for treatments DTP 50, DTP 100 and DTP 150 included 50, 100 and 150 kg/t of DTP, respectively. Inclusion of DTP at levels up to 100 kg/t in diets of laying hens increased egg production and egg mass by 2. 7 % and 4. 1 %, respectively, compared to the control and resulted in similar traits, relative to final BW, egg weight, daily feed consumption, egg shell weight, egg shell thickness, haugh units and yolk color.
