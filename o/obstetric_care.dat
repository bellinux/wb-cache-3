5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, ectopic pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for <b>obstetric</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
500|$|Improvements in {{maternal}} health, {{in addition}} to professional assistance at delivery, will require routine antenatal care, basic emergency <b>obstetric</b> <b>care,</b> including the availability of antibiotics, oxytocics, anticonvulsants, the ability to manually remove a retained placenta, perform instrumented deliveries, and postpartum care. Research has shown the most effective programmes are those focussing on patient and community education, prenatal care, emergency obstetrics (including access to cesarean sections) and transportation. As with women's health in general, solutions to maternal health require a broad view encompassing {{many of the other}} MDG goals, such as poverty and status, and given that most deaths occur in the immediate intrapartum period, it has been recommended that [...] care (delivery) be a core strategy. New guidelines on antenatal care were issued by WHO in November 2016.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{study area}} is the Birbhum {{district}} of the State of West Bengal in India. It {{is one of the}} backward districts in India. Objectives. The paper investigates the existing pattern of <b>obstetric</b> health <b>care</b> practices and the factors associated with the utilization of such care. Method. The present analysis includes 495 adult married women of both rural and urban areas of nine Blocks of Birbhum district. Besides performing x 2 tests to see the association of the relevant individual and household characteristics, logistic regression was also carried out to measure the effect of these characteristics on the use of <b>obstetric</b> health <b>care.</b> Results. In Birbhum district of West Bengal 65 percent mothers go to doctors for antenatal check-up during their pregnancy, but only 26 percent mothers deliver their babies in institutions and 30 percent mothers get the help of professional health assistants during delivery. Educated women have emphasized role in the practice of <b>obstetric</b> health <b>care.</b> Husband’s education and the standard of living of the family also have some effect on the practice of antenatal check up, place of delivery and assistance of health professional. While most of the family background variables have significant effect on the practice of antenatal check up, these variables do not have much effect on the choice of delivery or seeking assistance of health professionals. Contrary to the popular belief the working status of women does not have favourable influence on the <b>obstetric</b> health <b>care</b> practices. In developing countries like India, it is the poverty, which compels the women to take jobs—that too in low paid jobs especially in rural backward areas. Conclusion. The status of literacy of mothers and standard of living of the family are of prime importance in improving the <b>obstetric</b> health <b>care</b> practices...|$|R

2500|$|UNFPA {{estimated}} that 289,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2013. These causes range from severe bleeding to obstructed labour, {{all of which}} have highly effective interventions [...] As women have gained access to family planning and skilled birth attendance with backup emergency <b>obstetric</b> <b>care,</b> the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 380 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 210 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013, and many countries halved their maternal death rates in the last 10 years.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{maternal}} {{deaths are}} avoidable, as the health-care solutions {{to prevent or}} manage complications are well known. Improving access to antenatal care in pregnancy, skilled care during childbirth, and care and support {{in the weeks after}} childbirth will reduce maternal deaths significantly [...] It is particularly important that all births be attended by skilled health professionals, as timely management and treatment can make {{the difference between life and}} death. To improve maternal health, barriers that limit access to quality maternal health services must be identified and addressed at all levels of the health [...] system. Recommendations for reducing maternal mortality include access to health care, access to family planning services, and emergency <b>obstetric</b> <b>care,</b> funding and intrapartum care. Reduction in unnecessary obstetric surgery has also been suggested.|$|E

2500|$|Four {{elements}} {{are essential to}} maternal death prevention, according to UNFPA. First, prenatal care. It is recommended that expectant mothers receive at least four antenatal visits to check and monitor the health of mother and fetus. Second, skilled birth attendance with emergency backup such as doctors, nurses and midwives who have the skills to manage normal deliveries and recognize the onset of complications. Third, emergency <b>obstetric</b> <b>care</b> to address the major causes of maternal death which are hemorrhage, sepsis, unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labour. Lastly, postnatal care which is the six weeks following delivery. During this time bleeding, sepsis and hypertensive disorders can occur and newborns are extremely vulnerable {{in the immediate aftermath}} of birth. Therefore, follow-up visits by a health worker to assess the health of both mother and child in the postnatal period is strongly recommended.|$|E
2500|$|Historically {{women have}} been {{attended}} and supported by other women during labour and birth. However currently, as more women are giving birth in a hospital rather than at home, continuous support has become {{the exception rather than}} the norm. When women became pregnant any time before the 1950s the husband would not be in the birthing room. It did not matter if it was a home birth; the husband was waiting downstairs or in another room in the home. If it was in a hospital then the husband was in the waiting room. [...] "Her husband was attentive and kind, but, Kirby concluded, Every good woman needs a companion of her own sex." [...] <b>Obstetric</b> <b>care</b> frequently subjects women to institutional routines, which may have adverse effects on the progress of labour. Supportive care during labour may involve emotional support, comfort measures, and information and advocacy which may promote the physical process of [...] labour as well as women's feelings of control and competence, thus reducing the need for obstetric intervention. The continuous support may be provided either by hospital staff such as nurses or midwives, doulas, or by companions of the woman's choice from her social network. [...] There is increasing evidence to show that the participation of the child's father in the birth leads to better birth and also post-birth outcomes, providing the father does not exhibit excessive anxiety.|$|E

50|$|One {{major issue}} in regards to {{maternal}} health is access to quality emergency <b>obstetric</b> <b>care</b> and the many barriers Ugandan women face {{to gain access to}} such care. A needs assessment of emergency <b>obstetric</b> <b>care</b> was carried out in 197 health facilities in 19 out of 5 health districts in Uganda, covering 38% of the total population. The study found in 2005, that there was a large number of missing signal functions at health facilities and an urgent need to improve the availability of emergency <b>obstetric</b> <b>care.</b> It was found that the improvement of care begins by improving district health workers' skills in emergency <b>obstetric</b> <b>care</b> so that they can effectively manage and treat obstetric complications. Part of this training includes hospital staff on how to properly manage data systems to better monitor and evaluate program implementation. An effective advocacy tool, known as REDUCE, has already been developed for Uganda to stimulate policy dialog and strategic planning.

The influence of method of cardiotocograph recording on inter-observer variation in respect of suggested management of the patient, as well as the observer's opinion of the duration of the recording. Results. Variation in suggested management decreased significantly after assessment of the computer reports, compared with the standard cardiotocographs. While delivery was regarded to be indicated in 3. 5 % of patients and an immediate repeat of the cardiotocograph in a further 10 %, no such action was proposed after evaluation of the computer reports of the same recordings. Thirty-four per cent of tracings were considered to have been too long and 12. 5 % too short. However, suggested management in 40 % of the latter cases seemed inappropriate for tracings regarded as of too short a duration. Conclusion. While computer-assisted cardiotocographs significantly decrease inter-observer variation in the proposed management of patients, its cost-effectiveness in an <b>obstetric</b> special <b>care</b> unit in a developing country should be validated, as it might increase monitoring time.

40|$|Background: Regular {{monitoring}} and assessment of performance indicators for emergency <b>obstetric</b> and newborn <b>care</b> can help to identify priorities to improve health services for women and newborns. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform a district wide assessment of emergency <b>obstetric</b> and newborn <b>care</b> performance and identify ways for improvement. Methods: Facility assessment of 13 dispensaries, four health centers and one district hospital in a rural district in Tanzania was performed in two data collection periods in 2014. Assessment included a facility walk-through to observe facility infrastructure and interviews with facility in-charges to assess available services, staff and supplies. In addition facility statistics were collected for the year 2013. Results were discussed with district representatives. Results: Approximately 65 % of expected births took place in health facilities and 22 % of women with complications were treated in facilities expected to provide emergency care. None of the facilities was, however, able to perform at the expected level for emergency <b>obstetric</b> and newborn <b>care</b> since not all required signal functions could be provided. Inadequate availability of essential drugs such as uterotonics, antibiotics and anticonvulsants as well as lack of ability to perform vacuum extraction and blood transfusion limited performance. Conclusions: Performance of emergency <b>obstetric</b> and newborn <b>care</b> in Magu District was not in accordance with expected guidelines and highly influenced by lack of available resources and an insufficiently functioning health care system.
