Hayley and Michaela both died of smoke inhalation.|$|E
5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing from a movie that some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to have been thinking about what the episode would entail almost two years prior, when he was working on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of the nuclear power plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E

Thirty-three passengers and two crew members were quickly recovered, but two passengers, a 20-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl, both part of a tour group from Hungary, were killed. The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the Tugboat mate's (responsible for driving the tug at the time) inattention to his duties. The tugboat mate was sentenced to 366 days in federal prison.|$|R

Multiple resistant organisms were cultured from the wound and he was commenced on a course of ertapenem and discharged. Post discharge, he experienced marked nocturnal visual hallucinations on a daily basis. On multiple occasions, the presence of his close friends was perceived as real and he engaged in sensible conversation, only to notice their actual absence after a brief period of time.

40|$|The {{most salient}} aspect of memory is {{its role in}} {{preserving}} previously acquired information {{so as to make}} it available for further activities. Anna realizes that something is amiss in a book on Roman history because she learned and remembers that Caesar was murdered.

The fact that information is preserved distinguishes memory from imagination. But how do acquisition and retrieval of information contribute to the phenomenology of memory?The exclusive aim of this chapter is to sketch a map of the phenomenology of memory. It is structured as follows. In section 1, I introduce the contrast between content (what is remembered) and psychological attitude (remembering). This distinction will be helpful in disentangling issues in the phenomenology of memory. Section 2 is devoted to the contribution of memory content to phenomenology, section 3 to the contribution of the attitude of remembering...|$|R
40|$|Much {{information}} {{can be obtained from}} knowing what tasks the user does <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> This paper describes GuiDE, an automated user-activity recognition system on the mobile phone. GuiDE's unique approach to activity recognition exploits GUI screenshots taken as the individual interacts with their <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> These screenshots are aggregated into a graph to help probabilistically determine whether or not a set of screenshots can be considered a user-level activity. A frequency count of different sets of screenshots is also kept to act as a sanity check against the probabilistic result. GuiDE is just a partial step towards a much more powerful tool that can correlate GUI information with other services to provide a better understanding of user activity. by Emily Z. Yan. Thesis (M.

25|$|A {{road rage}} {{incident}} {{on the side}} of the highway led to the death of Richard Aderson in 1997. Aderson, an assistant superintendent at the Valley Central School District in Montgomery, was returning to his LaGrange home on the evening of February5, 1997, when he had a minor collision with a relatively new green Jeep Cherokee carrying what appeared to be New Hampshire license plates just before crossing the NewburghBeacon Bridge. The two drivers pulled over near exit12, and after a brief argument the other driver shot Aderson and left the scene. Aderson was able to give the 9-1-1 operator he called <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> a description of his assailant and the vehicle before dying at the scene. A police sketch based on Aderson's description has been widely circulated and is still posted prominently in kiosks at the freeway's rest areas.

To save lives and prevent injuries on roadways, inter-vehicle communication {{as well as}} communication between vehicles and roadside is required. Intelligent Transportation system (ITS) is a mission of the US department of transportation which focuses on intelligent vehicles, intelligent infrastructure {{and the creation of}} an intelligent transportation system through integration with and between these two components. Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) is a tool approved for licensing by the FCC in 2003 which promises to partially fulfill this mission. This research utilizes DSRC infrastructure to communicate the traffic safety information available at the roadside to a Bluetooth enabled <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> inside the vehicle. A major objective of this research project was to design, build and demonstrate a wireless communication interface device which can act as a traffic-safety-information transportation agent between the DSRC vehicle radio unit and a Bluetooth enabled <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> inside a vehicle. By having this interface device along with the DSRC radio unit in a vehicle as a separate entity or integrated with a DSRC unit, any driver will be able to receive the valuable traffic safety messages <b>on</b> <b>his</b> Bluetooth enabled <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> The system prototype was designed and built. The demonstration was given for multiple road and traffic scenarios by successfully transmitting the traffic safety messages to the Bluetooth enabled <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> This prototype system {{can be used as a}} building block for a diverse array of traffic safety applications...|$|R

Eventually, after being confronted, the city councilman agrees to stop the spraying and blood test the community under the guise of a cholesterol study. Mulder and Scully, reading that Funsch has not been tested yet, arrive at his house to find it strewn with smashed electronic devices. Mulder deduces that blood is Ed's phobia and that he has seen the subliminal messages, and an empty rifle case signals that Funsch is going to act on his paranoia.

Andy, upset that Erin is not in the audience, repeatedly checks for messages from her <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> While he is on stage, his phone rings in his pocket, disrupting the musical and forcing the performers to improvise. To make matters worse, Michael drops his bottle of wine, causing a commotion as it rolls. Then he loses grip of balloons he brought to his seat, which pop as they hit the top of the hall. This startles a baby, and the sound of her cries alerts Jim and Pam to the fact that Erin came to the play with CeCe, exciting Andy, but angering Jim and Pam. At the end of the show, everyone cheers except for Michael, who angrily boos the actor playing Sweeney Todd.
