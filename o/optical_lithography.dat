2500|$|Pellicles are {{normally}} expected {{to protect the}} mask from particles during transport, entry into or exit from the exposure chamber, {{as well as the}} exposure itself. Without pellicles, particle adders would reduce yield, which has not been an issue for conventional <b>optical</b> <b>lithography</b> with 193nm light and pellicles. However, for EUV, the feasibility of pellicle use is severely challenged, due to the required thinness of the shielding films to prevent excessive EUV absorption. Particle contamination would be prohibitive if pellicles were not stable above 200 W, i.e., the targeted power for manufacturing.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike <b>optical</b> <b>lithography,</b> {{there are}} {{multiple}} exposure limits, identified as the top dose, bottom dose, and critical dose, whose values must be determined experimentally for a proper exposure. [...] The exposure must be sufficient {{to meet the requirements}} of the bottom dose, the exposure under which a photoresist residue will remain, and the top dose, the exposure over which the photoresist will foam. [...] The critical dose is the exposure at which unexposed resist begins to be attacked. [...] Due to the insensitivity of PMMA, a typical exposure time for a [...] thick PMMA is six hours. [...] During exposure, secondary radiation effects such as Fresnel diffraction, mask and substrate fluorescence, and the generation of Auger electrons and photoelectrons can lead to overexposure.|$|E

40|$|The current {{nanofabrication}} techniques including {{electron beam}} lithography provide fabrication resolution in the nanometre range. The major limitation of these techniques is their incapability of arbitrary three-dimensional nanofabrication. This has stimulated the rapid development of far-field three-dimensional <b>optical</b> beam <b>lithography</b> where a laser beam is focused for maskless direct writing. However, the diffraction nature of light is a barrier for achieving nanometre feature and resolution in <b>optical</b> beam <b>lithography.</b> Here we report on three-dimensional <b>optical</b> beam <b>lithography</b> with 9 nm feature size and 52 nm two-line resolution in a newly developed two-photon absorption resin with high mechanical strength. The revealed dependence of the feature size and the two-line resolution confirms that they can reach deep sub-diffraction scale but are limited by the mechanical strength of the new resin.

50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>lithography,</b> {{which has}} been the {{predominant}} patterning technique since the advent of the semiconductor age, is capable of producing sub-100-nm patterns with the use of very short optical wavelengths. Several <b>optical</b> <b>lithography</b> techniques require the use of liquid immersion and a host of resolution enhancement technologies like phase-shift masks (PSM) and optical proximity correction (OPC). Multiple patterning is a method of increasing the resolution by printing features in between pre-printed features on the same layer by etching or creating sidewall spacers, and has been used in commercial production of microprocessors since the 32 nm process node e.g. by directed self-assembly (DSA). Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) uses ultrashort wavelengths (13.5 nm) and as of 2015, is the most popularly considered Next-generation lithography (NGL) technique for mass-fabrication.|$|E
40|$|A 77 -GHz {{automotive}} radar system for collision avoidance and {{intelligent cruise control}} has recently gained interest because of its huge market potential. The questions of the optimum technological and system approaches leading to both low cost and high performance {{have not yet been}} finally answered. The approach to this problem reported here differs mainly in two aspects from the GaAs monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) solutions described earlier: 1) 0. 12 -mu m gatelength pseudormorphic high electron mobility transistors (PHEMT's) are fabricated by <b>optical</b> stepper <b>lithography,</b> 2) a coplanar design is used.

40|$|Lithographic {{processes}} {{belong to}} the most critical steps in the fabrication of microelectronic circuits. <b>Optical</b> projection <b>lithography</b> which transfers the layout of a mask into a photoresist at the top surface of a silicon wafer is still the workhorse of semiconductor industry. Many innovations regarding the optical imaging system {{and the introduction of}} new mask technologies have pushed optical projection techniques close to their theoretical limits. Nowadays, <b>optical</b> projection <b>lithography</b> is used to create 45 nm features with a wavelength of 193 nm. This paper discusses the impact of the mask on the performance of a lithographic process. For large feature sizes the mask can be considered as infinitely thin and its local transmission and phase can be directly derived from the design. For mask features comparable to the wavelength of the used light and below, the mask becomes a complex scattering object which has a pronounced impact on the intensity, phase, and polariza tion of the diffracted light. The light diffraction from the mask has to be computed by rigorous electromagnetic methods. Several consequences with respect to the choice of most appropriate mask materials and geometries will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The imaging {{specifications}} for extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) projection optics parallel {{those of other}} <b>optical</b> <b>lithographies.</b> Specifications are scaled to reflect the 100 nm critical dimension for the first generation EUVL systems. The design being fabricated for the Engineering Test Stand, an EUVL alpha tool, consists of a condenser with six channels to provide an effective partial coherence factor of 0. 7. The camera contains four mirrors; three of the mirrors are aspheres and the fourth is spherical. The design of the optical package has been constrained so that the angles of incidence and the variations in the angle of incidence of all rays allow for uniform multilayer coatings. The multilayers introduce a slight shift in image position and magnification. We have shown that a system aligned with visible light is also aligned at 13. 4 nm. Each mirror must be fabricated with an RMS figure error of less than 0. 25 nm and better than 0. 2 nm RMS roughness. Optical surfaces that exceed each of these specifications individually have been fabricated. The success of EUVL requires that these specifications be met simultaneously...|$|R
