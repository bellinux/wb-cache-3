5|$|Clinical data alone may be {{sufficient}} for {{a diagnosis of}} MS if an individual has had separate episodes of neurological symptoms characteristic of the disease. In those who seek medical attention after only one attack, other testing is needed for the diagnosis. The most commonly used diagnostic tools are neuroimaging, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and evoked potentials. Magnetic resonance imaging {{of the brain and}} spine may show areas of demyelination (lesions or plaques). Gadolinium can be administered intravenously as a contrast agent to highlight active plaques and, by elimination, demonstrate the existence of historical lesions not associated with symptoms at the moment of the evaluation. Testing of cerebrospinal fluid obtained from a lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation in the central nervous system. The cerebrospinal fluid is tested for <b>oligoclonal</b> bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75–85% of people with MS. The nervous system in MS may respond less actively to stimulation of the optic nerve and sensory nerves due to demyelination of such pathways. These brain responses can be examined using visual- and sensory-evoked potentials.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for a virus {{as a cause}} {{include the}} {{presence}} of <b>oligoclonal</b> bands {{in the brain and}} cerebrospinal fluid of most people with MS, the association of several viruses with human demyelination encephalomyelitis, and the occurrence of demyelination in animals caused by some viral infections. Human herpes viruses are a candidate group of viruses. Individuals having never been infected by the Epstein–Barr virus are at a reduced risk of getting MS, whereas those infected as young adults are at a greater risk than those having had it at a younger age. Although some consider that this goes against the hygiene hypothesis, since the non-infected have probably experienced a more hygienic upbringing, others believe that there is no contradiction, since it is a first encounter with the causative virus relatively late in life that is the trigger for the disease. Other diseases that may be related include measles, mumps and rubella.|$|E
25|$|AQP4-Ab-negative NMO {{presents}} {{problems for}} diagnosis. The {{behavior of the}} <b>oligoclonal</b> bands respect MS can help to establish a more accurate diagnosis. <b>Oligoclonal</b> bands in NMO are rare {{and they tend to}} disappear after the attacks, while in MS they are nearly always present and persistent.|$|E
25|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} may demonstrate raised protein level, pleiocytosis (i.e. increased {{presence of}} both lymphocytes and neutrophil granulocytes) and <b>oligoclonal</b> bands. Various other tests (e.g. ACE level in CSF) have little added value.|$|E
25|$|Differences {{have been}} found between the proteines {{expressed}} by patients and healthy subjects, and between attacks and remissions. Using DNA microarray technology groups of molecular biomarkers can be established. For example, {{it is known that}} Anti-lipid <b>oligoclonal</b> IgM bands (OCMB) distinguish MS patients with early aggressive course and that these patients show a favourable response to immunomodulatory treatment.|$|E
25|$|At {{least five}} {{characteristics}} {{are present in}} CNS tissues of MS patients: Inflammation beyond classical white matter lesions, intrathecal Ig production with <b>oligoclonal</b> bands, an environment fostering immune cell persistence, Follicle-like aggregates in the meninges and a disruption of the blood–brain barrier also outside of active lesions. The scars that give the name to the condition are produced by the astrocyte cells healing old lesions.|$|E
25|$|Whether Devic's {{disease is}} a {{distinct}} disease {{or part of the}} wide spectrum of multiple sclerosis is debated. Devic's disease differs in that it usually has more severe sequelae after an acute episode than standard MS, MS infrequently presents as transverse myelitis, and <b>oligoclonal</b> bands in the CSF, as well as white matter lesions on brain MRI, are uncommon in Devic's disease, but occur in over 90% of MS patients.|$|E
25|$|For some {{investigation}} teams {{this means that}} MS is an immunopathogenetically heterogeneous disease. The latter hypothesis is further corroborated by a recent study that demonstrated significant differences in routine cerebrospinal fluid findings between patients with pattern I lesions and patients with non-pattern I lesions, including a lack of CSF-restricted <b>oligoclonal</b> bands, in most pattern II and III patients. Finally, some previously diagnosed with pattern II MS were later found to have in fact MOG-IgG-related encephalomyelitis, suggesting that both the current clinicoradiological diagnostic criteria for MS and the histopathological criteria for MS may be insufficiently specific. This was already indicated by previous studies that found a relatively high rate of false diagnoses of MS among patients with AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or MOG encephalomyelitis.|$|E
2500|$|CSF <b>oligoclonal</b> bands can be {{reflected}} in serum or not. This points to an heterogeneous origin of them ...|$|E
2500|$|CSF {{also shows}} <b>oligoclonal</b> bands (OCB) in the {{majority}} (around 95%) of the patients. Several studies have reported differences between patients with and without OCB with regard to clinical parameters such as age, gender, disease duration, clinical severity and several MRI characteristics, together with a varying lesion load.|$|E
2500|$|Micro-RNA are non-coding RNA {{of around}} 22 {{nucleotides}} in length. They {{are present in}} blood and in CSF. Several studies have found specific micro-RNA signatures for MS. They have been proposed as biomarkers {{for the presence of}} the disease and its evolution and some of them like miR-150 are under study, specially for those with lipid-specific <b>oligoclonal</b> IgM bands ...|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis of MS {{has always}} been made by {{clinical}} examination, supported by MRI or CSF tests. According with both the pure autoimmune hypothesis and the immune-mediated hypothesis, researchers expect to find biomarkers able to yield a better diagnosis, and able to predict {{the response to the}} different available treatments. As of 2014 no biomarker with perfect correlation has been found, but some of them have shown a special behavior like IgG- and IgM- <b>oligoclonal</b> bands in the cerebrospinal fluid and autoantibodies against neurotropic viruses (MRZ reaction) [...] and the potassium channel Kir4.1.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oligoclonal</b> {{bands are}} an {{important}} indicator in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Up to 95% of all patients with multiple sclerosis have permanently observable <b>oligoclonal</b> bands.|$|E

The {{behavior of the}} <b>oligoclonal</b> bands respect MS can help to establish a more accurate diagnosis. <b>Oligoclonal</b> bands in NMO are rare {{and they tend to}} disappear after the attacks, while in MS they are nearly always present and persistent.|$|E
5000|$|CSF {{also shows}} <b>oligoclonal</b> bands (OCB) in the {{majority}} (around 95%) of the patients.

CSF <b>oligoclonal</b> bands can be reflected in serum or not. This points to an heterogeneous origin of them ...|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{the main}} {{importance}} of <b>oligoclonal</b> bands {{is to demonstrate}} the production of intrathecal immunoglobins (IgGs). Currently alternative methods for detection of this intrathecal synthesis have been published. Specially interesting are the free light chains (FLC), specially the kappa-FLCs (kFLCs). Several authors have reported that the nephelometric and ELISA FLCs determination is comparable with OCBs as markers of IgG synthesis, and kFLCs behave even better than <b>oligoclonal</b> bands.|$|E
5000|$|Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) shows normal protein, glucose, {{white blood}} cell, and IgG index {{but there are}} weak <b>oligoclonal</b> bands, absent in the blood. Marked changes in {{circadian}} serum levels of neurohormones and increased levels of peripheral neurotransmitters were also observed. The absence of morphological alterations of the brain pathology, the suggestion of diffusion of IgG into the thalamus and striatum, more marked than in the cortex (consistent with effects on the thalamolimbic system) the <b>oligoclonal</b> bands in the CSF and the amelioration after PE all strongly support an antibody-mediated basis for the condition. Raised CSF IgG concentrations and <b>oligoclonal</b> bands {{have been reported in}} patients with psychosis. Anti-acetylcholine receptors (anti-AChR) antibodies have also been detected in patients with thymoma, but without clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis. [...] There have also been reports of non-paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis associated with raised serum VGKC suggesting that these antibodies may give rise to a spectrum of neurological disease presenting with symptoms arising peripherally, centrally, or both. Yet, in two cases, <b>oligoclonal</b> bands were absent in the CSF and serum, and CSF immunoglobulin profiles were unremarkable.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{the first}} {{widespread}} set of criteria were the Schumacher criteria (also spelled sometimes Schumacker). Currently, testing of cerebrospinal fluid {{obtained from a}} lumbar puncture can provide evidence of chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, looking for <b>oligoclonal</b> bands of IgG on electrophoresis, which are inflammation markers found in 75-85% of people with MS., {{but at the time}} of Schumacher criteria, <b>oligoclonal</b> bands tests were not available, and they also lacked MRI.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oligoclonal</b> bands (OCBs) are {{bands of}} {{immunoglobulins}} that are seen when a patient's blood serum, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is analyzed.|$|E
50|$|HHV-6 {{specific}} OCBs {{have also}} been found in other demyelinating diseases. A lytic protein of HHV-6A virus was identified as the target of HHV-6 specific <b>oligoclonal</b> bands.|$|E
5000|$|It {{presents}} three clinical subtypes: Monophasic, relapsing-remitting {{and primary}} rapidly progressive. CSF is either normal or shows mild mononuclear inflammatory reaction. <b>Oligoclonal</b> bands are present only in few cases ...|$|E
5000|$|Some PPMS {{patients}} with a special biomarker (Immunoglobulin M <b>oligoclonal</b> bands) {{have been shown to}} respond to standard RRMS medications, though there is only preliminary evidence waiting to be confirmed ...|$|E
50|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} may demonstrate raised protein level, pleiocytosis (i.e. increased {{presence of}} both lymphocytes and neutrophil granulocytes) and <b>oligoclonal</b> bands. Various other tests (e.g. ACE level in CSF) have little added value.|$|E
5000|$|Around 95% of MS cases present <b>oligoclonal</b> {{bands in}} CSF. Nevertheless, {{there are cases}} of real MS {{that do not have}} them. It is {{suspected}} to be immunogenetically different. Their evolution is better than standard MS patients ...|$|E
50|$|Examination of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) shows elevated numbers of lymphocytes (but usually < 100 cells/µl); elevated CSF protein (but usually <1.5 g/l), normal glucose, elevated IgG index and <b>oligoclonal</b> bands. Patients with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels {{may have a}} completely normal CSF examination.|$|E
5000|$|IgG {{synthetic}} rate {{is calculated}} from measured IgG and total protein levels; it is elevated in immune {{disorders such as}} multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, and neuromyelitis optica of Devic. <b>Oligoclonal</b> bands may be detected in CSF but not in serum, suggesting intrathecal antibody production.|$|E
5000|$|In {{respect to}} the {{pathology}} of the RIS cases, we can point out that they show cortical lesions, mainly in patients with <b>oligoclonal</b> bands. Macroscopic damage is similar to RRMS cases but milder. Cervical cord lesions are an important predictor of progression and the quotient N-acetylaspartate to creatine suggest axonal damage ...|$|E
50|$|MM-151 is an <b>oligoclonal</b> {{mixture of}} fully human {{monoclonal}} antibodies, which binds multiple {{parts of the}} EGFR molecule It has started clinical trials in patients with RAS wild-type colorectal cancers (CRCs) that were resistant to other anti-EGFR therapies. It is intended to overcome the problem of cancers becoming resistant to monoclonal antibody therapies.|$|E

50|$|Responses {{were often}} of short {{duration}} and faded days after administration. In 2002, lymphodepletion using a nonmyeloablative chemotherapy regimen administered immediately before TIL transfer increased cancer regression, {{as well as}} the persistent <b>oligoclonal</b> repopulation of the host with the transferred lymphocytes. In some patients, the administered antitumor cells represented up to 80% of the CD8+ T cells months after the infusion.|$|E
50|$|These {{criteria}} were later substituted by Poser criteria and McDonald criteria. Poser criteria introduced the CNS <b>oligoclonal</b> bands into the diagnosis criteria, while McDonald criteria {{focus on a}} demonstration with clinical, laboratory and radiologic data of the dissemination of MS lesions {{in time and space}} for non-invasive MS diagnosis. All the later {{criteria were}} heavily influenced by the original Schumacher work.|$|E
50|$|Cerebrospinal fluid {{is a clear}} bodily fluid that {{occupies}} the subarachnoid space and the ventricular system around and inside the brain. It is revealed that 70-80% of Parenchymal NBD patients show altered CSF constituents. The observed different is 1) Elevated CSF protein concentration (1 g/dL), 2) Absence of <b>oligoclonal</b> band, and 3) elevated CSF cell count (0-400×10⁶ cells/L) in the body.|$|E

The scars that give the name to the condition are produced by the astrocyte cells healing old lesions.|$|E
50|$|A {{diagnosis}} of leukemia can generally {{be ruled out}} in these patients based on the unremarkable appearance of small resting lymphocytes in the blood; however, patients must be closely monitored for any signs of monoclonal or <b>oligoclonal</b> B cell expansion because {{there may be an}} increased risk for B cell malignancy. Specifically, one patient with BENTA disease was reported as having developed B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) as an adult.|$|E
