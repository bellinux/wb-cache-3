5|$|The {{onset of}} the Second World War {{demonstrated}} that the League had failed in its primary purpose, the prevention of another world war. There were a variety <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this failure, many connected to general weaknesses within the organisation. Additionally, {{the power of the}} League was limited by the United States' refusal to join.|$|E
5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There were a couple <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan {{in the hope of}} gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{was back}} in Paris in May 1147 {{to meet with the}} new pope, Eugene III; among the issues {{probably}} discussed was Theobald's dispute with Bernard of St David's. Relations at this time between Theobald and Stephen seem to have been good, but when Eugene summoned the English bishops to the Council of Rheims in April 1148 the king forbade all of them from attending except for three he nominated: Chichester, Hereford and Norwich. Despite having been specifically refused permission Theobald sneaked away in a fishing boat, presumably accompanied by Gilbert Foliot, who attended the council with him. Theobald had a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> defying the king: chiefly his obedience to the pope's order commanding his attendance, but also to keep the papacy from favouring the newly elected Archbishop of York, Henry Murdac, in the disputes between York and Canterbury. Murdac was known to be close to his fellow Cistercian Eugene.|$|E

25|$|After his death, al-Kindi's {{philosophical}} works quickly {{fell into}} obscurity {{and many of}} them were lost even to later Islamic scholars and historians. Felix Klein-Franke suggests a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this: aside from the militant orthodoxy of al-Mutawakkil, the Mongols also destroyed countless libraries during their invasion. However, he says the most probable cause of this was that his writings never found popularity amongst subsequent influential philosophers such as al-Farabi and Avicenna, who ultimately overshadowed him.|$|E

25|$|In 1959 Boulez left Paris for Baden-Baden, moving {{eventually}} {{into a large}} hillside villa at Kapuzinerstraße 9, {{which was}} his main residence {{for the rest of}} his life. Robert Piencikowski suggests a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the move to Germany: excellent rehearsal conditions with the South-West German Radio orchestra, with which he had an arrangement to work as composer-in-residence and to conduct some smaller concerts; an electronic studio where he could work on a new piece (Poésie pour pouvoir); but also disenchantment with the cultural and political climate in France under de Gaulle at the time of the Algerian war.|$|E

GMG cited a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> replacing Jazz FM, including poor listening figures, not making money, the 'Jazz' name putting off potential listeners {{as well as}} not enough jazz for jazz purists. The Jazz FM name was retained by GMG for the relaunched ejazz.fm website service which was renamed jazzfm.com {{on the same day}} as the launch of Smooth FM. The station broadcast on digital satellite, online and on spare DAB capacity in Yorkshire, South Wales and the Severn Estuary where 102.2 Smooth FM and the defunct Smooth Digital service would have been duplicated.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton's {{article and}} the Court Report examine a variety <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the planned revolt. Extremely {{dependent}} on slavery, many Charleston residents had been alarmed about the Missouri Compromise of 1820 that restricted slavery from expansion {{to the western}} territories, feeling it threatened the future of slavery. Some suggested that slaves had learned about the compromise and thought {{they were to be}} emancipated. Whites blamed the AME Church, they blamed rising slave literacy, and the African slaves brought from Haiti during its Revolution. In 1822, beleaguered whites in Charleston uniformly believed that blacks had planned a large insurrection; such a scenario represented their worst fears.|$|E
25|$|Within the EU, Spain had the 2nd highest {{immigration}} rate in percentage terms after Cyprus, {{but by a}} great margin, the highest in absolute numbers, up to 2008. The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2million in 2008 {{out of a total}} population of 46million. In 2005 alone, a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people. There are a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the high level of immigration, including Spain's cultural ties with Latin America, its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce.|$|E

Gen. John C. Breckinridge, one of Hill's division commanders, was at Polk's headquarters, but was not informed that his division was to initiate the dawn attack. At 5 a.m. on September 20, Polk was awakened on the cold and foggy battlefield to find that Hill was not preparing to attack. He prepared new written orders, which reached Hill about 6 a.m. Hill responded with a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> delaying the attack, including readjustments of the alignment of his units, reconnaissance of the enemy line, and issuing breakfast rations to his men. Reluctantly, Bragg agreed.|$|E

Goby rapidly turns up a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> family members desperate for the money in Richard's estate. Goby employs all sorts of clever methods to uncover the most private information, using agents who pose as actors, lawyers or Catholic nuns. None of the family members can be cleared of suspicion.|$|E

An official announcement said that the junta “had considered and accepted General Thi's application for a vacation”. Thi retorted that “The only sinus condition I have is from the stink of corruption.” Kỳ then gave a series <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> dismissing Thi, accusing him of being too left-wing, of ruling the central regions like a warlord, of having a mistress who was suspected of being a communist, and being too conspiratorial. Despite Thi's {{good relations with the}} Buddhists in his area, most notably Thích Trí Quang, Kỳ reportedly had the monks' support for Thi's removal. Quang used the crisis to highlight Buddhist calls for civilian rule. There were claims that Quang intended to challenge Kỳ, {{regardless of whether or not}} Thi had been cast aside.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{uncontrolled}} public {{decisions have}} led to poor outcomes and disrespect for the decision-makers. Such decisions also lacked the regularity and transparency that distinguish them from the mere say-so of public authorities. On such grounds, there are obvious benefits for the disclosure <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> decisions. First, procedural participation by people affected by a decision promotes {{the rule of law}} by making it more difficult for the public authority to act arbitrarily. Requiring the giving of reasons helps ensure that decisions are carefully thought through, which in turn aids in the control of administrative discretion. Secondly, accountability makes it necessary for the public authority {{to face up to the}} people affected by a decision. When a public authority acts on all the relevant considerations, this increases the probability of better decision outcomes and, as such, is beneficial to public interests. Another important benefit is that respect for decision-makers is fostered, which increases their integrity in the public's eyes.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{there are}} 21, 18, 12, 9 or 5 drills or 'exchanges/groupings' of attacks and counterattacks, in each dui lian set. These drills were {{considered}} only generic patterns and {{never meant to}} be considered inflexible 'tricks'. Students practiced smaller parts/exchanges, individually with opponents switching sides in a continuous flow. Basically, dui lian were not only a sophisticated and effective methods of passing on the fighting knowledge of the older generation, they were important and effective training methods. The relationship between single sets and contact sets is complicated, in that some skills cannot be developed with single sets, and, conversely, with dui lian. Unfortunately, it appears that most traditional combat oriented dui lian and their training methodology have disappeared, especially those concerning weapons. There are a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this. In modern Chinese martial arts most of the dui lian are recent inventions designed for light props resembling weapons, with safety and drama in mind. The role of this kind of training has degenerated {{to the point of being}} useless in a practical sense, and, at best, is just performance.|$|E
25|$|In 1970–71, Catholics made {{up about}} 36% of the {{population}} and about 18% of the UDR. By the end of 1972 the number of Catholics in the UDR had dropped to 3% and never rose above that figure again. There are a number <b>of</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this. In {{the early years of the}} conflict, relations soured between the Catholic community and the Army. This was mainly due to incidents such as the Falls Curfew, internment, Bloody Sunday and Operation Motorman. There were also frequent claims of UDR soldiers abusing Catholics at checkpoints and during house searches. Catholic Church and Irish nationalist leaders withdrew their support for the regiment. Many Catholic soldiers left the regiment due to pressure and intimidation from their own community, and the IRA's policy of singling out Catholic soldiers for assassination. Catholics within the regiment also reported being intimidated by Protestant fellow soldiers. Other Catholics resigned in protest at what they saw as the Army's harsh and biased treatment of their community, especially after Operation Demetrius (the introduction of internment). The Belfast Telegraph reported that 25% of the regiment's Catholics resigned in 1971, half of those in the months following Operation Demetrius. By the end of 1972, the vast majority had resigned or simply stopped turning up for duty.|$|E
