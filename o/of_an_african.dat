5|$|The Zong {{massacre}} {{has inspired}} several works of literature. Fred D'Aguiar's novel Feeding the Ghosts (1997) {{tells the story}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> who survives being thrown overboard from the Zong. In the novel, {{the journal of the}} slave—Mintah—is lost, unlike that of Granville Sharp. According to the cultural historian Anita Rupprecht, this signifies the silencing of African voices about the massacre.|$|E
5|$|Tufaro criticized O'Malley's zero {{tolerance}} policy, suggesting {{it would lead}} to increased police brutality towards minorities. He instead proposed continuing Mayor Schmoke's community policing strategy. Opponents of the {{zero tolerance}} policy tried to tie O'Malley to the Baltimore Police shooting <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> American car theft suspect.|$|E
5|$|Committed to {{national}} cultural preservation and expansion, Massaquoi {{served as the}} director, later dean, of the Liberal Arts College and was the founding director of the Institute of African Studies. She co-founded the Society of Liberian Authors, helped abolish the practice of usurping African names for Westernized versions, and worked towards standardization of the Vai script. In the late 1960s, Vivian Seton, Massaquoi's daughter, had the autobiographical manuscript microfilmed for preservation. After Massaquoi's death, her writings and notes were rediscovered, edited and published in 2013 as The Autobiography <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> Princess.|$|E

5|$|Consequent to {{his defense}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> American {{who was forced}} into a form of {{commercial}} slavery after incarceration, Black was befriended by A. O. Lane, a judge connected with the case. When Lane {{was elected to the}} Birmingham City Commission in 1911, he asked Black to serve as a police court judge, an experience that would be his only judicial experience prior to the Supreme Court. In 1912, Black resigned that seat in order to return to practicing law full-time. He was not done with public service; in 1914, he began a four-year term as the Jefferson County Prosecuting Attorney.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{church building}} in the town is Orrick Chapel, built between 1866 and 1869 as the home <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> Methodist Episcopal congregation. Missionaries from this first independent black denomination came South after the war to aid freedmen and plant new congregations; they attracted {{hundreds of thousands of}} new members. This church replaced an earlier Methodist chapel constructed in the late 1850s; it was razed by Union troops during the winter months of 1864–1865 {{near the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E

From {{the earliest days of}} his career Etty had been interested in depicting variations in skin colour, and The Missionary Boy, believed to be his oldest significant surviving painting, shows a dark-skinned child.|$|E

5|$|Pope's {{reputation}} {{suffered a}} serious blow in 1879 when a late-convened Board of Inquiry called by President Rutherford B. Hayes {{and led by}} Maj. Gen. John Schofield (Pope's immediate predecessor in the Department of the Missouri and then head of the Department of the Pacific) concluded that Major General Fitz John Porter had been unfairly convicted of cowardice and disobedience at the Second Battle of Bull Run. The Schofield report used evidence of former Confederate commanders and concluded that Pope himself bore most {{of the responsibility for}} the Union loss. The report characterized Pope as reckless and dangerously uninformed about events during the battle, also criticized General Irvin McDowell (whom Pope detested), and credited Porter's perceived disobedience with saving the Union army from complete ruin. Soon, Schofield himself was criticized for his actions as superintendent of the U.S. Military at West Point following the hazing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> American cadet.|$|E
5|$|The sociopolitical {{atmosphere}} of Chicago {{was one of}} ethnic tension caused by competition among many new groups. With the Great Migration, thousands of African Americans from the South had settled next to neighborhoods of European immigrants on Chicago's South Side, near jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking plants. The Irish had been established first, and fiercely defended their territory and political power against all newcomers. Post World War I tensions caused frictions between the races, especially in the competitive labor and housing markets. Overcrowding and increased African American militancy by veterans contributed to the visible racial frictions. Also, a combination of ethnic gangs and police neglect strained the racial relationships. According to official reports, the turmoil came to a boil after the death <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> American youth who had accidentally drifted into a swimming area at an informally segregated beach. Tensions between groups arose in a melee that blew up into days of unrest.|$|E
5|$|Music intertwines with {{aspects of}} American social and {{cultural}} identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race {{is perhaps the most}} potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>African</b> American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the melting pot of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and yet has long been perceived as a form of white music.|$|E
