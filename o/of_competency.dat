25|$|Most {{recreational}} divers never {{advance to}} a high level <b>of</b> <b>competency</b> as might be indicated by certification and experience, and furthermore, many divers do not dive sufficiently frequently to maintain their skills.

The optimal conditions are seldom fulfilled on open-water recreational dives.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{research}} has already postulated {{the link between}} learning routines and the creation <b>of</b> <b>competencies,</b> but it is less clear how competencies influence organisational performance. This paper is an empirical investigation determining {{the relationship between the}} creation <b>of</b> <b>competencies</b> and the quality of learning. The purpose of the paper is to not only build on prior research that has validated the usefulness of linking levels of learning with the evidence <b>of</b> <b>competencies,</b> but also to illustrate how the creation <b>of</b> <b>competencies</b> is a socially constructed phenomenon. Thus, the paper has a strong theoretical disposition examining the existing literature as well as building on it. Socially constructed routines of themselves have little inimitable advantage to firms unless the routines are underpinned and harnessed by unique learning systems. The paper explores these concepts by showing how the creation <b>of</b> <b>competencies</b> depend on, and are predisposed to, the quality of learning interaction, the routines that are patterned from these, and the capacity of the organisation to turn the new socially constructed routines into superior performance. The paper is expected to make a major contribution to the strategic management literature by showing what types <b>of</b> <b>competencies</b> are more likely to lead to superior firm performance, and how competencies are linked to learning. 12 page(s...|$|R
25|$|The licenciatura degree (a four- to six-year course) was {{required}} for applicants who wished to undertake the old master's and doctoral programmes, but admission was reserved for those with a licenciatura degree with a grade above 14 (out of 20). After the changes introduced by the Bologna Process, the master's degree is conferred {{at the end of}} a programme roughly equivalent in time to many old licenciatura programmes. The process was developed to improve the education system to one based on the development <b>of</b> <b>competency</b> rather than the transmission of knowledge. Its goal was the development of a system of easily comparable degrees to simplify the comparison of qualifications across Europe. Its flexibility and transparency is intended to enable wider recognition of student qualifications, facilitating movement around a European Higher Education Area based on two main cycles (undergraduate and graduate) and providing third-cycle degrees for doctoral candidates.|$|E
25|$|To {{be defined}} as bilingual, an {{individual}} need not have perfect fluency or equal skill in both languages. Bimodal bilinguals, like oral-language bilinguals, exhibit {{a wide range of}} language competency in their first and second languages. For Deaf people (the majority of bimodal bilinguals in the U.S.), level <b>of</b> <b>competency</b> in ASL and English may be influenced by factors such as degree of hearing loss, whether the individual is prelingually or post-lingually deaf, style of and language used in their education, and whether the individual comes from a hearing or Deaf family. Regardless of English competency in other areas, no Deaf individual is likely to comprehend English {{in the same way as}} a hearing person when others are speaking it because only a small percentage of English phonemes are clearly visible through lip reading. Additionally, many Deaf bilinguals who have fluency in written English choose not to speak it because of the general social unacceptability of their voices, or because they are unable to monitor factors like pitch and volume.|$|E

He {{returned}} to New South Wales in May 1789 after circumnavigating the globe where he resumed former duties as a magistrate and surveyor of the Port Jackson area. In April 1792, following the wreck of HMS Sirius at Norfolk Island in 1790, Hunter returned to England where he was court marshalled {{for the loss of}} the vessel under his command, and honourably acquitted. In 1795 Hunter succeeded Arthur Phillip as the governor of New South Wales and served in this capacity until September 1800. His term as the governor was difficult and, after being accused of lack <b>of</b> <b>competency</b> and leadership, he was recalled from the office. He left for England having handed over the government of the colony to Philip Gidley King. Hunter returned to England in 1801 where he succeeded in clearing his name. He regained his standing in society and continued to progress his naval career. In 1807 he was promoted to rear-admiral, and finally in July 1810 to the rank of vice-Admiral. He died on 13 March 1821 in London.|$|E

25|$|Cleckley {{writes in}} the fifth edition that he remains, since before the first edition, profoundly struck both {{by the lack of}} {{response}} to treatment of those he classes as psychopathic, and by the legal difficulty of trying to detain them in hospital. While noting the issue of the protection of liberty, he argues that better ways must be found to do the latter for their own good and that of society, on the primary basis of demonstrated disability and need, perhaps within psychiatric units but segregated from other patients. He notes that neither psychological therapy or physical methods such as shock therapy or lobotomy appear to be a real solution to the problem, but suggests that more opportunity to control and direct the person may help psychiatrists treat them in the long-run. He also considers the issue <b>of</b> <b>competency</b> hearings and the insanity defense when crimes are committed. He expresses concern that his prior equating of psychopathy with psychosis was not intended to imply that psychopaths should be automatically found not guilty. However he also expresses dissatisfaction with sending psychopaths to prison which he believes will inevitably fail to correct the behaviour due to the underlying abnormality or masked 'insanity'.|$|E
