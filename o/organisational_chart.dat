40|$|Abstract: Business Process Simulation (BPS) is {{a rapidly}} {{emerging}} application area of discrete-event simulation that has gained considerable recognition {{in recent years}} as an enabler in enterprise engineering efforts. This paper reports on a case study where discrete-event simulation models of business processes were elaborated and executed to assist the management decision making of the initiation of a call centre application and furthermore decide on parameters affecting its operation and customer service level. To achieve this goal, the ARIS Collaborative Suite of tools was deployed. In the Enterprise Modelling level, ARIS offered a structured architecture and a variety of methods (models) for process mapping and simulation model elaboration. Down to the process planning and control level, it was ARIS simulation that provided the project team with the necessary simulation (dynamical execution of extended event driven process chains and <b>organisational</b> <b>charts)</b> and reporting capabilities that supported the final management decision...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore the {{possibility}} of using Web links to study collaborations between organisations, combining the results of qualitative analysis of interviews and quantitative analysis of linking patterns. We use case studies of scientific intermediaries, that is, organisations that mediate between the science system and other social actors (the market, the government etc) and argue that it is becoming increasingly important for such intermediaries to use the Web to indicate their strategic alliances. We analyse links between these organisations, together with primary sources such as <b>organisational</b> <b>charts</b> and internal reports, and find that these organisations indeed use outlinks to point to their collaborators and more specifically outlinks from specific depths. This supports our argument that links can be used to study the developments in science and the environment of scientific intermediaries. We discuss these findings in terms of their relevance for science studies and webometrics...|$|R

50|$|Richardson, A (2010), {{states that}} {{taking the time}} to look at {{touchpoints}} as a collective whole, would help shape a better customer experience and even point to opportunities to invent new types of touchpoints. It may reveal that some touchpoints are overly reliant on third parties who are not upholding their part of the customer experience. When Apple got fed up with retailers not doing a good enough job in communicating the Mac experience, it opened up its own stores, which is now a key reason why Apple is now able to attract a broader customer base. To analyse touch points requires multiple parts of a business to work together to improve the customer experience.

40|$|Organisation {{models are}} {{at the core of}} {{enterprise}} model, since they represent key aspects of a company's action system. Within MEMO, the Organisation Modelling Language (OrgML) supports the construction of organisation models. They can be divided into two main abstractions: a static abstraction is focusing on the structure of an organisation that reflects the division of labour with respect to static responsibilities and a dynamic abstraction that is focusing on models of business processes. In this report, those concepts of the OrgML are presented that serve modelling static aspects of an organisation. They cover prevalent concepts used in <b>organisational</b> <b>charts</b> as well as concepts required for specifying temporal units of work, roles and committees.

40|$|Notwithstanding {{several authors}} have {{recognised}} the conceptual key of "politics" {{as an important}} component in any Require-ments Engineering (RE) process, practitioners still lack a prag-matic answer {{on how to deal}} with the political dimension: such an ability has become a mostly desirable but totally undetailed part of what we usually and vaguely refer to as "professional experience". Nor were practitioners given any suitable tool or method to easily detect, represent, control and if possible leverage politics. Authors argue that this issue could be successfully ad-dressed and resolved if, when we map organisations against the system to be developed, we include power and politics in their "too human" and even emotional dimension. A simple way to do so is to use emoji pictograms: most of them are part of a universal language, which requirements engineers could easily adopt and exploit to assess and produce models that include an extra layer of "political" information, without the need to actually introduce any new notation.

5000|$|The second fortuitous {{event was}} {{the death of}} one of the {{smuggling}} ring's main organisers, Pasquale Camera, a former captain in the Italian customs agency. When Camera was {{killed in a car accident}} in August 1995, police found dozens of photographs of stolen antiquities in the glove compartment of his car, which directly linked Camera to a recent theft of valuable antiquities from an Italian regional museum. Subsequent raids by the TCP uncovered a large hoard of stolen and looted antiquities of the highest quality, as well as an extraordinary collection of documents and photographs that chronicled the smuggling ring's operations in forensic detail. Most importantly of all, the raid on the Rome apartment of one of the smugglers yielded a crucial piece of evidence that enabled the TCP to break the entire ring wide open - it was a comprehensive <b>organisational</b> <b>chart,</b> handwritten by Camera himself, which named and linked every major player in the operation, including the gangs of tombaroli (tomb robbers) and their leaders, the middle-men (including Medici) who smuggled the looted treasures out of Italy and other countries, the corrupt international dealers (including British dealer Robin Symes and American dealer Robert E. Hecht) who traded the stolen goods through major auction houses - notably Sotheby's in London - and even the unscrupulous curators, institutions, and private collectors who purchased looted goods from the gang.|$|E
50|$|Medici {{typically}} {{paid the}} tombolari small sums for the looted and stolen goods, and then smuggled {{them out of}} Italy to Switzerland, where they were restored. Taking advantage of the lax attitudes and practices of 'cooperative' auction houses - notably Sotheby's in London - Medici built up an elaborate network of front companies and elite antiquities dealers and galleries, including the British dealer Robin Symes, Rome-based American dealer Robert E. Hecht, and Hollywood dealer and producer Bruce McNall. A major investigation by the TPC (the art crimes division of the Carabinieri) beginning in the 1990s, which eventually resulted in Medici's conviction, recovered {{tens of thousands of}} looted artefacts, and extensive documentary evidence, including thousands of sequential photographs that showed the journey of these looted objects from excavation, through restoration, to their final placement in museum collections, as well as a crucial handwritten 'organigram' (<b>organisational</b> <b>chart)</b> that named and linked all the members of Medici's operation. TPC investigations also revealed that Medici used front companies to anonymously sell and then buy back many items, often multiple times, in order to manipulate the market, as well as allowing him to acquire the all-important Sotheby's provenances. In February 2016, TPC officials announced that a raid on Robin Symes' warehouse in the Geneva Freeport had uncovered a huge collection of 17,000 looted antiquities, nearly all of which are thought to have been sourced from Medici, and which Symes secretly placed there ca. 2000 in order to conceal their existence from the executors of the estate of his former lover and business partner, Christo Michelaides, who died in 1999.|$|E

40|$|Summary. the Organisation for {{economic}} cooperation and Development (OecD) principles of good laboratory practice (GLP) were originally developed for application to animal-based toxicology stud-ies. On the other hand, more and more studies involving in vitro test systems are performed to produce data on the safety of chemicals with respect to human health and the environment. therefore, national legislation usually requires that the in vitro studies are conducted in compliance with the GLP principles. Furthermore, developments in the area of toxicogenomics, toxicoproteomics, toxicometabonomics and various high throughput screening techniques will also enhance the importance of in vitro methodologies for safety testing. the OecD principles of GLP require that safety studies, independent of their type, are planned, conducted, recorded, reported, and archived {{in a way that they}} can be inspected by the GLP monitoring authorities and scientifically evaluated by the receiving authorities. Some critical aspects and pitfalls are discussed as regards the proper application and interpretation of the GLP principles for the organisation and management of in vitro studies. <b>Organisational</b> <b>charts</b> and responsibilities of test facili-ties (tFs) involved in single or multisite studies are sometimes dysfunctioning because there is a lack of traceability in reporting and communication lines.

The study {{is part of}} the research project "New Forms of Organisation of Work-Centered Life&# 8221;, which is financed by the German &# 8220;Federal Ministry of Education and Research&# 8221; and carried out by the &# 8220;Institute of Labour and Organizational Psychology&# 8221; of the Freie Universität Berlin. Beyond the questions on which this thesis focusses, the individual competence-development and work-life-balance of these founders and employees has also been examined. In general IT-workers and IT-enterprises are regarded as protoypical for the current, widely discussed labour and business trends. The present study aims at examining the various types of teamwork, leadership and commit¬ment from the establishment of these IT-Start-ups through their different phases of expansion, crises and conflicts. The main objective is to analyse the organizational &# 8220;blue-prints&# 8221; and corporate cultures in the spectrum from equality to hierarchy, and how these enterprises differ according to cooperative or competitive conflict handling. Afterwards these identified, various types of enterprises are discussed in view of their economic and social sustainability. Finally due to the shown strengths and weaknesses of these IT-Start-ups, general conclusions are drawn for the consultation of small-sized, high-tech companies. In order to answer the raised questions, interviews were conducted with 72 founders and co-workers from 45 predominantly young, small to medium-sized IT-enterprises.

For a short period, the 26th Independent Reconnaissance Air Regiment, flying the Petlyakov Pe-2, was also based at Graf Ignatievo airfield. In the beginning of 1951,the 15th, 19th and 21st fighter air regiments (FAR) were relocated to the airfield from Karlovo to form the 10th Fighter Air Division. Those were the descendants of the orlyaks of the former 6th Fighter Regiment of the His Majesty's Air Troops - their sole fighter formation, which took part in the defence of the capital of Sofia from Allied bombing in 1943 and 1944. At the time of the relocation to Graf Ignatievo, {{the regiment}}s flew only a handful of Yakovlev Yak-11 and Polikarpov Po-2 training aircraft in preparation for the transition to jet aircraft - the Yak-23 and Yak-17. The first fighters started flying in April 1951. The batch comprised only 30 Yak-23s and 4 Yak-17Us, as the Bulgarian Air Force started acquiring the MiG-15 in September the same year. For that reason, the Yaks were transferred to the newly forming 1st Fighter Air Division in Tolbukhin (today Dobrich, northwestern Bulgaria). Lieutenant-Colonel Simeon Simeonov (a legendary figure in Bulgarian aviation history and future Commander of the Bulgarian Air Force) assumed command of 10th FAD. His monument is located in the front of 3rd Fighter Air Base - Graf Ignatievo's control tower.|$|R

It is necessary for library administrators to evaluate their organisational structures in order to meet their customers' rising expectation and parent institutions' vision, mission, and strategy for future development. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the extent oflibrary reorganisation within the UK and Taiwan universities, and the principal differences and similarities on organisational structure changes between 1985 and 2001. This study was a population study. This study was composed of two surveys (the initial survey and the follow-up survey) in the two countries. Quantitative data was gathered though a questionnaire. The researcher investigated general aspects of library reorganisation, then focused specific on eight research problems and conducted comparison between the UK and Taiwan.

40|$|Graphic {{depiction}} is {{an established}} method for academics to present concepts about theories of innovation. These expressions {{have been adopted}} by policy-makers, the media and businesses. However, {{there has been little}} research on the extent of their usage or effectiveness ex-academia. In addition, innovation theorists have ignored this area of study, despite the communication of information about innovation being acknowledged as a major determinant of success for corporate enterprise. The thesis explores some major themes in the theories of innovation and compares how graphics are used to represent them. The thesis examines the contribution of visual sociology and graphic theory to an investigation of a sample of graphics. The methodological focus is a modified content analysis. The following expressions are explored: check lists, matrices, maps and mapping in the management of innovation; models, flow <b>charts,</b> <b>organisational</b> <b>charts</b> and networks in the innovation process; and curves and cycles in the representation of performance and progress. The main conclusion is that academia is leading the way in usage as well as novelty. The graphic message is switching from prescription to description. The computerisation of graphics has created a major role for the information designer. It is recommended that use of the graphic representation of innovation should be increased in all domains, though it is conceded that its content and execution need to improve, too. Education of graphic 'producers', 'intermediaries' and 'consumers' will play a part in this, as will greater exploration of diversity, novelty and convention.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{responds}} to the question, is exercise medicine? It does so using a qualitative case study that proposes that exercise is recreation. The study (1) describes and reflects upon an exercise is recreation metaphor, (2) establishes the principles and processes used to develop a sport park within which exercise is recreation, and (3) presents a comparative analysis of the exercise is recreation approach with a UK quality framework for “exercise referrals”. Methods: Four years of documentation were collated and placed into 14 categories: (1) university strategies, (2) plans of the site, (3) policy documents, (4) minutes of a steering group, (5) contemporary documents, (6) <b>organisational</b> <b>charts,</b> (7) responses to local government policies on sport, (8) consultation documents, (9) operational procedures, (10) facility specifications, (11) partnership agreements, (12) material relating to the university's work on events, (13) notes on the universities sport department, and (14) timetables. These data were analysed through a 4 -stage process which used recreation as the analytical theme for a comparative analysis. Results: The characteristics of the exercise is recreation metaphor in this case are (1) {{a focus on the}} experience of the user, (2) the promotion of well-being, (3) the importance of community, (4) embracing inclusivity, (5) sport, (6) aesthetics, and (7) leisure time. The principles and processes used to develop the sport park were (1) custodianship, (2) partnerships, (3) values, (4) inter-professional working, (5) local heritage, (6) change, (7) the natural park environment, and (8) “riding the bike as you build it”. The comparative analysis with a UK quality framework for “exercise referrals” clearly shows a difference from an exercise is recreation approach.
