5|$|The {{legend of}} <b>Orion</b> was first told in full in a lost work by Hesiod, {{probably}} the Astronomia; simple references to Hesiod will refer to this, unless otherwise stated. This version is known {{through the work}} of a Hellenistic author on the constellations; he gives a fairly long summary of Hesiod's discourse on <b>Orion.</b> According to this version, <b>Orion</b> was likely the son of the sea-god Poseidon and Euryale, daughter of Minos, King of Crete. <b>Orion</b> could walk on the waves because of his father; he walked to the island of Chios where he got drunk and attacked Merope, daughter of Oenopion, the ruler there. In vengeance, Oenopion blinded <b>Orion</b> and drove him away. <b>Orion</b> stumbled to Lemnos where Hephaestus — the lame smith-god — had his forge. Hephaestus told his servant, Cedalion, to guide <b>Orion</b> to the uttermost East where Helios, the Sun, healed him; <b>Orion</b> carried Cedalion around on his shoulders. <b>Orion</b> returned to Chios to punish Oenopion, but the king hid away underground and escaped Orion's wrath. Orion's next journey took him to Crete where he hunted with the goddess Artemis and her mother Leto, {{and in the course of}} the hunt, threatened to kill every beast on Earth. Mother Earth objected and sent a giant scorpion to kill <b>Orion.</b> The creature succeeded, and after his death, the goddesses asked Zeus to place <b>Orion</b> among the constellations. Zeus consented and, as a memorial to the hero's death, added the Scorpion to the heavens as well.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise is {{en route}} to the Berengarius system, one of the {{proposed}} locations for a Starfleet starbase, when it is approached by an <b>Orion</b> Syndicate vessel. Captain Archer is invited to visit the <b>Orion</b> ship by its captain, Harrad-Sar. During the visit, Archer and Lieutenant Reed are entertained by three <b>Orion</b> dancers, Navaar, D'Nesh, and Maras. Archer negotiates with Harrad-Sar and they agree to a joint magnesite mining operation, and the three slaves are given to him. They return to Enterprise with the slaves and set a course to survey the planet.|$|E
5|$|In Ancient Greece, <b>Orion</b> had a hero cult in {{the region}} of Boeotia. The number of places {{associated}} with his birth suggest that it was widespread. Hyria, the most frequently mentioned, was in the territory of Tanagra. A feast of <b>Orion</b> was held at Tanagra as late as the Roman Empire. They had a tomb of <b>Orion</b> most likely at the foot of Mount Cerycius (now Mount Tanagra). Maurice Bowra argues that <b>Orion</b> was a national hero of the Boeotians, much as Castor and Pollux were for the Dorians. He bases this claim on the Athenian epigram on the Battle of Coronea in which a hero gave the Boeotian army an oracle, then fought on their side and defeated the Athenians.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, {{the team}} was merged with the Daiei Unions and renamed the Daimai <b>Orions.</b> In 1964 they became the Tokyo <b>Orions,</b> and the Lotte <b>Orions</b> in 1969. The {{franchise}} was slow to duplicate its initial success: the <b>Orions</b> made the Japan Series in 1960 and 1970, only to lose both years.|$|R

The <b>Orions</b> won the Japan Series championship in 1974, with Kaneda's younger brother, Tomehiro, pitching for the <b>Orions</b> and winning the MVP award. The <b>Orions</b> used uniforms designed by Kaneda for 19 seasons.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, the Unions {{merged with}} the Mainichi <b>Orions</b> to form the Daimai <b>Orions.</b> This enabled the Pacific League to shrink from the ungainly seven-team {{arrangement}} (caused by the 1957 merger) to six teams.|$|R
5|$|Italian {{composer}} Francesco Cavalli {{wrote the}} opera, L'Orione in 1653. The story {{is set on}} the Greek island of Delos and focuses on Diana's love for <b>Orion</b> {{as well as on}} her rival, Aurora. Diana shoots <b>Orion</b> only after being tricked by Apollo into thinking him a sea monster—she then laments his death and searches for <b>Orion</b> in the underworld until he is elevated to the heavens. Johann Christian Bach ('the English Bach') wrote an opera, <b>Orion,</b> or Diana Reveng'd, first presented at London's Haymarket Theatre in 1763. <b>Orion,</b> sung by a castrato, is in love with Candiope, the daughter of Oenopion, King of Arcadia but his arrogance has offended Diana. Diana's oracle forbids him to marry Candiope and foretells his glory and death. He bids a touching farewell to Candiope and marches off to his destiny. Diana allows him his victory and then kills him, offstage, with her arrow. In another aria, his mother Retrea (Queen of Thebes), laments his death but ultimately sees his elevation to the heavens. The 2002 opera Galileo Galilei by American composer Philip Glass includes an opera within an opera piece between <b>Orion</b> and Merope. The sunlight, which heals Orion's blindness, is an allegory of modern science. Philip Glass has also written a shorter work on <b>Orion,</b> as have Tōru Takemitsu, Kaija Saariaho, and John Casken. David Bedford's late-twentieth-century works are about the constellation rather than the mythical figure; he is an amateur astronomer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Orion</b> served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture. The {{story of the}} adventures of <b>Orion,</b> the hunter, is the one on which {{we have the most}} {{evidence}} (and even on that not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, in the Greek sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage which says that <b>Orion</b> was responsible for the present shape of the Strait of Sicily.|$|E
5|$|References since antiquity {{are fairly}} rare. At the {{beginning}} of the 17th century, French sculptor Barthélemy Prieur cast a bronze statue <b>Orion</b> et Cédalion, some time between 1600 and 1611. This featured <b>Orion</b> with Cedalion on his shoulder, in a depiction of the ancient legend of <b>Orion</b> recovering his sight; the sculpture is now displayed at the Louvre.|$|E

5|$|Takahashi began {{a sequel}} to Ginga Legend Weed, {{entitled}} , in issue #2173 of Manga Goraku, released on July 24, 2009. The first collected volume was released by Nihon Bungeisha in November 2009 and last July 2014. The new series follows Weed's offspring: Bellatrix, Rigel, Sirius, and, in particular, <b>Orion.</b> They are all named after astronomical phenomenon: <b>Orion</b> after the <b>Orion</b> constellation, Rigel after the star Rigel, Sirius after the star Sirius, and Bellatrix after the star Bellatrix. <b>Orion</b> bears a close physical resemblance Riki and possesses an inborn strength, but is rude and hot-headed. Rigel shares Orion's fiery personality, while Sirius, who resembles his father, is level-headed and a peace-keeper. Bellatrix, Weed's only daughter, is portrayed as immature and whiny.|$|E

5|$|The Boeotian {{school of}} epic poetry was chiefly {{concerned}} with the genealogies of the gods and heroes; later writers elaborated this web. Several other myths are attached to <b>Orion</b> in this way: A papyrus fragment of the Boeotian poet Corinna gives <b>Orion</b> fifty sons (a traditional number). This included the oracular hero Acraephen, who, she sings, gave a response to Asopus regarding Asopus' daughters who were abducted by the gods. Corinna sang of <b>Orion</b> conquering and naming all {{the land of the}} dawn. Bowra argues that <b>Orion</b> was believed to have delivered oracles as well, probably at a different shrine. Hyginus says that Hylas's mother was Menodice, daughter of <b>Orion.</b> Another mythographer, Liberalis, tells of Menippe and Metioche, daughters of <b>Orion,</b> who sacrificed themselves for their country's good and were transformed into comets.|$|E
5|$|The {{designation}} WS-199B {{was assigned}} to the project that, under a contract awarded in 1958 to Martin Aircraft, would become the Bold <b>Orion</b> missile. The design of Bold <b>Orion</b> was simple, using parts developed for other missile systems to reduce the cost and development time of the project. The initial Bold <b>Orion</b> configuration was a single-stage vehicle, using a Thiokol TX-20 Sergeant solid-fuel rocket. Following initial testing, the Bold <b>Orion</b> configuration was altered to become a two-stage vehicle, an Allegany Ballistics Laboratory Altair upper stage being added to the missile.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} <b>Orion</b> and Oenopion also varies. One source refers to Merope as {{the wife of}} Oenopion and not his {{daughter}}. Another refers to Merope {{as the daughter of}} Minos and not of Oenopion. The longest version (a page in the Loeb) is from a collection of melodramatic plots drawn up by an Alexandrian poet for the Roman Cornelius Gallus to make into Latin verse. It describes <b>Orion</b> as slaying the wild beasts of Chios and looting the other inhabitants to make a bride-price for Oenopion's daughter, who is called Aëro or Leiro. Oenopion does not want to marry her to someone like <b>Orion,</b> and eventually <b>Orion,</b> in frustration, breaks into her bedchamber and rapes her. The text implies that Oenopion blinds him on the spot.|$|E

50|$|Long {{before the}} time in which the game is set, two {{extremely}} powerful races, the <b>Orions</b> and the Antarans, fought a war that devastated most of the galaxy. The victorious <b>Orions,</b> rather than exterminate the Antarans, imprisoned them in a pocket dimension before departing the galaxy, leaving behind a very powerful robotic warship, the Guardian, to protect their homeworld.|$|R
5|$|There was a {{movement}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century to interpret all the Boeotian heroes as merely personifications of the constellations; there has since come to be wide agreement that the myth of <b>Orion</b> existed before there was a constellation named for him. Homer, for example, mentions <b>Orion,</b> the Hunter, and <b>Orion,</b> the constellation, but never confuses the two. Once <b>Orion</b> was recognized as a constellation, astronomy in turn affected the myth. The story of Side may well be a piece of astronomical mythology. The Greek word side means pomegranate, which bears fruit while <b>Orion,</b> the constellation, can be seen in the night sky. Rose suggests she is connected with Sidae in Boeotia, and that the pomegranate, as a sign of the Underworld, is connected with her descent there.|$|E
5|$|A second full telling (even {{shorter than}} the summary of Hesiod) is in a Roman-era {{collection}} of myths; the account of <b>Orion</b> is based largely on the mythologist and poet Pherecydes of Leros. Here <b>Orion</b> is described as earthborn and enormous in stature. This version also mentions Poseidon and Euryale as his parents. It adds a first marriage to Side before his marriage to Merope. All that is known about Side is that Hera threw her into Hades for rivalling her in beauty. It also gives a different version of Orion's death than the Iliad: Eos, the Dawn, {{fell in love with}} <b>Orion</b> and took him to Delos where Artemis killed him.|$|E

5|$|By 1 May, <b>Orion</b> {{had been}} {{assigned}} to the 3rd BS of the Home Fleet and was serving as the flagship for Rear-Admiral Sir Douglas Nicholson, second-in-command of the Squadron. On 1 November, the 3rd BS was disbanded and <b>Orion</b> was transferred to the Reserve Fleet at Portland, together with her sisters. Nicholson still hoisted his flag aboard her, although he was now commander of the Reserve Fleet there. Nicholson hauled down his flag on 1 April 1920 and the ship was transferred back to Portsmouth by 14 September. <b>Orion</b> then became the flagship of the Reserve Fleet, which was commanded by Vice-Admiral Richard Phillimore. In June 1921 she became a gunnery training ship at Portland. On 12 April 1922, she was paid off and placed on the disposal list in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. On 19 December <b>Orion</b> was sold for scrap to Cox and Danks and she arrived at Upnor in February 1923 to begin demolition.|$|E
