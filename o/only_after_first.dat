2500|$|On November 29, 2011 the Expert Commission for the Future of the Valley of the Fallen, {{formed by}} the Socialist Party {{government}} of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero on May 27, 2011 under the Historical Memory Law and charged to give advice for converting the Valley of the Fallen to a [...] "memory center that dignifies and rehabilitates {{the victims of the}} Civil War and the subsequent Franco regime," [...] rendered a report recommending as its principal proposal for the Commission's stated end the removal of the remains of Francisco Franco from the Valley of the Fallen for reburial at a location to be chosen by his family, but <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>first</b> obtaining a broad parliamentary consensus for such action. [...] The Commission based its decision upon Franco having not died in the Civil War and the aim of the Commission that the Valley of the Fallen be exclusively for those on both sides who had died in the Civil War. [...] In regard to José Antonio Primo de Rivera, founder of Falange Española, the Commission recommended his remains should stay at the Valley of the Fallen, since a victim of the Civil War, but relocated within the Basilica mausoleum on equal footing with those remains of others who died in the conflict. [...] The Commission further conditioned its recommendation for the removal of the remains of Franco from the Valley of the Fallen and the relocation of the remains of Primo de Rivera within the Basilica mausoleum upon the consent of the Catholic Church since “any action inside of the Basilica requires the permission of the Church.” Three members of the twelve person commission gave a joint dissenting opinion opposing the recommendation for the removal of the remains of Franco from the Valley of the Fallen claiming such action would only further “divide and stress Spanish society." [...] The Commission additionally proposed for its report creating a [...] "meditation center" [...] in the Valley of the Fallen for those not of the Catholic faith, the names shown of all Civil War victims buried at the Valley of the Fallen who can be identified on the esplanade that leads into the Basilica mausoleum and an “interpretive center” be built to explain how and why the Valley of the Fallen exists. [...] The total cost of the proposed changes to the Valley of the Fallen was estimated by the Commission at 13 million euros. [...] On November 20, nine days before the issuance of the report of the Commission and ironically on the 36th anniversary of the death of Francisco Franco, the conservative Popular Party won for the 2011 General Election absolute majorities in both Spain’s lower house, the Congress of Deputies, and Senate.|$|E

50|$|Like all Amanita species, A. zambiana is mycorrhizal. It {{typically}} {{associates with}} {{trees in the}} genus Brachystegia. Fruit bodies are often found in small groups {{at the side of}} gravel roads. Its distribution includes Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, and southern Tanzania. In Zambia, it is known locally as tente in the Bemba language, or ndelema in Kaonde and Nyanja. It is also known as the Christmas mushroom, as it is most abundant around December and early January. A popular edible, it contributes significantly to Zimbabwean household food security when it is in season. It is widely marketed at roadside stalls and markets, but only the cap is sold. Occasionally, the mushroom is dried for storage, but <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>first</b> boiling it and draining the water. According to a 2002 publication, the average price paid to mushroom harvesters in Zambia was about 3 USD per kg.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the ninth}} of Tevet, [...] "something happened, {{but we do}} not know what it was..." [...] (Shulchan Aruch).

But according to the earlier sources (the Geonim as recorded by Bahag and cited in Tur Orach Chaim 580), the specific tragedy of 9 Tevet is unknown.

50|$|A {{key figure}} in the {{eventual}} transformation of the swamp into the park is Arnold Rothstein. Rothstein is widely suspected of significant involvement in the throwing of the 1919 World Series, known as the Black Sox Scandal, and soon thereafter using his gains to purchase 88 acre of Juniper Swamp. In the 1920s, he tried to sell the swamp to New York City for use as an airport, but <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>first</b> attempting to increase its apparent value by constructing on it a phantom village of 143 homes that {{were little more than}} facades. Before Rothstein could unload the swamp, he was murdered in 1928 due to what many suspect was non-payment of gambling debts. In 1931, New York City acquired Juniper Swamp at the rate of $5,700 per acre as settlement with the Rothstein estate for back taxes, and immediately tagged it for development as a public park. News of the park, coupled with improvements of Works Progress Administration (WPA) efforts, ushered in a wave of housing growth in the vicinity that continued through the 1960s.|$|E
5000|$|Elgar was not {{the first}} {{composer}} to think about setting John Henry Newman's poem [...] "The Dream of Gerontius". Dvořák had considered it fifteen years earlier, and had discussions with Newman, before abandoning the idea. Elgar knew the poem well; he had owned a copy since at least 1885, and in 1889 he was given another copy as a wedding present. This copy contained handwritten copies of extensive notes that had been made by General Gordon, and Elgar is known to have thought of the text in musical terms for several years. Throughout the 1890s, Elgar had composed several large-scale works for the regular festivals that were a key part of Britain's musical life. In 1898, based on his growing reputation, he was asked to write a major work for the 1900 Birmingham Triennial Music Festival. He was unable to start work on the poem that he knew so well until the autumn of 1899, and did so <b>only</b> <b>after</b> <b>first</b> considering a different subject.Composition proceeded quickly. Elgar and August Jaeger, his editor at the publisher Novello, exchanged frequent, sometimes daily, letters, which show how Jaeger helped in shaping the work, and in particular the climactic depiction of the moment of judgment. By the time Elgar had completed the work and Novello had printed it, there were only three months to the premiere. The Birmingham chorus, all amateurs, struggled to master Elgar's complex, demanding and somewhat revolutionary work. Matters were made worse by the sudden death of the chorus master and his replacement by an elderly musician who found the music beyond him. The conductor of the premiere, Hans Richter, received a copy of the full score only {{on the eve of the}} first orchestral rehearsal. The soloists at the Birmingham Festival on 3 October 1900 were Marie Brema, Edward Lloyd and Harry Plunket Greene. The first performance was, famously, a near disaster. The choir could not sing the music adequately, and two of the three soloists were in poor voice. Elgar was deeply upset at the debacle, telling Jaeger, [...] "I have allowed my heart to open once - it is now shut against every religious feeling & every soft, gentle impulse for ever." [...] However, many of the critics could see past the imperfect realisation and the work became established in Britain once it had had its first London performance in 1903, at the Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral.|$|E
