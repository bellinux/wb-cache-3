It is a network of vehicles that control themselves as they traverse from an origin to a destination while being electrically powered in motion – all {{without the use of}} connected wires. AET 2 ̆ 7 s realization may provide unparalleled returns in the form of dramatic reductions in traffic-related air pollution, <b>our</b> nation’s <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> oil, traffic congestion, and roadway inefficiency. More importantly, it may also significantly improve transportation safety by dramatically reducing the number of transportation-related deaths and injuries each year as it directly addresses major current issues such as human error and adverse environmental conditions related to vehicle emissions. In this thesis, a logical strategy in transitioning from today’s current transportation system to a future automated and electric transportation system is identified. However, the chief purpose of this research is to evaluate the operational parameters where AET will be feasible from a transportation operations perspective. This evaluation was accomplished by performing lane capacity analyses for the mainline, as well as focusing on the merging logic employed at freeway interchange locations. In the past, merging operations have been known to degrade traffic flow due to the interruptions that merging vehicles introduce to the system. However, by analyzing gaps in the mainline traffic flow and coordinating vehicle movements through the use of the logic described in this thesis, mainline traffic operations can remain uninterrupted while still allowing acceptable volumes of merging vehicles to enter the freeway. A 2 ̆ 2 release-to-gap 2 ̆ 2 merging algorithm was developed and utilized in order to maximize the automated flow of traffic at or directly downstream of a freeway merge point by maximizing ramp flows without causing delay to mainline vehicles. Through these tasks, it is the hope of this research to aid in identifying the requirements and impending impacts of the implementation of this potentially life-altering technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} economic potential for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is large {{with more than}} 300 billion barrels of oil remaining in domestic reservoirs after conventional technologies reach their economic limit. Actual EOR production in the United States has never been very large, less than 10 % of the total U. S. production even though a number of economic incentives {{have been used to}} stimulate the development and application of EOR processes. The U. S. DOE Reservoir Data Base contains more than 600 reservoirs with over 12 billion barrels of unrecoverable oil that are potential targets for microbially enhanced oil recovery (MEOR). If MEOR could be successfully applied to reduce the residual oil saturation by 10 % in a quarter of these reservoirs, more than 300 million barrels of oil could be added to the U. S. oil reserve. This would stimulate oil production from domestic reservoirs and reduce <b>our</b> nation's <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> imports. Laboratory studies have shown that detergent-like molecules called biosurfactants, which are produced by microorganisms, are very effective in mobilizing entrapped oil from model test systems. The biosurfactants are effective at very low concentrations. Given the promising laboratory results, it is important to determine the efficacy of using biosurfactants in actual field applications. The goal of this project is to move biosurfactant-mediated oil recovery from laboratory investigations to actual field applications. In order to meet this goal, several important questions must be answered. First, it is critical to know whether biosurfactant-producing microbes are present in oil formations. If they are present, then it will be important to know whether a nutrient regime can be devised to stimulate their growth and activity in the reservoir. If biosurfactant producers are not present, then a suitable strain must be obtained that can be injected into oil reservoirs. We were successful in answering all three questions. The specific objectives of the project were (1) to determine the prevalence of biosurfactant producers in oil reservoirs, and (2) to develop a nutrient regime that would stimulate biosurfactant production in the oil reservoir...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project is to confirm on a well-instrumented prototype the theoretically derived claims of higher efficiency and coefficient of performance for geothermal heat pumps based on a new regenerative thermodynamic cycle as comparing to existing technology. In order to demonstrate the improved performance of the prototype, it will be compared to published parameters of commercially available geothermal heat pumps manufactured by US and foreign companies. Other objectives are to optimize the design parameters and to determine the economic viability of the new technology. Background (as stated in the proposal) : The proposed technology closely relates to EERE mission by improving energy efficiency, bringing clean, reliable and affordable heating and cooling to the residential and commercial buildings and reducing greenhouse gases emission. It can provide {{the same amount of}} heating and cooling with considerably less use of electrical energy and consequently has a potential of reducing <b>our</b> nations <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> oil. The theoretical basis for the proposed thermodynamic cycle was previously developed and was originally called a dynamic equilibrium method. This theory considers the dynamic equations of state of the working fluid and proposes the methods for modification of T-S trajectories of adiabatic transformation by changing dynamic properties of gas, such as flow rate, speed and acceleration. The substance of this proposal is a thermodynamic cycle characterized by the regenerative use of the potential energy of two-phase flow expansion, which in traditional systems is lost in expansion valves. The essential new features of the process are: (1) The application of two-step throttling of the working fluid and two-step compression of its vapor phase. (2) Use of a compressor as the initial step compression and a jet device as a second step, where throttling and compression are combined. (3) Controlled ratio of a working fluid at the first and second step of compression. In the proposed system, the compressor compresses the vapor only to 50 - 60 % of the final pressure, while the additional compression is provided by a jet device using internal potential energy of the working fluid flow. Therefore, the amount of mechanical energy required by a compressor is significantly reduced, resulting in the increase of efficiency (either COP or EER). The novelty of the cycle is in the equipment and in the way the multi-staging is accomplished. The anticipated result will be a new refrigeration system that requires less energy to accomplish a cooling task. The application of this technology will be for more efficient designs of: (1) Industrial chillers, (2) Refrigeration plants, (3) Heat pumps, (4) Gas Liquefaction plants, (5) Cryogenic systems...|$|R

They measure their esteem of each other by what each has, and not by what each is. But a cultivated man becomes ashamed of his property, out of new respect for his nature.

40|$|When {{oil prices}} rise, {{politicians}} often call for improvements in energy efficiency or policies {{that they hope}} will make the U. S. more ?energy independent. ? The argument {{is that if we}} consume less oil, domestic supplies will constitute a larger portion of U. S. quantity demanded, mitigating <b>our</b> <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> potentially unreliable <b>foreign</b> oil sources, thereby lessening U. S. exposure to volatile supply/price fluctuations. Three interrelated issues are addressed in this dissertation. First, the drivers and substitution patterns in U. S. oil demand are explored using structural demand system analysis for energy in the U. S. Second, world oil supply is estimated using the cost structure of world oil reservoirs, which principally depend on reservoir characteristics. Models of both supply and demand yield insight into the feasibility and unintended outcomes of policies or technological advances that reduce oil demand. Finally, the U. S. autarky equilibrium price at the intersection of the U. S. supply and demand curves is considered. Inferences on the economic feasibility for the U. S. to strive towards self-sufficiency in oil are examined including the vulnerability premium associated with national security concerns. The demand model demonstrates that U. S. oil demand is explained as a system of demands for energy, where individuals are committed in the short run to minimum quantities of consumption. In the context of pre-commitments, oil is found to have a higher own-price elasticity (more elastic) at average than is commonly found in the literature. Oil is further demonstrated to be a compliment for natural gas and electricity, and a substitute for coal. Oil production costs and quantities are heavily dependent upon reservoir geology, which has a fixed dispersion around the world. Using this premise, a supply curve composed of world oil reservoirs is generated. Scenario analysis on different world oil demand reductions suggests there are unintended costs of reducing oil demand. Oil producing countries will experience smaller gross domestic products from diminished oil production. Smaller gross domestic products may affect the countries? political stability. The world oil supply curve and cross price elasticities from the demand model are considered together under the most likely scenario of a fall in world oil demand stemming from a 2. 5 % decrease in U. S. oil demand. These results are used to consider unintended consequences of changes in U. S. oil demand in attempts to achieve or pursue ?energy independence. ?
