5|$|This {{species may}} be active {{during the day}} and at night. However, on bright, sunny days, they are usually found coiled or {{stretched}} <b>out</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the shade. In the morning and on cool days, they can often be seen basking in the sunlight. They often emerge at sunset to warm themselves on warm ground (i.e., sidewalks, roads) and then become very active throughout the night, when they are usually found swimming or crawling. Contrary to popular belief, they are capable of biting while under water.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone <b>out</b> <b>somewhere</b> to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E

2500|$|The play {{opens in}} a {{fisherman}}'s hut near a {{lake in the}} forest. Outside a storm rages. [...] Here live the old fisherman Auguste and his wife Eugenie. [...] And here lives Ondine whom the old couple found as a baby {{at the edge of}} the lake, and brought up in place of their own daughter who was mysteriously snatched away as an infant. [...] Auguste is upset because Ondine is <b>out</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the storm. As Auguste rages, naiads, the wind, and even the King of the Ondines himself (throughout the play referred to as the Old One) peer in at the windows gently mocking Auguste. [...] Evidently this is not unusual—the [...] old couple are well aware that Ondine is “not like anyone else”. [...] A knight-errant, Hans von Wittenstein zu Wittenstein, arrives seeking shelter. He is welcomed and while he is in the midst of telling Auguste and Eugenie about his betrothed, the princess Bertha, Ondine appears. On seeing Hans she says, “How beautiful he is!” [...] In spite of taunts from Ondine's sister naiads, and against the advice of Auguste, Hans immediately falls in love with Ondine. [...] All thought of Bertha, his “dark angel”—the woman who sent him off on his quest—is banished. [...] Ondine in turn swears eternal love for [...] Hans. [...] The Old One warns her, “The man will deceive you. He will abandon you.” [...] Ondine does not believe him. [...] He gives a final warning “You will remember our pact.” [...] Ondine reluctantly agrees.|$|E
2500|$|The Western Pennsylvania Hospital at Pittsburgh {{ended its}} first year of {{operation}} in 1853, and {{it was evident that}} there were a greater number of patients in jails and almshouses than could be provided for in the 26 beds designated for that express purpose at the hospital. Managers of the hospital used a $10,000 appropriation from the state to purchase a large amount of farmland on a hill overlooking the Ohio River to the north of Pittsburgh in what is now suburban Kilbuck. Planners originally wanted to build the institution in the city, but this idea was rejected by Dorothea Dix. Construction began in 1859, and opened in 1862. A grand ceremony took place on July 19, 1859 where the cornerstone of the Dixmont Kirkbride building was laid in the foundation. A glass jar was placed in the cornerstone containing numerous objects, papers, and a letter from Dorothea Dix herself. Also contained was a copy of her 1845 [...] "Memorial", the 55-page county by county study of the conditions for the mentally ill in Pennsylvania, which had a great part in jump-starting early mental health care reform in Pennsylvania. Unfortunately, when the time capsule was recovered prior to demolition, the jar had broken and many of the contents were in poor condition. [...] The original patient population of the hospital was a meager 113 patients who were transferred from the Western Pennsylvania Hospital in Pittsburgh. Before the 1800s were <b>out,</b> <b>somewhere</b> between 1,200 and 1,500 patients called the hospital home. In 1907, the facility was individually incorporated as the Dixmont Hospital for the Insane after separating from the Western Pennsylvania Hospital system. Dixmont was completely self-sustained from the beginning. It had its own farmlands, livestock, rail station, and post office. Also part of the facility was a water treatment plant, a sewage treatment plant, and electricity generating facilities. They had their own butchers, bakers, farmhands, electricians, laborers, pipe fitters, botanists, chefs, and even a barber and a dentist.|$|E
