40|$|AbstractIn several {{applications}} like hoisting equipment, cranes, <b>open</b> <b>gears</b> {{are used}} to transmit power at rather low speeds (tangential velocity < 1 m/s) with lubrication by grease. In consequence those applications have particularities in term of lubricating conditions and friction involved, pairing of material between pinion and gear wheel, lubricant supply, loading cycles and behaviour of materials with significant contact pressure due to lower number of cycles. The comparison of proofed old rating methods (HENRIOT….) with ISO 6336 has shown that ISO is very conservative for through hardened steels gear wheels running with case hardened pinion specifically {{in the range of}} limited life. This has emphasis the need to develop experimental tests, in representative conditions. In order to assess new values of allowable contact-pressure stress numbers, the authors present the concept and the realization of a new test bench in order to satisfy those requirements with the associated procedures of calibration and testing. Analysis of experimental results and metallurgical analysis of cold working of tooth flanks are given. Fatigue result test are then compared to ISO and AGMA gear ratting method predictions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Investigations include {{results of}} {{research}} opportunities {{of improving the}} quality of open toothed wheels using advanced technologies of surface by ion nitriding in hydrogensaturating media and subsequent heat treatment with the creation of the material in the surface layer of optimal residual compressive stresses. Design/methodology/approach: Researches on high-cycle bending fatigue were performed on the smooth cylindrical samples with a diameter of 5 mm using IMA- 5 engine in pure bending with rotation (50 Hz) in the 3 % NaCl solution and midair. Findings: The analysis of the operating conditions and the stress-strain state of open toothed weels showed that different portions of the surface of the teeth take different in size and type of stress. The most dangerous areas of the surface have a leg and depression between the teeth. Practical implications: Experience of operating gears indicates {{that the vast majority of}} failing of <b>open</b> <b>gears</b> occurs as a result of breakage of teeth from bending. Currently, there are many ways to improve the wear resistance and durability of the gears, but the problem is not solved until the end and it is urgent. Originality/value: In order to {{improving the quality of}} open toothed wheels by hardening the surface of the toothed wheels and especially in hazardous areas due to the deposition of hardening coatings with a gradient structure in depth, authors create a surface layer of residual compressive stress with optimal value and strengthening the core of the toothed wheel...|$|R
40|$|Grease is {{commonly}} used to lubricate various machine components such as rolling element bearings, <b>open</b> <b>gears</b> etc. Better understanding of the flow properties of grease will contribute to understanding the lubrication mechanism in bearings and flow in lubrication systems. In an earlier paper Micro Particle Image Velocimetry (μPIV) techniques were used to study the flow in a rectangular channel. The present paper {{is an extension of}} this work where restrictions were applied in such a channel, which creates a much more complex velocity field. The grease is seeded with fluorescent particles, which are illuminated by a double-pulsed laser. The test geometries that are used in this study are a channel with one flat restriction and one with two flow restrictions in a similar channel. The stationary grease mass-flow and the two dimensional velocity fields have been monitored for different pressure drops. For the channel with one flat restriction, the flow was measured to be symmetric at the inlet and outlet, and the distance for the flow to fully develop is comparable with the height of the channel; Slow motion was followed near the step corner at the inlet. For the channel with two flow restrictions, the vector profiles show that the maximum velocity appears at the restrictions; In-between the two restrictions, a part of the grease is not moving. This particularly applies to cases with low-pressure drop and where high consistency grease was used. Godkänd; 2010; Bibliografisk uppgift: CD-ROM; 20100629 (ysko...|$|R
5000|$|By 1901 Straker were {{building}} an entire wagon [...] This exchanged the previous gear {{drive to the}} rear axle with a chain drive. Although other steam wagons used chain drives, {{this was the first}} to use a single chain, with the differential mounted on the axle rather than the chassis, and with a chain to each wheel. The rear wheels were large in diameter and constructed on the traction engine pattern, with two rows of narrow built-up spokes. As these wheels were too large to fit under the load deck of the wagon, they were mounted outboard of it, requiring an extra-long axle. These wagons were sold by the 'Straker Steam Vehicle Co' with offices at 9 Bush Lane, London and the works in Bristol. They took part in the War Office Trials at Aldershot of 1901, where they were awarded £100, and 1902 By 1902 the rear wheels had been reduced in diameter and now had six broader spokes from a flat sheet: a single sheet for the 2 ton, doubled for the 5 and 7 ton models. The steam engine itself was a two-cylinder compound, with cylinders of 7" [...] stroke and 4" [...] and 7" [...] diameter. The transmission was relatively crude, using <b>open</b> <b>gears</b> rather than the enclosed oil-bath that was in use amongst other makers, and indeed used for the high-speed engine of their 2-ton light tractor. Two gears were provided, but one was only intended for hill-climbing and could only be selected from alongside the engine, not from the driver's cab.|$|R

40|$|Grease {{lubrication}} {{is traditionally}} {{used in a}} great variety of mechanical systems such as rolling bearings, seals, and gears where it has been shown more advantageous than oil, mainly due to its consistency allowing the grease to stay inside the system and not leak out. Knowledge of the flow dynamics of grease is important for the understanding and prediction of grease distribution for optimum lubrication and for the migration of wear and contaminant particles. Free-surface effects {{play an important role in}} rolling bearings and <b>open</b> <b>gears</b> as the configuration normally is filled with about 30 % grease to avoid heavy churning. In this study, an analytical model of the stationary uniform flow on a rotating disc is developed and validated with experiments. The model results in the velocity profile for the flow in the thin fully yielded viscous layer in connection to the surface as well as an expression for the plug flow region on top of the viscous layer. Furthermore, the depth-averaged velocity is derived as is the shear stress value on the plate. From the latter, follows a condition for the grease to start moving and in turn yielding an expression for the viscous layer thickness as a function of the grease yield stress value, grease density, angular velocity, and radial position. In addition, an expression of the layer thickness containing the ratio between the flow rate and the layer width which in turn can account for effects not included in the model such as wall slip and surface adhesion and thus add another degree of freedom into the model. Experiments with two different greases having NLGI grade 1 and 2, respectively, shows it is possible to obtain a good fit with the analytically obtained thickness using the rheological parameters for actual grease...|$|R
