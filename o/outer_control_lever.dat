50|$|The switch {{mechanism}} {{is designed to}} have two stable states that are {{a mirror image of}} each other, with the contact actuator always resting at one stable state or the other.

50|$|In {{vertical}} flight, the tiltrotor uses controls {{very similar}} to a twin or tandem-rotor helicopter. Yaw is controlled by tilting its rotors in opposite directions. Roll is provided through differential power or thrust. Pitch is provided through rotor cyclic or nacelle tilt. Vertical motion is controlled with conventional rotor blade pitch and either a conventional helicopter collective <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> (as in the Bell/Agusta BA609) or a unique control similar to a fixed-wing engine control called a thrust <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> (TCL) (as in the Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey).|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{algorithm}} for multiarmed bandits that achieves almost optimal performance in both stochastic and adversarial regimes without prior {{knowledge about the}} nature of the environment. Our algorithm is based on augmentation of the EXP 3 algorithm with a new <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> in the form of exploration parameters that are tailored individually for each arm. The algorithm si-multaneously applies the “old ” <b>control</b> <b>lever,</b> the learning rate, to control the regret in the adver-sarial regime and the new <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> to detect and exploit gaps between the arm losses. This secures problem-dependent “logarithmic ” regret when gaps are present without compromising on the worst-case performance guarantee in the ad-versarial regime. We show that the algorithm can exploit both the usual expected gaps between the arm losses in the stochastic regime and determin-istic gaps between the arm losses in the adver-sarial regime. The algorithm retains “logarith-mic ” regret guarantee in the stochastic regime even when some observations are contaminated by an adversary, as long as on average the con-tamination does not reduce the gap by more than a half. Our results for the stochastic regime are supported by experimental validation...|$|R

"The {{finger and}} thumb <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> {{works in a}} small {{quadrant}} which is marked at the top [...] "Traffic" [...] then [...] "High" [...] and at the bottom [...] "Low" [...] and finally [...] "Cold" [...] with spaces in between. Variations of this lever govern engine speeds. The forward, neutral and reverse positions for the central hand lever are stepped. To start the car from rest a driver presses out his clutch, moves his hand lever forward, and lets in the clutch in the ordinary way with slight acceleration. Thereafter {{the whole of the}} drive is done with the accelerator pedal, the accelerator allowing the engine to run up and keep constant maximum speed governed by the <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> {{on the top of the}} steering wheel by which engine braking power can also be regulated. When the accelerator is pressed after being released the effect is rather similar to that with a free wheel in use, in that the engine picks up to the speed that is suitable to the drive. The engine is available as a brake, and greater power of this kind can be had by moving the <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> down towards low"Motoring correspondent, The Times ...|$|R

50|$|Consequently, {{during the}} time the reverse thrust lever for the right engine was being moved forward (to reduce the reverse thrust), the {{airplane}} captain unintentionally moved the throttle <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> for the left engine forward (increasing forward thrust). The reverse thrust of the right engine was reduced by the pilot gradually up to the stowed position and remained in that position until the time of colliding with the barriers. The throttle <b>control</b> <b>lever</b> for the left engine was in the position corresponding to the forward thrust setting of roughly 60% of its full rated takeoff thrust, and remained in that position until the flight data recorder (FDR) stopped recording. The crew apparently did not notice the left engine’s increase in forward thrust.|$|R
