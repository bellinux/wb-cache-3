5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route18, an {{unsigned}} legislative {{route that}} {{ran from the}} Pennsylvania state line at Ripley {{to the mouth of}} the Niagara River north of Youngstown with a gap through the city <b>of</b> <b>Buffalo.</b> North <b>of</b> <b>Buffalo,</b> Route18 followed Niagara Falls Boulevard (modern NY950K and U.S. Route62 or US62) to Niagara Falls and current NY104 and NY18F between Niagara Falls and Lake Ontario. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of legislative Route18 north <b>of</b> <b>Buffalo</b> became the basis for NY34, which began at Main Street (NY5) in Buffalo and followed the path of legislative Route18 through Niagara Falls and along the Niagara River to Lake Ontario. NY18 was assigned at the same time; however, it initially went from the Pennsylvania state line at Limestone north to Buffalo along what is now US219, NY417, NY353 and US62. In Cattaraugus County, NY18 initially followed Leon and New Albion Roads between Cattaraugus and Little Valley.|$|E
