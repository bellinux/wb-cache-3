25|$|The FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC {{is named}} the J. Edgar Hoover Building, after Hoover. Because of the {{controversial}} nature of Hoover's legacy, there have been periodic proposals to rename it by legislation proposed by both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate. For example, in 2001 Senator Harry Reid sponsored an amendment to strip Hoover's name from the building. Reid said J. Edgar Hoover's name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> building is a stain on the building. The Senate did not adopt the amendment.|$|E
25|$|Despite their pardons, Felt and Miller won {{permission}} from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to appeal the conviction so as to remove it from their record and {{to prevent it from}} being used in civil suits by the victims of the break-ins they ordered. Ultimately, Felt's law license was returned by the court in 1982, which cited Reagan's pardon. In June 1982, Felt and Miller testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee's security and terrorism subcommittee that the restrictions placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> by Attorney General Edward H. Levi were threatening the country's safety.|$|E

25|$|The FBI in {{the past}} has {{identified}} individuals by the sequence number in which each individual has appeared on the list. Some individuals have even appeared twice, and often a sequence number was permanently assigned to an individual suspect who was soon caught, captured, or simply removed, before his or her appearance could be published on the publicly released list. In those cases, the public would see only gaps in the number sequence reported by the FBI. For convenient reference, the wanted suspect's sequence number and date of entry <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> list appear below, whenever possible.|$|E
25|$|Osama bin Laden, {{the founder}} and former leader of al-Qaeda, went into hiding {{following}} {{the start of the}} War in Afghanistan in order to avoid capture by the United States and/or its allies {{for his role in the}} September 11, 2001 attacks, and having been <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list since 1999. After evading capture at the Battle of Tora Bora in December 2001, his whereabouts became unclear, and various rumours about his health, continued role in al-Qaeda, and location were circulated. Bin Laden also released several video and audio recordings during this time.|$|E
25|$|On May 26, 2004, United States Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller {{announced}} that reports indicated that Ghailani {{was one of}} seven al-Qaeda members who were planning a terrorist action for the summer or fall of 2004. The other alleged terrorists named on that date were Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, who had also been earlier listed with Ghailani by the FBI as a Most Wanted Terrorist for the 1998 embassy attack, and Abderraouf Jdey, Amer El-Maati, Aafia Siddiqui, Adam Yahiye Gadahn, and Adnan G. El Shukrijumah. Abderraouf Jdey was already <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list since January 17, 2002, to which the other four were added as well.|$|E

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of December 4, 1980, career criminal Donald Eugene Webb was the chief suspect {{in the murder of}} the borough police chief Gregory Adams in Saxonburg. This was the first homicide in the borough's nearly 150-year history and received national attention, especially as Webb was never apprehended. Webb was put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> Most Wanted List, but was never captured. After the FBI found new evidence in her house in 2016, in July 2017, his wife Lillian Webb confessed to hiding her husband for 17 years, and led the FBI and police to his remains buried in the yard of her Massachusetts house. He died in 1999 of strokes, at the approximate age of 68.|$|E
25|$|In December 1994, {{after being}} tipped off by his former FBI handler about a pending {{indictment}} under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, Bulger fled Boston {{and went into}} hiding. For 16 years, he remained at large. For 12 of those years, Bulger was prominently listed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. Beginning in 1997, the New England media exposed criminal actions by federal, state, {{and local law enforcement}} officials tied to Bulger. The revelation caused great embarrassment to the FBI. In 2002, Special Agent John J Connolly was convicted of federal racketeering charges for helping Bulger avoid arrest. In 2008, Special Agent Connolly completed his term on the federal charges and was transferred to Florida where he was convicted of helping plan the murder of John B Callahan, a Bulger rival. In 2014, that conviction was overturned on a technicality. Connolly was the agent leading the investigation of Bulger.|$|E
25|$|Thurman's {{involvement}} {{in identifying the}} fragment later proved controversial because of a 1997 report <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> Laboratory, unrelated to the PA 103 investigation, written by U.S. Inspector-General Michael Bromwich, which concluded that Thurman had altered lab reports in ways that had rendered them inaccurate, and {{that he ought to}} be transferred to a position outside the FBI lab (The Wall Street Journal, September 26, 1997). Thurman was not called to testify. Potentially also damaging to the Crown's case as presented at the trial, the testimony of Thurman's UK counterpart, DERA's Alan Feraday, has now been called into question. In three separate cases where Feraday had been the expert witness, men against whom he gave evidence have had their convictions overturned. And, thirdly, Dr Thomas Hayes was castigated for his failure to test the timer fragment for explosives residue, even though at the trial he maintained that the fragment was too small to test. Defence counsel contrasted Hayes' testimony with that of two of his colleagues (Elliott and Higgs) at DERA's forensic laboratory who, as revealed in the notorious Maguire Seven trial, had tested minute samples from underneath the fingernails of the suspects for explosives residue. In another important development, a retired senior Scottish police chief added fuel to the timer fragment fire by claiming that the CIA planted this crucial piece of evidence.|$|E

500|$|Murray's {{case was}} one of many cited by proponents of a cold case unit for New Hampshire in 2009. Her case was {{subsequently}} added to the newly-established cold case unit later that year. In 2010, Fred Murray publicly criticized the police investigation for treating the disappearance as a 'missing person' case and not a criminal matter and has called <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> to join the investigation. Jeffery Strelzin said in February 2009 that the investigation is still active. [...] "We don't know if Maura is a victim, but the state is treating it as a potential homicide. It may be a missing-persons case, but it's being handled as a criminal investigation." ...|$|E
500|$|Olivia and Peter first suspect Dr. Nayak's {{research}} assistant Zach (Jarrett Knowles) but find him dead. Back in Boston Walter believes the chips lead to mind control and tests this <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>FBI</b> agent assigned to him while Peter and Olivia are away. However, during these tests Walter soon changes his theory; the dreams are being stolen from their hosts {{to cause a}} [...] "high" [...] in Dr. Nayak, who is receiving them and has two personalities. Peter and Olivia shut down the dream equipment before Nayak kills another victim, but the doctor dies in the process. The final scene shows Peter dreaming about his childhood when Walter kidnaps him, an event Peter normally has no memory of; Peter wakes up confused but still unaware of what his father did.|$|E
