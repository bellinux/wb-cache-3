40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the distinctive responses of the maize catalases to the plant growth regulator abscisic acid (ABA). We analyzed RNA and enzyme accumulation in excised maize embryos and found that each catalase responded differently to exogenously applied ABA. Levels <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 1 transcript and enzyme activity rapidly increased. In contrast, levels <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 2 transcript and protein decreased, while Cat 3 transcript levels were not affected. In developing kernels of the ABA-deficient/biosynthetic viviparous mutant vp 5, lower levels <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 1 RNA correlated with lower endogenous ABA levels when compared to measured levels in comparably aged wild-type siblings from the same ear. The maize vp 1 mutant line is morphologically insensitive to normal endogenous levels of ABA. Analysis of the response <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 1 to exogenously applied ABA in mutant and wild-type vp 1 sibling embryos suggests that, unlike other ABA-responsive genes analyzed to date, the Vp 1 gene product is not essential for the ABA-mediated regulation <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 1. The significance of these responses to ABA in defining the roles <b>of</b> the various <b>CATs</b> in maize is discussed...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 2 and Cat 3 catalase transcripts in 6 - 7 -day postimbibition leaves of normally pigmented and pigment-deficient maize seedlings under different light regimes. In seedlings of normal inbred maize lines Cat 2 mRNA accumulates to significantly higher levels in either continuous light or a diurnal light/dark cycle than in continuous dark. In contrast to the high levels <b>of</b> the <b>Cat</b> 2 message observed in their wild-type siblings, carotenoid-deficient mutants accumulate Cat 2 mRNA at barely detectable levels. Mutants deficient in chlorophylls, but having normal carotenoid levels, accumulate normal levels <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 2 mRNA. This suggests that both light and carotenoids are required for the normal accumulation <b>of</b> the <b>Cat</b> 2 message. The steady-state level <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 3 RNA exhibits a dramatic diurnal variation when seedlings are grown under a 24 -hr light/dark cycle. We have previously shown that this variation is at the level <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 3 gene transcription and is {{under the control of}} a novel circadian rhythm. In this study we show that both pigment-deficient mutants and their wild-type siblings exhibit the normal diurnal pattern <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 3 RNA accumulation. This indicates that photosynthetic pigments, allelic variation, and genetic background do not directly affect the temporal pattern <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 3 accumulation in leaves. We observed, however, that when normal plants are grown in either continuous light or continuous dark, the Cat 3 transcript in leaves is present at uniformly high levels throughout the 24 -hr sampling period. Because the Cat 3 gene is continually transcribed in leaves {{in the absence of a}} cyclic light regime, the normally observed diurnal variation <b>of</b> <b>Cat</b> 3 gene expression is apparently the result of a circadian-regulated transcriptional repressor...|$|R

5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} is an abnormality of the {{hip joint}} which can cause crippling lameness and arthritis.

X-rays submitted to the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) between 1974 and 2011 indicates that 24.3% of Maine Coons in the database were dysplastic.

5|$|Given the inaccessibility {{of much of}} the species' range, {{particularly}} the central Amazon, estimating jaguar numbers is difficult. Researchers typically focus on particular bioregions, thus species-wide analysis is scant. In 1991, 600–1,000 (the highest total) were estimated to be living in Belize. A year earlier, 125–180 jaguars were estimated to be living in Mexico's 4,000-km2 (2400-mi2) Calakmul Biosphere Reserve, with another 350 in the state of Chiapas. The adjoining Maya Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala, with an area measuring 15,000km2 (9,000mi2), may have 465–550 animals. Work employing GPS telemetry in 2003 and 2004 found densities of only six to seven jaguars per 100km2 in the critical Pantanal region, compared with 10 to 11 using traditional methods; this suggests the widely used sampling methods may inflate the actual numbers <b>of</b> <b>cats.</b>|$|E

5|$|Many human {{medicines}} {{should never}} be given to cats. For example, the painkiller paracetamol (or acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol and Panadol) is extremely toxic to cats: even very small doses need immediate treatment and can be fatal. Even aspirin, which is sometimes used to treat arthritis in cats, is much more toxic to them than to humans and must be administered cautiously. Similarly, application of minoxidil (Rogaine) to the skin <b>of</b> <b>cats,</b> either accidentally or by well-meaning guardians attempting to counter loss of fur, has sometimes been fatal. Essential oils can be toxic to cats and cases have been reported of serious illnesses caused by tea tree oil, including flea treatments and shampoos containing it.|$|E
