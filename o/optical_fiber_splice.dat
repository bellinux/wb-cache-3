These methods are {{specified in the}} chapters; their application in different environments and conditions is accentuated. This paper presents splicing optical fibers. It emphasizes problems which can occur if proper procedures aren´t kept or if improper device is used. In the thesis there is the chapter dealing with problems which can arise during splicing optical fibers - these negative influences are evaluated with educational equipments EF- 970 - 01 PLASTIC by the company MIKROKOM, s. r. o. Another aim {{of the work is}} to describe mechanical <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>splice</b> 3 MTM FibrlokTM. This kind of device was lent for testing optical fibers multiple splicing. It was tested under extreme conditions. Statistically processed values of insertion loss and splice reflectance, measured by OTDR are the results of the test. Comparing measured values, technical report ones, regarding for usage in practice, there is a possibility of 75 multiple reusing of the mechanical <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>splice.</b> The prediction of magnitude insertion loss, calculated for thousands splice cycles follows. The next part of the work deals with fusion splices and contains comparison of splices made with two cleavers: CORNING LWL-TRENNGERAT S 46999 -M 9 -D 12 and the later model - Fitel S 325 A cleaver. The result is that older S 46999 -M 9 -D 12 model gained lower attenuation. The results of both previous measurements are influenced by human factor.

For the safety of construction workers and the steady development of oil industries, it is critically important to measure the stress state of a casing pipe. This study develops a rugged, real-time monitoring, and warning system that combines the distributed Brillouin Scattering Time Domain Reflectometry (BOTDR) and the discrete fiber Bragg grating (FBG) measurement. The BOTDR optical fiber sensors were embedded with no <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> <b>splice</b> joints in a fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) rebar and the FBG sensors were wrapped in epoxy resins and glass clothes, both installed during the segmental construction of casing pipes. In situ tests indicate that the proposed sensing system and installation technique can survive the downhole driving process of casing pipes, withstand a harsh service environment, and remain intact with the casing pipes for compatible strain measurements. The relative error of the measured strains between the distributed and discrete sensors is less than 12 %. The FBG sensors successfully measured the maximum horizontal principal stress with a relative error of 6. 7 % in comparison with a cross multipole array acoustic instrument...|$|E

40|$|A {{fiber optic}} {{temperature}} sensor uses a light source which transmits light through an <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> to a sensor {{head at the}} opposite end of the <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> from the light source. The sensor head has a housing coupled to the end of the <b>optical</b> <b>fiber.</b> A metallic reflective surface is coupled to the housing adjacent the end of the <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> to form a gap having a predetermined length between the reflective surface and the <b>optical</b> <b>fiber.</b> A detection system is also coupled to the <b>optical</b> <b>fiber</b> which determines the temperature at the sensor head from an interference pattern of light which is reflected from the reflective surface...|$|R
