40|$|ABSTRACT Individuals {{differ in}} innumerable ways, some adaptive, some maladaptive, and some neutral.

This article outlines a taxonomy <b>of</b> origins <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> differences—environmental sources <b>of</b> adaptive differences (e. g., early environmental calibration), heritable sources of adaptive differences (e. g., adaptive self-assessment of heritable qualities), nonadaptive sources <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> differences (e. g., incidental by-products of adaptive variation), and maladaptive sources <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> differences (e. g., epigenetic trauma). The second section outlines empirical procedures for confirming or falsifying the differing conceptions <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> differences, {{with a special}} focus on empirically distinguishing adaptive individual differences from those that are maladaptive or nonadaptive. The final section highlights the importance <b>of</b> <b>individual</b> differences for solving social adaptive problems.
