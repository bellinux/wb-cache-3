25|$|The Tarzan Swing: This was a steel arch {{hanging from}} a -long cable over a spring-fed pool. Patrons waited in long lines {{for the chance to}} hang from it, swing out over the water, then jump off as the beam reached its height. In early years the area patrons jumped off from was not over the water but a {{cushioned}} area. Some people who let go as soon as they started their swing would land on the cushion and then slide/crash into the water. In the mid-1980s the starting position was shifted so that patrons started over the water. Some patrons hung on too long and scraped their toes on the concrete at the far side. Others used the ride properly, but were then surprised to find out the water underneath was very cold. It was cold enough, in fact, that the lifeguards sometimes had to rescue people who were so surprised by the sudden chill that they could not swim <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> In 1984, one man died from a heart attack after experiencing the swing.|$|E

During the shooting of an underwater sequence, a few electrical lights were used. The electricians changed the lines, creating a short circuit which resulted in the death of one of the unit members. Mahesh had gotten <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> two seconds before the accident happened which he termed a [...] "miracle".|$|E
500|$|Thorpe {{lined up}} {{later in the}} night {{alongside}} Klim, Chris Fydler and Ashley Callus to anchor the 4Ã—100m freestyle relay, an event which the Americans had never lost at Olympic level. The third leg ended with Australia only an arm's length ahead of the United States. Thorpe timed his dive much better than Gary Hall, Jr., and surfaced a body length ahead. Hall's sprinting ability allowed him to open a lead by the final turn, but Thorpe's finishing kick overhauled him in the final metres, sparking wild celebrations amongst the partisan crowd. It evoked an uncharacteristic celebration from Thorpe, who immediately jumped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> screaming and hugging his ecstatic teammates. He even {{went as far as}} playing air guitar to mock Hall's pre-race claim that the Americans would [...] "smash" [...] the Australians [...] "like guitars".|$|E

From 1989 through 2002, there were two double elimination <b>pools,</b> but <b>the</b> two teams coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pools</b> played a single championship game and a champion was crowned regardless <b>of</b> whether <b>the</b> loser had two losses.|$|R
500|$|The album's artwork {{was photographed}} by Harry Langdon in the {{swimming}} pool of the Jackson family's home. Jackson described Langdon as [...] "the sweetest man imaginable". She took inspiration from a photograph of actress Elizabeth Taylor submerged {{in a swimming pool}} which was taken early in her career. In the photograph, nothing could be seen apart from Taylor's face above the water; her body was hidden beneath the surface. Jackson thought the pose was dramatic and loved the fact that she could do the same thing, and not to have to reveal anything except for her face. With the photographer, his assistant and other people around the pool, she was still reluctant to take off her robe, and stand there in her bathing suit. She waited until everybody got distracted to slip into the pool. After they took the photos, she waited until everybody was gone to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Set {{just weeks}} after Rex's death, Andrew's first opening shot in Season 2 is to claim Bree is {{incapable}} of having murdered his father because [...] "it takes guts to kill somebody". He resents George Williams for dating Bree while Rex was still alive, and is very rude {{to him when he}} sees him with Bree. Andrew shaved his head after the 1st season. Bree blackmails Andrew with swim club subs into attending dinner with George. In response, Andrew imitates Bree's pleasure moan to provoke George, who tries to send him to his room but will not tell Bree why, and she refuses to punish Andrew without a reason. George decides to get rid of Andrew by kissing his mother during his swim meet, which angers him so much that he jumps <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> and attacks George. That evening, Andrew packs his bags for Camp Hennessey a second time.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the show}} got picked up to reduce {{production}} costs the interior, backyard, and pool house was rebuilt at Raleigh Studios in Manhattan Beach, Ca. [...] During some early episodes in season 1, the Cohens were doing some extensive remodeling; {{this was probably}} written in because the new set did not accurately recreate the original home in Malibu. [...] The kitchen countertop changed from a dark grey granite to a light beige marble countertop. [...] The sink in the island countertop switches {{to the other side}} and the backsplash tile changes. During the pilot episode Ryan walked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> house to look at the ocean view. [...] Past the property line there were houses, streets, cars, and land between the house and the ocean. [...] After the set was created, there was just an ocean and sky backdrop as if the house were sitting on a cliff; also artificial grass and studio lighting looked less realistic than in the pilot episode.|$|E
2500|$|One year later, Yates {{attended}} the 56th BAFTA Awards with a British Academy Film Award nomination for Best Short Film for the fourteen-minute production, Rank, which expressed the social elements of racism, friendship and adolescence through {{the story of}} a street gang that cross Glasgow to witness the arrival of a group of Somali refugees. Yates said that even though The Way We Live Now was [...] "a very big production" [...] and [...] "enormous fun to do", Rank was an opportunity to [...] "shake all that off" [...] and [...] "get back to [...] roots." [...] Of the casting, Yates said that he [...] "wanted to use non-actors to tell the story, to create a reality ... the kids we cast in Glasgow had never done a film before." [...] The film was noted for its gritty style and cinematography, with a review from Eye For Film stating that [...] "such intelligent use of camera and cast lifts Yates <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> of promising young directors into the front line of genuine hopefuls. This work demands respect." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taima is a transient/Icelandic hybrid female {{killer whale}} born in captivity to Gudrun in 1989. Trainers believe that Gudrun's {{behavior}} towards Nyar may have confused Taima, as {{she may have}} learned by example that this was how to raise a calf. In May 1998, Taima {{gave birth to a}} male calf named Sumar. They were separated when he was about eight months old because of the aggression between them. On one occasion while performing, Taima started biting Sumar and throwing him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> onto the trainer's platform. She then slid out herself, and continued to bite him. In November 2000, Taima gave birth to a male named Tekoa. The two were separated after only nine months due to aggression between them. On March 12, 2007, Taima gave birth to her third calf, Malia. Taima seemed to be a better mother this time, and no notable occurrences of aggression were reported; this may be in part {{due to the fact that}} Kalina acted as [...] "aunt" [...] to Malia and helped Taima to look after her. Kalina was a very experienced mother and would often be kept with Malia, while Taima was given time with her mate, Tilikum.|$|E
2500|$|On {{a routine}} {{training}} ride near Boulder, Wellington suffered a serious bike crash on Saturday 24 September, exactly {{two weeks before}} the World Championships in Kona. She received severe road rash (equivalent to second- or third-degree burns) on her left leg and injuries to her left elbow and hip. Wellington described the pain as [...] "intense", much worse than the fractures she had suffered earlier in the year, but X-rays showed no broken bones. Her first attempt at training after the accident was on the following Tuesday when, despite a swollen, infected leg, she tried swimming. She could manage no more than two lengths, in pain she later described as [...] "excruciating". She had to be lifted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> and given crutches to enable her to walk; her boyfriend Tom Lowe and coach Dave Scott had to carry her back to her car. The next day, Wednesday, she was due to fly to Kona, but she preferred to remain in Boulder, close to the experts treating her. The infection was causing her fever and night sweats, and the hip pain had disturbed her running gait.|$|E
2500|$|The buildup to [...] "Bettymania" [...] {{by various}} {{broadcasters}} {{also began to}} take shape overseas, especially in the United Kingdom. On December 6, 2006, Channel 4 began to advertise the show. The ad shows seemingly attractive models gathered around a pool, but as the camera angle changes a model comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> wearing Betty's glasses, then as the models smile, they are all wearing Betty's braces. Another ad parodies Marks and Spencer's successful fashion advertising campaign, as well as Dove and Gap campaigns. A voice over then says, [...] "Fashion has a new face. 'Ugly Betty' Coming Soon To 4." [...] After a week of these teasers, clips from the actual program were included in the trailers. In mid-January, Davina McCall, presenter of Celebrity Big Brother dressed up as Betty live on Channel 4 before the titles of the second eviction show of the evening. On February 16, 2007, Ashley Jensen (Christina) also dressed up as Betty during an airing of Channel 4's Friday Night Project, where she was the guest host. The children's channel CBeebies also parodied the title sequence, with one variation mixing faces of regular CBeebies characters until finally settling with Tiny from Little Robots.|$|E

2500|$|By Saturday, the {{infection}} had died down, and she flew to Kona. On Sunday Wellington published a blog post {{in which she}} referred to Sun Tzu's book The Art of War and elaborated on how war strategy {{could be applied to}} triathlon, saying that she hadn't lost her fight because of her injuries and quoting Bella Bayliss's dictum that [...] "It's not a race, it's war." [...] The flight had caused her leg to swell up again, but she was still able to do some bike and run training. On Monday she tried a four-kilometre swim, her first hard swim since the crash; this produced pain in her pectoral muscle, which worsened over subsequent training sessions. On Tuesday she tried another swim session: after 1km she had to stop, and again had to be lifted <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> by Lowe. She later wote, [...] "I was 'crying into my goggles', and described the pain as 'unbearable'", adding, [...] "I was convinced I'd broken my rib. Every breath hurt and I couldn't move my arm properly." [...] The previous day Mike Leahy had begun treating Wellington using his Active Release Therapy (ART); he instructed her {{to go to the hospital}} for tests, not wanting to continue ART treatment if the problem was a fracture. The hospital's first concern, from the swollen state of her leg, was that she might have a pulmonary embolism. Six hours of tests showed that she had no fractures, nor any embolism, but that she did have damaged pectoral and intercostal muscles; the badly infected state of her leg was obvious from the appalling smell when the bandages were removed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of the Uddeler- and Bleeke Lake(s): This myth concerns a battle that allegedly took place between Donar the God of Thunder with the winter giants and the [...] "Midgaardslang" [...] (a giant snake monster) who strategically align against him. The giants throw hail down, while the snake climbs into a tall oak tree and blows poison into the air. Donar attacks, riding through the air on [...] "his billy-goat wagon", the sky blazes and the earth trembles because of his [...] "never missing thunderhammer." [...] Donar strikes the snake on his head with such force on the head {{that not only was}} the monster crushed, the mighty thunderhammer went seven miles deep into the earth. The snake dies. However, in the attack the snake's poison scorches and stuns Donar. Donar crashes down, with his [...] "steerless goats" [...] and wagon onto the Donderberg (meaning Donar's hill or [...] "Thunder-hill") in Dieren. Then the earth sank into the sea, the seagod blew a horn and a big black ship came to collect Donar's body. When the floodwaters receded, two lakes mark the spot that are [...] "as deep as the world, the Uddelermeer or [...] "Lake of Uddel" [...] (Uttiloch), and the Godenmeer (God's lake)..." [...] Later the legend continues that Thor's hammer surfaced from the depths. The grave of Migdaardsnake became overgrown with the forest nearby, until in 1222 a bright flame shot <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> and the ghost of the snake wriggled up and fled north. The forest was burned and a moor near the lake remains where the forest once was.|$|E
