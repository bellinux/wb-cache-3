5|$|The group {{discovers that}} the generator's fuel {{reserves}} are near exhausted; when empty, the facility will enter a self-destruct mode by design to eradicate all the infectious diseases stored there. Jenner seals the building, refusing to allow Rick's group to leave, but promises that the high-impulse thermobaric weapon designed {{to destroy the}} facility will mean their deaths will be quick. Rick's group tries in vain to have Jenner <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> and Rick eventually convinces him {{to allow them to}} at least try to overcome the tragedy rather than be forced to die. Two of Rick's group, Jacqui (Jeryl Prescott Sales) and Andrea (Laurie Holden), choose to stay behind, but Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) refuses to leave without Andrea and stays as well. As Rick departs, Jenner whispers something to him. Shortly thereafter, Andrea has a change of heart, not wishing to see Dale die, and the two escape the building moments before its destruction. The surviving members return to their vehicles and set off away from the smoking husk of the CDC.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of the ocean at night. It then shows a mansion by the water, in which Buena is seen {{standing}} by a balcony. The following scene shows Range entering the mansion as two men <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> for her. Buena is shown walking {{in the middle of}} a masquerade ball, in which she captures the attention of a man. The Sugababes are shown on a couch, where Buchanan holds a man's hand; they all then walk down the mansion's staircase. Each group member begins to dance with a man at the ball. Buena walks towards a mirror which depicts a reflection of the Sugababes, while Buchanan drops her white mask which subsequently shatters. Towards the end of the video, they are shown leaving the ball before Buchanan jumps off the balcony and into the water. All three members are shown collectively in the water, which begins to fade out into the sky. The last scene shows the men that were in the mansion walking away.|$|E
25|$|The DeLorean solved these {{problems}} {{by using a}} solid-steel torsion bar (supplied by Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation) to counterbalance a full-sized door and then used simple pneumatic struts {{similar to those found}} in hatchback cars to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and damp their movement.|$|E

25|$|There are no maps {{posted on}} the trains, but {{electronic}} screens in each carriage and recorded voice messages announce the stations as they come up. The station announcements and all signs are bilingual in English and French; a few features of the trains, such as the buttons touched to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> are also marked in German {{as a result of}} their design heritage.|$|E
25|$|The Tesla Model X, first {{introduced}} in 2015, has double hinged gull-wing doors, called falcon-wing doors by Tesla. The Model X has several design considerations {{to make the}} doors more practical. Being double hinged allows them to open with less clearance (horizontal and vertical) than would otherwise be required. The vehicle also has sensors to determine ceiling height {{and the presence of}} potential obstacles and determines how the hinges will operate to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> and avoid the obstacles, if possible.|$|E
25|$|Blue jays, {{like other}} corvids, are highly curious and are {{considered}} intelligent birds. Young individuals playfully snatch brightly coloured or reflective objects, such as bottle caps or pieces of aluminum foil, and carry them around until they lose interest. While not confirmed to {{have engaged in}} tool use in the wild, blue jays in captivity have been observed using strips of newspaper as tools to obtain food, while captive fledglings have been observed attempting to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of their cages.|$|E

25|$|In early September, Don Fernando, Duke of Alba (who {{despite being}} a strong defender of Catholicism, {{described}} the massacre as a atrocity), arrived at Mons with reinforcements and took {{command of the}} operations. The Prince of Orange continued to advance through the Netherlands, and some cities and villages were forced to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> to its passage for fear (Alba was specially angry for this), although some, such as Leuven, prevented the Orange's troops entered the city, in exchange for supplies. On 10 September arrived near Mons, and Alba, knowing the Orange's arrival, positioned his troops for a possible attack.|$|E
25|$|The center {{platform}} {{was first}} used in passenger service in 1959, but was originally built {{along with the other}} platforms. It served the purpose of a Spanish solution, allowing passengers to exit both sides of subway cars as the express trains would <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> on both sides. Newer subway cars' door controls made it more difficult to open doors {{on both sides of the}} train simultaneously; thus this solution became impractical and the platform was closed on November 8, 1973. In 2007–2010, it was converted to a crossunder between the IRT side platforms. Large metal fences have been erected to keep people away from the edges.|$|E
25|$|Ridership {{has been}} rising, and {{user-friendly}} features {{that have grown}} up through custom and practice help this. For instance, passengers <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> by pressing a green strip on the central pole (in PCC trams) or an illuminated button (on Flexity trams), and drivers usually {{make a point of}} waiting for latecomers. However, overcrowding at rush hours and at weekend is common. The rate of detected fare-dodging is 4.15%, despite periodic enforcement campaigns, and this is being addressed by the installation of ticket barriers in all metro stations. From 2013, the obligation to check out of as well as into the system is being progressively introduced.|$|E

25|$|While {{the actors}} were {{attempting}} to quell the panic, the head usher, Thomas Rocheford, went {{to the rear of}} the auditorium to open the Flood's Alley special exit door on the east end of the vestibule, opposite of the Washington Street entrances, one of the three special exit doors designed by architect Jackson. Since the doors were rarely used, he found the locking mechanism corroded; he was initially unable to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors.</b> He found a small piece of metal in his pocket and with this was able to release the doors. This action enabled the people on the floor of the auditorium to evacuate the building fairly quickly, but Rocheford's action came at a cost. The open doors furnished airflow for the fire on the stage, which immediately grew in intensity.|$|E
25|$|The Coven {{sets out}} to find the next Supreme with the test of Seven Wonders. Misty and Zoe die while {{attempting}} different tests. Queenie is disqualified when she is unable to revive Zoe. Madison can but refuses, and angrily leaves after she fails a test. Kyle then kills her for not saving Zoe. Cordelia enters the competition and successfully brings Zoe back. She becomes the new Supreme, regains her sight, and reveals the Coven to the world. Myrtle is burned once again for murdering the Council. Zoe and Queenie are appointed seats on the Council, and Kyle becomes the new butler. Fiona returns to the Coven alive but withered from cancer. She makes amends with Cordelia, before dying in her arms. Fiona is then banished to hell with the Axeman. Cordelia, Zoe, Queenie, and Kyle <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> to the Academy, welcoming the new recruitment of witches.|$|E
25|$|At {{first the}} {{security}} forces obeyed Ceauşescu's orders to shoot protesters. However, {{on the morning of}} 22 December, the Romanian military suddenly changed sides. This came after it was announced that defense minister Vasile Milea had committed suicide after being unmasked as a traitor. Believing Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over virtually en masse to the revolution. Army tanks began moving towards the Central Committee building with crowds swarming alongside them. The rioters forced <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of the Central Committee building in an attempt to capture Ceauşescu and his wife, Elena, coming within a few meters of the couple. However, they managed to escape via a helicopter waiting for them {{on the roof of the}} building. The revolution resulted in 1,104 deaths. Unlike its kindred parties in the Warsaw Pact, the PCR simply melted away; no present-day Romanian party claiming to be its successor has ever been elected to the legislature since the change of system.|$|E

With goal tender Nick Eckhardt will getting more ice time with the team, and the likely return of Finnish imports Hakala and Teisala, the Canberra Knights are set {{to be a strong}} team in the 2008 AIHL season. On 26 February 2014 club owner John Raut {{announced}} that the team have folded operations effective immediately and would not be competing in the upcoming 2014 AIHL season. Raut cited financial costs, lack of local players and poor performance as the reasons behind the move. The following day it was announced that the player group headed by captain Mark Rummukainen have approached the AIHL with plans on taking on the club's licence. The following month the league announced that the Knights had been replaced in the league by the CBR Brave. Knights owner, John Raut, will keep possession of the Knights brand and has suggested reviving the team in the future to play in the East Coast Super League.|$|E
