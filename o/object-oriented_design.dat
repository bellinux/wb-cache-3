5|$|During the game's development, {{the team}} lacked artists. The art {{director}} at Epic Games, Shane Caudle, and the artists at Digital Extremes {{could not make}} enough new textures because {{of the amount of}} diversity in characters and maps. In order to supplement the skin and texture production, Epic turned to contract artist Steve Garofalo. The game's level and content management program, UnrealEd, was written in Visual Basic and considered buggy, but no one had time to fix it. The game engine had an <b>object-oriented</b> <b>design,</b> and the scripting language, UnrealScript, was considered to be more like Java. The modularity of the <b>object-oriented</b> <b>design</b> meant that programmers could make large changes without affecting other parts of the game. Other tools used during development included Microsoft Visual Studio and 3D Studio Max. All of the weapon sound effects were created by Sonic Mayhem. The soundtrack for the game, which employed the system of module files, was written by Alexander Brandon, Michiel van den Bos, Andrew Sega, Dan Gardopee and Peter Hajba.|$|E

40|$|The {{goals of}} {{exception}} handling mechanisms are to make programs more reliable and robust. The integration of exception handling mechanisms with object-oriented languages raises some unique issues. The requirements of exception handling often conflict {{with some of}} the goals of <b>object-oriented</b> <b>designs,</b> such as supporting design evolution, functional specialization, and abstraction for implementation transparency. This paper demonstrates these conflicts, illustrates that the use of exception handling in object-oriented systems poses potential pitfalls, and suggests that their resolution {{is one of the first}} steps necessary to make exception handling robust in <b>object-oriented</b> <b>designs</b> and languages...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{develops}} a mathematical characterisation of object-oriented concepts by defining an observation-oriented semantics for an object-oriented language (OOL) {{with a rich}} variety of features including subtypes, visibility, inheritance, dynamic binding and polymorphism. The language is expressive enough for the specification of <b>object-oriented</b> <b>designs</b> and programs. We also propose a calculus based on this model to support both structural and behavioural refinement of <b>object-oriented</b> <b>designs.</b> We take {{the approach of the}} development of the design calculus based on the standard predicate logic in Hoare and He’s Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP). We also consider object reference in terms of object identity as values and mutually dependent methods...|$|R
40|$|Current diagramming {{techniques}} {{for the development}} and documentation of <b>object-oriented</b> <b>designs</b> largely emphasize capturing relationships among classes. Such techniques cannot capture full designs because the static nature of class relationships makes them inadequate for describing the dynamics of object collaboration. Other techniques attempt to diagram dynamic behavior but are limited by their media to producing essentially passive description of dynamic operations. What is still needed is a technique that models message ordering, changing visibility and temporal object lifetimes {{in a manner that}} is concise and immediate. We have developed an approach in which developers use animation to develop and capture <b>object-oriented</b> <b>designs.</b> This allows developers to <b>design</b> <b>object-oriented</b> scenarios in the way that they visualize them: by animating the actions of the objects in the scenario. The same animation then acts as the documentation for the design. Its playback makes immediately eviden [...] ...|$|R
