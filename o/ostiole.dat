5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called <b>ostiole.</b> Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the <b>ostiole</b> into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E
5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the <b>ostiole).</b> They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew {{their way through the}} syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E
25|$|In the puffballs, {{which include}} the genera Lycoperdon, Bovista, and Calvatia, spores are formed within spherical to pestle-shaped fruit bodies and are {{released}} either by wind (as the fruit body wears away, exposing the spore mass inside) or by raindrops. In the latter case, the fruit bodies develop an <b>ostiole</b> (apical hole) through which spores are puffed out by the pressure of raindrops falling on the fruit body surface. The same ingenious mechanism has evolved separately in the earthstars (Geastrum species), which have a hard outer layer to the fruitbody that splits open in a star-like manner to reveal the puffball-like spore sack.|$|E

50|$|Cliona viridis is an {{excavating}} sponge and on calcareous substrates, {{the mass}} of the sponge is largely unseen beneath the surface with just the osculi (exhalent openings) and <b>ostioles</b> (inhalent pores) projecting. The osculi are a few millimetres wide and are yellowish-green or light brown with pale rims. The <b>ostioles</b> are grouped together on flat-topped, sieve-like protuberances which may be white, yellow or brownish-green. The colour is due to the zooxanthellae which are present in the tissues. The exterior appearance of this sponge in its later growth stages is a smooth mosaic-like surface composed of a firm, tough material. Beneath this surface are galleries excavated by the sponge which are up to 2.5 mm in diameter. The whole sponge may be a globose structure some 15 cm in diameter.|$|R

O principal resultado das observações é o fato de que, em vez de três pares de ostíolos, o coração possui apenas um único ostíolo em cada uma das suas últimas câmaras. Material capturado no campo (Panstrongylus megistrus) possui normalmente três pares de ostíolos, porém diferentes em tamanho e localização. The author {{studied the}} anatomy of the dorsal vessel and aorta of Triatoma infestans, reared during some years in the laboratory.

In material collected in the field (Panstrongylus megistrus) we found normally three pairs of <b>ostioles,</b> but with certain differences in size and localization...|$|R
25|$|Female fig wasps arrive {{carrying}} pollen {{from their}} natal tree and squeeze {{their way through}} the <b>ostiole</b> into the interior of the syconium. The syncomium bears 500–600 female flowers arranged in multiple layers - those that are closer to the outer wall of the fig have short pedicels and long styles, while those that are located closer to the interior of the chamber have long pedicels and short styles. Female wasps generally lay their eggs in the short-styled flowers, while longer-styled flowers {{were more likely to be}} pollinated. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. Pollinated flowers which have not been parasitised give rise to seeds.|$|E
500|$|In maturity, the exoperidium {{at the top}} of the puffball sloughs away, {{revealing}} a pre-formed hole (<b>ostiole)</b> in the endoperidium, through which the spores can escape. In young puffballs, the internal contents, the gleba, is white and firm, but turns brown and powdery as the spores mature. [...] The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with hymenium (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue); the chambers collapse when the spores mature. Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the <b>ostiole</b> when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops. A study of the spore release mechanism in L.pyriforme using high-speed schlieren photography determined that raindrops of 1mm diameter or greater, including rain drips from nearby trees, were sufficient to cause spore discharge. The puffed spores are ejected from the <b>ostiole</b> at a velocity of about 100cm/second to form a centimeter-tall cloud one-hundredth of a second after impact. A single puff like this can release over a million spores.|$|E
500|$|The endoperidium is [...] in {{diameter}} by [...] high, sessile, and a dull grayish brown. The peristome {{is made of}} radially arranged fibrils that clump together at the apex in groups of unequal length to form an opening that appears jagged or torn. The circular area bordering the peristome is a paler color. Spores {{are thought to be}} dispersed by the wind sucking them out when it blows over the hole, or when falling raindrops hit the flexible endoperidium, creating a puff of air that forces the spores through the <b>ostiole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like other sponges, Cliona viridis {{maintains}} a current of water through its structure. It draws water in through its <b>ostioles</b> and filters out food particles such as bacteria and other micro-organisms. During {{the passage of}} the water through the sponge, oxygen diffuses into the tissues and waste products diffuse out. The water is then expelled through the osculi.|$|R
5|$|Like many earthstars, {{the fungus}} uses {{the force of}} falling raindrops to help {{disperse}} the spores, which are ejected in little bursts when objects (such as rain) strike the outer wall of the spore sac. The gleba is brown to grayish-brown, with a cotton-like texture that, when compressed, allows the endoperidium to flex quickly and create a puff of air that is forced out through the <b>ostioles.</b> This generates a cloud of spores that can then be carried by the wind. There are columellae (sterile structures that start {{at the base of}} the gleba and extend through it), which are usually not evident in the mature gleba, but apparent {{at the base of the}} spore sac. The columellae are not connected to the <b>ostioles,</b> but rather, terminate within the gleba at some distance from them. The capillitia (sterile strands within the gleba) are long, slender, free, tapering, unbranched, and 2–5μm thick, with thickened walls. The spores are spherical, nonamyloid, and are ornamented with irregularly shaped flaring protuberances up to 2μm high. They measure 3.9–4.8μm in diameter (without ornamentation), and 5.4–7.0μm including the ornamentation.|$|R

500|$|Like all mushrooms, {{the fruit}} body of Geastrum triplex is the visible {{part of a}} larger organism. Hidden from sight are masses of nearly {{invisible}} fungal threads called mycelium, which form the active feeding and growing structures of the fungus. The fruit body—created when environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient availability are optimal—is designed to produce and disseminate spores. Geastrum triplex has the largest fruit body of the earthstar mushrooms. The immature fruit body is typically [...] in diameter, and up to [...] broad (Roody gives a larger value here, up to 11.5cm) after the rays have spread out. It is composed of a roughly spherical to egg-shaped structure, the endoperidium, topped by an opening, the <b>ostiole,</b> covered by fragments of tissue that form a small pointed beak (a peristome). The endoperidium is typically lacking any sort of stem (it is sessile) grayish brown to [...] "wood brown" [...] when young but light yellow-brown in dried, unopened specimens. The outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, develops splits which radiate from the apex and form between four and eight rays that separate from the endoperidium. The latter's thin and papery envelope surrounds a mass of spores and fertile tissue known as the gleba. The central part of the gleba contains a pseudocolumella (a columella not attached to the stalk), that is typically cylindrical or club-shaped, and extends up from the base. Because of the variability in columella persistence, size, structure and shape within the genus, its value for identification is limited.|$|E

Female wasps of this species are about [...] long and are capable of producing about 190 offspring.|$|E
50|$|Formation of the syconium {{begins with}} the initial growth of bracts, which curve to form a receptacle. When the outer bracts meet, they form the <b>ostiole</b> by interlock. Syconia may also develop lateral, basal, or peduncular bracts. There is a {{relationship}} between the shape of the <b>ostiole</b> and the morphology of the pollinating wasp.|$|E
50|$|Pertusaria {{is a large}} genus of warty crustose lichens It is in the Pertusariaceae family. The fruiting {{bodies are}} usually {{modified}} apothecia that immersed in warts on the main body (thallus) with small holes for the spores to emerge, similar to <b>ostioles,</b> or are fully above and lecanorine (spore bearing discs surrounded by a ring of tissue similar to the tissue of the thallus.

50|$|The fertile {{part of the}} stroma is the head. The head is {{granular}} {{because of}} the <b>ostioles</b> of the embedded perithecia. The perithecia are ordinally arranged and ovoid. The asci are cylindrical or slightly tapering at both ends, and may be straight or curved, with a capitate and hemispheroid apex, and may be two to four spored. Similarly, ascospores are hyaline, filiform, multiseptate at a length of 5-12 μm and subattenuated on both sides. Perithecial, ascus and ascospore characters in the fruiting bodies are the key identification characteristics of O. sinensis.|$|R
40|$|G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) control {{important}} aspects of asexual and sexual development in eukaryotic organisms. We have identified a predicted GPCR in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa with similarity to cyclic AMP-receptor like GPCRs from Dictyostelium discoideum and GCR 1 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of gpr- 1 is highest in female reproductive structures, and deletion of gpr- 1 leads to defects during sexual development. Unfertilized female structures (protoperithecia) from Δgpr- 1 strains are weakly pigmented, small, and submerged in the agar. The perithecia produced after fertilization have deformed beaks that lack <b>ostioles,</b> the openings through which ascospores are discharged. Localization studies using a GPR- 1 -green fluorescent protein fusion protein showed that GPR- 1 is targeted to female reproductive structures. Genetic epistasis experiments with the three Gα genes were inconclusive due to the early block in mating exhibited by Δgna- 1 strains. Phenotypic analysis of mutants from a high-throughput N. crassa knockout project allowed identification of BEK- 1, a homeodomain transcription factor that is a potential target of GPR- 1. The perithecial defects of Δbek- 1 strains {{are similar to those}} of the Δgpr- 1 strain, and epistasis analysis indicates that bek- 1 could function downstream of gpr- 1 during postfertilization events. The effect must be posttranscriptional, as bek- 1 transcript levels are not affected in Δgpr- 1 strains. The lack of <b>ostioles</b> in Δgpr- 1 and Δbek- 1 mutants has an undesirable effect on the ability to spread progeny (ascospores) by the normal ejection mechanism and would severely compromise the fitness of these strains in nature...|$|R

40|$|Unilocular cystocarps {{distinguish}} Pterocladia {{from the}} morphologically similar Gelidium, which exhibits bilocular cystocarps. Unequally developed locules, regarded as exceptional, {{have been found}} in two species assigned to Pterocladia. This study describes the patterns of morphological variation found during cystocarpic development in Pterocladia musciformis Taylor and in P. capillacea (Gmelin) Bornet & Thuret. About 70 % of the cystocarps of P. musciformis are Gelidium-type. The remaining exhibit unequally developed locules with a longitudinal septum displaced off-center, sometimes producing spores on only one side of the cystocarp and with one or a few <b>ostioles</b> only on the most protruding face of the frond or blade. In a Brazilian population of Pterocladia capillacea the internal cystocarpic structure changes with age. Young cystocarps exhibit the typical structure of the genus. In more mature cystocarps the septum is located close {{to the middle of the}} cystocarp, splitting the cavity, which then appears as two unequallocules. A few ofthese larger cystocarps show pericarps protruding equally on both surfaces of the frond and with <b>ostioles</b> on each surface. It is concluded that the origin of the placenta seems to be the only consistent reproductive difference that distinguishes Gelidium from Pterocladia. It spite of the comparative scarcity of gametophytes, this distinction is the only important one. Under this concept, the new combination Gelidium musciforme is proposed. The pattern of cystocarpic development exhibited by Pterocladia capillacea is clearly different from the one shown by P. lucida (R. Brown) J. Agardh, the type species of the genus. However, additional studies of interspecific and intraspecific variation in cystocarpic development in the genera Pterocladia and Gelidium seem desirable before erecting a new genus...|$|R
50|$|Ficus {{typically}} {{control the}} reproductive mutualism with fig wasps by being highly {{selective in their}} choice of pollinator. Contributing {{to the evolution of}} Ficus, pollinator specificity in Ficus is a pre-zygotic mechanism of reproductive isolation among plant species in diverse angiosperm lineages with varying degrees of sympatry and of gene flow in hybrid zones. This is proven by the high host specificity and low pollinator sharing ratios found in fig pollinators, especially in the genera Ceratosolen and Kradibia. Morphological examples of such specificity includes the diameters of <b>ostioles</b> compared to the head widths of the respective wasp species. While the fig species F. wassa have a diameter of 1.0-1.5 mm, its pollinator K. wassae had an average head width of 0.58 mm.|$|R

40|$|In 1950 I {{received}} from Mr. D. Hille Ris Lambers a strange Pseudococcid from Java {{which had been}} collected by Mr. F. W. Rappard, a senior forestry officer, who regularly collects aphids for Mr. Hille Ris Lambers on his tours of duty. As this insect was a coccid, it was transmitted to me for examination. Its appearance is quite abnormal; the shape of its body reminds one almost of a large mite (fig. 4). The 6 -segmented antennae have a dense vestiture of fine hairs, with exception of the 2 first segments which are very short. A tuft of 5 very long setae is present {{on the top of}} each of the anal lobes. The ungual digitules are extremely large and very flat.
