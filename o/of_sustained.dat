40|$|This study {{examined}} the mediating role of disinhibition (sensation seeking) on the positive association between performance goal orientation (achievement motivation) and risk <b>of</b> <b>sustaining</b> injury. Our study comprised 248 cadets from three military academies. In support of our hypotheses, we found {{a positive relationship between}} performance goal orientation and risk <b>of</b> <b>sustaining</b> injury and that this relationship was mediated by disinhibition. This finding contributes to the extant achievement goal theory literature by demonstrating a mechanism through which performance orientation relates to the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>sustaining</b> an injury. Theoretical and practical implications and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The Blitz was {{a period}} <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> {{strategic}} bombing of the United Kingdom by Germany during the Second World War. Between 7 September 1940 and 21 May 1941, sixteen British cities were hit by major aerial raids. Beginning on 7 September 1940, London was bombed by the Luftwaffe for 57 consecutive nights. Overall, {{more than one million}} London houses were destroyed or damaged during the Blitz, and more than 40,000 civilians were killed, almost half of them in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} of Tom Watson as the club's manager in 1896 {{led to the}} club's first period <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> success. Liverpool consolidated {{their position in the}} Football League following promotion to the First Division, and won their first League championship in 1901. A further championship followed in 1906, and in 1914 the club reached their first FA Cup final, losing to Burnley. Watson died suddenly in 1915 of pneumonia after the outbreak of the First World War. The club won two further championships in 1922 and 1923 when football resumed after the war.|$|E

5|$|The chicks are fed worms, insects, and berries. Waste {{accumulation}} {{does not}} occur in the nest because adults collect and take it away. Chicks are fed, and then raise tails for elimination of waste, a solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to flying off. All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other. Even after leaving the nest, the juveniles will follow their parents around and beg food from them. Juveniles become capable <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> flight two weeks after fledging.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> winds {{recommended by}} the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and used by most weather agencies {{is that of a}} 10-minute average at a height of 10m (33ft). However, the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period, at 10m (33ft) above the surface. The scale used by RSMC New Delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period, and the Australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval. These make direct comparisons between basins difficult.|$|E

5|$|The lack <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> and {{concentrated}} attacks on radar left it free to help direct {{the deployment of}} RAF units at opportune moments. Its continued warnings of incoming raids were a crucial benefit to Fighter Command. The Luftwaffe also had poor intelligence {{on the type of}} RAF airfields. It made repeated errors, often misidentifying airfields as Fighter Command bases, which turned out to belong to RAF Coastal Command and RAF Bomber Command. On Adlertag, most of the targets on the Luftwaffes list—if destroyed—would not have impaired Fighter Command in the slightest.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1874, Smetana {{had become}} {{completely}} deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> composition that continued for almost {{the rest of his}} life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. Smetana's reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, where advocates have raised his status above that of his contemporaries and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard Antonín Dvořák as a more significant Czech composer.|$|E

5|$|Cluj-Napoca and the {{surrounding}} area (Cluj County) had a rate of 268 criminal convictions per 100,000 inhabitants during 2006, just above the national average. After the revolution in 1989, the criminal conviction rate in the county entered a phase <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> growth, reaching a historic high of 429 in 1998, when it began to fall. Although the overall crime rate is reassuringly low, petty crime can be an irritant for foreigners, as in other large cities of Romania. During the 1990s, two large financial institutions, Banca Dacia Felix and Caritas, went bankrupt due to large-scale fraud and embezzlement.|$|E
5|$|Cædmon's {{only known}} {{surviving}} work is Cædmon's Hymn, the nine-line alliterative vernacular praise poem {{in honour of}} God which he supposedly learned to sing in his initial dream.

It {{is also one of the}} earliest recorded examples <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> poetry in a Germanic language. In 1898, Cædmon's Cross was erected in his honour in the graveyard of St Mary's Church in Whitby.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the majestic yet fairly traditional compositions by the two Strausses and Khachaturian, Kubrick used four highly modernistic compositions by György Ligeti that employ micropolyphony, the use <b>of</b> <b>sustained</b> dissonant chords that shift slowly. This technique was pioneered in Atmosphères, the only Ligeti piece heard in its entirety in the film. Ligeti admired Kubrick's film but, in {{addition to}} being irritated by Kubrick's failure to obtain permission directly from him, he was offended that his music was used in a film soundtrack shared by composers Johann Strauss II and Richard Strauss. Other music used is Ligeti's Lux Aeterna, the second movement of his Requiem and an electronically altered form of his Aventures, the last of which was also used without Ligeti's permission and is not listed in the film's credits.|$|E
