40|$|Coastal {{ecosystems}} are increasingly recognized as essential elements within coastal defence schemes and coastal adaptation. The capacity of coastal ecosystems, like marshes and <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs,</b> {{to maintain their}} own habitat and grow with sea-level rise via biophysical feedbacks {{is seen as an}} important advantage of such systems compared to man-made hard engineering structures. Providing a suitable substrate for oysters to settle on offers a kick-start for establishment at places where they were lost or are desirable for coastal protection. Accumulation of shell material, through recruitment and growth, is essential to the maintenance of <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> as it provides substrate for new generations (positive feedback loop), forming a self-sustainable structure. Insight in establishment, survival and growth thresholds and knowledge about the population dynamics are necessary to successfully implement <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> in coastal defence schemes. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate whether artificial Pacific <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> develop into self-sustaining <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> that contribute to coastal protection. Reef development was investigated by studying recruitment, survival and growth rates of oysters on artificial <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> in comparison with nearby natural Pacific <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs.</b> The artificial reef structure successfully offered substrate for settlement of oysters and therefore stimulated reef formation. Reef development, however, was hampered by local sedimentation and increasing tidal emersion. Tidal emersion is an important factor that can be used to predict where artificial <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> have the potential to develop into self-sustaining reefs that could contribute to coastal protection, but it is also a limiting factor in using <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> for coastal protectio...|$|R
50|$|Natural <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> are {{composed}} of living and dead oyster shells and provides important habitats for various species.

500|$|Unlike {{most of the}} Matagorda Bay system, Lavaca Bay has {{a mostly}} muddy bottom with large amounts of oyster reefs and spoils islands formed by the {{dredging}} of several canals. The shores are lined with grassy bluffs and a thick cover of trees. The Lavaca River enters near the Port Lavaca Causeway as it traverses Lavaca Bay from Port Lavaca to Point Comfort {{at the center of}} the bay, which is also its narrowest width. The river flows [...] southeast from its source in northeast Gonzales County, draining approximately [...] into Lavaca Bay. South of the Port Lavaca Causeway in Point Comfort, on the bay's eastern shore, a heavy industrial sector is located, which lines the coast to Cox Bay, which extends to the east. South of Cox Bay is the larger Keller Bay extension, which extends the bay to its easternmost point near Olivia. Below the extension, is a narrow peninsula, bounded by Matagorda Bay to the south, which extends west to mouth of Lavaca Bay. Across the mouth on the western shore, past the Matagorda Ship Channel, which runs through the middle of the bay to Point Comfort, the town of Magnolia Beach is found. To the northwest is the town of Alamo Beach, located on Gailinipper Point, from which a major <b>oyster</b> <b>reef</b> begins across the bay to Point Comfort. The point is located on the northeastern extreme of a headland that juts to the north, forming Chocolate Bay to the west. Port Lavaca is found north of Chocolate Bay, back at the Port Lavaca Causeway. North of the causeway is a large circular extension, forming the northern boundary of the Lavaca Bay. The northwestern extreme is formed by Garcitas Cove, fed by Garcitas Creek, which flows [...] from its source in DeWitt County. To the east is Venado Creek, which converges with the bay, northwest of the mouth of the Lavaca River.|$|E

2500|$|As an {{ecosystem}} engineer oysters provide [...] "supporting" [...] ecosystem services, along with [...] "provisioning", [...] "regulating" [...] and [...] "cultural" [...] services.

Oyster feeding and nutrient cycling activities could [...] "rebalance" [...] shallow, coastal ecosystems if restoration of historic populations could be achieved. Furthermore, assimilation of {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} into shellfish tissues provides an opportunity to remove these nutrients from the environment, but this benefit has only recently been recognized. In California's Tomales Bay, native oyster presence is associated with higher species diversity of benthic invertebrates but other ecosystem services have not been studied.

40|$|<b>Oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> {{around the}} world are declining rapidly, and {{although}} they haven t received as much attention as coral reefs, they are just as important to their local ecosystems and economies. <b>Oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> provide habitats for many species of fish, invertebrates, and crustaceans, as well as the next generations of oysters. Oysters are also harvested from many of these reefs and are an important segment of many local economies, including that of Mobile Bay, where oysters rank in the top five commercial marine species both by landed weight and by dollar value. Although the remaining Mobile Bay <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> are some of the least degraded in the world, projected climate change could have dramatic effects on the health of these important ecosystems. The viability of <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> depends on water depth and temperature, appropriate pH and salinity levels, and the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. Projected increases in sea level, changes in precipitation and runoff patterns, and changes in pH resulting from increases in the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the oceans could all affect the viability of <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> in the future. Human activities such as dredging and unsustainable harvesting practices are also adversely impacting the <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs.</b> Fortunately, several projects are already under way to help rebuild or support existing or previously existing <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs.</b> The success of these projects will depend on the local effects of climate change on the current and potential habitats and man s ability to recognize and halt unsustainable harvesting practices. As the extent and health of the reefs changes, it will have impacts on the Mobile Bay ecosystem and economy, changing the resources available to {{the people who live there}} and to the rest of the country, since Mobile Bay is an important national source of seafood.

40|$|Published online: 14 January 2015 <b>Oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> form over {{extensive}} {{areas and}} the diversity and productivity of sheltered coasts depend on them. Due to the relatively recent population growth of coastal settlements in Australia, {{we were able to}} evaluate the collapse and extirpation of native <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> (Ostrea angasi) {{over the course of a}} commercial fishery. We used historical records to quantify commercial catch of O. angasi in southern Australia from early colonization, around 1836, to some of the last recorded catches in 1944 and used our estimates of catch and effort to map their past distribution and assess oyster abundance over 180 years. Significant declines in catch and effort occurred from 1886 to 1946 and no native <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> occur today, but historically <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> extended across more than 1, 500 km of coastline. That <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> were characteristic of much of the coastline of South Australia from 1836 to 1910 appears not to be known because there is no contemporary consideration of their ecological and economic value. Based on the concept of a shifted baseline, we consider this contemporary state to reflect a collective, intergenerational amnesia. Our model of generational amnesia accounts for differences in intergenerational expectations of food, economic value, and ecosystem services of nearshore areas. An ecological system that once surrounded much of the coast and possibly the past presence of <b>oyster</b> <b>reefs</b> altogether may be forgotten and could not only undermine progress towards their recovery, but also reduce our expectations of these coastal ecosystems.
