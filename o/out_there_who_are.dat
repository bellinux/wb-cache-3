500|$|Inspired by Badu's {{creativity}} and their time listening to music, Chavarria added special effects and delays to the tracks by using and manipulating {{a variety of}} plug-ins and guitar pedals, subsequently reworking effects frequency and modulation parameters. Chavarria said {{they were able to}} expand on the producers' tracks rather than change them, because [...] "Erykah made this record to display to the world that there is this whole group of producers <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> outside of the mainstream making great music." [...] Badu said of the approach, [...] "I work in layers. The first layer is the track. The second layer is the songs. The third would be the musicians who add a certain nuance. And when they play, they play like they are a sample. Or we take a piece of what they played, and we sample and loop it." ...|$|E

[...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music.

Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it back in the day, and the new stuff is slammin'.'

5000|$|It's {{a horrible}} move. It is a political, ideological move {{driven by the}} {{language}} of the Trump campaign and ... promises in the campaign that were hyped by an exaggeration of the threat, and in fact what U.S. is doing now has probably made us less safe today than we were Friday morning before the order happened. Because we are now living the worst jihadist narrative possible: that there is undying enmity between Islam and the West. Muslims <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not part of the jihadist movement are now being shown that the story they were being told by the jihadists—"They hate us, they're our enemy"—that's being acted out by the American government.
