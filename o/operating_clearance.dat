40|$|A fixed {{geometry}} hybrid {{thrust bearing}} is investigated {{with three different}} supply orifice diameters. The test rig uses a face-to-face thrust bearing design, with the test bearing acting as the rotor loading mechanism. A hydraulic shaker applies the static axial load, which is reacted by a second thrust bearing. The rotor is supported radially by two water-lubricated fluid film journal bearings and {{is attached to a}} 30, 600 rpm motor via a high speed coupling with very low axial stiffness. Thrust bearings with three different orifice diameters (1. 63, 1. 80, and 1. 93 mm) are tested for a range of supply pressures, fluid film thicknesses, and rotational speeds. The water-lubricated test bearings have eight pockets, with feed orifices located centrally in each pocket. Experimental results are comparted to predictions found using bulk flow model HYDROTHRUST. Analysis of the data reveals generally good agreements between predictions and measurements. Thrust-bearing inlet supply and inner radius flow rates all decreased with decreasing orifice diameters and bearing axial clearances. In most cases, the bearings with larger orifice diameters exhibit higher recess pressure ratios, <b>operating</b> <b>clearances,</b> and flow rates. The largest orifice diameter configuration does not display higher recess pressure ratios or <b>operating</b> <b>clearances</b> at high speeds for some supply pressures, but it does continue to require additional lubricant flow rate compared to the smaller orifice bearings. In these cases, the results are not reflected in predictions, which otherwise correlate very well with experimental measurements. Estimations of static loading axial stiffness are obtained using experimental results. An optimum hybrid thrust bearing orifice diameter will depend on the conditions of individual applications. Larger orifices generally provide larger <b>operating</b> <b>clearances</b> and higher stiffnesses, but also require higher flow rates.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in brush seal {{gas turbine engine}} applications show the promise that carefully designed bristle packs can also function as oil and oil mist seals. Because brush seals are primarily contact seals, oil temperature rise and coking become major concerns in addition to leakage performance. Although individual bristles form very small bearing surfaces, hydrodynamic forces generated by viscous sealing medium combined with high surface speeds may easily lift the compliant bristle pack off the shaft surface. Amount of lift affects seal <b>operating</b> <b>clearance,</b> which - in return - determines oil temperature rise and leakage rate. Balancing these two conflicting performance criteria depends on good understanding of the bristle hydrodynamic lift.

40|$|After proven {{performance}} in gas turbine secondary flow and hot gas path sealing applications, brush seals are {{being considered for}} oil and oil mist applications in aero-engines and industrial turbines. In oil sealing applications shear heating and oil coking are major concerns. The field experience indicates that shear heating and oil coking issues can be managed if seal is designed properly. When seal stiffness is well controlled, combined with proper fiber material selection and leakage cooling, shear heating and oil coking issues can be managed. Field experience from early gas turbine bearing sump applications suggest reduced oil mist ingestion and compressor blade fouling with no observable coking issues. Brush seal <b>operating</b> <b>clearance</b> determines leakage rate and oil temperature rise. Balancing these two conflicting performance criteria requires the knowledge of bristle hydrodynamic lift. In this work, some background on analytical solution to bristle lifting force and shear heating is presented.

40|$|The present {{configuration}} of Helium Buffer Seal on the ATD oxygen pump {{consists of a}} pair of opposed carbon rings are forced axially against their containment housings. Leakage occurs through the clearance between the rings and the shaft. The total helium leakage through both sides is approximately 239 SCFM.

40|$|Abstract: Physical {{models and}} fast {{computational}} programs aim {{to improve the}} design and performance of turbocharger (TC) rotordynamics. Most commercial automotive TCs incorporate floating ring bearings (FRBs) owing to their low cost and reduced power losses. However, persistent subsynchronous motions afflict this type of rotor/bearing system, albeit reaching limit cycles that enable their continuous operation. FRBs comprise two fluid films in series and are prone to show one or two subsynchronous instabilities over extended speed ranges of operation. A flow model for prediction of FRB forced response is detailed here. The model incorporates a lumped-parameter thermal energy balance for estimation of the lubricant viscosity and thermal growth of the rotor, bearing and floating ring. The FRB model, fully integrated into a non-linear rotordynamics computational program, predicts the floating ring speed, journal and ring eccentricities, power loss and the rotordynamic force coefficients of {{the inner and outer}} films {{as a function of the}} load applied at a given rotor speed. Knowledge of the actual load conditions, static and dynamic, and the changes in <b>operating</b> <b>clearance</b> and effective lubricant viscosity are most important for accurate estimation of a TC dynamic forced response. Predictions for the exit lubricant temperature, power losses and floating ring speeds agree well with measurements obtained in an automotive turbocharger test rig.

40|$|A {{thrust bearing}} test rig {{experienced}} a catastrophic failure while operating with gas bearings. After many repairs, {{the test rig}} is in operating condition with water-lubricated bearings. Previous work details the failure and several initial repairs and modifications. Further modifications include manufacturing two rotors, repairing the main housing, aligning the motor shaft and test rotor, upgrading the water pipeline system, developing a static load system, installing instrumentation, and developing means of data acquisition. Presently, the revamped system has rotated to a speed of 5 krpm. Measurements of the free-free mode natural frequencies and lateral mode shapes of the rotor-coupling system show that the rotor and quill shaft operate as a unit. Once assembled, water lubricates the bearings to lift and support the test rotor connected to the motor through its coupling. Impact loads identify the system fundamental natural frequency and damping ratio for operation without rotor speed or active thrust bearings. The flexibility of the quill shaft commands {{the location of the}} system lateral natural frequency (~ 93 Hz) and its low damping ratio. XLTRC 2 ? based predictions agree well with the measured natural frequency and identified damping ratio. The water lubricates the radial bearings to lift the test rotor again as the motor accelerates the rotor to 5 krpm. During this operation, the rotor motion is synchronous and does not excite the first natural frequency. While operating at speeds up to 5 krpm, the system did not reach its first critical speed. Measurements show the thrust bearing axial clearance increases as the water supply pressure increases, max. 4. 14 bar(g), for operation with a constant axial load and at null or low rotor speed (3 krpm). As the imposed axial load increases, the <b>operating</b> <b>clearance</b> decreases exponentially. The decreasing <b>operating</b> <b>clearance</b> causes an increased flow resistance across the film lands, resulting in a reduced flow rate. As the flow rate decreases, there is a lower pressure drop across each orifice, resulting in an increase in recess pressure. The derived axial stiffness increases as the axial clearance decreases or the water supply pressure increases. XLHydroThrust? uses the thrust bearing geometry to generate predictions of thrust bearing performance. The predictions accurately describe the influence of the load and supply pressure on the thrust bearing performance; however, there are discrepancies between the magnitudes of the predictions and the magnitudes of the measurements at a high axial load (low axial clearance). The average percent difference between the predicted and measured magnitudes of supply flow rate, flow rate through inner diameter, axial clearance, and recess pressure ratio change from 2 % to 47 %, 7 % to 73 %, 25 % to 53 %, and 7 % to 18 %, respectively, as the applied axial load increases from its minimum to maximum magnitude. Thus, there is a significant increase in difference between the predicted and measured magnitudes as the applied axial load increases.
