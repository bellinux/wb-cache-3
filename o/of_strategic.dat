40|$|The Afghan war post 9 / 11 {{has become}} the source of {{multiple}} case studies. Recent studies suggest that variations in domestic support for deployment of troops in Afghanistan {{can be explained by}} means <b>of</b> the <b>strategic</b> narratives provided by the policymakers of the contributing state; a strong consistent narrative increases public support. Scholars recognize a Swedish catch-all narrative, which suggests weakens the narrative, thus raising the uncertainty among the public. This thesis investigates the projection <b>of</b> Swedish <b>strategic</b> narrative through elite Swedish newspapers. The content analysis reveals an inconsistency between the policymaker’s formation <b>of</b> the <b>strategic</b> narrative and the narrative projected by individual newspapers. The finding suggests that the lack <b>of</b> a strong <b>strategic</b> narrative due to the inconsistencies raised an uncertainty among the public during the period. The results recognize media to be a significant, but surprisingly unnoticed actor in the projection <b>of</b> policymakers’ <b>strategic</b> narratives...|$|R
