5|$|WrestleMania (sequentially {{known as}} WrestleMania I) was the inaugural WrestleMania {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event (only in selected areas), {{produced by the}} World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on March 31, 1985, at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The attendance for the event was 19,121. The event was seen by over one million viewers through closed-circuit television, making it the largest showing <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> on closed-circuit television in the United States at the time.|$|E
5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as {{picking up a}} letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills {{and the difficulty of}} the task. In circumstances where a character does not have control <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>event,</b> such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.|$|E

5000|$|Randomness {{refers to}} <b>a</b> future <b>event</b> and {{reflects}} its propensity to occur. The propensity can be small or large {{depending on the}} given situation. More than 300 years ago, the Swiss theologian and mathematician Jacob Bernoulli succeeded to quantify randomness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future <b>event.</b> He explained the occurrence propensity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> future <b>event</b> by the degree of certainty of its occurrence and called this degree probability. If the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>event</b> is impossible, {{there is not the}} slightest propensity and the degree of certainty, i.e., the probability is 0. On the other hand if the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given <b>event</b> is certain, then the propensity reaches its maximum and the degree of certainty adopts the value 1.|$|R

5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive more information about the setting and more direction from the GMs than players do. In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scholars use {{a number}} of criteria, such as the {{criterion}} of independent attestation, the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> also depends on {{the reliability of the}} source; indeed, the gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.|$|E

Bhardwaj got two Filmfare nominations for Kaminey in Best Director and Best Music Director categories. He won his second National Film Award for Best Music Direction, for his production venture Ishqiya. At the 62nd National Film Awards, Bhardwaj won his third Best Music Direction and Best Screenplay award for Haider. In 2016, Bhardwaj was awarded with Yash Bharti award by the Government of Uttar Pradesh for his contribution in the field of cinema.

5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} going to feature online elements, offered through Square's PlayOnline service. The features, however, were dropped during production, and online gaming would not {{become part of}} the Final Fantasy series until Final Fantasy XI. Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional Final Fantasy game, in line with the realism of the game's 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds. As a player of the games in the Final Fantasy series, battle director Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the Active Time Battle system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused Conditional Turn-Based Battle system. Originally, Final Fantasy X was going to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters. Battle art director Shintaro Takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in Final Fantasy X come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element. However, due to hardware limitations, this idea was not used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen at the end <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>event</b> scene. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game. Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such {{that they will be able}} to observe the development of those attributes firsthand. The developers experienced difficulty with the scene of Tidus and Yuna kissing, as they were not used to animating romance scenes. Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori stated that this was due to the use of 3D models in the scene. Because of the negative response from female members of staff, the scene was remade multiple times.|$|E

The results show that bid-ask spreads narrow as the number of time periods increase, regardless of probability of insider trading or the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>an</b> informational <b>event</b> occurring. For <b>a</b> high, given likelihood <b>of</b> <b>an</b> informational <b>event</b> occurring, the highest average spreads were found for lower probabilities of insider trading as time increased. For a high, given probability of insider trading, the highest average spreads were found for lower likelihoods <b>of</b> <b>an</b> informational <b>event</b> occurring as time increased. The variances increased along with the probability of insider trading {{as well as with the}} likelihood <b>of</b> <b>an</b> informational <b>event</b> occurring.

25|$|Optimism bias is {{typically}} measured through two determinants of risk: absolute risk, where individuals {{are asked to}} estimate their likelihood <b>of</b> experiencing <b>a</b> negative <b>event</b> compared to their actual chance <b>of</b> experiencing <b>a</b> negative <b>event</b> (comparison against self), and comparative risk, where individuals are asked to estimate the likelihood <b>of</b> experiencing <b>a</b> negative <b>event</b> (their personal risk estimate) compared to others {{of the same age}} and sex (a target risk estimate). Problems can occur when trying to measure absolute risk because it is extremely difficult to determine the actual risk statistic for a person. Therefore, the optimistic bias is primarily measured in comparative risk forms, where people compare themselves against others, through direct and indirect comparisons. Direct comparisons ask whether an individual's own risk <b>of</b> experiencing <b>an</b> <b>event</b> is less than, greater than, or equal to someone else's risk, while indirect comparisons ask individuals to provide separate estimates of their own risk <b>of</b> experiencing <b>an</b> <b>event</b> and other's risk of experiencing the same event.|$|R
