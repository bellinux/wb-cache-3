5|$|Alprazolam, {{available}} {{under the}} trade name Xanax, is a potent, short-acting benzodiazepine anxiolytic—a minor tranquilizer.

It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties.

Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate nursing students 2 ̆ 7 perception of preparedness for <b>oral</b> medication <b>administration</b> in two practice environments and determine possible relationship between student demographics and their perceived preparedness for <b>oral</b> medication <b>administration.</b> Design: This was a cross sectional, exploratory study. Participants: Eighty-eight second year students from a baccalaureate nursing course from two metropolitan Australian tertiary institutions participated. Methods: Student nurses 2 ̆ 7 perception of preparedness for <b>oral</b> medication <b>administration</b> was measured via a self-administered, adapted, and validated questionnaire. Results: The overall mean Total Preparedness Score was 86. 2 (range 71 - 102). There was no significant difference for perceived total preparedness to administer oral medications between the two facilities. Whilst there was no significant relationship established between student demographics and their perceived preparedness to administer oral medications, four single questions related to clinical practice were shown to be significant. Conclusion: Low fidelity simulated teaching environments that incorporate time management and post medication situations, may improve student nurses 2 ̆ 7 perceived preparedness for <b>oral</b> medication <b>administration...</b>|$|R

5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) and <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> {{are considered}} to be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion.

Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E
5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> {{of drugs}} when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or tramadol are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E

5|$|Macrolide antibiotics, such as erythromycin, are an {{effective}} treatment for DPB when taken regularly {{over an extended}} period of time. Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used. The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily <b>oral</b> <b>administration</b> of erythromycin for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa. However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.|$|E
