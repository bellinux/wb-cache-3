40|$|ABSTRACT- Conventional drug {{delivery}} systems have slight {{control over their}} drug release and almost no control over the effective concentration at the target site. This kind of dosing pattern may result in constantly changing, unpredictable plasma concentrations. Drugs can be delivered in a controlled pattern {{over a long period}} of time by the controlled or modified release {{drug delivery}} systems. They include dosage forms for oral and transdermal administration as well as injectable and implantable systems. For most of drugs, oral route remains as the most acceptable route of administration. Certain molecules may have low oral bioavailability because of solubility or permeability limitations. Development of an extended release dosage form also requires reasonable absorption throughout the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). Among the available techniques to improve the bioavailability of these drugs fabrication of <b>osmotic</b> <b>drug</b> delivery system is the most appropriate one. <b>Osmotic</b> <b>drug</b> delivery systems release the drug with the zero order kinetics which does not depend on the initial concentration and the physiological factors of GIT.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of regenerated cellulose}} (RC) films and capsules was investigated for their applications in oral controlled drug delivery. Regenerated cellulose films were prepared by non-solvent-mediated, phase inversion of native and depolymerized cotton linter solutions (methylolcellulose; cellulose dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide/ paraformaldehyde solvent system) in water {{as well as by}} phase inversion of native cotton linter solutions in organic non-solvents followed by thermal annealing. These films were monolithic in dry state and formed porous structures when hydrated. Irrespective of the degree of polymerization of the starting cellulose source or the use of organic non-solvents, the cellulose chain length was not significantly altered and cellulose was in an amorphous state. Flux analysis in diffusion cells, using ethanol-water mixtures as the solvent medium, indicated that the films take up solvent to form porous routes for transport of solute. The amount of solvent uptake required to form these routes was greater for films prepared from depolymerized cotton linter. Ionic and hydrophobic solutes traverse the films using the porous pathways following hydration of the film. Blended RC films were prepared by combining native and depolymerized cotton linter solutions in varying ratios and phase-inverting in water, followed by thermal annealing. Porosity, pore size and water uptake of the hydrated films decreased, while the length of the transport pathway (tortuosity) increased, as the fraction of depolymerized cellulose increased in the blended films. Differences in methylene blue dye adsorption on phase-inverted vs. phase-inverted and thermally annealed RC films indicated that the type of non-solvent utilized for phase-inversion does not affect the internal RC film structure during the phase-inversion process. However, as the boiling point of the non-solvent increased, the amount of irreversible polymer consolidation and formation non-swelling domains (hornification) increased during the thermal annealing process. This, in turn, led to reduced porosity and solute flux through these RC films. Two-piece cellulose capsules were fabricated by phase-inversion of methylolcellulose solutions in water using a dip-coating approach. Zero-order release rates for a number of drugs increased as their water solubility increased. The release of water soluble drugs occurred by osmotically-driven convection and diffusion through the pores in the capsule wall, while the release of moderate to poorly soluble drugs predominantly occurred by diffusion. Moreover, as the drug solubility increased, the apparent permeability of the drugs through the capsule wall decreased, which indicated that the inward osmotic flux of water reduced the diffusivity of the drug through the pores. The hydraulic permeability of the cellulose capsules was determined to be higher than for conventional ethylcellulose and cellulose acetate coated <b>osmotic</b> <b>drug</b> delivery systems, indicating that the cellulose-based capsules may be better suited for <b>osmotic</b> <b>drug</b> delivery...|$|E

Particularly interesting is the possibility of seawater desalination by forward osmosis, as the process is claimed to require little or no pre-treatment of the feed water, due to minor membrane fouling. This alone is a significant advantage over reverse osmosis. Within the oil and gas sector, research conducted {{in the last couple of}} years shows that low salinity waterflooding can result in enhanced oil recovery, and therefore the industry is searching for new possibilities for off-shore based production of low salinity water. Due to the fact that forward osmosis operates at atmospheric pressure and requires no pressure vessels, the process can be utilized for seawater desalination where low overall equipment weight is required – off-shore oil platforms for example. This thesis is focused on the development of membranes for water desalination by forward osmosis, and estimation of the requirements (approximate membrane area and volume) for seawater desalination by a two-stage membrane based forward osmosis – nanofiltration process.

40|$|Colon {{specific}} {{drug delivery}} has gained increased importance {{not for the}} treatment of local diseases associated withthe colon but also as potential site for systemic delivery of therapeutic proteins and peptides. Colon is a site whereboth local and systemic delivery of drug can take place. Treatment could be more effective if it is possible for drugto be directly to colon. Systemic side effects can also be reduced the primary approaches to obtain colon specificdelivery is based on prodrugs, pH and time dependent systems (or) microflora activated systems and have achievedlimited success only. Most recently new colon – specific delivery systems are developed. These are pressurecontrolled colon delivery capsules, CODESTM, colon drug delivery systems based on pectin and galactomamcoating, hydrogels, <b>osmotic</b> controlled <b>drug</b> delivery system, pulsincap system, time clock system, chronotropicsystem, enterion capsule technology. The review is aimed at understanding above pharmaceutical approaches tocolon targeted drug delivery systems for better therapeutic action without compromising on drug degradation (or) itslow bioavailability [1]...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{effectiveness of}} <b>osmotic</b> laxative <b>drugs</b> based on lactulose in restoration of gastrointestinal tract function in early postoperative period after transanal interventions and laparoscopic operations in 53 children 2 – 17 years old was studied. All patients had non-functional (cologenic and proctogenic) constipation. Patients underwent full-thickness laparoscopic or transanal biopsy due to suspicion of gastrointestinal malformation presence. Children from base group (n = 28) used lactulose (Duphalac) {{from the second}} day of postoperative period (dose complied with the age) once daily, in the morning. The control group (n = 25) received subcutaneous or intramuscular proserinum for the stimulation of peristalsis. Blood tests with serum potassium control were performed on 2 nd and 4 t h  day. The study showed clinical effectiveness of lactulose in treatment of postoperational hypotonic constipation in children with colon malformations.   Key words: children, gastrointestinal malformations, postoperative period, chronic constipation, lactulose.

40|$|The colon is the {{terminal}} {{part of the}} GIT which has gained {{in recent years as}} a potential site for delivery of various novel therapeutic drugs, i. e. peptides. However, colon is rich in microflora which can be used to target the drug release in the colon. Colon is a site where both local and systemic drug delivery can take place. Local delivery allows the topical treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. If drug can be targeted directly into the colon, treatment can become more effective and side effects can be minimized. These systemic side effects can be minimized by primary approaches for CDDS (Colon specific drug delivery) namely prodrugs, pH and time dependent systems and microbially triggered system which gained limited success and have limitations as compared with recently new CDDS namely pressure controlled colon delivery capsules (PCDCS), CODESTM (Novel colon targeted delivery system) <b>osmotic</b> controlled <b>drug</b> delivery system, Pulsincap system, time clock system, chronotropic system.
