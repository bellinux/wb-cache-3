40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} the variables that affect stress redistribution in the strata underneath supercritical longwall panels. To do this, Wilson’s equations for the vertical stress distribution in the vicinity of a single longwall panel after it has been mined have been used in conjunction with finite element modelling to evaluate vertical stresses in the underlying strata. Key findings of the study are that the abutment angle has a significantly greater effect on the magnitude of the relative changes in vertical stress in the strata below a pillar than the overburden depth; anisotropic deformation behaviour of the rock mass results in strong ‘columnisation’ of the vertical stresses in the strata below the first mined seam; and the final vertical stress induced into the strata surrounding the second seam is larger in magnitude when narrow pillars are used in the first mined seam in conjunction with a large value of the ratio of overburden depth to interburden depth. For the particular cases considered in this study, increasing the abutment angle by 20 ° tripled the predicted change in vertical stress at a depth of 25 m below the <b>overlying</b> <b>seam.</b> Furthermore, replacing the isotropic elastic material with a transversely isotropic elastic material increased the vertical stress at the depth of 25 m below the <b>overlying</b> <b>seam</b> by 74 %...|$|E

Headgate pillars and entries were instrumented and monitored to study their behavior during side-abutment loading as the longwall panel approached and passed beneath the overlying room-and-pillar developments. The two operations are separated by 800 ft of interburden, and although interactions between operations separated by this distance are uncommon, geomechanical measurements indicate the occurrence of an interaction. These measurements show that convergence on the headgate entries was most adverse subjacent to barrier pillars in the overlying mine. Pillar measurements indicate that side-abutment pressure increases were slightly greater than predicted values. Several factors related to both geology and mine design, believed responsible for this large interactive distance, are discussed...|$|E

The subsidence monitoring data now available from the mining of longwall panels in two seams at the Ashton Underground Mine (Ashton) provides an opportunity to significantly advance the understanding of subsidence behaviour in response to multi-seam mining in a regular offset geometry. This paper presents an analysis and interpretation of the multi-seam subsidence monitoring data from the first five panels in the second seam at the Ashton Underground Mine. The methods used to estimate subsidence effects for the planned third seam of mining are also presented. Observations {{of the characteristics of}} multi-seam subsidence indicate that although more complex than single seam mining, the subsidence movements are regular and reasonably predictable. Movements are constrained within the general footprint of the active panel. They are however sensitive to the relative panel geometries in each seam and to the direction of mining. In an offset geometry, tilt and strain levels are observed to remain at single seam levels despite the greater vertical displacement. At stacked goaf edges tilt and strain levels are up to four times greater.

40|$|Most coal seams, {{currently}} mined in the Karaganda Coal Basin, {{are prone}} to outburst. The main thick D 6 coal seam is considered as most prone to outburst risk. Trials of advance degassing from the surface have not given positive results because of low permeability. 100 mm diameter inseam holes are subsequently drilled in almost all longwall blocks to facilitate preliminary degassing of the coal seams. Gas extraction quantities are however low, even the holes are placed on suction To facilitate the gas release during longwall block development, of the main seam, a method of development below the seam was used. This gave rise to increase in permeability of overlying thick seam with high gas content, achieving a local degasification of the <b>overlying</b> <b>seam</b> by up to 90 %. The initial development roadway was driven under the seam, in rock, {{at a distance of}} between 8 - 12 m from seam floor in the same contour of the future development roadway in the coal seam.

Degassing holes were drilled from the rock development, into the seam area of the future coal seam development heading. During traditional in seam development, outburst preventive measures were taken, which increased the labour intensiveness of development working, sharply decreasing the development rate. Application of these new techniques allowed increased development rates in seams to be realised, from 25 - 40 m per month to 120 - 150 m in the outburst prone areas...|$|E
40|$|Multiple seam {{interactions}} {{are a major}} ground control hazard in many U. S. underground coal mines. The two most common types are: 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Undermining, where stress concentrations caused by previous full extraction in an <b>overlying</b> <b>seam</b> is the primary concern, and; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Overmining, where previous full extraction in an underlying seam can result in stress concentrations and rock damage from subsidence. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has completed a major study aimed at helping to identify the location and likely severity of these interactions. In the course of field visits to mines throughout the U. S., more than 300 multiple seam case histories were assembled into the largest data base of multiple seam case histories ever collected. These data were analyzed with the multivariate statistical technique of logistic regression. The study also employed LaM 2 D to estimate the multiple seam stresses, ALPS and ARMPS to determine pillar stability factors, and the CMRR to measure roof quality. The study resulted {{in the development of}} a computer program, called Analysis of Multiple Seam Stability (AMSS), which can help mine planners to evaluate each potential interaction and take steps to reduce the risk of ground control failure. AMSS first evaluates pillar design by calculating the single seam Stability Factor (SFSS) using ALPS or ARMPS. It also automatically generates a LaM 2 D analysis that provides the additional multiple seam stress so that the final, multiple seam SFMS can be determined. The second part of the AMSS procedure builds upon the statistical findings that overmining is much more difficult than undermining, isolated remnant pillars cause more problems than gob-solid boundaries, and weaker roof significantly increases the risk of multiple seam interactions. AMSS quantifies these effects and predicts the outcome in terms of three levels of risk: GREEN (where a major multiple seam interaction is considered unlikely), YELLOW (where adding a pattern of cable bolts or other equivalent supplemental support could greatly reduce the probability of a major interaction.), or RED (a major interaction should be considered likely, and it may be desirable to avoid the area entirely) ...|$|E

40|$|Multiple-seam {{interactions}} {{are a major}} ground control hazard in many U. S. underground coal mines. In some U. S. coalfields, particularly in central Appalachia and the West, the majority of today's mines are operating above and/or beneath previously mined seams. The effects of multiple-seam interactions can include roof falls, rib spalling, and floor heave. These can seriously disrupt mining operations and threaten the safety of miners. In early 2006, a West Virginia coal miner was killed by rib roll that occurred in a high-stress zone beneath a remnant structure in an overlying mine. Fortunately, not every multiple-seam situation results in hazardous conditions. Indeed, the vast majority do not. For the past several years, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has been conducting research to develop better techniques for predicting the location and severity of multiple-seam interactions. During this investigation, more than 50 mines were visited across the U. S. coalfields. Nearly 300 case histories were collected and analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques. The study also employed the numerical model LaM 2 D to estimate the multiple-seam stress, the Analysis of Longwall Pillar Stability (ALPS) and the Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability (ARMPS) programs to determine pillar stability factors (SFs), and the Coal Mine Roof Rating to measure roof quality. The study focused on the two most common types of multiple-seam interactions: 1. Undermining, where stress concentrations caused by previous full extraction in an <b>overlying</b> <b>seam</b> is the main concern; and. 2. Overmining, where previous full extraction in an underlying seam can result in stress concentrations and rock damage from subsidence. The study confirmed that overmining {{is much more difficult}} than undermining, and isolated remnant pillars cause more problems than gob-solid boundaries. For the first time, however, it was possible to quantify these effects in terms of the equivalent thickness of interburden needed to compensate for them. The study also found that pillar design is a critical component of multiple-seam mine planning. Many of the failed cases involved pillars whose SF seemed inadequate once the multiple-seam stresses were accounted for. Weaker roof was also found to significantly increase the risk of multiple-seam interactions. The most important result of the study is an equation that predicts the critical thickness of the interburden required to minimize the likelihood of a multiple-seam interaction. This equation was incorporated into a step-by-step methodology that allows mine planners to evaluate each potential interaction and take steps {{to reduce the risk of}} ground control failure. Such measures could include installing cable bolts or other supplemental support, increasing the pillar size, or changing the mine layout to avoid the remnant structure entirely. These Proceedings also contain several previously published papers that cover other facets of multiple-seam mining research. Two papers describe the LaModel family of software developed by Professor Keith A. Heasley of West Virginia University. The LaModel programs were designed for calculating the stresses and displacements in coal mines or other thin, tabular seams in layered media. The original three-dimensional version of LaModel is essential for detailed analyses of complex multiple-seam scenarios. LaM 2 D, by contrast, implements a simplified two-dimensional model that is suitable for quick approximations of the multiple-seam stresses and strains. Three additional papers in these Proceedings describe the extensive multiple-seam experience of the Harris Mine, examples of extreme multiple-seam mining from the central Appalachian coalfields, and longwall mine experiences in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Utah.

The dwindling reserve base consists in large part of coal that would have been considered unmineable by earlier generations. Nearly every current operation is working on a property where coal has been extracted in the past, from seams either above, below, or both. NIOSH is conducting research aimed at helping mine planners prevent hazardous conditions due to multiple seam interactions. To-date, more than 300 case histories have been collected from underground mines, mainly from central Appalachia.

40|$|Why do {{some room}} and pillar retreat panels {{encounter}} abnormal conditions? What factors deserve the most consideration during the planning and execution phases of mining {{and what can be}} done to mitigate those abnormal conditions when they are encountered? To help answer these questions, and to determine some of the relevant factors influencing the conditions of {{room and pillar}} (R & P) retreat mining entries, four consecutive R & P retreat panels were evaluated. This evaluation was intended to reinforce the influence of topographic changes, depth of cover, multiple-seam interactions, geological conditions, and mining geometry. This paper details observations were made in four consecutive R & P retreat panels and the data were collected from an instrumentation site during retreat mining. The primary focus was on the differences observed among the four panels and within the panels themselves. The instrumentation study was initially planned to evaluate the interactions between primary and secondary support, but produced rather interesting results relating to the loading encountered under the current mining conditions. In addition to the observation and instrumentation, numerical modeling was performed to evaluate the stress conditions. Both the LaModel 3. 0 and Rocscience Phase 2 programs were used to evaluate these four panels. The results of both models indicated a drastic reduction in the vertical stresses experienced in these panels due to the full extraction mining in <b>overlying</b> <b>seams</b> when compared to the full overburden load. Both models showed a higher level of stress associated with the outside entries of the panels. These results agree quite well with the observations and instrumentation studies performed at the mine. These efforts provided two overarching conclusions concerning R & P retreat mine planning and execution. The first was that there are four areas that should not be overlooked during R & P retreat mining: topographic relief, multiple-seam stress relief, stress concentrations near the gob edge, and geologic changes in the immediate roof. The second is that in order to successfully retreat an R & P panel, a three-phased approach to the design and analysis of the panel should be conducted: the planning phase, evaluation phase, and monitoring phase.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a study assessing potential factors and migration paths of methane emissions experienced in a room-and-pillar mine in Lower Kittanning coal, Indiana County, Pennsylvania. Methane emissions were not excessive at idle mining areas, but significant methane was measured during coal mining and loading. Although methane {{concentrations in the}} mine did not exceed 1 % limit during operation due {{to the presence of}} adequate dilution airflow, the source of methane and its migration into the mine was still a concern. In the course of this study, structural and depositional properties of the area were evaluated to assess complexity and sealing capacity of roof rocks. Composition, gas content, and permeability of Lower Kittanning coal, results of flotation tests, and geochemistry of groundwater obtained from observation boreholes were studied to understand the properties of coal and potential effects of old abandoned mines within the same area. These data were combined with the data obtained from exploration boreholes, such as depths, elevations, thicknesses, ash content, and heat value of coal. Univariate statistical and principal component analyses (PCA), as well as geostatistical simulations and co-simulations, were performed on various spatial attributes to reveal interrelationships and to establish area-wide distributions. These studies helped in analyzing groundwater quality and determining gas-in-place (GIP) of the Lower Kittanning seam. Furthermore, groundwater level and head on the Lower Kittanning coal were modeled and flow gradients within the study area were examined. Modeling results were interpreted with the structural geology of the Allegheny Group of formations above the Lower Kittanning coal to understand the potential source of gas and its migration paths. Analyses suggested that the source of methane was likely the <b>overlying</b> <b>seams</b> such as the Middle and Upper Kittanning coals and Freeport seams of the Allegheny Group. Simulated ground-water water elevations, gradients of groundwater flow, and the presence of recharge and discharge locations at very close proximity to the mine indicated that methane likely was carried with groundwater towards the mine entries. Existing fractures within the overlying strata and their orientation due to the geologic conditions of the area, and activation of slickensides between shale and sandstones due to differential compaction during mining, were interpreted as the potential flow paths.

The sedimentary succession was divided up into five facies, namely: conglomerate facies, sandstone facies, interlaminated sandstone-siltstone facies, siltstone facies and coal facies. These were interpreted hydrodynamically. Facies assemblages were then interpreted palaeoenvironmentally. Glacial, fluvial, deltaic and transgressive marine sequences were responsible for forming this sedimentary succession. Attention was then focussed on the main economic No. 4 seam, which is mined underground at the colliery. Detailed subsurface geological cross-sections, core sequences and isopach maps of the No. 4 seam coal and the lithologies above, were used to determine specific aspects of the depositional environment that could contribute to unstable roof conditions above No. 4 seam. Coarsening-upward deltaic cycles, fining-upward bedload fluvial cycles, glauconite sandstone marine transgressions and crevasse-splay deposits are recognized in the overlying strata. Poor roof conditions occur parallel to palaeochannel margins because the interbedded channel sandstone and adjacent flood plain argillites cause collapsing along bedding plane surfaces.

Determination of suitable topsoil replacements is based on chemical analysis, including neutralization potential (NP), a component of acid-base accounting (ABA). The presence of siderite (FeCO?) contributes to an overburdens NP, which may result in false positive ABA values, leading to overestimation of neutralizing minerals and therefore, may result in acid drainage / acid soils. Mineralogy and chemistry of overburden samples from Texas lignite mines were characterized for use in (NP) determination studies. Samples were obtained from the Northwestern Resources (NWR) mine in Jewett, Texas Utilities (TXU) mines at Oak Hill and Big Brown, and Intermountain Laboratories (IML) in College Station. The IML samples all contained FeCO? and had high ABA values. The FeCO? rock obtained from the NWR mine has cation substitution for Fe in the lattice.

Thirteen modifications to the currently-accepted stratigraphic nomenclature are recommended in this study. These include changes to the definitions or status of some previously-defined units and the naming of several new units. Six depositional systems have been recognised using an hierarchical approach to facies analysis. The lowermost depositional unit, Deltaic System A, comprises the Pheasants Nest Formation and records a continuation of a regressive trend in {{the upper part of the}} marine Shoalhaven Group. This system is represented by widespread deltaic facies which grade up-dip into alluvial fan and braidplain facies, flanking the 2 ̆ 2 Gerringong Volcanics 2 ̆ 2. The upper part of Deltaic System A was reworked during a transgression which resulted in the deposition of extensive, sandy, subtidal to middle shelf facies in the Shallow Marine System (Erins Vale Formation and Kulnura Marine Tongue). A regressive phase of sedimentation is recorded in the overlying Fluvial/Shore-zone System in the east and the Braided Fluvial System in the west. Upper shoreface to beach deposits of the Fluvial/Shore-zone System were deposited along a storm-dominated, southwest-northeast trending shore-line. This was periodically charged with sediment from meandering rivers (lower Wilton Formation) and was located in the eastern part of the basin. At a similar time, alluvial fan, braidplain and fan-delta facies of the craton-derived Marrangaroo Conglomerate (Braided Fluvial System) were deposited along the western margin of the basin. The distribution of the <b>overlying</b> Woonona <b>seam</b> above a wide range of depositional units suggests the synchronous development of the Marrangaroo Conglomerate and lower Wilton Formation, and indicates a period of tectonic stability. Several delta systems are identified in Deltaic System B. They record deposition of widespread interdeltaic facies constructed around a thin framework of distributary channels. The delta systems in the west passed up-dip into an extensive braidplain represented by the Blackmans Flat Conglomerate (Braided Fluvial System). The abandonment of these delta systems is reflected in the blanket geometry of the <b>overlying</b> Tongarra <b>seam.</b> Progradation of a complex delta-system, Deltaic System C, resulted from expansion of the New England Orogen. The lower half of this system records deposition on a lower deltaic plain. This includes the prodelta, delta front and interdeltaic sequences of the Bargo Claystone, Darkes Forest Sandstone and Allans Creek Formation respectively. Upper deltaic plain sedimentation is recorded in the very lithic Kembla Sandstone which was deposited by a complex network of distributaries that flowed directly across the basin. The thick Wongawilli Coal formed on abandonment of this fluvial system and passes up-sequence into interdistributary lake-fill deposits in the lower Eckersley Formation. Sandstone is the dominant component of the upper Eckersley Formation and records deposition by meandering rivers in extensive fluvial tracts. The coal seams associated with these fluvial sequences (Balgownie and Bulli seams) are laterally extensive and exhibit little evidence for contemporaneous fluvial sedimentation. Sandstone in the Sydney Subgroup can be categorised into two petrographic suites. The Quartz Suite rocks are characterised by quartz to rock fragment ratios greater than 0. 5 whereas the same ratio is less than 0. 5 for Lithic Suite rocks. The Quartz and Lithic Suites were derived from the Lachlan Fold Belt, and from the New England Orogen and 2 ̆ 2 Gerringong Volcanics 2 ̆ 2, respectively. Tuffaceous units in the Illawarra Coal Measures of the southern Sydney Basin have been recognised on the basis of petrographic criteria...|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{assessment of}} the vertical stress on a coal seam at depth is important for mine design. Vertical stress calculation techniques presently available either are not sufficiently accurate or cannot handle complex surface topography. Therefore, the U. S. Bureau of Mines developed a computerized method to calculate vertical stress exerted on surfaces at depth that includes the effect of topography. Two input data sets are required: a digital elevation model containing topographic elevations and a coal seam file defining coal seam elevations at depth. Boussinesq's equation then quantifies the vertical stress resulting from topography. The computerized method was tested on a coal <b>seam</b> <b>overlain</b> by a complex topography where a vertical stress map encompassing several square miles was produced. Results show that depth mitigates the affects of surface topography, while the coal seam topography has a direct effect on the vertical stress. In comparison to the computerized method, the direct stress method overestimates stress under hills and underestimates stress under valleys. The largest {{difference between the two}} methods occurs under the steepest topographic relief. A limitation of the computerized method is that stresses cannot be accurately determined near an outcrop...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} a new method for detecting {{the margin of}} old mine works using the seismic energy generated by active mining in the coal seam. As the first test of this new concept, the method should {{not be viewed as}} a proven, off-the-shelf technology, but rather a demonstration of the fundamental concept which has promise for detecting the margins of old mine works. For the primary method a linear spread of vertical 4. 5 Hz geophones on the earth’s surface was distributed across the margin of old mine works (both flooded and air-filled locations) and to a position over the active mining nearby. The seismic vibrations associated with the underground mining were passively recorded across this spread, with individual records as long as 32 seconds. Through a process of crosscorrelation, using each seismic trace sequentially as the pilot sweep for correlation with each other trace in the recording, two distinct seismic wave arrival patterns emerged from the data. The direct arrival from the mining operation to the surface through the rock <b>overlying</b> the coal <b>seam</b> was distinct and well represented in 2 all processed data sets. However, in the data sets across the flooded mine site a...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines has {{developed}} a unique new mine design procedure to determine the changing static load distributions imposed on under-ground support structures during the mining cycle. The procedure reduces the complexities associated with analyzing a three-dimensional problem. A combination of the multiple-seam displacement-discontinuity model and a two-dimensional finite-element window model produces refined results for a specific area of interest by assuming displacement compat-ibility between models. Input to the procedure includes the geometry of mined-out areas in up to two adjacent seams, the rock mass characteris-tics of the surrounding geology, the in situ stress conditions, and the mining sequence. The displacement-discontinuity program calculates ex-pected loadings for mine structures affected by the mining cycle and/or by <b>overlying</b> or underlying <b>seams.</b> Pseudoelastic finite-element analysis using a yield-factor approach determines the stability of coal pillars by simulating the degree and extent of nrogressive rib failure and sub-sequent load transfer. Application of the procedure is demonstrated on a field problem. In-duced stress changes predicted from the numerical model analysis are in reasonably good agreement with stress measurements obtained from an instrumented chain pillar affected by remnant workings in an upper seam...|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} fossil assemblage – fifteen ’in situ’ stumps {{standing at}} their original position – was explored at the opencast lignite mine at Bükkábrány, N Hungary. The stumps occupying {{an area of}} about 50 x 100 m have been preserved in Upper Miocene grey sands <b>overlying</b> the lignite <b>seam.</b> The height of the trunks ranges from 2 up to 5, 2 m, their perimeter at the base reaches up to 8, 8 m. The age of the fossil remains is estimated to about 7 million years according to the regional stratigraphy. The fossil forest is {{the remains of a}} swamp forest which is also corroborated by the palaeogeography of the fossil site as the area of the former Lake Pannon. Fossil leaf and fruit assemblages indicating the typical swamp vegetation in the close vicinity of Lake Pannon have already been reported from the site. Wood anatomy of some of the stumps is diagnostic for Taxodioxylon germanicum (Greguss) Van der Burgh which is related to modern Sequoia Endlicher and was an important element of peat forming vegetation during the Neogene. Some other stumps are comparable to Glyptostroboxylon Conwentz emend. Dolezych & Van der Burgh. The organic rich sediments underlying and embedding the stumps provided a high abundance of Glyptostrobus Endlicher remains, foliage, cones and seeds...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{and effective}} management of gas within the sandstones <b>overlying</b> the Bulli <b>seam</b> mines of BHP Billiton Illawarra Coal {{is required to}} ensure safe and productive mining operations. Recent surface exploration has also detected the presence of oil accumulations in these sandstones which {{have the potential to}} impact on future mining operations. Some of these hydrocarbons are located within the longwall relaxation zone of the overlying strata and, as a result, can migrate to the goaf and active workings subsequent to extraction. A number of new exploration techniques, which are in common use by the petroleum industry, have been adopted by Illawarra Coal in order to more accurately locate these zones and determine the potential impact on future mining. These techniques include: • Advanced analysis of downhole geophysics to determine the location and extent of strata gas horizons. • Specialist interpretation of 2 D and 3 D seismic to detect gas zones. • Modeling of multiple data-sets to determine controls on gas distribution and composition. • Detailed geological and chemical analysis of the oil-bearing horizons {{to gain a better understanding}} of the petroleum system and the controls to its distribution. • Geotechnical studies of the overlying strata to determine the extent and nature of post-mining strata relaxation in comparison with the location of the hydrocarbon zones. The results of these studies have formed the scientific basis for the development of more effective technologies to manage the impact and potential impact of strata oil and gas on the underground extraction of coal...|$|R
40|$|Deep {{extraction}} of minerals is accompanied by deformations of the strata <b>overlying</b> extracted coal <b>seams.</b> Deformations of <b>overlying</b> layers run {{up to the surface}} where a subsidence trough gradually forms. The movement of individual surface points is curvilinear, spatial and, in relation to the time pattern, not uniform. In some cases, during the formation of a subsidence trough, temporary uplifts of the surface occur. This paper gives a particular area in which uplifts of the surface occurred when the rigid overlying strata was disturbed. The character of deformations of the overlying rocks is evaluated {{on the basis of a}} comparison of the results of the measurement of subsidence of the surface using geodetic methods with the development of mined-out areas and with their extracted thickness. For specifying the time of failure of the overlying strata, also information obtained from a system of continuous monitoring of seismic events is used. The spatial extent of the subsidence trough is identified by satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques applied to TerraSAR-X images. The subsidence wave was possible to detect using a short temporal difference of 11 days between satellite radar images. This shows the potential of short-temporal high resolution InSAR for monitoring of progress of subsidence troughs. A good knowledge of extents and shape of subsidence trough formation in time allows to verify values of parameters used for prediction purposes. Application of the short temporal InSAR appears very effective for spatio-temporal studies of the current subsidence trough development and helps understanding the physical process as well as identifying deviations from the behaviour expected by models.

40|$|Realistic {{values of}} {{specific}} storage (Ss) for groundwater systems {{are important to}} determine the spatial extent and timing of changes in groundwater heads when the groundwater system is mechanically stressed. However, numerical groundwater models of underground excavations typically assume a constant literature value of Ss. Our research used both in situ and laboratory obtained data. High frequency pore pressure data was evaluated to understand the variability and changes in Ss within sedimentary strata overlying a longwall coal mine. Pore pressure data from a vertical series of 6 vibrating wire piezometers (50 to ~ 278 m depth) recording at hourly intervals used barometric pressure loading for the period before and during mining. The site was located near the centre of a longwall panel that extracted coal {{at a depth of}} 300 - 400 m. The data was processed to calculate loading efficiency and Ss values by multi-method analyses of barometric and earth tide responses. In situ Ss results varied over one to two orders of magnitude and indicated that Ss was changing before and after extraction of underlying coal seams. Laboratory geomechanical tests were undertaken to compare with in situ findings. The vertical leakage of groundwater within the constrained zone (~ 10 to ~ 150 m depth) was found to be limited before mining, although some degree of vertical hydraulic connectivity was observed. Depressurization was evident in the fractured zone directly <b>overlying</b> the coal <b>seam,</b> and Ss changes at ~ 250 m depth indicated this confined aquifer may have became unconfined, while other zones remained confined. Our results demonstrate that high frequency pore pressure data can provide realistic time series Ss values. We have shown, for the first time, that variability of Ss can be significant, and that these changes can provide important insights into how shallow and deep groundwater systems respond to underground mining...|$|R
