40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{rational}} design approach to the seismic retrofitting of an existing building connected with an adjacent newly-built <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> by viscous dampers. The mass and stiffness of the existing building together with the mass of the <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> are given. Then the stiffness of the <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> and the damping coefficient of the connecting dampers are found so that the requirements on the maximum interstory drift of the existing building are satisfied. By introducing a response reduction contour map in terms of the stiffness ratio κ and the connecting-damper damping ratio hR of the rigidly supported model, an approximate but effective design procedure is proposed. It is concluded that the proposed approach is an effective method for designing the <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> and the connecting dampers...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} paper is to extend the theory of frames for countably {{generated}} Hilbert C^*-modules over arbitrary C^*-algebras. In investigating the non-unital case we introduce the concept of <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> as a sequence in the multiplier module M(X) that has the standard frame property when applied to elements of the ambient module X. Given a Hilbert -module X, we prove {{that there is a}} bijective correspondence of the set of all adjointable surjections from the generalized Hilbert space ℓ^ 2 () to X and the set consisting of all both <b>frames</b> and <b>outer</b> <b>frames</b> for X. Building on a unified approach to <b>frames</b> and <b>outer</b> <b>frames</b> we then obtain new results on dual frames, frame perturbations, tight approximations of frames and finite extensions of Bessel sequences...|$|R

We designed a new scanning mirror which has a circular mirror plate with an elliptical <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> and is electrostatically driven by vertical combs arranged at the <b>outer</b> <b>frame.</b> This eye-type mirror showed a larger deflection angle compared to the rectangular and the elliptical mirrors. To increase the driving force twice, stationary comb electrodes are arranged at {{the upper and lower}} sides of the moving comb fingers, together. The diameter of the mirror plate is 1. 0 mm, and the lengths of the major and minor axes of the <b>outer</b> <b>frame</b> are 2. 5 mm and 1. 0 mm, respectively.
