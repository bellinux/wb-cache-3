There, the system steadily gained organization and was declared a tropical depression by 1200UTC on July14. Moving slowly northwest, a low wind shear and warm sea surface temperature environment allowed the system to strengthen to a tropical storm at 1800UTC on July15. Following {{the development of a}} curved convection band and appearance of an eye on satellite, Cosme was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane at 1800UTC the next day; it is at this time that the system attained its peak with winds of 75mph (120km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 987mb (hPa; 29.15inHg). Cosme tracked <b>over</b> <b>ever</b> cooler waters beginning at that time, causing the system to weaken quickly back to tropical storm strength. It turned west {{as a result of an}} intensifying ridge of high pressure to its north while continuing to deteriorate in organization. At 1800UTC on July18, Cosme weakened to a tropical depression after crossing into the central Pacific, and by 1800UTC on July22, no longer sustained enough organization to be considered a tropical cyclone. The remnant low continued generally westward until dissipation early on July25.|$|E

When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all <b>over,</b> <b>ever</b> so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.|$|E
60|$|For you {{are here}} as scholars; {{you are here}} to learn wisdom; you are here in what should be, and I believe surely is, one of the fore- courts of that mystic Temple into which Wisdom calls us all. And {{therefore}} it is fit that you should this day remember the wise; for they have laboured, and you are entering into their labours. Every lesson which you learn in school, all knowledge which raises you above the savage or the profligate (who is but a savage dressed in civilized garments), has been made possible to you by the wise. Every doctrine of theology, every maxim of morals, every rule of grammar, every process of mathematics, every law of physical science, every fact of history or of geography, which you are taught here, is a voice from beyond the tomb. Either the knowledge itself, or other knowledge which led to it, is an heirloom to you from men whose bodies are now mouldering in the dust, but whose spirits live for ever before God, and whose works follow them, going on, generation after generation, upon the path which they trod while they were upon earth, the path of usefulness, as lights to the steps of youth and ignorance. They are the salt of the earth, which keeps the world of man from decaying back into barbarism. They are the children of light whom God has set for lights that cannot be hid. They are the aristocracy of God, into which not many noble, not many rich, not many mighty are called. Most of them were poor; many all but unknown in their own time; many died, and saw no fruit of their labours; some were persecuted, some were slain, even as Christ the Lord was slain, as heretics, innovators, and corruptors of youth. Of some, the very names are forgotten. But though their names be dead, their works live, and grow, and spread, <b>over</b> <b>ever</b> fresh generations of youth, showing them fresh steps toward that Temple of Wisdom, which is the knowledge of things as they are; the knowledge of those eternal laws by which God governs the heavens and the earth, things temporal and eternal, physical and spiritual, seen and unseen, from {{the rise and fall}} of mighty nations, to the growth and death of the moss on yonder moors.|$|E

60|$|He was to dine at {{the palace}} {{in an hour or}} two, and he had lunched there, at an early luncheon, that morning. He had then been out with the three ladies, the three being Mrs. Lowder, Mrs. Stringham and Kate, and had kept afloat with them, under a {{sufficient}} Venetian spell, until Aunt Maud had directed him to leave them and return to Miss Theale. Of two circumstances connected with this disposition of his person he was even now not unmindful; the first being that the lady of Lancaster Gate had addressed him with high publicity and as if expressing equally the sense of her companions, who had not spoken, but who might have been taken--yes, Susan Shepherd quite equally with Kate--for inscrutable parties to her plan. What he could as little contrive to forget was that he had, before the two others, as it struck him--that was to say especially before Kate--done exactly as he was bidden; gathered himself up without a protest and retraced his way to the palace. Present with him still was the question of whether he looked a fool for it, of whether the awkwardness he felt as the gondola rocked with the business of his leaving it--they could but make, in submission, for a landing-place that was none of the best--had furnished his friends with such entertainment as was to cause them, behind his back, to exchange intelligent smiles. He had found Milly Theale twenty minutes later alone, and he had sat with her till the others returned to tea. The strange part of this was that it had been very easy, extraordinarily easy. He knew it for strange only when he was away from her, because when he was away from her he was in contact with particular things that made it so. At the time, in her presence, it was as simple as sitting with his sister might have been, and not, if the point were urged, very much more thrilling. He continued to see her as he had first seen her--that remained ineffaceably behind. Mrs. Lowder, Susan Shepherd, his own Kate, might, each in proportion, see her as a princess, as an angel, as a star, but for himself, luckily, she hadn't as yet complications to any point of discomfort: the princess, the angel, the star, were muffled <b>over,</b> <b>ever</b> so lightly and brightly, with the little American girl who had been kind to him in New York and to whom certainly--though without making too much of it for either of them--he was perfectly willing to be kind in return. She appreciated his coming in on purpose, but there was nothing in that--from the moment she was always at home--that they couldn't easily keep up. The only note the least bit high that had even yet sounded between them was this admission on her part that she found it best to remain within. She wouldn't let him call it keeping quiet, for she insisted that her palace--with all its romance and art and history--had set up round her a whirlwind of suggestion that never dropped for an hour. It wasn't therefore, within such walls, confinement, it was the freedom of all the centuries: in respect to which Densher granted good-humouredly that they were then blown together, she and he, as much as she liked, through space.|$|E
