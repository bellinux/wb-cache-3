After exploring the impact of organizational culture <b>on</b> organizational <b>climate</b> through distinguished culture's factors, article examines the importance of these factors and, what is more, presents the case study analysing organizational culture determinants impact <b>on</b> organisational <b>climate</b> based <b>on</b> the research of two Latvian medium-sized companies. MethodologyThe research design is based on Yin (1994) methodology and consists of two main stages: data analysis and validation for case study and case study's methodology. In the first stage an expert evaluation method was used to investigate impact and stress the significance of organizational culture factors’ <b>on</b> organizational <b>climate.</b> To verify the results mathematical calculations and case study were used. Within the research the most significant factors were stressed. In this study comparison was studied between Latvian medium-sized companies with Latvian capital and companies with international capital. ResultsThe results of the research confirmed that during the period of changes organizational culture has an impact <b>on</b> organizational <b>climate</b> through specific factors.
