In <b>the</b> <b>lawyer's</b> professional activities, <b>the</b> observance <b>of</b> certain ethical principles which should be referred to in their work, as well as <b>the</b> basic premise <b>of</b> <b>lawyer</b> responsibility, also plays a role.

During his program, Berg called Kaplan on the phone. When she answered, he introduced her as “a vile human being” and praised Nancy Kissinger's attack on her. After Kaplan hung up, Berg continued to ridicule Kaplan and abuse her verbally for the remainder of the program.

One of the cases, Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. Nathaniel Jennison, firmly established that slavery was incompatible with the new state constitution. Although the decision by Justice William Cushing was based on the state constitution's language [...] "all men are born free and equal", Lincoln in his arguments had instead appealed to natural law and God's law. He was also elected to the Continental Congress in 1781, but declined to serve.

500|$|The rumours persisted; {{sixty years}} later the {{official}} biographer of King George V, Harold Nicolson, was told by Lord Goddard, who was a twelve-year-old schoolboy {{at the time of}} the scandal, that Albert Victor [...] "had been involved in a male brothel scene, and that a solicitor had to commit perjury to clear him. The solicitor was struck off the rolls for his offence, but was thereafter reinstated." [...] In fact, none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> in the case was convicted of perjury or struck off during the scandal, but Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, was convicted of obstruction of justice for helping his clients escape abroad, and was sentenced to six weeks in prison. Over twenty years later in 1910, Newton was struck off for twelve months for professional misconduct after falsifying letters from another of his clients, the notorious murderer Dr Crippen. In 1913, Newton was struck off indefinitely and sentenced to three years' imprisonment for obtaining money by false pretences.|$|E
500|$|Though the UFA MLAs {{were not}} willing to accept a non-farmer as premier, many of them {{realized}} that the post of Attorney-General should go to a lawyer.

With the caucus convinced, Greenfield asked Brownlee to accept the position. Brownlee demurred, reluctant to take the resulting cut in income, not eager to leave his family in Calgary to work in Edmonton (the provincial capital), and leery of the high expectations invested in the new government by the province's farmers. [...] Ultimately, a combination of duty, loyalty, and ambition convinced him to accept the position. [...] Though the choice of cabinet ministers is traditionally the prerogative of the premier, as part of the UFA's agenda of democratic reform Greenfield agreed to present his choices to the caucus for vetting. Brownlee was approved August 11, 1921, and was sworn in two days later.|$|E
500|$|The {{chemical}} companies involved denied {{that there was}} a link between Agent Orange and the veterans' medical problems. However, on May 7, 1984, seven {{chemical companies}} settled the class-action suit out of court just hours before jury selection was to begin. The companies agreed to pay $180 million as compensation if the veterans dropped all claims against them. Slightly over 45% of the sum was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone. Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court, and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers. [...] "Fairness Hearings" [...] were held in five major American cities, where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement, and condemned the actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> and courts, demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers. Federal Judge Julius Weinstein refused the appeals, claiming the settlement was [...] "fair and just". By 1989, the veterans' fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out. A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of $12,000 spread out over the course of 10 years. Furthermore, by accepting the settlement payments, disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement, such as food stamps, public assistance, and government pensions. A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would only receive $3700.|$|E
