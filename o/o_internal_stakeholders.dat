Students and academic staff are part of <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> and they participate in university governance by collective bodies such as universities senate and faculty councils. At present, the management and governance of the universities become complex and often there are divergent interests between external and <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> New trends in organization of the management structures of universities prefigure {{the end of the}} democratic decision- making tradition in universities replacing it with management structures similar to market- based institutions or commercial companies.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} how {{entrepreneurial}} cognition interacts with <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholder</b> perception in established entrepreneurial organizations. In addition, {{the influence of}} interdependent factors of cognitive biases, temporality, growth and performance on the interaction has been examined. The study is exploratory, phenomenological and framed within an interpretive research paradigm. Primary data was gathered using a qualitative multiple case study methodology. Semi-structured interviews were conducted every three months over an eighteen-month period with entrepreneurs and <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> of nine organizations in Phase I and three organizations in Phase II. This research is original because it focuses exclusively on the interaction between concepts of entrepreneurial cognition and biases, temporality, <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholder</b> perception, organizational factors, growth and performance for established entrepreneurial organizations. The empirical evidence highlights that cognitive diversity and differences in perception and expectations {{have an impact on}} entrepreneurial and <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholder</b> interrelationships in established entrepreneurial organizations. Furthermore, entrepreneurial decision-making leads to the Icarus Paradox of confidence-success-attribution cycle that either moderates or mediates organizational growth and performance. The consequence of longer communication chains is limited information flow that results in cognitive dissonance. The research contributes to closing the gap in literature on the interdependent nature of entrepreneurial cognition and <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholder</b> perception on organizational growth and performance. The contribution to practice therefore is that in established entrepreneurial organizations the entrepreneurs and <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> can focus on performance by understanding the cause and effect influence of their interactions. This sets the foundation for further research on the interaction between entrepreneurial cognition and other organizational concepts...|$|R

But, the type and extent of roles to be played by different stakeholders are not yet clearly ascertained. One of the centers of attention in Ethiopia is health institution under the private holding. In this research, hence, attention {{was given to the}} role of stakeholders in improving education quality in private health institutions. For the materialization of the research, four private colleges were purposively selected as target research sites according to their ease for access of data. Such were Rift-Valley College, Central College of Health, Deborah and Keamed. Target informants were selected from among <b>internal</b> and external <b>stakeholders.</b> Accordingly, the informants among <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> were 40 students, 20 teachers and four officers. Likewise, four health professionals in the private health center were purposively chosen as data providers from among external stakeholders. The research data were collected in the form of responses to questionnaire from students and teachers; and, in the form of interview data from officers. After thorough analysis of the data, the researcher has come up with the findings that, <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> had stronger curricular and evaluative roles than external ones.

40|$|Abstract (engelsk sammendrag) The {{purpose of}} this study is to get a deeper {{understanding}} of how companies communicate their CSR initiatives and issues to <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> The main research question is: “How do companies communicate their CSR initiatives in order to create engagement and commitment among internal stakeholders?”. This is followed by four supplementary research questions: 1) “To what extent are <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> aware of and engaged in the companies CSR initiatives?”; 2) “To what extent are <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> involved in CSR initiatives?”; 3) “Which message channels are being used for communicating CSR initiatives?” and 4) “How does the company’s external communication affect internal stakeholders?”. The research questions are answered through a qualitative case study consisting of three large regional companies in the municipality of Hedmark in Norway. The data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with both managers and employees, in total 14 respondents. The main findings show that the awareness and engagement of CSR is high among most of the employees. The main underlying cause of this, in this case, is the degree of involvement, which seems to be the utmost important factor for increased commitment and engagement to CSR and their associated activities. The most used communication channels are intranet, e-mails, face-to-face, department-, house- and video meetings. However, the preferred channel among <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> turned out to be face-to-face communication, with the desire of having the opportunity to give feedback and suggestions for improvement. The companies in this study seemed good at involving employees on top- and middle manager level. On lower positions, however, the involvement was arguably at a bare minimum, with the consequence of low commitment and engagement. The company’s own websites and annual reports seem to have little to no significant impact on employees, whereas social media and newspaper articles stand higher on the perceived impact – something perhaps overlook, but a considerably important channel for reaching employees...|$|R

Quality Assurance in higher education has been an ongoing international issue for discussion. As higher education institutions move toward an era of accountability and accreditation, groups of stakeholders require proof of high-quality academic programs and services from higher education providers. Since the mid- 1990 s, most providers have strived to incorporate business practices in efforts to refine their higher education institutions. The leadership in Cambodia, like in many other countries in Asia, is attempting to integrate Quality Assurance practices into its higher education system. This study employed a constructivist grounded theory approach to examine perceptions, practices, and challenges through semi-structured interviews with a purposeful sampling of 34 policy makers and administrative staff and eight teaching staff implementing Quality Assurance at the Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP). Archival research and observations were also completed. I pursued six research questions: How do the <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> perceive the term Quality Assurance? What purposes are viewed as essential by the <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> in implementing an internal Quality Assurance system at RUPP? What are the current Quality Assurance measures for RUPP? How do the <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> perceive the current Quality Assurance measures? What challenges does RUPP face in ensuring the quality of the institution? What recommendations do the <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> make to enhance the current Quality Assurance measures?An analysis of data revealed three emergent themes: Adapting Quality Assurance, Integrating Quality Assurance, and Teaching Quality Assurance. I developed the Ros gravitational theory to depict the Quality Assurance implementation process and interaction dynamics of the participants whose development of understanding go through three stages: applying Quality Assurance with a cognitive comprehension, attempting to adapt Quality Assurance with an intrapersonal awareness, and going beyond Quality Assurance with multiple interpersonal relationships.

40|$|Service {{design is}} known for various methods that are facilitating healthy {{communication}} and collaboration with customers however {{it seems to be}} difficult to find studies that analyze service design methods improving communication and collaboration within the organization. Therefore, service design methods were applied from a new perspective. The goal of this thesis was to investigate how to improve communication and collaboration of <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders</b> in a growing IT organization. Action research was used as the research method in this thesis work. The literature review was conducted to identify suitable services design methods for the empirical study. As a result of the literature review, service blueprint and participatory methods were selected. The empirical study was based on both qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques, such as 36 interviews, a workshop, observations and a survey. The empirical study revealed that the scope of service blueprint had to be modified to support communication and collaboration between <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> Changes mostly affected physical size and accuracy level of the visualization. The participatory workshop was found to be effective for collaboration support. Furthermore more valuable results would be achieved if workshop arrangements and engagement activities were aligned with the workshop participants. Service blueprint and participatory methods were found to positively affect communication and collaboration of <b>internal</b> <b>stakeholder</b> in a growing IT organization. These service design methods provided a big picture of the service delivery process. Also visibility on the processes increased common understanding and eased internal communication in an organization. Furthermore, a healthy communication and collaboration environment was managed. This environment allowed sharing experiences and deciding on improvements regarding organizational processes. The results of the study indicate that the service blueprint and participatory methods can provide deep understanding of the service delivery process across the organization and support improvement of organizational processes.

In this way a policy implication from the network analysis is that the attention to internal audiences should be improved and extended in the early stage of KTOs to gain legitimisation. University-industry relations can only be effective if KTOs actually know their own academic environment and research capabilities. KTOs should structure proactive strategies to meet internal capabilities with potentially interested demands from the economic fabric.|$|R
