40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of the periparturient egg rise (PPER) of gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) in sheep remains unclear, and may {{be influenced}} by the lambing season. This longitudinal study was performed to determine the effect of <b>out-of-season</b> <b>lambing</b> on the PPER in ewes in Ontario, and whether total plasma protein (TPP) and packed cell volume (PCV) were associated with the PPER. Six farms that practiced <b>out-of-season</b> <b>lambing</b> were enrolled, and sampled for three consecutive lambing seasons (winter, spring and autumn). For each lambing season, all farms were visited five times. On the first visit for each lambing season, 15 – 20 pregnant ewes and 15 – 20 non-pregnant/early gestation ewes were randomly selected. At each visit, fecal samples were collected from all selected animals and processed individually to measure GIN fecal egg counts (FECs). Blood samples were collected on three visits in each lambing period and processed to measure TPP and PCV. The ewes were classified into one of five production stages (maintenance [i. e. not pregnant], early or late gestation [< 120 d and ≥ 120 d, respectively], and early or late lactation [< 40 d and ≥ 40 d, respectively]) based on information collected during farm visits. Linear mixed models were developed for the TPP, PCV and logarithmic-transformed FEC (lnFEC). During the winter and spring lambing season, the FECs increased gradually over the gestation period and peaked during lactation, with these increases being larger in ewes with a low PCV (three-way interaction in the final model). In the autumn lambing season, the FECs started off higher in early gestation, and increased rapidly to peak in late gestation, particularly for animals with low PCV levels. In the TPP model, PCV and lnFEC were positively associated with TPP. During both autumn and winter lambing seasons, the TPP decreased from maintenance throughout gestation and early lactation, followed by an increase in late lactation, except for when there were high FECs. During the spring lambing season, TPP peaked at early gestation, and then decreased in late gestation, to increase more gradually over lactation. In the PCV model, PCV increased with TPP and decreased exponentially with increases in lnFEC. The PPER occurred during all three lambing seasons, and its magnitude and distribution varied with the lambing season, suggesting that the PPER in ewes depends on both environmental and animal physiological factors, an important consideration when implementing preventive parasite control strategies on sheep farms that practice <b>out-of-season</b> <b>lambing...</b>|$|E
40|$|Enhancement of Sicilian {{autochthonous}} breeds {{and their}} typical dairy products. With regard of the valorization of local Sicilian dairy breeds, the authors focus on {{some aspects of}} management based on which to qualify their dairy products, and drive their enhancement and promotion in the market. It is noted the beneficial effects of feeding of local cows on pasture and of the traditional farming system on nutritional and health properties of Caciocavallo Palermitano cheese. It is shown, in organic farms and in conventional ones, the possibility to integrate the diet of grazing animals with concentrates based on locally produced grains, safer and less expensive than maize and soybean. It is proposed an out-of-season sheep farming model that, based on <b>out-of-season</b> <b>lambing</b> and nocturnal grazing for attenuating the effects of heat stress, permits to extend the production period in summer, and thus ensures the presence of dairy products on the market. In order to contribute in recovering the Girgentana goat breed, at risk of extinction, it highlights its adaptation to free-housing and to intensive grazing on forage crops, and the good cheese-making aptitude of milk from goats with genotype characterized by strong alleles of αs 1 -casein...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate out-of-season lamb production in the lower North Island of New Zealand. Ewes representing three crosses (Border Leicester x Romney (BR), Poll Dorset x BR (PBR) and Suffolk x BR (SBR)) and three birth years were reared, under commercial farming conditions, to enter an <b>out-of-season</b> <b>lambing</b> experiment. Suffolk x BR hoggets had significantly (P < 0. 01) heavier 1 6 month liveweights than PBR or BR hoggets. There were inconsistent differences in liveweight between PBR and BR ewe hoggets. Border Leicester x Romney hoggets produced more (P < 0. 01) greasy wool at the yearling shearing than PBR or SBR hoggets. The same sheep were then assigned to one of two lambing policies (June or August) at their 2 -year-old mating and remained within that policy while they were evaluated for their 2 -year-old (1987, 1988, 1989) and 3 -year-old (1988, 1989, 1990) lambing performance. Lambing policy did not influence the proportion of mated ewes that lambed but there were more (P < 0. 05) multiple births in the August-lambing ewes. Birth weights and weaning weights of the June-born lambs were significantly (P < 0. 00 1) lower than those of their August-born counterparts. June-lambing ewes produced more (P < 0. 00 1) wool (on average by 0. 5 kg) than August-lambing ewes. Border Leicester x Romney ewes produced more (P < 0. 00 1) greasy wool per year (by 0. 7 to 1. 2 kg) than PBR ewes while PBR ewes outperformed SBR ewes (by 0. 3 to 0. 5 kg) for annual greasy wool production. Reproductive differences between the ewe crosses were small and non-significant, although PBR ewes reared the heaviest lambs. In an attempt to determine when the extra wool growth occurred in June-lambing compared to August-lambing ewes, six-weekly midside patch wool growth measurements were taken throughout a 1 2 -month period on a sample of the same three ewe crosses described earlier. lt was found that the seasonal decline in wool growth rate that normally occurs over the winter months in August lambing ewes was minimised in June-lambing ewes. Associated with this effect was a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in mean fibre diameter and an increase in staple strength at the following October shearing in June-lambing ewes. The next experiment was designed to determine the relationships between sward surface height, intake and production for lactating June-lambing ewes. The organic matter intake (OMI) of June-lambing ewes was not influenced by a range (2. 6 - 7. 8 cm) of sward surface heights (SSH) during week 3 of lactation. Between weeks 4 and 7 of lactation, ewe OMI increased up to a SSH of 7. 8 cm while in week 8 of lactation there was no increase in OMI between ewes grazing 4. 4 or 7. 8 cm swards. Sward surface height had no effect on ewe midside wool growth, mean fibre diameter or lamb growth but ewes on the 2. 6 cm sward lost 8 - 1 0 kg more liveweight during lactation than those on the 4. 4 and 7. 8 cm swards. These results suggest that June-lambing ewes in good condition can maintain lamb growth at low (2 - 3 cm) SSH but at the expense of ewe l iveweight loss. The final trial investigated the effect of SSH on ewe intake and performance during the last month of pregnancy in June- and August-lambing ewes. Ewe OMI, condition score and liveweight gain increased as SSH increased from 2. 0 to 8. 0 cm. There was no effect of SSH on ewe m idside wool growth, mean fibre diameter or lamb birth weights. June-born lambs were significantly (P < 0. 05) lighter at birth than August-born lambs across all SSH treatments. At the same SSH, Junelambing pregnant ewes achieved similar OMI to those of August-lambing ewes. The results of these studies are discussed in the context of the development of <b>out-of-season</b> <b>lambing</b> systems for the lower North Island of New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate ewe and lamb performance in an accelerated lamb production system, and to compare the performance and lamb output between a conventional and an accelerated lamb production system. In the “Conventional” system, ewes were bred in March to lamb in August. The “Accelerated” system was based on the “STAR” system (Lewis et al., 1996), in which there were five breeding periods within each year. In the current experiment these were 14 th January, 28 th March, 9 th June, 21 st August and 2 nd November. Progesterone was used to synchronise the breeding periods and during the non-breeding season, eCG was used to induce reproductive activity. Lambing began on each of these dates and weaning was 73 days later, coinciding with the next breeding period. The experiment ran over a three-year period beginning with breeding in March 2003 and was complete with the weaning of lambs from the January 2006 -bred ewes. This resulted in 15 lambing and breeding periods over the three years in the Accelerated system and three lambing and breeding periods in the Conventional system. Average pregnancy rates were lower in the Accelerated system than in the Conventional system. Lamb growth rates were similar between the two systems, although lamb live weights at weaning were lower in the Accelerated system due to the age of the lambs at weaning (average = 69 vs 96 days). More lambs were born and weaned, resulting in more kilograms of lamb weaned in the Accelerated system relative to the Conventional system over the experimental period (26, 200 vs 24, 300 kg). Labour input was 35 % higher in the Accelerated system, or 13 % higher per lamb weaned. Average annual ewe energy requirements were 6 % higher in the Accelerated system. Ewe energy requirements per kilogram of lamb weaned was lower (6 %) in the Accelerated system due to more breeding and lambing periods per ewe per year. Laparoscopic observation of ewes’ ovaries at each breeding period revealed that most ewes had active ovaries and were therefore capable of successfully producing a viable foetus. In a subsequent experiment, blood samples were collected for analysis of progesterone concentrations from ewes bred during the spring and autumn breeding periods. Observations of data indicated that a small number of ewes conceived and lost their conceptus, or had abnormal corpora lutea. Results suggested that pregnancies were failing due to a lack of an appropriate signal from the embryo to the dam/uterus. Exposing Romney ewes to an artificial lighting regimen was unsuccessful for inducing reproductive activity during spring. In another experiment, melatonin implants administered to Romney ewes in spring and used in conjunction with eCG and progesterone, resulted in 61 % more lambs born per ewe treated, compared to eCG and progesterone alone. This result indicated that melatonin implants, used with eCG and progesterone may be a suitable method for improving reproductive performance in sheep bred out of season in New Zealand. Delaying weaning of lambs and breeding lactating ewes can be used to obtain heavier lamb weaning weights in the Accelerated system. Spring-bred ewes had lambs weaned at either 69 days post partum or 90 days post partum. Reproductive performance was similar between the two groups of ewes, and lamb live weights in the later weaned group were heavier when lambs were 90 and 120 days of age. This research has shown that accelerated or <b>out-of-season</b> <b>lamb</b> production is an option for some New Zealand sheep farmers. However, the mechanisms associated with reproductive seasonality and methods of successfully circumventing this seasonality require further attention in order to achieve optimum reproductive performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine whether targeted anthelmintic treatment of peri-parturient ewes lambing in the winter, spring and/or autumn would suppress the peri-parturient egg rise (PPER) and improve 50 -day lamb weights. Three farms in Ontario, Canada, that practiced <b>out-of-season</b> <b>lambing</b> were enrolled in 2010 and sampled for three consecutive lambing seasons (winter, spring and autumn). For each lambing season, all farms were visited three times. On the first visit, all ewes due to lamb that season were randomly allocated to treatment with ivermectin, fenbendazole or levamisole at the recommended dosage, or left untreated. Among these treated ewes, 40 – 60 animals (10 – 15 ewes per treatment group) were randomly selected for fecal sampling during the 3 sampling visits and processed individually to measure gastro-intestinal nematode (GIN) fecal egg counts (FECs). Ewe and lamb productivity data, including approximate 50 -day lamb weights, were collected for all ewes lambing in each season, where available. A Fecal Egg Count Reduction Test was performed on all three farms to determine the ivermectin, fenbendazole and levamisole resistance status. Both farms A and B had fenbendazole resistance, while farm C had ivermectin and fenbendazole resistance; levamisole was effective on all three farms. The effect of targeted treatment on the subsequent PPER depended on the farm, possibly a partial surrogate variable for the different anthelmintic resistance levels on each farm, lambing season and sampling time-point. On farm A, during the winter and autumn lambing seasons, ivermectin and levamisole were more effective at reducing the FECs, compared to fenbendazole. In contrast, during the spring lambing season, treatment of ewes with ivermectin, fenbendazole or levamisole had no effect on the FECs. On farm B, all anthelmintic treatments were associated with a reduction in the FECs during the spring lambing season, while no reduction was observed during the winter and autumn lambing seasons. On farm C, the FECs decreased in ewes treated with levamisole in both the winter and spring lambing seasons, while ivermectin only reduced the FECs in ewes treated in the winter lambing season. Litter size was positively associated with FECs. Anthelmintic treatment was not associated with approximate 50 -day lamb weights, although the power to detect significant difference was lower than anticipated due to only having relevant weight data from farm A. These results suggest that the efficacy of targeted treatment for the suppression of the PPER depends on the anthelmintics’ efficacy and time of treatment in relation to the grazing period...|$|E
