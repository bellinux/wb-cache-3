Squall is characterized by forlorn memories of standing <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> at the orphanage where he grew up, wondering where [...] "Sis" [...] went. Squall's weapon is a gunblade, a sword that uses components of a revolver to send vibrations through the blade when triggered. His Limit Break is a series of sword strikes called Renzokuken.|$|E

At home, Rentaro's mother visits him, {{pressuring}} him {{to accept a}} marriage proposal to a childhood friend. However, upon seeing the umbrella, she insists on meeting his [...] "girlfriend". They go to visit a temple together, where the woman demonstrates fondness towards his mother such as by buying her toad oil for her stiff shoulders.

60|$|Kurrell groaned, {{and tried}} to frame some sort of idiotic {{sentence}} about being willing to give 'satisfaction.' But his interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> woman was dead, had died <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rains,</b> and, mentally, he was abusing her for her amazing indiscretion. It {{would have been so}} easy to have broken off the thing gently and by degrees, and now he was saddled with Boulte's voice recalled him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Who's touchin' {{your old}} hair?" [...] Jake shouted back, {{from the inside}} of the barn. [...] "You must be crazy. Hurry up, if you're ever goin' to attack us. I want to get <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> myself, awhile." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard her}} this morning: 'Eh, Mrs. Morel! I {{was going to}} do that,' when you went <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> for some coal," [...] he said. [...] "That looks a lot like your being able to manage servants!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hello!" [...] he exclaimed, as Dave hurried <b>in</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> {{and shook}} <b>the</b> water from his cap. [...] "I {{thought you were}} one of our crowd." ...|$|R
2500|$|Bunawar tasks him to {{infiltrate}} the underworld befriending Uco, son of Bangun and heir to his criminal empire. Taking on the alias [...] "Yuda," [...] he is told to assault {{the son of}} the politician responsible for putting Uco in prison, so Bunawar can arrest him so he may befriend the incarcerated Uco. What {{was supposed to be a}} few months sentence is instead 3 years.

He quickly proves his value to the crime family, earning their trust through his work under Uco and his father's consigliere Eka.|$|R

6000|$|... "Now {{that sounds}} {{a little too much}} like General Triscoe's pessimism," [...] said Mrs. March; and she added: [...] "But whether we have any {{national}} melodies or not, we don't poke women <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> and keep them soaking!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, thank you, miss! I'd like 'em ever so much, for I'm <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> {{half the}} time, and get bad colds because my boots are old," [...] said Lizzie, smiling brightly {{at the thought}} of the welcome gift.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs Null laughed. [...] "Imagine," [...] she said, [...] "a woman {{putting on}} a {{waterproof}} and overshoes, and coming <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> to stand with an umbrella over her head, to be proposed to! That would be the funniest proceeding I ever heard of!" ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bennett subsided. He {{was feeling}} {{thoroughly}} misanthropic. He disliked everybody, with perhaps {{the exception of}} Billie, for whom a faint paternal fondness still lingered. He disliked Mr. Mortimer. He disliked Bream, and regretted that Billie had become engaged to him, though for years such an engagement had been his dearest desire. He disliked Jane Hubbard, now <b>out</b> walking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> with Eustace Hignett. And he disliked Eustace.|$|R

60|$|The farmer {{said it was}} wonderful--he {{had never}} heard of a case like it before; and talking of Watch he succeeded in forgetting the trouble in his mind which had sent him <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> in his thin clothes and straw hat, and he went away in a cheerful mood.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Tom, [...] "people don't go much on hermits, nowadays, {{like they}} used to in old times, but a pirate's always respected.

60|$|Coming home, an Irish coachman {{drove us}} into a cul de sac, near Battersea Bridge.

6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being <b>out</b> this morning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b> Young ladies {{should take care}} of themselves.--Young ladies are {{delicate}} plants.

6000|$|... 'Tattoo lao! Get my pony! Here, come <b>in</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> till I'm ready. What blasted {{nuisances}} you are! That's brandy. Drink some; {{you want}} it. Hang {{on to my}} stirrup and tell me if I go too fast.' ...|$|R

60|$|His {{mother said}} it was not {{suitable}} for young ladies to go <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> as their shoes, and their dress generally, were thin, and could not bear to be exposed to wet; but she said that Rollo himself might take off his shoes and stockings, and go out alone, when the rain held up.|$|E
60|$|But when night came I {{could not}} bear the lonesomeness, {{and went to the}} new shelter which he has built, to ask him what I had done that was wrong and how I could mend it and get back his {{kindness}} again; but he put me <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain,</b> and it was my first sorrow.|$|E
6000|$|... "My name's Cornelia; but father, {{he calls}} me Corny, which mother hates to hear the very sound of," [...] said she; [...] "and {{the rest of it}} is Mary Chipperton.

And father and I'll be sure to be here early to-morrow to go out fishing with you. Good-bye!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Babwold wears {{a rather}} solemn personality, {{and has never}} been known to smile, even when saying disagreeable things to her friends or making out the Stores list. She takes her pleasures sadly. A state {{elephant}} at a Durbar gives one a very similar impression. Her husband gardens in all weathers. When a man goes <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pouring <b>rain</b> to brush caterpillars off rose-trees, I generally imagine his life indoors leaves something to be desired; anyway, it must be very unsettling for the caterpillars.|$|R

6000|$|... "No one but the McClintocks--and {{only a few}} of them," [...] I soberly replied. [...] "Uncle William and Aunt Maria, Frank and Lorette--and Deborah, all {{old people}} now. I don't know of any one else." [...] In fact, we had less than this number, for Maria was not well enough to come <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain.</b>|$|E
