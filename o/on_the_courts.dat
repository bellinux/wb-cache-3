5|$|State Senator Richard Madaleno {{requested}} in 2009 {{that the}} Attorney General {{answer the question}} of whether same-sex marriages could be recognized by the state. In February 2010, Doug Gansler issued an opinion after a nine-month analysis of state laws stating that valid same-sex marriages performed in other states that permit same-sex marriage could be recognized under Maryland law. Gansler stated that the opinion was not binding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> and state agencies could begin immediately to recognize out-of-state same-sex marriages. He said that he expected the opinion to be quickly challenged in court.|$|E
5|$|Years {{of civil}} war had left Rome {{in a state of}} near lawlessness, but the Republic was not {{prepared}} to accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the Roman provinces. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting the overt political pressure imposed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> of law and ensuring free elections—in name at least.|$|E

50|$|Players {{are divided}} into two teams and wait with one team behind each baseline. One player from each team steps up and a singles point is played out {{starting}} with a drop hit.

This next point is played one vs. two with the team with only one person <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> starting <b>the</b> ball. The team with one person <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> can use <b>the</b> doubles <b>court</b> while <b>the</b> team with multiple people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> has to use <b>the</b> singles <b>court.</b> If <b>the</b> team with two people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> wins, they add another player and play one vs. three.

Hurt stated that the increase was essential, based on the information lawmakers had at the time, to refrain from a government shutdown over a budget impasse and has since stated regret over the vote.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} is often remembered today as {{paving the way}} for free agency in baseball. However, it did so, according to Bill James, only by showing players they could not rely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> to strike down the antitrust exemption and the reserve clause along with it. But the effort by a player of Flood's stature did galvanize the players, and according to Marvin Miller it made the general public aware of the reserve clause. Labor law proved a more fruitful opportunity for the invalidation of the reserve clause. The next year the National Labor Relations Board voted that baseball came under its jurisdiction, and that led to the Seitz decision three years later that Andy Messersmith and Dave McNally were free agents after they had played out a year without signing new contracts. That event is considered the true beginning of baseball free agency.|$|E

Iaukea was taken aback by the honor since he had no experience in diplomacy and was only twenty-eight at the time. In this role, Iaukea would become the most traveled member of the Hawaiian administration after Kalākaua who had made a similar world tour in 1881. Commissioned as the kingdom's ambassador under the title of [...] "Envoy Extraordinary" [...] and [...] "Minister Plenipotentiary", he represented Hawaii at {{the coronation}} of Tsar Alexander III of Russia on May 27, 1883, and led a subsequent diplomatic tour of the courts of Europe and Japan. Traveling with his secretary, the part-Hawaiian Henry F. Poor, Iaukea made a favorable impression <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> of Europe. In Russia, they had an audience with the new tsar and tsarina, met Russian Foreign Minister Nikolay Girs, and socialized on an equal footing with the other foreign dignitaries. Iaukea later noted, [...] "the sight of my country's flag floating over the entrance to the Hotel Duseaux besides those of the United States and Japan, gave me an added incentive to meet the responsibilities that lay ahead and discharge them with honor". The two Hawaiians traveled to the courts of Berlin, Vienna, Belgrade, London, Rome, and India and Japan via the Suez Canal. In London, he visited the International Fisheries Exhibition. In Japan, he met with the Emperor Meiji and helped finalize an immigration plan between Japan and Hawaii previously negotiated by Kalākaua during his world tour.|$|E
