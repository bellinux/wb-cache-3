5|$|Fragments of Him is a first-person narrative-based {{video game}} set around {{the death of}} a {{bisexual}} man named Will. The player controls four characters, each of whom was connected to Will during his lifetime. The characters consist of: Will, who dies in a car crash early in the game; Sarah, Will's ex-girlfriend; Harry, Will's boyfriend {{at the time of his}} death; and Mary, Will's grandmother. The gameplay has the player character walk around the world, with the player triggering snippets <b>of</b> <b>narration</b> by clicking on highlighted objects. When interacting with non-player characters, clicking on them will sometimes result in them disappearing and reappearing in a different location to give the impression of them walking.|$|E
5|$|From 1885 {{until his}} death in 1908 his work was {{dominated}} by prose and poems. The 1895 prose text Der Schmetterling contains autobiographical accounts. Peter's enchantment by the witch Lucinde, of whom he regards himself a slave, is possibly in reference to Johanna Kessler. Peter, like Busch, returns to his birthplace. It is similar in style to the romantic travel story that Ludwig Tieck established with his 1798 Franz Sternbald's Wanderungen. Busch plays with its traditional forms, motifs, pictures, literary topics and form <b>of</b> <b>narration.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many of the Ainu dialects, {{even from}} one end of Hokkaido to the other, were not {{mutually}} intelligible; however, the classic Ainu language of the Yukar, or Ainu epic stories, was understood by all. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters <b>of</b> <b>narration,</b> with the Yukar and other forms <b>of</b> <b>narration</b> such as the Uepeker (Uwepeker) tales, being committed to memory and related at gatherings, often lasting many hours or even days.|$|E
25|$|A hadith {{is said to}} be mutawatir if it was {{reported}} by a significant, though unspecified, number of narrators at each level in the chain <b>of</b> <b>narration,</b> thus reaching the succeeding generation through multiple chains <b>of</b> <b>narration</b> leading back to its source. This provides confirmation that the hadith is authentically attributed to its source at a level above reasonable doubt. This is due to its being beyond historical possibility that narrators could have conspired to forge a narration. In contrast, an ahaad hadith is a narration the chain of which has not reached a number sufficient to qualify as mutawatir.|$|E
25|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts, which also becomes a method <b>of</b> <b>narration,</b> marking the protagonist’s moral progress. Being egoistic and {{indifferent}} to his community and roots, materialistic {{in the first part of}} the book, he becomes social and altruistic in the second.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{passages}} {{appear to}} be the transcription <b>of</b> spontaneous <b>narration</b> <b>of</b> religious beliefs, society or nature. Other parts clearly reflect a consistent set of questions presented to different people designed to elicit specific information. Some sections of text report Sahagún's own <b>narration</b> <b>of</b> events or commentary.|$|R
25|$|In July 1937, the Mutual Network gave Welles a seven-week {{series to}} adapt Les Misérables. It {{was his first}} job as a writer-director for radio, the radio debut of the Mercury Theatre, and one of Welles's {{earliest}} and finest achievements. He invented the use <b>of</b> <b>narration</b> in radio.|$|E
25|$|An {{accusation}} of fabricating a hadith. This would be due a narration that clearly contradicts established religious principles originating {{from the direction}} (as it pertains to that hadith's chain <b>of</b> <b>narration)</b> of that individual. Or, that a narrator is known to lie in his ordinary speech but not while narrating hadith.|$|E
25|$|Two of Bukhari's hadith {{works have}} survived: Al-Adab al-Mufrad ("the book devoted {{to matters of}} respect and propriety") and al-Jāmi’ al-Musnad al-Sahīh al-Mukhtaṣar min umūr Rasûl Allāh wa sunnanihi wa ayyāmihi ("the {{abridged}} collection of sound reports with chains <b>of</b> <b>narration</b> going back {{all the way to}} the Prophet regarding matters pertaining to the Prophet, his practices and his times"). The latter is also known simply as Sahih al-Bukhari.|$|E
50|$|This word is {{the only}} one used in most <b>of</b> the <b>narrations</b> and is not omitted due to the {{diversity}} <b>of</b> the <b>narrations.</b> It is thought this word is used as an exaggerated expression of remoteness.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>narrations,</b> {{presented as}} hadith, declared fabricated {{by the author}} and then arranged by subject. Al-Mawdu'at {{has been described by}} Al-Nawawi as including many narrations, occupying approximately two volumes. It consists <b>of</b> some 1847 <b>narrations</b> according to the numbering provided in the latest edition and is currently published in four volumes with ample footnotes providing additional information.|$|R
50|$|Finally, critics {{seemed to}} praise both the {{remarkable}} {{amount of access}} granted to Glawogger in shooting Whores’ Glory and the hands-off approach he adopted. The film presents itself to its audience without the aide <b>of</b> <b>narrations</b> or commentary.|$|R
25|$|A hadith {{is subject}} to {{criticism}} {{on the basis of}} two matters. The first relates to the continuity of the hadith's chain of narration; if there is discontinuity between two or more narrators, that hadith is criticized on this basis as discussed in depth in the hadith terminology article. The second relates to criticism of a narrator, or more, in the chain <b>of</b> <b>narration</b> of a particular hadith.|$|E
25|$|In {{almost all}} his works, be it verse or prose, {{the way in}} which Chilkamarti narrated the {{incident}} instantaneously captured the reader's mind. The imageries he presented in detail, {{the way in which}} he unfolded the story with a special technique <b>of</b> <b>narration,</b> the diction he employed with familiar expression intelligible even to the average reader, above all, the sincerity of purpose with which he wrote went a long way for the success and popularity of his works.|$|E
25|$|Tarkovsky {{has been}} the subject of several documentaries. Most notable is the 1988 {{documentary}} Moscow Elegy, by Russian film director Alexander Sokurov. Sokurov's own work has been heavily influenced by Tarkovsky. The film consists mostly <b>of</b> <b>narration</b> over stock footage from Tarkovsky's films. Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky is 1988 documentary film by Michal Leszczylowski, an editor of the film The Sacrifice. Film director Chris Marker produced the television documentary One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich as an homage to Andrei Tarkovsky in 2000.|$|E

25|$|The Introduction {{comprises}} 65 chapters, each {{covering a}} hadith related issue. The first 33 chapters describe the various technical terms of hadith terminology which describe {{the conditions of}} a hadith's authenticity, or acceptability {{as a basis for}} Islamic jurisprudence. The following chapters relate to the isnād, or chain <b>of</b> <b>narration.</b> Next are a series of chapters pertaining to the etiquette to be observed by hadith scholars and manners of transcription. The last chapters describe various issues relating to the narrators of hadith including naming conventions.|$|E
25|$|Pandavani is a folk ballad form {{performed}} predominantly in Chhattisgarh. It {{depicts the}} story of the Pandavas, the leading characters in the epic Mahabharata. The artists in the Pandavani narration consist of a lead artist and some supporting singers and musicians. There are two styles <b>of</b> <b>narration</b> in Pandavani, Vedamati and Kapalik. In the Vedamati style the lead artist narrates in a simple manner by sitting on the floor throughout the performance. The Kaplik style is livelier, where the narrator actually enacts the scenes and characters.|$|E
25|$|Adinarayana Swamy Temple is {{a temple}} {{dedicated}} to Lord Vishnu located at Pariyur {{and the chief}} deity the temple is Adhi Narayana Perumal. He is seen along with his companions Sri Devi and Bhu Devi. The specialty of the temple is that, there is a separate shrine dedicated to Lord Hanuman. The statues of Sanjeevi Anjaneyar, Veera Anjaneyar and Alwars are seen inside the main temple complex. Garuda Alwar is seen {{in front of the}} main sanctum. The main Gopuram of the temple depicts the scene <b>of</b> <b>narration</b> of Bhagavad Gita, the holy book of Hindus. Vaikunta Ekadashi and other festivals of Vishnu are celebrated here.|$|E

25|$|Updike is {{a master}} of {{effortless}} motion—between third and first person, from the metaphorical density of literary prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide generalisation, from the actual to the numinous, from the scary to the comic. For his own particular purposes, Updike devised for himself a style <b>of</b> <b>narration,</b> an intense, present tense, free indirect style, that can leap up, whenever it wants, to a God's-eye view of Harry, or the view of his put-upon wife, Janice, or victimised son, Nelson. This carefully crafted artifice permits here assumptions about evolutionary theory, which are more Updike than Harry, and comically sweeping notions of Jewry, which are more Harry than Updike.|$|E
25|$|While Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ {{arranged}} {{his work}} {{to a greater extent}} than previous authors on the subject, it had its limitations in organization because it began as a series of lectures. He did not arrange his book in a particular manner, in some cases mentioning a term related to the matn (text), before moving onto one related to the isnād (chain <b>of</b> <b>narration),</b> or perhaps mentioning types related to both. As a large number of students were present at his lectures, memorizing or transcribing them, he was subsequently unable to revise this order. Were he to have done so, the students original transcriptions might then differ with his revisions as some may have attended the original lectures and others the revised. The introduction of the book required an index to guide readers which illustrates the somewhat disorganized nature of his work.|$|E
25|$|Ibn Jamāʻah, in his abridgement, divided {{these terms}} into four {{different}} categories according to subject (and adding six {{terms in the}} process). The first pertains to the matn (text) of the hadith and its three divisions and 30 types. The three divisions are ṣaḥīḥ, ḥasan, and ḍa`īf. The thirty types include those mentioned in hadith terminology and others. The second deals with the isnād (chain <b>of</b> <b>narration)</b> and comprises 11 types. These types generally fall within the discipline of biographical evaluation. The third category includes six types: the qualifications necessary for conveying hadith, the manners {{in which they are}} transmitted, the transcription of hadith, and the etiquette of the narrator and of the student. The fourth category, which comprises 21 types, relates to the names of the narrators. This includes the definition of a ṣaḥābī (companion), a tābi`ī (follower), the time periods of narrators, names and paidonymics among others.|$|E
25|$|According to Fofana, {{historically}} (most) jurists {{agreed on}} the prohibition of riba from these verses and termed it riba al-nasia, distinguishing it from riba al-fadl — the exchange of like goods in different quantities at the same time, mentioned in a number <b>of</b> <b>narrations.</b>|$|R
50|$|The film pays {{homage to}} the life {{and the legacy of}} the African-American activist Malcolm X through a series <b>of</b> <b>narrations</b> and {{dramatic}} reenactments. The narrations are conducted by members of Malcolm X’s family, former aides, eyewitnesses, scholars of history, social analysts and quotations from Malcolm X’s autobiography.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether planning in writing tasks affects the fluency <b>of</b> written <b>narrations</b> or not. To do so, the researchers selected ninety EFL full time students from a population of one hundred and twenty through giving them SAT practice test. They were divided into three groups of thirty. These groups were assigned the same written task which was a narration based on six-picture series. It was inferred from the obtained results that the strategic group had outperformed the other groups as far as the fluency <b>of</b> <b>narrations</b> was concerned...|$|R
