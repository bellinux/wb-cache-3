5|$|Food {{politics}} are the political {{aspects of the}} production, control, regulation, inspection and distribution <b>of</b> <b>food.</b> The politics can {{be affected by the}} ethical, cultural, medical and environmental disputes concerning proper farming, agricultural and retailing methods and regulations. Food power {{is an integral part of}} the politics <b>of</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other sectors also {{attribute}} to the amounts <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste. The food industry produces large amounts <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste, with retailers alone generating 1,600,000 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste per year. Supermarkets particularly have been criticised for wasting items which are damaged or unsold (what the industry calls 'surplus food'), but that often remain edible. However, exact {{statistics for the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>food</b> wasted by supermarkets is mostly unavailable; although a few voluntarily release data on food waste, it is not required by law. Similarly, limited information is available on amounts generated by the agricultural sector. Before a reversal of European Union policy in 2008, which came into effect on 1 July 2009, misshaped or 'wonky' fruit and vegetables could not be sold by retailers and were required to be thrown away.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} proportion <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste {{is produced by}} the domestic household, which, in 2007, created 6,700,000 tonnes <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste. Potatoes, bread slices and apples are respectively the most wasted foods by quantity, while salads are thrown away in the greatest proportion. A majority of wasted food is avoidable, with the rest being divided almost equally by foods which are unavoidable (e.g. tea bags) and unavoidable due to preference (e.g. bread crusts) or cooking type (e.g. potato skins).|$|E

50|$|Variations in food composition: Foods are {{biological}} mixtures {{and as such}} show considerable {{variation in}} composition, particularly in respect of water and fat content. This means that compositional values quoted for representative samples <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> in food composition tables do not necessarily apply to individual samples <b>of</b> <b>foods.</b> In studies where great accuracy is required, samples <b>of</b> the <b>food</b> consumed must be analysed.|$|R

30|$|Respondents {{who thought}} about the high cost <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> were over 2 {{times more likely to}} have poor dietary {{practice}} than those who did not think about the high cost <b>of</b> <b>foods.</b> This result is in agreement with a study done on Iranian adults with diabetes which showed thinking about cost <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> as the most frequent barrier to the dietary practice among type 2 diabetic patients (Jazayeri and Pipelzadeh 2006). This commonly corresponds to the economic background. In clear terms, those who have economic constraints cannot have enough money to buy different types <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> to fulfill their daily requirements. Therefore, they will be forced to consume only some specific foods without choice and get exposed to poor self dietary management.|$|R
40|$|This paper gives a {{definition}} of 'nutrient profiling' and outlines the scope 'marketing <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> to children' and it's 'regulation' {{for the purposes of}} the paper. It then points out that nutrient profiling has many other purposes besides the regulation <b>of</b> marketing <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> to children. It briefly outlines the ideal process for developing a nutrient profile model and summarises how nutrient profiling models have been validated to date. It discusses how existing nutrient profiling models for the purpose of regulating the marketing <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> to children can be compared and it concludes that nutrient profiling has much potential but that there are several obstacles to overcome before an ideal model for regulating the marketing <b>of</b> <b>foods</b> can be agreed. © 2012...|$|R

5|$|Before the war, the Belgian {{government}} had planned an emergency system of rationing, which was implemented {{on the day}} of the German invasion. The German occupying authority used Belgium's reliance on food imports as a bargaining tool. The amount <b>of</b> <b>food</b> permitted to Belgian citizens was roughly two-thirds of that allowed to comparable German citizens and was amongst the lowest in occupied Europe. On average, scarcity <b>of</b> <b>food</b> led to a loss of five to seven kilograms of weight per Belgian in 1940 alone.|$|E

5|$|Common ravens nesting near {{sources of}} human garbage {{included}} {{a higher percentage}} <b>of</b> <b>food</b> waste in their diet, birds nesting near roads consumed more road-killed vertebrates, and those nesting far from these sources <b>of</b> <b>food</b> ate more arthropods and plant material. Fledging success was higher for those using human garbage as a food source. In contrast, a 1984–1986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of south-western Idaho found that cereal grains were the principal constituent of pellets, though small mammals, grasshoppers, cattle carrion and birds were also eaten.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian's {{primary concern}} was {{to place the}} {{provision}} <b>of</b> <b>food</b> supplies to the army on a rational and sustainable basis. To this end, the emperor {{put an end to}} the arbitrary exaction <b>of</b> <b>food</b> levies (indictiones) for the army, whose burden fell mainly on border provinces and which had ruined them economically. He instituted a system of regular annual indictiones ("tax levies") with the tax demanded set in advance for 5 years and related to the amount of cultivated land in each province, backed by a thorough empire-wide census of land, peasants and livestock. To deal with the problem of rural depopulation in some areas (and consequent loss <b>of</b> <b>food</b> production), he decreed that peasants, who had always been free to leave their land during the Principate, must never leave the locality in which they were registered by the census (legal term is 'origo'). This measure had the effect of legally tying tenant farmers (coloni) and their descendants to their landlords' estates.|$|E
