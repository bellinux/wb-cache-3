40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the anti-obesity effect and mechanism of action of Korean white ginseng extracts (KGE) using high-fat diet (HFD) -induced obese mice. Mice were fed a low-fat diet (LFD), HFD or HFD containing 0. 8 and 1. 6 % (w/w) KGE diet (HFD +  0. 8 KGE and HFD +  1. 6 KGE) for 8  weeks. We also {{examined the effects of}} KGE on plasma triglyceride (TG) elevation in mice administrated with <b>oral</b> lipid <b>emulsion.</b> Body weight gain and white adipose tissue (WAT) weight were significantly decreased in the HFD +  1. 6 KGE group, compared with the HFD group. The plasma TG levels were also significantly reduced in both HFD +  0. 8 KGE and HFD +  1. 6 KGE groups, while leptin levels were significantly decreased in only the HFD +  1. 6 KGE group, compared with the HFD group. The HFD +  1. 6 KGE group showed significantly lower mRNA levels of lipogenesis-related genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptorγ 2 (PPARγ 2), sterol regulatory element binding protein- 1 c (SREBP- 1 c), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), fatty acid synthase (FAS) and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT 1), compared with the HFD group. In addition, a dose of 1000  mg/kg KGE inhibited the elevation of plasma TG levels compared with mice given the lipid emulsion alone. These results suggest that the anti-obesity effects of KGE may be elicited by regulating expression of lipogenesis-related genes in WAT and by delaying intestinal fat absorption...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Propofol has {{negligible}} oral bioavailability in humans. It may {{be possible}} to administer systemic propofol with an oral transmucosal delivery system that bypasses hepatic first-pass metabolism. Background: Although propofol is only administered intravenously in the practice of anaesthesia, {{it has been suggested that}} alternative routes could be utilized, such as nebulized inhalation, transmucosal or upper gastrointestinal, or rectal. The hepatic extraction ratio of propofol is in the range of 0. 8 to 0. 9., Thus, the a priori expectation is that the oral bioavail-ability of propofol is no greater than 20 %, and plasma levels following oral ingestion should be very low. However, were propofol orally bioavailable in humans, there could be therapeutic utility for the treatment of epilepsy, migraine headache, chronic pain, pruritis, and nausea and vomiting. In this pilot study we evaluated bioavailability of orally administered 1 % propofol emulsion. Methods: With approval from the institutional research and ethics committee (School of Medicine, Clínica Alemana, Universidad del Desarrollo, Santiago, Chile), and after obtaining written informed consent, we enrolled six healthy male volunteers in this open label, unblinded pilot study. The first three volunteers received 20 mls of oral propofol 1 % (Fresenius Kabi). The second three volunteers received 40 mls of oral 1 % <b>oral</b> propofol <b>emulsion.</b> Venous blood samples were collected at 2, 4, 8, 16, 30 and 60 min after oral ingestion of propofol emulsion.

40|$|The oral {{residence}} time of low-viscosity emulsions, like milk, is relatively short. Despite this short {{residence time}}, people can easily perceive {{differences between these}} emulsions. Our research is dedicated to unravel the <b>oral</b> behaviour of <b>emulsions</b> in relation to sensory perception. The {{aim of this study}} is to thoroughly evaluate the sensory perception of low-viscosity emulsions in relation to a range of emulsion engineering control parameters. A standard, 10 % sunflower containing emulsion stabilised by whey protein isolate was modified with respect to fat type (sunflower oil, palm fat and milk fat), fat content (0 ¿ 40 %), droplet size and addition of guar gum or particles. Fat-related attributes, like creaminess, fattiness, satiation and coating after feel were affected by fat type, fat content and guar gum addition. Increasing fat content and/or replacing sunflower oil by solid fat, which melts around body temperature, were the most effective ways to increase fat and creamy perception of low-viscosity emulsions. Control of emulsion perception by varying droplet size in the range from 0. 5 to 6 ¿m did not affect fat-related attributes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{compare the}} tolerance, efficacy, and {{pharmacokinetics}} of amphotericin deoxycholate (Fungizone) prepared in a parenteral fat emulsion (Intralipid 20 %) or glucose in HIV patients with candidiasis. DESIGN [...] Non-blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING [...] University hospital; tertiary clinical care. PATIENTS [...] 22 HIV positive patients with oral candidiasis. INTERVENTIONS [...] Amphotericin 1 mg/kg/day given on four consecutive {{days as a}} one hour infusion dissolved in either 5 % glucose (amphotericin-glucose) or parenteral fat emulsion at a final concentration of 2 g/l fat emulsion (amphotericin-fat emulsion). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Clinical tolerance (fever, chills, sweats, nausea, arterial pressure, and pulse rate); biological tolerance (serum creatinine, electrolyte, and magnesium values); clinical score of candidiasis; and serum concentrations of amphotericin. RESULTS [...] 11 patients were enrolled in each group. All the amphotericin-fat emulsion infusions were given without serious problem whereas four amphotericin-glucose infusions were stopped because of renal impairment (n = 3) or severe chills (n = 2), or both. For patients completing the amphotericin-glucose treatment creatine concentration increased by 42 mumol/l; four of seven patients {{had at least one}} creatinine value > or = 133 mumol/l versus one of 11 receiving amphotericin-fat emulsion. Magnesium concentration fell significantly with amphotericin-glucose but not with amphotericin-fat emulsion. Clinical side effects were noted in 36 / 38 infusions with amphotericin-glucose but 10 / 44 with amphotericin-fat <b>emulsion.</b> <b>Oral</b> candidiasis score was reduced similarly in both groups. Serum amphotericin concentrations were significantly lower and the volume of distribution of the drug higher after infusion of amphotericin-fat emulsion than after amphotericin-glucose. CONCLUSIONS [...] Clinical and renal toxicity of amphotericin are reduced when the drug is prepared in fat emulsion. Preparation is simple and cost effective.

40|$|Perception of food {{emulsions}} {{can often}} not be {{directly related to}} the structure of the products before consumption. Taking into account the changing product structure upon oral processing might increase understanding of the relation between perception and product properties. This study aims to gain insight in the effect of saliva-induced flocculation on perception of emulsions at neutral pH. Whey protein (WPI) -stabilized emulsions flocculating in a reversible manner with saliva were compared with lysozyme-stabilized emulsions that irreversible flocculate with saliva. The main emulsion variables, besides the emulsifying protein, were oil content (2. 5 % oil vs 10 % oil), and the effect of emulsion thickening with guar gum (at 10 % oil). To relate perception to processes occurring in the <b>oral</b> cavity, the <b>emulsions</b> were characterized before and after oral processing with respect to morphology and rheological properties (viscosity, storage and loss moduli). In addition, insight in retention of emulsion droplets on the tongue surface was obtained by measuring emulsifier and oil content in tongue swabs. Saliva-induced emulsion flocculation clearly shows a large effect on perception of the here studied emulsions. WPI-stabilized emulsions showed little retention on the tongue surface and perception was characterized by creaminess, fattiness and thickness. Guar gum thickening further increased perception of these attributes. On the other hand, for lysozyme-stabilized emulsions perception was largely related to attributes like dryness, roughness and astringency. In addition, a large viscosity increase upon oral processing and clear retention of emulsion droplets on the tongue surface was observed. Guar gum thickening decreased the effects of irreversible flocculation, likely because of its lubricating properties and increased viscosity. Although the amount of mucins recovered from the tongue surface was unaffected by orally processing of lysozyme-stabilized emulsions, the sensory characteristics of these emulsions reminds one of astringency perception of e. g. tannins that precipitate salivary proteins...|$|R
40|$|Two in vitromodels {{were used}} to {{understand}} emulsion behavior and the subsequent formation of free fatty acids (FFA), monoglycerides (MG) and diglycerides (DG). Emulsions stabilized by whey protein isolate (WPI) or gum arabic (GA), varying in droplet size, were digested under intestinal conditions. Concentrations of FFA, MG and DG, assessed by gas chromatography, decreased with increasing droplet size. FFA release from gum arabic-stabilized emulsions was higher compared to WPI-stabilized emulsions showing an influence of the interface. Next, lipolysis of protein stabilized emulsions (i. e. WPI or lysozyme) {{and the influence of}} flocculation at the isoelectric point (pI) were investigated in a dynamic gastrointestinal model. The stomach properties including gradual acidification caused WPI-stabilized emulsions to cream during transition through the pI of the protein. This resulted in delayed intestinal lipolysis compared to the lysozyme-stabilized emulsion. Thus, since gastric passage affects emulsion behavior and intestinal lipolysis, the gastric passage should be part of digestion models. Next, in a human study emulsion behavior and resulting lipolytic products were related to the release of satiety hormones, satiety perception and ad libitumintake. Also, gallbladder volume and oral processing were studied. A delayed entry into the duodenum and lipolysis for the un-homogenized sample resulted in lower CCK, delayed GLP- 1 /PYY responses and barely gallbladder contraction compared to the homogenized emulsion. No difference was found between treatments on ghrelin, only the perception 'desire to eat´ was elevated for homogenized <b>emulsions.</b> <b>Oral</b> processing induced prolonged gallbladder contraction, but had no additive effect on other measures. A homogenous system as such is possibly not effective to induce pronounced satiety perceptions compared to phase separated or creamed systems using the same emulsifier. Moreover, the release of gastrointestinal hormones cannot directly be related to the satiating effect of food...|$|R
40|$|The 19 th Gums & Stabilisers for the Food Industry Conference: Hydrocolloid MultifunctionalityThis {{research}} {{seeks to}} better understand the food matrix microstructure that impacts on carotenoid bioaccessibility of two Brazilian native fruits Pitanga and Buriti while developing <b>emulsioned</b> <b>oral</b> delivery systems of its compounds. Buriti is a fruit produced by an Amazonia palm tree. Its pulp is very rich in β-carotene which is approximately 400 µg/g fresh weight 1. Pitanga originates from Atlantic forest and has high amounts of lycopene (approx. 71 µg/g in ripened fruit) 1. These hydrophobic plant pigments have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activity. However, these desired health benefits are limited by bioaccessibility aspects, mainly their physical location and structure in fresh fruits and its products 2. Emulsions have been largely studied as oral delivery systems for hydrophobic bioactives compounds such as β-carotene. Also, the concept of excipient foods is an innovation in food science and technology research 2. Buriti and Pitanga freeze dried pulps were submitted to the following experiments: 1) experimental design testing ultraturrax and ultrasound for carotene release; 2) emulsion formation by Tween 80 or Whey Protein Isolate at 1 % and 2 % surfactant concentration; 3) microstructure study of fresh pulps and emulsions. For carotene determination, it was applied a microscale extraction and HPLC-PDA analysis based on Porcu and Rodriguez-Amaya (2008) 3. Processed pulp and fruit emulsions microstructure was assessed by microscopy (brightfield, fluorescence and confocal), rheology and turbidity. Main results showed that ultrasound processing have more impact on tissue fragmentation, cell disruption and carotene release than ultraturrax (p< 0. 05) and is indispensable for fruit emulsion formation. Microscopy study clearly elucidate that most carotenes are entrapped inside cell walls and must be released for incorporation into lipid micelles. Ultraturrax (15000 rpm) and ultrasound (20 kHz, 40 % amplitude) treatment released up to 50 % of initial carotenoid. After emulsion formation, surfactant do not link only to the internal oil and external water, it also interacts with the carbohydrate from cell walls mainly cellulose that are in suspension – forming a gel-like structure – that was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. The obtained Buriti and Pitanga emulsions have high potential for the development new products with more bioaccessible β-carotene and lycopene. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
