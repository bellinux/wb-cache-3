40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, legislators and {{regulators}} have increasingly turned to disclosure schemes, rather than substantive regulation, to accomplish regulatory goals. Most of these schemes are either expressly or impliedly based on the disclosure-based regulatory system established by the securities acts, which is primarily intended to provide information to traders in an established market and thereby to enhance {{the operation of the}} market. A secondary purpose of the securities acts is to alter the behavior of firms and individuals through the operation of the market. <b>Other</b> <b>disclosure</b> schemes usually have similar purposes, but they rarely operate in a market akin to the financial markets. As a result, the mechanism by which the disclosure scheme is expected to accomplish its purpose is often obscure. Where there is a specified mechanism for the operation of the disclosure system, it often fails to take account of the way individuals and firms process and react to information. This Article examines the purposes and operation of both securities <b>disclosure</b> and <b>other</b> <b>disclosure</b> schemes and the limitations on the usefulness of disclosure as a regulatory method. The Article then describes criteria for the use and design of disclosure systems as regulatory tools that take into consideration realistic benefits and costs of the disclosure regime...|$|R

A “public winner-takes-all contest” dominates public contests—those where any success is immediately disclosed—with any other prize-sharing scheme as well as winner-takes-all contests with any <b>other</b> <b>disclosure</b> policy.

5000|$|The Securities Act of 1933 {{requires}} {{a company to}} register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In order to complete registration, the company must include audited financial statements and numerous <b>other</b> <b>disclosures.</b> If the registration statement was to be found materially misstated, both {{the company and its}} auditors may be held liable. Those who initially purchase a security offered for sale are the only ones protected by the 1933 Act. These security purchasers, known as the plaintiffs, only need to prove a loss was constant and that the registration statement was misleading. They do not need to prove that they relied upon the registration or that the auditors were negligent. In order for an auditor to avoid liability, they must provide proof that the audit was performed with due diligence, the plaintiff’s losses were not caused by misstated financial statements, the plaintiffs knew of the misstatement at the time the securities were purchased, or the statute of limitations had expired (one year after the discovery of the misstatement, but no more than three years after the security was offered to the public). [...] The due diligence defense is the defense that most auditors raise, even though it is difficult for auditors to prove their innocence.
