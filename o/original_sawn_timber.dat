The reason for this, according to Johan at Holmen Timber, is that transport costs account for a larger share of the value of goods for <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> than for pulp and paper. Railway transport implies huge costs associated with handling, making door-to-door transport by truck a more cost effective alternative.

50|$|The timber {{industry}} {{has been a significant}} part of Queensland's history as timber getters were among the first Europeans to live and work in the colony.

The small sawmill was opened in 1941 {{at a time when the}} Second World War demanded increased production of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> in Queensland. The continued success of the business is attributed to it responding to the changing demands for <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> in Queensland.|$|R
40|$|The main {{question}} asked {{of the work}} described in this thesis was howthe sawing of logs into <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> can be performed more efficientlywith respect to the choice of raw material, volume and value yield in thesawing and in the grading of the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> produced. The development of industrial computed tomography scanning providesinformation about the external and internal properties of a sawlogat production speed. This opens up new possibilities of controlling theflow of raw material early {{in the process and}} of optimizing the breakdownof each sawlog. Another use of industrial computed tomography scanningis for predicting the strength of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> better than is possible withcurrent visual and machine strength grading equipment. A more traditional way of increasing sawmill profitability is by increasingthe volume of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> One way of doing this is by reducing thesaw blade thickness which results in less sawdust. With the use of thinnersaw blades however there is a risk that the saw blades become misalignedwhich in turn leads to saw mismatch, an unevenness seen on the surfaceof the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> In this work, attempts were made to automaticallymeasure and monitor saw mismatch in a sawmill during ongoing production. It is also possible for a sawmill to increase its profitability by measuresnot related to the sawing process. One such example is customer adaptationwhen delivering the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> Different customers use the sawntimber for different purposes and consequently have different requirements,which is why the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> produced is graded and sorted before it isdelivered to the customer. In this work, an alternative method for gradingsawn timber more efficiently using a multivariate method was developedand evaluated. The following results have been obtained:Log breakdowns of 716 Scots pine logs and 750 Norway spruce logsthat had been scanned using computed tomography were simulated andthe rotational position of each log was optimized. The results showedan average relative value increase of 16 % for appearance graded sawntimber compared to the conventional horns down position. When simulating log breakdowns of 677 Norway spruce logs with respect to visuallystrength graded <b>sawn</b> <b>timber,</b> an average relative value increase of 11 %was obtained. The effect that errors in knot detection algorithms had ona breakdown optimization was also analysed when optimizing breakdownof 57 Norway spruce sawlogs. The results showed that errors in the knotdiameter had the most severe impact on the average relative value increaseof a log rotation optimization, followed by errors in the dead knot border. The smallest effect was observed in the case of errors in rotational positionof the knots. Computed tomography scanning can also be used in a sawmill for log sorting in relation to different end-uses of the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> A simulationsoftware for cross-cutting optimization based on computed tomographydata was developed and it was shown that there was a reasonable correlationbetween these results and the results of an industrial system. Sincethe developed software can be combined with log breakdown simulationsbased on computed tomography data, it is evident that computed tomographycan be used to identify logs that would result in a poor volume yieldin the subsequent cross-cut optimization. Destructive bending strength tests were performed on 113 pieces of Norway spruce <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> Multivariate models for predicting the bending strength of the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> were created using computed tomography data of the sawlogs from which the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> originated. The results showed that computed tomography scanning of logs produced prediction models of bending strength with a higher accuracy than discrete X-rayscanning. The main advantage was the detailed knot information {{that could be used in}} the prediction models. A method to measure saw mismatch automatically in a sawmill basedon laser triangulation was developed and the measurements were well correlatedwith manual measurements of saw mismatch. When laser triangulationwas used to measure saw mismatch in a sawmill, a distinguishabletrend of increasing magnitude and frequency of saw mismatch was observed. Finally, ways in which the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> in a sawmill could be gradedand sorted more efficiently was investigated. It was found that by using agrading method based on multivariate techniques it is possible to increasethe proportion of higher <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> grades by up to 10 percentage points,which may increase sawmill profitability.

40|$|This work {{describes}} deformation {{and crack}} formation in <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> of pine and spruce after first drying and subsequent cycles of resoaking {{in water and}} drying. The influence of annual ring orientation and the occurrence of juvenile wood was determined. In addition, the influence of compression wood, annual ring orientation {{at the edges of}} the cross section, the position of the board surface in relation to the pith, and the condition of the board surface i. e. whether wet or dry during resoaking were studied. When timber is exposed to repeated cycles of wetting and drying, warp, viz spring, bow, twist and cup, increases and is greater after the first cycle. The influence of annual ring orientation on spring, bow and twist depends on the type of deformation and on the kind of wood. Generally, the results indicated that timber with vertical and semi (half) vertical annual rings show less deformation (mean values) than plain <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> and timber containing pith. Cup is mainly caused by transverse anisotropy and is strongly influenced by the radius of the annual ring. Therefore, timber with vertical annual rings do not show any cup. Spring, twist and, especially bow are strongly influenced by compression wood. Large amount of compression wood in <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> increases such deformation. The distance between <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> in the log and the pith with surrounding juvenile wood is of vital significance for cracking. During moisture cycling, the amount of boards that develop cracks increased irrespective of their prior location in the cross section of the stem. <b>Timber</b> <b>sawn</b> from near the pith or distinctly containing pith has a higher relative crack length compared to <b>timber</b> <b>sawn</b> away from and lacking pith.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work {{described}} in this thesis was to develop techniques based on non-invasive measurements of logs and <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> that would increase the profitability of the wood industry in general and sawmills in particular. The work has two main focus areas: computed tomography (CT) scanning of logs and traceability of wood products. The first focus was on detecting knots in CT images of logs and {{to find ways to}} use the knot information efficiently. The result is an automated algorithm that can successfully detect knots in CT images of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Knots {{have a negative impact on}} the bending strength of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> and, since knots can be detected in CT images of logs, it is possible to adapt the sawing process to take into consideration where the knots are located. This thesis includes an investigation of the profitability gain for a sawmill producing strength-graded <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> of Norway spruce when detailed knot information from a CT scanner is used. The strategy was to optimize the log breakdown by rotating logs to an optimum position with respect to the sales value of the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> The investigation was carried out using computer simulations. The work also includes an investigation into how accurately the bending strength of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> can be predicted from information in CT images of the logs. Features and defects in the CT images were measured and key parameters were inserted into multivariate PLS regression models. The models were calibrated with data from destructive bending tests and, although the results were unclear, there were indications that the bending strength could be predicted with a higher accuracy using CT scanning than by using log scanning techniques that are currently common in the industry. The second focus area was fingerprint traceability of individual wood products, which is valuable for sawmills since it enables detailed process control. Diagnostics and process surveillance could be based on statistics for each individual piece of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> instead of on statistics at a batch level. Without an automatic recognition system for <b>sawn</b> <b>timber,</b> such studies would involve labor-intensive and possibly process-disruptive manual tests. The work includes the development of two wood surface recognition systems based on different techniques. One of them uses information about how knots are positioned in relation to each other to construct scale- and rotationally-invariant descriptors. The performance and robustness of this recognition system were tested on 212 edge-glued panel images of Scots pine with different noise levels. The other recognition system was specialized on <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> This particular method considerably reduces the resolution of the board images and matches them using template matching. Tests were performed by matching three sets of 88 board images to a database of 886 Scots pine boards. The recognition systems have different strengths and weaknesses due to their design, but both of them were fast and had high recognition rates in the tests carried out. Overall, the work led to several computerized methods that enable increases in profitability of sawmills. The proposed knot detection in CT images of logs enables detailed control of the log breakdown process, and the proposed fingerprint traceability methods permit process control based on individual pieces of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> Results from this thesis also give sawmill managers valuable information on how an industrial CT scanner would affect the profitability of their sawmills.
