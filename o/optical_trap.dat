25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Arthur Ashkin and Joseph M. Dziedzic {{demonstrated}} the first {{application of the}} technology to the biological sciences, using it to trap an individual tobacco mosaic virus and Escherichia coli bacterium. Throughout the 1990s and afterwards, researchers like Carlos Bustamante, James Spudich, and Steven Block pioneered the use of <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> force spectroscopy to characterize molecular-scale biological motors. These molecular motors are ubiquitous in biology, and are responsible for locomotion and mechanical action within the cell. Optical traps allowed these biophysicists to observe the forces and dynamics of nanoscale motors at the single-molecule level; <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> force-spectroscopy has since led to {{greater understanding of the}} stochastic nature of these force-generating molecules.|$|E
25|$|For {{quantitative}} scientific measurements, most optical traps are {{operated in}} such a way that the dielectric particle rarely moves far from the trap center. The reason for this is that the force applied to the particle is linear with respect to its displacement from the center of the trap as long as the displacement is small. In this way, an <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> can be compared to a simple spring, which follows Hooke's law.|$|E
500|$|The most {{striking}} {{outcomes of the}} analysis of Kinesin-5 motility {{is that it is}} slow – about 10 times slower than conventional Kinesin-1 – with a velocity in the range of 50 nanometers per second and that it could generate very high levels of mechanical force (7-9 picoNewtons per molecule). [...] These values come from three types of experimental data: microtubule gliding assays, single molecule motility assays, and <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> assays. In microtubule gliding assays, kinesins are attached to a glass surface and microtubules are laid down over the top. [...] Since the motors are attached to the glass, their motile behavior translates into movement of the microtubule across the anchored kinesins, akin to someone crowd surfing. [...] These experiments gave us the first analysis of Kinesin-5 motility. [...] By attaching microtubules to the glass surface first, then adding Kinesin-5 with free microtubules in solution, it was possible to adapt the microtubule gliding assays to show that Kinesin-5 can crosslink two microtubules and move them in opposite directions. [...] This experiment showed that Kinesin-5 was indeed capable of carrying out the role that had been proposed for it in mitosis – sliding oppositely oriented microtubules in the mitotic spindle. [...] To study the behavior of individual Kinesin-5 molecules, single molecule motility assays were performed by attaching microtubules to a glass surface, then adding a dilute solution of Kinesin-5 with a fluorophore attached. [...] This experimental setup enables the observer to follow separate Kinesin-5 molecules as they “walk” along the microtubule, providing not only information about velocity, but also about processivity – the ability of a kinesin to take multiple steps along the microtubule without dissociating. [...] In single molecule motility assays, velocities for Kinesin-5 were similar to those seen in microtubule gliding assays, and the motor was observed to be weakly processive. In <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> experiments, Kinesin-5 molecules are attached to a bead that can be held in place by a finely focused laser. [...] By moving the bead close to a microtubule, the kinesin can bind to the microtubule and begin stepping, pulling the bead along behind it. [...] Since the bead is being held in place by the trap laser, it acts like a spring and exerts a force that resists the forward movement of the kinesin. [...] This allows for the measurement of the stall force – the maximum amount of force that can be exerted by a motor before it releases from the microtubule. [...] <b>Optical</b> <b>trap</b> experiments showed that Kinesin-5 generates a maximum of 7 picoNewtons of force before releasing, but that its behavior differs from that of other kinesins in that there was no observable plateau phase in which the motor “struggles” at its maximal force generation before letting go. [...] Extrapolation of kinetic data suggests that the maximal observed force generated in the <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> by Kinesin-5 is actually an underestimate and that it theoretically can exert up to 9 picoNewtons of force as a maximum, although further experimental work is required to test this.|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} fiber <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> {{relies on}} the same principle as the optical trapping, but with the Gaussian laser beam delivered through an Optical fiber. If {{one end of the}} optical fiber is molded into a lens-like facet, the nearly gaussian beam carried by a single mode standard fiber will be focused at some distance from the fiber tip. The effective Numerical Aperture of such assembly is usually not enough to allow for a full 3D <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> [...] but only for a 2D trap (optical trapping and manipulation of objects will be possible only when, e.g., they are in contact with a surface [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|While {{earlier version}} of fiber-based laser traps {{exclusively}} used single mode beams, M. Kreysing and colleagues recently showed that the careful excitation of further optical modes in a short piece of optical fiber allows the realization of non-trivial trapping geometries. By this the researchers were able to orient various human cell types (individual cells and clusters) on a microscope. The main advantage of the so-called [...] "optical cell rotator" [...] technology over standard optical tweezers is the decoupling of trapping from imaging optics. This, its modular design, and the high compatibility of divergent laser traps with biological material indicates the great potential of this new generation of laser traps in medical research and life science. Recently, the optical cell rotator technology was implemented {{on the basis of}} adaptive optics, allowing to dynamically reconfigure the <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> during operation and adapt it to the sample.|$|E
2500|$|Expanding {{the beam}} emitted from the laser {{to fill the}} {{aperture}} of the objective {{will result in a}} tighter, diffraction-limited spot. While lateral translation of the trap relative to the sample can be accomplished by translation of the microscope slide, most tweezer setups have additional optics designed to translate the beam to give an extra degree of translational freedom. This can be done by translating the first of the two lenses labelled as [...] "Beam Steering" [...] in the figure. For example, translation of that lens in the lateral plane will result in a laterally deflected beam from what is drawn in the figure. If the distance between the beam steering lenses and the objective is chosen properly, this will correspond to a similar deflection before entering the objective and a resulting lateral translation in the sample plane. The position of the beam waist, that is the focus of the <b>optical</b> <b>trap,</b> can be adjusted by an axial displacement of the initial lens. Such an axial displacement causes the beam to diverge or converge slightly, the end result of which is an axially displaced position of the beam waist in the sample chamber.|$|E
40|$|Ultrashort pulsed lasers offer {{high peak}} powers at low average powers, making them ideal for {{maximising}} {{the efficiency of}} nonlinear excitation. Their broad bandwidths {{make it possible to}} tailor the pulse's temporal profile for advanced control of multiphoton excitation, techniques known as pulse shaping. This thesis represents the first combination of ultrashort pulse shaping with <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> and axicon dispersion compensation. We construct an <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> system which incorporates a 12 fs duration pulsed laser, the shortest duration used to date in <b>optical</b> <b>trapping.</b> To achieve 12 fs pulse durations at the sample, we must first eliminate temporal dispersion, which stretches and distorts pulses as they travel through microscope systems. We use the Multiphoton Intrapulse Interference Phase Scan (MIIPS) method to measure and compensate all orders of dispersion in our <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> system, verifying 12 - 13 fs pulses at the sample. We use the dispersion-compensated <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> system to investigate the effects of pulse duration on <b>optical</b> <b>trapping.</b> Our theoretical arguments show that trap stiffness is independent of pulse duration. For experimental verification, we measure the trap stiffness of trapped 780 nm silica spheres with back focal plane interferometry as we change pulse duration by more than an order of magnitude using quadratic pulse shaping. We find the trap stiffness unchanged within 9...|$|R

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the ends of}} the fiber are not moulded, the laser exiting the fiber will be {{diverging}} and thus a stable <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> can only be realised by balancing the gradient and the scattering force from two opposing ends of the fiber. The gradient force will trap the particles in the transverse direction, while the axial optical force comes from the scattering force of the two counter propagating beams emerging from the two fibers. The equilibrium z-position of such a trapped bead is where the two scattering forces equal each other. This work was pioneered by A. Constable et al., Opt. Lett. 18,1867 (1993), and followed by J.Guck et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 5451 (2000), who made use of this technique to stretch microparticles. By manipulating the input power into the two ends of the fiber, there will be an increase of a [...] "optical stretching" [...] {{that can be used to}} measure viscoelastic properties of cells, with sensitivity sufficient to distinguish between different individual cytoskeletal phenotypes. i.e. human erythrocytes and mouse fibroblasts. A recent test has seen great success in differentiating cancerous cells from non-cancerous ones from the two opposed, non-focused laser beams.|$|E
2500|$|As laser science needed good {{theoretical}} foundations, {{and also}} because research into these soon proved very fruitful, interest in quantum optics rose. Following the work of Dirac in quantum field theory, George Sudarshan, Roy J. Glauber, and Leonard Mandel applied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 1950s and 1960s to gain a more detailed understanding of photodetection and the statistics of light (see degree of coherence). This led {{to the introduction of}} the coherent state as a quantum description of laser light and the realization that some states of light could not be described with classical waves. In 1977, Kimble et al. demonstrated the first source of light which required a quantum description: a single atom that emitted one photon at a time. [...] Another quantum state of light with certain advantages over any classical state, squeezed light, was soon proposed. At the same time, development of short and ultrashort laser pulses—created by Q-switching and mode-locking techniques—opened the way to the study of unimaginably fast ("ultrafast") processes. Applications for solid state research (e.g. Raman spectroscopy) were found, and mechanical forces of light on matter were studied. The latter led to levitating and positioning clouds of atoms or even small biological samples in an <b>optical</b> <b>trap</b> or optical tweezers by laser beam. This, along with Doppler cooling was the crucial technology needed to achieve the celebrated Bose–Einstein condensation.|$|E

40|$|The {{vestibular}} system, which detects {{gravity and}} motion, {{is crucial to}} survival, but the neural circuits processing vestibular information remain incompletely characterised. In part, {{this is because the}} movement needed to stimulate the vestibular system hampers traditional neuroscientific methods. <b>Optical</b> <b>trapping</b> uses focussed light to apply forces to targeted objects, typically ranging from nanometres to a few microns across. In principle, <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> of the otoliths (ear stones) could produce fictive vestibular stimuli in a stationary animal. Here we use <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> in vivo to manipulate 55 -micron otoliths in larval zebrafish. Medial and lateral forces on the otoliths result in complementary corrective tail movements, and lateral forces on either otolith are sufficient to cause a rolling correction in both eyes. This confirms that <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> is sufficiently powerful and precise to move large objects in vivo, and sets the stage for the functional mapping of the resulting vestibular processing...|$|R

40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>trapping</b> and tweezing - the {{manipulation}} of particles using optical forces - enables direct interaction with biological samples and non-invasive monitoring of their properties. As such, <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> has become a common tool in biology with applications ranging from better understanding of DNA mechanics to non-invasive manipulation of red blood cells in vivo. While <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> using bulk optics is a well established technique, recent work has turned towards chip-based <b>optical</b> <b>trapping</b> using integrated devices. However, many of these integrated systems are fundamentally limited to passive demonstrations within microns of the chip surface. Integrated optical phased arrays, which manipulate and dynamically steer light, provide one possible approach to scaling and arbitrary tweezing of <b>optical</b> <b>traps.</b> However, current on-chip optical phased array demonstrations have focused on systems which form and steer beams or project arbitrary radiation patterns in the far field. In this thesis, Fresnel-lens-inspired focusing integrated optical phased arrays are demonstrated {{for the first time}} and proposed as a method for chip-based <b>optical</b> <b>trapping.</b> These systems focus radiated light to tightly-confined spots in the near field above the chip to enable applications in wide-angle trapping at millimeter scales. Furthermore, integrated optical phased arrays are proposed and demonstrated for the first time as a method for generating quasi-Bessel beams in a fully-integrated, compact-form-factor system. Through generation of quasi-Bessel beams with elongated properties, these devices have potential for applications in multi-particle, multi-plane <b>optical</b> <b>trapping.</b> To enable these phased array systems, a suite of integrated nanophotonic architectures and devices for waveguiding, coupling, routing, phase control, and radiation are developed, simulated, fabricated, and tested and a CMOS-compatible foundry platform is leveraged for natural scaling to active demonstrations. by Jelena Notaros.
