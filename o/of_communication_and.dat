5|$|The Empathic Civilization: The Race to Global Consciousness in a World in Crisis is a 2010 non-fiction {{book written}} by Jeremy Rifkin. It connects the {{evolution}} <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> energy development in civilizations with psychological {{and economic development}} in humans. Rifkin considers the latest phase <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> <b>and</b> energy regimes—that of electronic telecommunications and fossil fuel extraction—as bringing people together on the nation-state level based on democratic capitalism, {{but at the same}} time creating global problems, like climate change, pandemics, and nuclear proliferation. Rifkin extrapolates the observed trend into the future, predicting that Internet and mobile technology along with small-scale renewable energy commercialization will create an era of distributed capitalism necessary to manage the new energy regime and a heightened global empathy that can help solve global problems.|$|E

Poorer outcomes were related to {{lack of access to}} appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.|$|E
