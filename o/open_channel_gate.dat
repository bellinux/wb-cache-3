40|$|Two {{defining}} functional {{features of}} ion channels are ion selectivity and <b>channel</b> <b>gating.</b> Ion selectivity {{is generally considered}} an immutable property of the <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> structure, whereas <b>gating</b> involves transitions between <b>open</b> and closed <b>channel</b> states typically without changes in ion selectivity 1. In store-operated Ca 2 + release-activated Ca 2 + (CRAC) channels, the molecular mechanism of <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> by the CRAC channel activator, STIM 1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) remains unknown. CRAC channels are distinguished by an extraordinarily high Ca 2 + selectivity and are instrumental in generating sustained [Ca 2 +]i elevations necessary for gene expression and effector function in many eukaryotic cells 2. Here, we probed the central features of the STIM 1 gating mechanism in the CRAC channel protein, Orai 1, and identified V 102, a residue located in the extracellular region of the pore, {{as a candidate for}} the <b>channel</b> <b>gate.</b> Mutations at V 102 produced constitutively active CRAC <b>channels</b> that were <b>open</b> {{even in the absence of}} STIM 1.

40|$|Ion channels, {{like most}} other proteins, are {{designed}} to move. To preserve ionic gradients across cell membranes, they are usually closed and open their gates only when called upon to do electric work.

A singular feature of the ion channels underlying action potentials is that their gates are regulated by the voltage across the plasma membrane.

The positive or negative change in current with humidity pulse at zero-gate voltage was found to depend on the previous state of the gate electrode (positive or negative voltage, respectively). Those characteristics were explained by the charge traps in the gate dielectric altering the effective gate voltage, which influenced the operation of field effect transistor. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Voltage-gated proton {{channels}} are strongly inhibited by Zn 2 +, which binds to His residues. However, in a molecular model, the two externally accessible His are too far apart to coordinate Zn 2 +. We hypothesize that high-affinity Zn 2 + binding {{occurs at the}} dimer interface between pairs of His residues from both monomers. Consistent with this idea, Zn 2 + effects were weaker in monomeric channels. Mutation of His 193 and His 140 in various combinations and in tandem dimers revealed that channel opening was slowed by Zn 2 + only when at least one His was present in each monomer, suggesting that in wild-type (WT) HV 1, Zn 2 + binding between His of both monomers inhibits channel opening. In addition, monomeric <b>channels</b> <b>opened</b> exponentially, and dimeric <b>channels</b> <b>opened</b> sigmoidally. Monomeric <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> had weaker temperature dependence than dimeric channels. Finally, monomeric <b>channels</b> <b>opened</b> 6. 6 times faster than dimeric channels. Together, these observations suggest that in the proton channel dimer, the two monomers are closely apposed and interact during a cooperative gating process. Zn 2 + appears to slow opening by preventing movement of the monomers relative to each other that is prerequisite to opening. These data also suggest that the association of the monomers is tenuous and allows substantial freedom of movement. The data {{support the idea that}} native proton {{channels are}} dimeric. Finally, the idea that monomer–dimer interconversion occurs during activation of phagocytes appears to be ruled out...|$|R

Using the whole-cell recording technique, we demonstrated that NEFA inhibits NMDA responses with an IC 50 of 0. 51 μM at − 66 mV. We determined that NEFA binds to the <b>open</b> <b>channel,</b> and subsequently the channel can close and trap the blocker. Once the channel has closed, NEFA {{is unable to}} dissociate until the channel reopens. Single-channel recordings revealed that NEFA reduces the mean open time of single NMDA-activated channels in a concentration-dependent manner with a forward blocking rate (k+) of 39. 9 μM− 1 s− 1. A computational model of antagonism by NEFA was developed and constrained using kinetic measurements of single-channel data. By multiple criteria, only models in which blocker binding in the channel causes a change in receptor operation adequately fit or predicted whole-cell data. By comparing model predictions and experimental measurements of NEFA action at a high NMDA concentration, we determined that NEFA affects receptor operation through an influence on <b>channel</b> <b>gating.</b> We conclude that inhibition of NMDA receptors by PCP-like blockers involves a modification of <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> as well as block of current flow through the <b>open</b> <b>channel...</b>|$|R

40|$|Dehydrosoyasaponin-I (DHS-I) is {{a potent}} {{activator}} of high-conductance, calcium-activated potassium (maxi-K) channels. Interaction of DHS-I with maxi-K channels from bovine aortic smooth muscle was studied after incorporating single channels into planar lipid bilayers. Nanomolar amounts of intracellular DHS-I caused the appearance of discrete episodes of high <b>channel</b> <b>open</b> probability interrupted by periods of apparently normal activity. Statistical analysis of these periods revealed two clearly separable gating modes that likely reflect binding and unbinding of DHS-I. Kinetic analysis of durations of DHS-I-modified modes suggested DHS-I activates maxi-K channels through a high-order reaction. Average durations of DHS-I-modified modes increased with DHS-I concentration, and distributions of these mode durations contained two or more exponential components. In addition, dose-dependent increases in <b>channel</b> <b>open</b> probability from low initial values were high order with average Hill slopes of 2. 4 – 2. 9 under different conditions, suggesting at least three to four DHS-I molecules bind to maximally activate the channel. Changes in membrane potential over a 60 -mV range appeared to have little effect on DHS-I binding. DHS-I modified calcium- and voltage-dependent <b>channel</b> <b>gating.</b> 100 nM DHS-I caused a threefold decrease in concentration of calcium required to half maximally <b>open</b> <b>channels.</b> DHS-I shifted the midpoint voltage for channel opening to more hyperpolarized potentials with a maximum shift of − 105 mV. 100 nM DHS-I had a larger effect on voltage-dependent compared with calcium-dependent <b>channel</b> <b>gating,</b> suggesting DHS-I may differentiate these gating mechanisms. A model specifying four identical, noninteracting binding sites, where DHS-I binds to open conformations with 10 – 20 -fold higher affinity than to closed conformations, explained changes in voltage-dependent gating and DHS-I-induced modes.

Subunit stoichiometric studies of the Kir 1. 1 channel showed that a minimum of one functional subunit was required for the pH-dependent <b>gating</b> of the <b>channel.</b> Four subunits in this channel were coordinated as dynamic functional dimers. In Kir 6. 2 channel, stoichiometry for proton-binding was almost identical to that for <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> in the M 2 helix, suggesting a one-to-one direct coupling of proton binding in C-terminus to <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> in M 2 helix.

Mean open times and conductances of <b>channels</b> <b>gated</b> by H- or L-GlyRs {{were determined by}} noise analysis or voltage jumps. We found that adult H- and L-GlyRs <b>opened</b> <b>channels</b> that differed in their mean open time but had the same channel conductance. Both H- and L-GlyRs gated Cl- currents that displayed a similarly strong outward rectification. Nevertheless, single channels of adult H- and L-GlyRs did not rectify and their mean open times were only slightly altered by voltage. It follows that the outward rectification of adult GlyRs is due mainly {{to a reduction in}} the number of <b>open</b> <b>channels.</b> In contrast to H-GlyRs, whose characteristics seem to remain essentially unchanged with age, L-GlyRs from newborn and adult rats have different properties. Channels of newborn L-GlyRs have a higher conductance, longer open time, and greater voltage dependency than those from the adult. Interestingly, {{properties of}} newborn GlyRs expressed by whole mRNA were markedly different from those encoded by newborn or adult L or H mRNA. These results demonstrate that the functional heterogeneity of GlyRs is developmentally regulated...|$|R
40|$|Gating of K+ {{and other}} ion {{channels}} is 'hard-wired' within the channel protein. So {{it remains a}} puzzle how closely related channels in plants can show an unusually diverse range of biophysical properties. <b>Gating</b> of these <b>channels</b> {{lies at the heart}} of K+ mineral nutrition, signalling, abiotic and biotic stress responses in plants. Thus, our knowledge of the molecular mechanics underpinning K+ <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> will be important for rational engineering of related traits in agricultural crops. Several key studies have added significantly to our understanding of <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> in plants and have challenged current thinking about analogous processes found in animal K+ channels. Such studies highlight how much of K+ <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> remains to be explored in plant...|$|R
40|$|EAAT {{glutamate}} transporters do {{not only}} function as secondary-active glutamate transporters {{but also as}} anion channels. EAAT anion channel activity depends on transport substrates. For most isoforms, it is negligible without external Na+ and increased by external glutamate. We here investigated gating of EAAT 4 anion channels with various cations and amino acid substrates using patch clamp experiments on a mammalian cell line. We demonstrate that Li+ can substitute for Na+ in supporting substrate-activated anion currents, albeit with changed voltage dependence. Anion currents were recorded in glutamate, aspartate, and cysteine, and distinct time and voltage dependences were observed. For each substrate, gating was different in external Na+ or Li+. All features of voltage-dependent and substrate-specific anion <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> can be described by a simplified nine-state model of the transport cycle in which only amino acid substrate-bound states assume high anion <b>channel</b> <b>open</b> probabilities. The kinetic scheme suggests that the substrate dependence of <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> is exclusively caused by differences in substrate association and translocation. Moreover, the voltage dependence of anion <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> arises predominantly from electrogenic cation binding and membrane translocation of the transporter. We conclude that all voltage- and substrate-dependent conformational changes of the EAAT 4 anion channel are linked to transitions within the transport cycle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} {{mechanism}} by which Hanatoxin (HaTx) inhibits the drk 1 voltage-gated K+ channel. HaTx inhibits the K+ channel by shifting channel opening to more depolarized voltages. <b>Channels</b> <b>opened</b> by strong depolarization {{in the presence of}} HaTx deactivate much faster upon repolarization, indicating that toxin bound <b>channels</b> can <b>open.</b> Thus, HaTx inhibits the drk 1 K+ channel, not by physically occluding the ion conduction pore, but by modifying <b>channel</b> <b>gating.</b> Occupancy of the channel by HaTx was studied using various strength depolarizations. The concentration dependence for equilibrium occupancy as well as the kinetics of onset and recovery from inhibition indicate that multiple HaTx molecules can simultaneously bind to a single K+ channel. These results are consistent with a simple model in which HaTx binds {{to the surface of the}} drk 1 K+ channel at four equivalent sites and alters the energetics of <b>channel</b> <b>gating...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mechanosensitive <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} to occur via two models: the bilayer model, whereby forces generated within the lipid bilayer serve to <b>gate</b> the mechanosensitive <b>channel,</b> and the tethered model, whereby cytoskeletal tension {{plays a role in}} mechanosensitive <b>channel</b> <b>gating.</b> With respect to stretch-inactivated mechanosensitive channels in supraoptic neurons that are important in osmoreception, it is unclear which model prevails. To determine if the tethered model, and therefore the cytoskeleton, plays a role in mechanosensitive <b>channel</b> <b>gating,</b> neurons were subjected to drugs that function to depolymerize (Cytochalasin D; CytD) or stabilize (Jasplakinolide; Jasp) the actin cytoskeleton. A mechanosensitivity index was calculated in control, CytD and Jasp conditions by performing whole cell voltage clamp recordings on acutely isolated supraoptic neurons (magnocellular neurosecretory cells; MNCs) from adult Long Evans rats. Conductance and volume data revealed that cells treated in Cytochalasin D possessed a decreased mechanosensitivity compared to control, whereas cells treated with Jasplakinolide possessed an increased mechanosensitivity. The results provide evidence that actin is involved in mechanosensitive <b>channel</b> <b>gating</b> in supraoptic neurons and suggest that mechanosensitive gating occurs via the tethered model...|$|R
40|$|MscL, a {{bacterial}} mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, {{is the first}} structurally characterized mechanosensor protein. Molecular models of its gating mechanisms are tested here. Disulfide crosslinking shows that M 1 transmembrane alpha-helices in MscL of resting Escherichia coli are arranged similarly {{to those in the}} crystal structure of MscL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. An expanded conformation was trapped in osmotically shocked cells by the specific bridging between Cys 20 and Cys 36 of adjacent M 1 helices. These bridges stabilized the <b>open</b> <b>channel.</b> Disulfide bonds engineered between the M 1 and M 2 helices of adjacent subunits (Cys 32 -Cys 81) do not prevent <b>channel</b> <b>gating.</b> These findings support gating models in which interactions between M 1 and M 2 of adjacent subunits remain unaltered while their tilts simultaneously increase. The MscL barrel, therefore, undergoes a large concerted iris-like expansion and flattening when perturbed by membrane tension...|$|R
