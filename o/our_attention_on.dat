We feel assured that your lordship's approbation will prove a stimulus to our future exertions, and that next Christmas (with God's blessing) will find us much further advanced, not only in our secular studies, but in the great study you so strongly recommended to <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> your late visit, namely - 'the study of God's laws {{and those of the}} Church.' We conclude, begging your lordship's apostolic benediction, and wishing you a merry Christmas and many happy New Years. Signed on behalf of the pupils of St Peter's School. Laurence Lorigan.|$|E
25|$|We {{know that}} our {{consciousness}} inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually {{are not aware of}} the breathing of our lungs or the beating of our heart unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our kidneys command <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our liver is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.|$|E

60|$|The plants which {{attracted}} <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> {{this mountain}} were the mountain cinquefoil, abundant and in bloom {{still at the}} very base by the waterside, very beautiful harebells overhanging the precipice, bearberry, the Canada blueberry, wild holly, the great round-leafed orchis, bunchberry, reddening as we ascended, green {{at the base of}} the mountain, red at the top, and the small fern Woodsia ilvensis, growing in tufts, now in fruit. Having explored the wonders of the mountain, and the weather being now cleared up, we commenced the descent. We met the Indian, puffing and panting, about one third of the way up, but thinking that he must be near the top.

60|$|When we {{have dealt}} with {{subjects}} which lie outside our own island, let us concentrate <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> what lies within it, because the gravest problems lie at home. I shall venture to-night {{to make a few}} general observations upon those larger trendings of events which govern the incidents and the accidents of the hour. The fortunes and the interests of Liberalism and Labour are inseparably interwoven; they rise by the same forces, and in spite of similar obstacles, they face the same enemies, they are affected by the same dangers, and the history of the last thirty years shows quite clearly that their power of influencing public affairs and of commanding national attention fluctuate together. Together they are elevated, together they are depressed, and any Tory reaction which swept the Liberal Party out of power would assuredly work at least proportionate havoc in the ranks of Labour. That may not be a very palatable truth, but it is a truth none the less.|$|E
60|$|We thus {{see that}} close {{attention}} certainly affects various parts and organs, {{which are not}} properly {{under the control of}} the will. By what means attention--perhaps the most wonderful of all the wondrous powers of the mind--is effected, is an extremely obscure subject. According to Muller,[44] the process by which the sensory cells of the brain are rendered, through the will, susceptible of receiving more intense and distinct impressions, is closely analogous to that by which the motor cells are excited to send nerve-force to the voluntary muscles. There are many points of analogy in the action of the sensory and motor nerve-cells; for instance, the familiar fact that close attention to any one sense causes fatigue, like the prolonged exertion of any one muscle.[45] When therefore we voluntarily concentrate <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> any part of the body, the cells of the brain which receive impressions or sensations from that part are, it is probable, in some unknown manner stimulated into activity. This may account, without any local change in the part to which our attention is earnestly directed, for pain or odd sensations being there felt or increased.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{molten salts}} are {{becoming}} more and more popular with electricity generation and other industries which need molten salts as thermal energy storages, <b>our</b> <b>attentions</b> <b>on</b> molten salts’ thermophysics properties are increasing every year. Thermal conductivity is a key parameter when designing apparatus applied in related industries. Although there are some researchers studying the thermal conductivity of molten salts for years, few can measure it accurately. Most of them measure the thermal conductivity of molten salts by steady-state concentric cylinder method because the method is simpler and easier to design and carry out. In this paper, the steady-state concentric cylinder method for determining thermal conductivity of sodium nitrate is simulated with pure conduction condition and natural convection is considered later. The influence of natural convection on molten salt heat transfer is discussed at last...|$|R

"Destiny, {{which has}} lately riveted <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the burning plains {{of the extreme}} East," [...] says the Times of 9th July, [...] "now claims our solicitude for the auriferous {{mountains}} and rushing rivers of the Far West and {{the shores of the}} remote Pacific. What most of us know of these ultra-occidental regions may be summed up in a very few words. We have most of us read Washington Irving's charming narrative of `Astoria,' sympathised with the untimely fate of Captain Thorn and his crew, and read with breathless interest the wanderings of the pilgrims to the head waters of the Columbia. After thirty years, the curtain rises again on the stormy period of the Ashburton Treaty, when the `patriots' were bent upon `whipping the Britishers' out of every acre of land on the western side of the Rocky Mountains. And now, for the third time, we are recalled to the same territory, no longer as the goal of the adventurous trader or the battle ground of the political agitator, but as a land of promise--a new El Dorado, to which men are rushing with all the avidity that the presence of the one, thing which all men, in all times and in all places, insatiably desire is sure to create." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, if we set aside, for the present, ecclesiastical miracles, and {{judicial}} witchcraft, and fix <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> such minor and useless marvels as clairvoyance, 'ghosts,' unexplained noises, unexplained movements of objects, one doubts whether the general opinion {{as to the}} ratio of marvels and ignorance is correct. The truth {{is that we have}} often very scanty evidence. If we take Athens in her lustre, we are, undeniably, in an age of enlightenment, of the Aufklarung. No rationalistic, philosophical, cool-headed contemporary of Middleton, of Hume, of Voltaire, could speak more contemptuously about ghosts, and about the immortality of the soul, than some of the Athenian gentlemen who converse with Socrates in the Dialogues. Yet we find that Socrates and Plato, men as well educated, as familiar with the refined enlightenment of Athens as the others, take to some extent the side of the old wives with their fables, and believe in earth-bound spirits of the dead. Again, the clear-headed Socrates, one of the pioneers of logic, credits himself with 'premonitions,' apparently with clairvoyance, and assuredly with warnings which, in the then existing state of psychology, he could only regard as 'spiritual'. Hence we must infer that belief, or disbelief, does not depend on education, enlightenment, pure reason, but on personal character and genius. The same proportionate distribution of these is likely to recur in any age.|$|E
60|$|To give another, and, in some respects, more {{appropriate}} illustration. If a man stands before a hot fire, his face reddens. This {{appears to be}} due, as Mr. Michael Foster informs me, {{in part to the}} local action of the heat, and in part to a reflex action from the vaso-motor centres.[46] In this latter case, the heat affects the nerves of the face; these transmit an impression to the sensory cells of the brain, which act on the vaso-motor centre, and this reacts on the small arteries of the face, relaxing them and allowing them to become filled with blood. Here, again, it seems not improbable that if we were repeatedly to concentrate with great earnestness <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> the recollection of our heated faces, the same part of the sensorium which gives us the consciousness of actual heat would be in some slight degree stimulated, and would in consequence tend to transmit some nerve-force to the vaso-motor centres, so as to relax the capillaries of the face. Now as men during endless generations have had their attention often and earnestly directed to their personal appearance, and especially to their faces, any incipient tendency in the facial capillaries to be thus affected will have become in the course of time greatly strengthened through the principles just referred to, namely, nerve-force passing readily along accustomed channels, and inherited habit. Thus, as it appears to me, a plausible explanation is afforded of the leading phenomena connected with the act of blushing.|$|E
