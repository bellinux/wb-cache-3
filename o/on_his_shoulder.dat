5|$|Washington was a {{lover of}} exotic animals, as well as gardening. He {{maintained}} extensive menageries on his country properties, first at Bellport, and later at Mendham. On Long Island, it is reported that he was often seen with a bird or monkey <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> At both his menageries, Washington specialized in rare birds, but such animals as deer, sheep, goats, and antelope are also recorded at Bellport, and deer, llamas, and zebras are recorded {{among the hundreds of}} animals in the larger space at Mendham. Socially, he was {{an active member of the}} Lotos Club, a literary gentlemen's club in New York City.|$|E
5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} in {{the athletic}} competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> and a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, {{holding on to the}} rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.|$|E
5|$|On December 18, 1993, Taylor {{was injured}} while {{defending}} his brother Brenden in a fistfight. The New York Times reported that Brenden confronted {{a man named}} Ron Wilson, who he had fought with in Harlowe, North Carolina. Brenden suffered head lacerations in his fight with Wilson. Once Brien found out his brother had been hurt, he and a cousin went to Wilson's trailer home to confront him. There, Taylor got into an altercation with Jamie Morris, Wilson's friend, and Taylor fell <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> According to Wilson, Taylor attempted to throw a haymaker at Morris, and missed, which caused the injury. In the hours following the altercation Boras told reporters the injury was a bruise. However, when the Yankees had Taylor visit Dr. Frank Jobe, he called the injury {{one of the worst}} he'd seen. The following week, Jobe repaired a torn capsule and a torn glenoid labrum in Taylor's shoulder, which caused him to miss the 1994 season.|$|E

5|$|Operation Barbarossa, the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, began on 22June 1941. On the same day, the Ustaše began arresting communists and their known sympathisers in the towns of Bosanska Krajina, including Prijedor. The communists had predicted this, {{and most of them}} avoided capture by escaping to the villages or hiding in the towns. Stojanović {{was one of the few}} communists arrested in Prijedor. He was imprisoned with the Serb hostages on the second floor of a school in the town. They were subjected to forced labour, being led each morning through the town to repair the road to Kozarac. The column of hostages was usually headed by Stojanović carrying a shovel <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder.</b> The Croatian Home Guards guarding the prison treated him well. While detained, Stojanović lectured a group of hostages about Marxism.|$|E
5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. In many regions it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E
5|$|On the Packers' first drive, Rodgers {{failed to}} {{recognize}} the Bears' zone defense, having expected a man-to-man defense, and Shea McClellin escaped Don Barclay's block and, along with Isaiah Frey, pulled Rodgers down, who landed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> and injured his left collarbone, {{and was replaced by}} Seneca Wallace {{for the remainder of the}} game. Afterwards, Mason Crosby kicked the 30-yard field goal to give the Packers the lead. On Chicago's first drive, McCown escaped pressure from Mike Neal and threw towards Brandon Marshall for the 7–3 lead. Once the Packers got the ball back, Wallace's pass for Jordy Nelson was tipped and intercepted by Julius Peppers, and was returned 14 yards to Green Bay's 45-yard line, but after the Bears failed to convert on third down, Adam Podlesh's punt was blocked by Jamari Lattimore. Eventually, James Starks ran 32 yards for the touchdown. However, the Bears traveled 60 yards on two plays, and Forté scored on the 1-yard run. The Bears ended the first half with Robbie Gould's 24-yard field goal to expand the lead to 17–10. In the third quarter, the Packers forced the Bears to punt, and Lacy ran 56 yards to the Bears' 1, and scored on the ensuing play. On the eventual kickoff, the Packers successfully attempted a surprise onside kick, which was recovered by Lattimore. Crosby kicked a 23-yarder on the drive. On the Bears' next drive, McCown threw a six-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery, whose size kept the ball from being knocked away by Davon House. After both teams exchanged punts in the fourth quarter, on the Bears' next drive, began attempting to run out the clock. On 4th and 1 at the Bears' 32 with 7:50 remaining, Forté ran three yards for the conversion and continuing the drive, which ended with Gould's 27-yard field goal. The drive lasted 18 plays and took up 8:58, leaving only 50 seconds remaining in the game. Despite a 15-yard pass by Wallace to Nelson, sacks by Corey Wootton and McClellin ended the game with a 27–20 victory for the Bears.|$|E

25|$|Because St. Christopher offered {{protection}} to travelers and against sudden death, many churches placed images or statues of him, usually opposite the south door, {{so he could}} be easily seen. He is usually depicted as a giant of a man, with a child <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoulder</b> and a staff in one hand. In England, there are more wall paintings of St. Christopher than of any other saint; in 1904, Mrs. Collier, writing for the British Archaeological Association, reported 183 paintings, statues, and other representations of the saint, outnumbering all others except for the Virgin Mary.|$|E
