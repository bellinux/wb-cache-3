40|$|International audienceSouth-Bauchi West (SBW) {{languages}} build a dialect continuum {{spoken in}} Northern Nigeria {{that has been}} classified as West-Chadic B. Their internal classification reveals a split between two subgroups: the northern subgroup (Geji, Polci) and the southern subgroup (Zeem, Dass, Saya). This genetic split is completed by a grammatical heterogeneity that surfaces in the morphological complexity of the Saya cluster, {{a subset of the}} Southern sub-group. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) see if these differences are corroborated by the study of number; (ii) shed new lights on the genesis of SBW. To that effect, the first section presents an overview of SBW grammatical structure and genetic classification. The following two sections study number in Noun Phrases (noun plurals, modifiers), and in Verb Phrases (imperatives, pluractionals, and plural suffixes). The last section examines the relationship in SBW between number and related categories such as honorifics, associatives and singulatives. The conclusion introduces some nuances in this vision of a division between the northern and southern sub-groups, with the Dass cluster (e. g. Zoɗi) behaving like the Northern languages in that they share the same absence of nominal and adjectival plurals and pluractional derivation. The presence of those plurals in {{the other members of the}} southern sub-group (i. e. the Zeem and Saya clusters) seems to be an innovation departing from a situation where number is expressed only by the personal pronouns, the modifiers within the nominal system, and the imperative. Pluractionals, although they are widespread in many Chadic languages, seem to be an innovation of Zeem and Saya as well. These innovative features may have developed through the influence of plateau languages. The innovation has gone one step further in the Zaar language with the <b>optional</b> <b>marking</b> of number on noun modifiers. Finally, a marginal case of subject-verb plural agreement on the right periphery has appeared in four languages (Zaranda, Geji, Pelu and Diir), first in the 2 nd plural, and then has spread to the 3 rd plural in one of the languages (Pelu) ...|$|E

40|$|The present work is an {{investigation}} of the function of sentence intonation in Swedish for conveying information of various kinds: semantic-syntactic (distinguishing. declarative and interrogatory yes/no sentences), stylistic (on the character of the speech situation), and dialectal information (on the regional background of the speakers). Finally the properties of the sentence intonation of individual speakers have been studied. The investigation is based on an acoustic analysis of recorded speech supplemented by other experiments involving perceptual tests in which specimens of natural speech, low pass filtered speech, and synthetic speech were presented to listeners. In the acoustic experiments five fundamental pitch parameters were investigated. The significance of these parameters for the listeners was tested in the perceptual experiments. The most evident difference between declarative and interrogatory intonation is in the marking of the frequency dominance manifested by certain properties of the features corresponding to the pitch parameters. The weak (negative) marking in declarative sentences implies a relatively low average and low peak value of pitch, an early position of the pitch peak in the sentence, and a relatively fast slope of the pitch. The contrasting strong (positive) marking in interrogatory sentences is characterized by the opposite properties. The marking of these features is in some cases optional. In speech delivered in situations when the pitch contour was one of very few or the only channel of information, e. g. in lists of read sentences, the intonation types are distinguished more clearly than when several channels were working, e. g. in spontaneous conversations. As far as dialectal information is concerned there is a tendency among speakers from the southern parts of Sweden to use a higher average level and greater variations of pitch than in Northern Sweden. In order to estimate the influence of particular vowels on the sentence intonation their inherent pitch was investigated. It was shown that, although there is a considerable variation in the inherent pitch of vowels, the influence of the inherent pitch on sentence intonation is neutralized in speech with a normal variation of vowels. The result of the investigation has been summarized in a model for the production of sentence intonation of Swedish. It contains process steps with obligatory or <b>optional</b> <b>marking</b> of the pitch contour features. digitalisering@um...|$|E

40|$|Matéq is an Austronesian {{language}} of the Land Dayak (Bidayuhic) subgroup spoken by around 10, 000 – 20, 000 people in West Kalimantan (Borneo), Indonesia. This thesis presents a sketch grammar of the language based on linguistic fieldwork conducted from September 2012 to January 2013. Topics discussed in the sketch grammar include the geographic and social context of the Matéq language, its phonology and elements of its morphosyntax. Major features of Matéq phonology include the presence of both plain and prenasalised plosives, geminate nasals, and nasal vowels that contrast with oral vowels in certain positions. In terms of morphosyntax, this study shows that Matéq has two sets of personal pronouns which encode information about the generational relationships between speech participants or referents. With respect to grammatical voice, findings suggest that Matéq has five distinct voice constructions which can be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their morphosyntactic and semantic properties. Each voice construction also tends to have different pragmatic and TAM associations. This study also shows that Matéq has <b>optional</b> subject <b>marking</b> with certain verbs, and has both continuous and discontinuous serial verb constructions...|$|R

The system is an extension of ditroff/ffortid that is already capable of handling Hebrew in the context of multilingual scientific documents. ditroff/ffortid itself is a collection of pre- and postprocessors for the UNIX ditroff (Device Independent Typesetter RunOFF) formatter. The new system is built without changing ditroff itself. The extension consists of a new preprocessor, fonts, and a modified existing postprocessor. The preprocessor transliterates from a phonetic rendition of Arabic using only the two cases of the Latin alphabet. The preprocessor assigns a position, stand-alone, connectedprevious, connected-after, or connected-both, to each letter. It recognizes ligatures and assigns vertical positions to the <b>optional</b> diacritical <b>marks.</b> The preprocessor also permits input from a standard Arabic keyboard using the standard ASMO encoding.

40|$|The {{identity}} of the suffix men in Mandarin Chinese has long been debated but is still controversial. Chinese grammars usually introduce it as a plural marker and/or a collectivity marker without distinguishing the two. The issue was not addressed until Iljic (1994) and Li (1999) offered a unified analysis for men as a pure collectivity marker and a pure plural marker respectively. However, their argumentation is not flawless or very convincing. What’s more, linguists working on men are prone to give it other interpretations, {{one of which is}} definiteness. Such an interpretation is beyond the realm of number morphology, yet there is no systematic or satisfactory account for it. Looking into languages with <b>optional</b> plural <b>marking,</b> I find that those plural markers often play more than one role. Not only they are claimed to be definite markers, but they could also be specificity marker, collectivity marker and maybe are more comparible with a large/imprecise number quantifier. In addition, men shares some other features with these optional markers; they usually attach to common human nouns and proper names, they cannot co-occur with number (+ CL), etc. These similarities motivate me to do a typological study among languages with <b>optional</b> plural <b>marking</b> and compare men with other plural markers. In the paper I selected Japanese, Indonesian and Papiamentu and analyzed some alleged interpretations for their optional plural markers/marking morphemes. For each of the arguments I tried to apply it to men in Mandarin. I also conducted some corpus study, web search and a survey to gain enough empirical data supporting my intuitions and findings. The results show that although men seems to have some optional interpretations other than a plural marker, none of them is significantly strong enough or can be theoretically accounted for. The definite reading of most men-plurals is not brought about by men but possibly by the topic status of the nominal or by the nature of a human noun to which men attaches. Men can co-occur with expressions indicating distributivity such as yi ge jie yi ge ‘one by one’ and ge ‘each’, implying that it is not inherently collective. Native speakers sometimes are more tolerant towards men with a larger/ imprecise number, but the difference is not significantly large. And there is evidence arguing against a specificity analysis for men-plurals. With all these data and argumentation, I conclude eventually that men in Mandarin Chinese {{is no more than a}} plural marker...|$|R
