The APCs had also been redeployed to cover the south-east ridge and the southern approach from Trang Bom. The communist assault commenced just before midnight on 19 February, this time focussing on the south-east, and was preceded by heavy machine-gun fire. The attack was stopped short <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire,</b> regardless the forward pits were hit by rifle grenades, while the Assault Pioneer positions were attacked with satchel charges.

5|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{the police}} characters from other television detectives, Simon {{makes the point}} that even the best police <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, The Wire does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.|$|E

5|$|Playwright and {{television}} writer/producer Eric Overmyer joined the crew <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> in the show's fourth {{season as a}} consulting producer and writer. He had also previously worked on Homicide. Overmyer was brought into the full-time production staff to replace Pelecanos who scaled back his involvement to concentrate on his next book and worked on the fourth season solely as a writer. Primetime Emmy Award winner, Homicide and The Corner, writer and college friend of Simon, David Mills also joined the writing staff in the fourth season.|$|E
5|$|Many {{important}} events occur off-camera {{and there is}} no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one {{at the end of the}} pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows. Each season <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wire</b> consists of between ten and thirteen episodes which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.|$|E

40|$|We use aberration-corrected {{transmission}} {{electron microscopy}} to track the real time atomic level torsional dynamics of subnanometer wires of MoS interconnecting monolayer regions of MoS 2. An in situ heating holder is used inside the transmission electron microscope to raise <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sample to 400 °C to increase crystallization rates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> and reduce contamination effects. Frequent rotational twisting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MoS <b>wire</b> is captured, demonstrating elastic torsional deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MoS <b>wires.</b> We show that torsional rotations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crystal structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MoS <b>wires</b> depend upon <b>the</b> specific atomic structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anchored sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suspended <b>wire</b> and <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> unit cells that make up <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> length. Elastic torsional flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MoS <b>wires</b> is revealed to help their self-adapting connectivity during the structural changes. Plastic torsional deformation is also seen for MoS wires that contain defects in their crystal structure, which produce small scale rotational disorder within <b>the</b> <b>wires.</b> Upon removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defects, <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> returns back to pristine form.

5|$|The {{land where}} the Glidden House stands once held a log structure, which Glidden lived {{in when he}} first came to DeKalb at the beckoning of his cousin Russell Huntley. The house was built in 1861 for barbed wire {{entrepreneur}} Joseph Farwell Glidden. As his personal residence, the house, and its accompanying barn, were closely associated with his invention, really just an improvement, of barbed wire. Glidden's improvement upon a wire board fence developed by Henry Rose was of vast importance in the settlement of the United States west of the Mississippi. It was after Glidden saw Rose exhibit his wire at a fair in 1873 that he was struck with the idea of attaching barbs to wire strand fencing. Glidden is said to have experimented with some of his ideas in the basement kitchen of the Glidden House. He noticed that whenever he tried to attach s directly to strands of wire they slid {{along the length of the}} wire; Glidden realized he needed a way to crimp the barbs. He began tinkering around the home's kitchen. Glidden fit two hair pins to the shaft of a coffee mill, one centered and the other off-center. He found that by placing the wire between the pins and turning the crank a uniform barb resulted. How to crimp the barbs to the wire was solved, in the barn, by tying one end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> and another length of wire to a poplar tree on the grounds of the Glidden House and the other ends of the wires to a grindstone. The grindstone was used to twist the wires together and prevent the barbs from slipping.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
25|$|The {{two large}} balls were {{positioned}} on alternate {{sides of the}} horizontal wooden arm of the balance. Their mutual attraction to the small balls caused the arm to rotate, twisting the wire supporting the arm. The arm stopped rotating when it reached an angle where the twisting force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> balanced the combined gravitational force of attraction between the large and small lead spheres. By measuring {{the angle of the}} rod and knowing the twisting force (torque) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> for a given angle, Cavendish was able to determine the force between the pairs of masses. Since the gravitational force of the Earth on the small ball could be measured directly by weighing it, the ratio of the two forces allowed the density of the Earth to be calculated, using Newton's law of gravitation.|$|E

25|$|AWG gauges {{are also}} used to {{describe}} stranded wire.

25|$|Electromagnetic waves {{which have}} a {{component}} of their electric fields aligned parallel to the wires will induce the movement of electrons {{along the length of}} the wires. Since the electrons are free to move in this direction, the polarizer behaves in a similar manner to the surface of a metal when reflecting light, and the wave is reflected backwards along the incident beam (minus a small amount of energy lost to Joule heating <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire).</b>|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{recovery}} stress <b>of</b> martensitic shape-memory alloy [SMA] wires {{can be used}} {{to confine}} concrete, and <b>the</b> confining effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SMA <b>wires</b> was previously proved through experimental tests. However, <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> SMA <b>wires</b> under recovery stress has not been seriously investigated. Thus, this study conducted a series of tests of NiTiNb martensitic SMA wires under recovery stress with varying degrees <b>of</b> prestrain on <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> and compared <b>the</b> behavior under recovery stress with that under prestressing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wires.</b> <b>The</b> remaining stress was reduced by <b>the</b> procedure <b>of</b> additional strain loading and unloading. More additional strains reduced more remaining stresses. When <b>the</b> SMA <b>wires</b> were heated up to the transformation temperature under prestress, the stress on <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> increased due to the state transformation. Furthermore, the stress decreased with a decreasing temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wires</b> down to room temperature. <b>The</b> stress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NiTiNb <b>wires</b> was higher than the prestress, and the developed stress seemed to depend on <b>the</b> composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SMAs. When an additional strain was subsequently loaded and unloaded on <b>the</b> prestressed SMA <b>wires,</b> <b>the</b> remaining stress decreased. Finally, the remaining stress becomes zero when loading and unloading a specific large strain.|$|R
