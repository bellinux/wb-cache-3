500|$|A direct {{relationship}} between the real Clyde and the fictional Winesburg, however, remains the supposition of scholars. Anderson wrote in A Writer's Conception of Realism that he reacted with [...] "shock" [...] when he [...] "...heard people say that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> books Winesburg, Ohio, was an exact picture of Ohio village life." [...] The author went on to admit that, [...] "the hint for almost every character was taken from my fellow lodgers in a large rooming house..." [...] These lodgers were the [...] "...young musicians, young writers, painters, actors..." [...] and others that lived in proximity to Anderson on the North Side of Chicago and to whom he referred as [...] "The Little Children of the Arts". The truth probably lies somewhere in between, with memories of Clyde [...] "merging" [...] with Anderson's interactions at the boardinghouse.|$|E

60|$|Presentiments are strange things! {{and so are}} sympathies; and so are signs; and {{the three}} {{combined}} make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key. I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because I have had strange <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own.</b> Sympathies, I believe, exist (for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, {{the unity of the}} source to which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with man.|$|R

6000|$|... "Never mind, Béla! I can {{see that}} our little Elsa is a trifle nervy to-day; she does me more honour than I deserve by resenting your great {{kindness}} to me. But bless you, my good Béla! I don't mind. I am used to jealousies: the petty <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> sex are quite endurable; {{it is when you}} men are jealous that we poor women often have to suffer. Leopold Hirsch, who is courting me, you know, is so madly jealous at times. He scarce can bear anyone to look at me. As if I could help not being plain, eh?" ...|$|R

40|$|I have {{mentioned}} the irregularity of heredity of nervous diseases {{and tried to}} account for it. The apparent complexity of human pathogenic gene is caused by considering a number of mutations which have different origins as disease unit. Generally speaking, pathogenic gene may be regarded as normal gene whose functions are degenerated or lost through mutation. So instead of Holmes's formula c=f(G. E), I have found <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> c=f[(P. N. gM) E](P: pathogenic gene, N: normal gene, gM. genotypic milieu). Don't P and M stand rather in the relation of compensation than in that of dominance? Thus in the same disease we find some gene dominant and some ressesive, Expressivity of skipping or hetero and homo may be looked upon as mere difference of quantity. The individual difference {{of the extent of}} the site of the pathologic changes is vast, ranging from "formes frustes" to "homo lethal". About these phenomena I have tried to give a systematic and consecutive explanation. As disease examples, I {{have mentioned}}, including <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> examination, Huntington's chorea, Friedreich's ataxia, athetose double, dystrophia progressiva, etc...|$|R
6000|$|... "Salaries!" [...] exclaimed the collector, {{with hands}} raised; [...] "Valgame Dios! not <b>one</b> centavo <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> pay have I {{received}} {{for the last}} seven months. The pay of an admiral, do you ask? Quién sabe? Should it be less than three thousand pesos? Mira! you will see a revolution in this country very soon. A good sign of it is when the government calls all the time for pesos, pesos, pesos, and pays none out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] I admitted, with a laugh, [...] "it is a {{good deal}} like <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own.</b> I have always been struck with that phase of our civilization." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I know I {{was wrong}} before, when I wouldn't take Jane's warning; {{but that was}} not about <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> and, besides, poor Dolores is very much altered.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Let be. I {{will write}} to Edward an you will. He {{has been more}} prone to Lancaster folk since he was caught by the wiles of Lady Grey; but I would that I could hear what would clear this knight of yours by other {{testimony}} than such as your loving heart may frame.

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] my lady went on, [...] "I {{could not}} but open my heart about thee and me, to <b>one</b> who is <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> age, and so wise, unlike other girls.

60|$|In my eighth year I {{commenced}} learning Latin, {{in conjunction}} with a younger sister, to whom I taught it as I went on, and who afterwards repeated the lessons to my father; from this time, other sisters and brothers being successively added as pupils, a considerable part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> day's work consisted of this preparatory teaching. It was a part which I greatly disliked; the more so, as I was held responsible for the lessons <b>of</b> <b>my</b> pupils, in almost as full a sense as for my own: I, however, derived from this discipline the great advantage, of learning more thoroughly and retaining more lastingly the things which I was set to teach: perhaps, too, the practice it afforded in explaining difficulties to others, may even at that age have been useful. In other respects, the experience <b>of</b> <b>my</b> boyhood is not favourable to the plan of teaching children by means <b>of</b> <b>one</b> another. The teaching, I am sure, is very inefficient as teaching, and I well know that the relation between teacher and taught is not a good moral discipline to either. I went in this manner through the Latin grammar, and a considerable part of Cornelius Nepos and Caesar's Commentaries, but afterwards added to the superintendence of these lessons, much longer <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Mr. Clifford Pyncheon!" [...] {{said the}} man of patches, [...] "you may scheme for {{me as much as}} you please; but I'm {{not going to give up}} this <b>one</b> scheme <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own,</b> even if I never bring it really to pass. It does seem to me that men make a {{wonderful}} mistake in trying to heap up property upon property. If I had done so, I should feel as if Providence was not bound to take care of me; and, at all events, the city wouldn't be! I'm <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those people who think that infinity is big enough for us all--and eternity long enough." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he glanced}} down at the little white steamer lying in the inlet below. [...] "That's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> {{particular}} toys. You're coming up the coast with us next week for the salmon-trolling?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bear with him! I do {{not know}} exactly what you mean. Of course I will {{remember}} that he is an old man, and not answer him as I would <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> age." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] {{answered}} the Gump. [...] "I greatly prefer {{to navigate the}} air. For should I travel on the earth and meet with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> species, my embarrassment would be something awful!" ...|$|E
60|$|I was born, it said, {{or rather}} told me by thought transference, {{in a field}} of growing corn near to a big wood. At least I suppose I was born there, though the first thing I {{remember}} is playing about in the wheat with two other little <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> size, a brother and a sister that were born with me. It was at night, for a great, round, shining thing which I now know was the moon, hung in the sky above us. We gambolled together and were very happy, till presently my mother came--I remember how big she looked--and cuffed me with her paw because I had led the others away from the place where she had told us to stop, and given her a great hunt to find us. That is the first thing I remember about my mother. Afterwards she seemed sorry because she had hurt me, and nursed us all three, letting me have the most milk. My mother always loved me the best of us, because I was such a fine leveret, with a pretty grey patch on my left ear. Just as I had finished drinking another hare came who was my father. He was very large, with a glossy coat and big shining eyes that always seemed to see everything, even when it was behind him.|$|R
