40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{describes}} the <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords</b> and their various implementation possibilities. The <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords</b> are passwords, which are valid only for one login or transaction. In contrast to regular <b>passwords,</b> <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords</b> are immune against reply attacks, {{which means that}} if a possible attacker eavedroppes the used password, he cannot exploit it, {{because it is not}} valid anymore. The theoretical section of the thesis explains the reasons for using <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords</b> and demonstrates some particular OTP systems. The practical section shows two different examples of using open-source OTP systems. The first one {{describes the}} use of OTPasswd for authentication to a server over SSH, the other one uses MultiOTP PHP class for authentication to a web application...|$|R
5000|$|The YubiKey is a {{hardware}} authentication device manufactured by Yubico that supports <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords,</b> {{public key encryption}} and authentication, and the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol developed by the FIDO Alliance (FIDO U2F). It allows users to securely log into their accounts by emitting <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords</b> or using a FIDO-based public/private key pair generated by the device. YubiKey also allows for storing static passwords for use at sites that do not support <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords.</b> Facebook uses YubiKey for employee credentials, and Google supports it for both employees and users. Some password managers support YubiKey.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{discusses the}} use of one time passwords. Thesis is initially focused on {{the ways of the}} authentication and then on {{the use of}} one time <b>passwords.</b> <b>One-time</b> <b>passwords</b> are those passwords which are valid for only one authentication or transaction. After that they lose their validity. <b>One-time</b> <b>passwords</b> no longer exist after their use, so they are resistant to repeated attacks. Furthermore, the comparation of security between ordinary <b>passwords</b> and <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords</b> is discussed. Further, there is shown a comparison of different types of <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords.</b> There is a description of their creation and distribution to users. The practical part describes the implementation of open-source solution of OTP. Implementation is carried out using a plug-in to a website created in WordPress content management system. In {{the first part of the}} practical part, the selection of the plugin by selected criteria is described. In the second part of the practical part, the implementation of plugin is realized...|$|R

50|$|The use of {{challenge-response}} <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords</b> {{requires a}} user {{to provide a}} response to a challenge. For example, this can be done by inputting the value that the token has generated into the token itself. To avoid duplicates, an additional counter is usually involved, so if one happens to get the same challenge twice, this still results in different <b>one-time</b> <b>passwords.</b> However, the computation does not usually involve the previous one-time password; that is, usually this or another algorithm is used, rather than using both algorithms.|$|R

The YubiKey NEO and YubiKey 4 include protocols such as OpenPGP card using 2048-bit RSA and elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) p256 and p384, Near Field Communication (NFC), and FIDO U2F. The YubiKey allows users to sign, encrypt and decrypt messages without exposing the private keys to the outside world. The 4th generation YubiKey launched on November 16, 2015. It has support for OpenPGP with 4096-bit RSA keys, and PKCS#11 support for PIV smart cards, a feature that allows for code signing of Docker images.|$|E
