In 1967, Norway carried out a two-week comparative <b>observation</b> <b>test</b> with the Leopard 1 and found that, with closed hatches, the 103 spotted more targets and fired faster than the Leopard while the situation was reversed when operating with hatches open.

In 1973, the BAOR tested the 103. British crewmen received six weeks training and the vehicles were serviced by Swedish engineers. Over nine days of manoeuvres alongside the Chieftain tank, availability never fell under 90% and the final report stated, [...] "It has not been possible to prove any disadvantage in the [...] "S" [...] inability to fire on the move." [...] In 1975, two 103s were tested at the American armour center at Fort Knox. The trial demonstrated that the 103 fired more accurately than the M60A1E3, but on an average 0.5 seconds more slowly.|$|E

However, those allocated bands are not freely usable in the Korean oceanographic radars because of the radio environments and/or the radio interference to existing fixed and mobile services. In order to investigate the number of radio signals which are being introduced at coastal area of Korea, the mobile measuring system was used for the <b>observation</b> <b>test</b> of the radio environment in the frequency of 3 - 50 MHz band.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to examine psychometric characteristics of two measures related to mental slowness experienced after stroke: One measure is aimed at performance on tasks, the other is a questionnaire evaluating perceived consequences of mental slowness. A group of 37 stroke patients and 33 matched controls were studied. A subgroup of 10 patients and 22 controls was observed by two independent raters to determine inter-rater reliability, a subgroup of 18 patients completed the questionnaire twice over a two-week interval to determine test-retest stability. Results showed that internal consistency was acceptable for the Mental Slowness <b>Observation</b> <b>Test</b> (Cronbach's =. 61 and. 73) and good for the Mental Slowness Questionnaire (=. 91). For the <b>Observation</b> <b>Test,</b> correlations between the results of the two raters ranged between. 77 and. 99 and intra-class correlation coefficients were between. 86 and. 99.
