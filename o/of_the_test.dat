40|$|Researchers have {{repeatedly}} showed that when students take a <b>test</b> on <b>the</b> studied materials, their retention of information increases on later exams. The memory gain produced by <b>tests</b> is called <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect. <b>The</b> <b>testing</b> effect {{has been demonstrated}} with different materials (e. g., word lists, prose), with different designs (e. g., within-subjects, between-subjects), with different age groups and with different settings (e. g., laboratory, classroom). This thesis offers a novel approach to <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect: <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect. Although research on <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect has been flourishing over the last decade, transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effect has not been studied systematically. In this context, <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect refers to whether a learner can utilize the memory gain produced by tests in different contexts. The present study examined <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect in <b>the</b> temporal domain which refers to retention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect {{over a period of}} time (Experiment 1, Experiment 2, Experiment 3 and Experiment 4), the knowledge domain which refers to transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect across different levels of learning (Experiment 1, Experiment 2 and Experiment 3) and the modality domain which concerns how <b>the</b> format <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tests</b> influence <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect (Experiment 4). In addition to the laboratory studies, Experiment 3 was conducted in an actual classroom setting incorporating real classroom curriculum. The study revealed that <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect endures over a long period of time varying between 1 and 12 weeks and is transferable across different levels of learning (i. e., lower level and higher level). Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect is affected by the differences in <b>the</b> format <b>of</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>The</b> transferability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect across different domains indicated that <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect reflects more than rote learning. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study were discussed in light of two competing theoretical orientations explaining <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> effect: <b>the</b> retrieval hypothesis and the transfer-appropriate processing framework. Additionally, <b>the</b> practical implications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study were discussed in relation to the educational system...|$|R

5|$|The purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>test</b> is {{to ensure}} that the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness.

The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness.

Multi-state system usually has multiple normal states, and state changes at unpredictable points caused by the daily operation such as feed, outlet, flow control, etc. For the multistate system, collecting enough data that contain all possible states are challenging or impossible to users. Furthermore, conventional anomaly detection methods are sensitive to <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> training datasets or the unpredicted phased changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> datasets, or just consider <b>the</b> local density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>testing</b> samples.
