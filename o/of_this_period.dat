5|$|The Scottish economy <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> was {{dominated}} by agriculture and by short-distance, local trade. There was an increasing amount of foreign trade in the period, as well as exchange gained by means of military plunder. By the end <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> coins were replacing barter goods, but for most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> most exchange was done {{without the use of}} metal currency.|$|E
5|$|At {{the close}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> came the Permian–Triassic {{extinction}} event in which 96% of all marine species vanished {{and from which}} bio-diversity took 30 million years to recover.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 730s, he {{travelled}} in the Jiangsu/Zhejiang area; his earliest surviving poem, describing a poetry contest, {{is thought to}} date from the end <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> around 735.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{contemporary}} historical references worldwide refer to {{an extended period}} of extreme weather during 535-536. Evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cold <b>period</b> is also found in dendrochronology and ice cores. The consequences <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cold <b>period</b> are debated.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period's</b> {{most notable}} {{products}} are celadon pottery and the Tripitaka Koreana—the Buddhist canon (Tripiṭaka) carved onto more than 80,000 woodblocks and stored (and still remaining) at Haeinsa. The oldest surviving metal movable type book, the Jikji, was printed in 1377.|$|R

5|$|Many breeds {{can claim}} {{heritage}} {{to the early}} Fox terrier <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> including the Brazilian terrier, Japanese terrier, Miniature Fox terrier, Ratonero Bodeguero Andaluz, Rat terrier, and Tenterfield terrier.|$|E
5|$|Microfossils {{dating from}} – just 3million {{years after the}} end of the Cryogenian glaciations– may {{represent}} embryonic 'resting stages' in the life cycle of the earliest known animals. An alternative proposal is that these structures represent adult stages of the multicellular organisms <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of what {{is known}} of the history <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> comes from Gildas's On the Ruin of Britain, which is thought to have been written in Durotrigan territory, {{possibly}} at Glastonbury.|$|E
5000|$|The Boys of Our Lady's Church flourished {{especially}} in the 16th and 17th centuries when they were {{also part of the}} Copenhagen Royal Chapel Choir. The richness <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period's</b> musical life is also reflected in the repertoire of the Boys' Choir at the present time.|$|R

5|$|Other works <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> {{include the}} Variations on a Rococo Theme for cello and orchestra, the Second and Fourth Symphonies, the ballet Swan Lake, and the opera Eugene Onegin.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{imposing}} tomb <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> {{is that of}} Amenhotep III, WV22, located in the West Valley. It was re-investigated in the 1990s by a team from Waseda University, Japan, {{but it is not}} open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The proto-Scotland landmass moved northwards, {{and from}} 460–430 Ma, sandstone, {{mudstone}} and limestone were {{deposited in the}} area that is now the Midland Valley. This occurred in shallow tropical seas at the margins of the Iapetus Ocean. The Ballantrae Complex near Girvan was formed from this ocean floor and is similar in composition to rocks found at The Lizard in Cornwall. Nonetheless, northern and southern Britain were far apart at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> although the gap began to close as the continent of Avalonia broke away from Gondwana, collided with Baltica and drifted towards Laurentia. The Caledonian orogeny began forming a mountain chain from Norway to the Appalachians. There was an ice age in the southern hemisphere, and the first mass extinction of life on Earth took place at the end <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{achievements}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> 3-year <b>period</b> {{include a}} radical restructure {{of both the}} Department and policy, including: ...|$|R

5|$|The tengu <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> {{were often}} {{conceived}} of as the ghosts of the arrogant, {{and as a result}} the creatures have become strongly associated with vanity and pride. Today the Japanese expression tengu ni naru ("becoming a tengu") is still used to describe a conceited person.|$|E
5|$|The year 1916 marked {{four centuries}} since Palestine had {{become part of}} the Ottoman Empire, also known as the Turkish Empire. For most <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period,</b> the Jewish {{population}} represented a small minority, approximately 3% of the total, with Muslims representing the largest segment of the population, and Christians the second.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> was {{the appearance}} of stellate (star-shaped) shrines in a few temples built of the traditional sandstone, such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi, the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti. In all three cases, the shrine is a 16-pointed uninterrupted star, a ground-plan not found anywhere else in India and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32-pointed interrupted star plans of bhumija shrines in northern India.|$|E

5|$|Adi Da {{published}} his fourth book, titled Garbage and the Goddess: The Last Miracles and Final Spiritual Instructions of Bubba Free John. It documented the relatively unexpurgated lectures and activities <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period.</b> It quickly sold out its first print run, {{and a second}} was sent to bookstores. However, due to the controversial nature of its contents, all available copies were quickly retrieved and ritually burned at Adi Da's behest.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from football Young had many different jobs, including removals, managing a sports shop, delivering milk, {{working in a}} supermarket, and selling insurance. In his spare time he maintained his fitness by playing badminton, and after winning local tournaments, played the sport for Cheshire. During much <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> he struggled financially, {{to the point where}} he had to sell the family home and move in with his mother. Deeply depressed at this point in his life, at one point he attempted suicide. From the mid-1990s Young coached school football teams in the area around his Cheshire home.|$|E
5|$|Almost every silver siliqua in the hoard has had {{its edge}} clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> in Britain, {{although}} clipped coins are very unusual {{through the rest of}} the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait on the front of the coin intact, but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and the image on the obverse.|$|E
50|$|Insurrection {{was well}} received, with reviewers praising the novels {{successful}} evocation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> little-documented <b>period</b> <b>of</b> the Middle Ages.|$|R

5|$|As {{political}} awareness among the black majority {{on the island}} spread, so did bebop, a kind of jazz which was associated, in the United States, with social activism and Afrocentrism. The first Barbadian bebop musician from the island was Keith Campbell, a pianist who had learned to play many styles while living in Trinidad {{during a time when}} American soldiers were stationed there, providing a ready market for bands that could play American music. Other musicians <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> included Ernie Small, a trumpeter and pianist, and bandleader St. Clare Jackman.|$|E
5|$|At the end <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> Windsor Castle {{became a}} place of royal confinement. In 1788 the king first became ill during a dinner at Windsor Castle; {{diagnosed}} as suffering from madness, he was removed for a period to the White House at Kew, where he temporarily recovered. After relapses in 1801 and 1804, his condition became enduring from 1810 onwards and he was confined in the State Apartments of Windsor Castle, with building work on the castle ceasing the following year.|$|E
5|$|Both Calakmul and Tikal were {{sizeable}} Preclassic {{cities that}} survived into the Classic Period. Early hieroglyphic texts from stelae found in Structure 2 record the probable enthronement {{of a king}} of Calakmul in AD 411 and also records a non-royal site ruler in 514. After this there is {{a gap in the}} hieroglyphic records that lasts over a century, although the Kaan dynasty experienced a major expansion of its power at this time. The lack of inscriptions recording the events <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>period</b> may be either {{due to the fact that}} the Kaan dynasty was located elsewhere during this time or perhaps that the monuments were later destroyed.|$|E
