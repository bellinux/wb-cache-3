40|$|A {{synthesized}} photochromic compound-pyrrylfulgide-is {{prepared as}} {{a thin film}} doped in a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) matrix. Under irradiation by UV light, the film converts from the bleached state into a colored state that has a maximum absorption at 635 nm and is thermally stable at room temperature. When the colored state is irradiated by a linearly polarized 650 nm laser, the film returns to the bleached state; photoinduced anisotropy is produced during this process. Application of <b>optical</b> image <b>processing</b> methods using the photoinduced anisotropy of the pyrrylfulgide/PMMA film is described.

50|$|Theoretically, 2.39:1 release prints {{made from}} Super 35 should have {{slightly}} lower technical quality than films produced {{directly in the}} anamorphic format. Because part of the Super 35 image is thrown away when printing to this format, films originated with anamorphic lenses use a larger negative area. Super 35 has continually been popular with television shows, {{due to the lack}} of a need for a final release print; with the advent of widescreen television sets, 3-perf Super 35 - with a native 1.78:1 (16:9) ratio - is now also being used for widescreen television shows. 3-perf Super 35 has also been used for some time for 2.39:1 feature films, and the digital intermediate process has made it more attractive by skipping the <b>optical</b> <b>processing</b> formerly required.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} {{processed}} {{information can be}} very high (terabits/s), since the operation is performed in parallel on a whole image. This compensates {{for the fact that}} the recording time, which is in the order of a microsecond, is still very long compared to the processing time of an electronic computer. The <b>optical</b> <b>processing</b> performed by a dynamic hologram is also much less flexible than electronic processing. On one side, one has to perform the operation always on the whole image, and on the other side, the operation a hologram can perform is basically either a multiplication or a phase conjugation. In optics, addition and Fourier transform are already easily performed in linear materials, the latter simply by a lens. This enables some applications, such as a device that compares images in an optical way.|$|E

50|$|In true flies, the rhabdom has {{separated}} into seven independent rhabdomeres (there are actually eight, {{but the two}} central rhabdomeres responsible for color vision sit one atop the other), such that a small inverted 7-pixel image is formed in each ommatidium. Simultaneously, the rhabdomeres in adjacent ommatidia are aligned such that {{the field of view}} within an ommatidium is the same as that between ommatidia. The advantage of this arrangement is that the same visual axis is sampled from a larger area of the eye, thereby increasing sensitivity by a factor of seven, without increasing the size of the eye or reducing its acuity. Achieving this has also required the rewiring of the eye such that the axon bundles are twisted through 180 degrees (re-inverted), and each rhabdomere is united with those from the six adjacent ommatidia that share the same visual axis. Thus, {{at the level of the}} lamina - the first <b>optical</b> <b>processing</b> center of the insect brain - the signals are input in exactly the same manner as in the case of a normal apposition compound eye, but the image is enhanced. This visual arrangement is known as neural superposition.|$|E
50|$|In {{subsequent}} {{work the}} technique's latent capability was eventually achieved. That work, depending on advanced radar circuit designs and precision sensing of departures from ideal straight flight, {{along with more}} sophisticated optical processors using laser light sources and specially designed very large lenses made from remarkably clear glass, allowed the Michigan group to advance system resolution, at about 5-year intervals, first to 15 ft, then 5 ft, and, by the mid-1970s, to 1 foot (the latter only over very short range intervals while processing was still being done optically). The latter levels and the associated very wide dynamic range proved suitable for identifying many objects of military concern as well as soil, water, vegetation, and ice features being studied {{by a variety of}} environmental researchers having security clearances allowing them access to what was then classified imagery. Similarly improved operational systems soon followed each of those finer-resolution steps.Even the 5 ft resolution stage had over-taxed the ability of cathode-ray tubes (limited to about 2000 distinguishable items across the screen diameter) to deliver fine enough details to signal films while still covering wide range swaths, and taxed the <b>optical</b> <b>processing</b> systems in similar ways. However, at about the same time, digital computers finally became capable of doing the processing without similar limitation, and the consequent presentation of the images on cathode ray tube monitors instead of film allowed for better control over tonal reproduction and for more convenient image mensuration.|$|E
