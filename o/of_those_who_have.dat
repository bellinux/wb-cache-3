5|$|Aspirin is an {{important}} part of the treatment <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had a myocardial infarction (heart attack). One trial found that among those likely having an ST-segment elevation MI, aspirin saves the life of 1 in 42 by reducing the 30-day death rate from 11.8% to 9.4%. There was no difference in major bleeding, but there was a small increase in minor bleeding amounting to roughly 1 in every 167 people given aspirin.|$|E

5|$|Mashrafe Mortaza, {{the captain}} of the Bangladesh {{national}} cricket team from 2014, has played the most matches as a captain, having led in all 33 matches that he has played in, with an overall win–loss percentage of 75.75%. Mosharraf Hossain of the Dhaka Gladiators has the best win–loss percentage in the BPL as a captain with 100%. However, he only captained for one match. <b>Of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> captained for at least 10 matches, Mashrafe Mortaza has the best win–loss percentage in the BPL, with a win–loss percentage of 75.75% from 33 matches.

Approximately 20% of the people seen at epilepsy clinics have PNES and <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> PNES about 10% also have epilepsy; separating the two based on the seizure episode alone without further testing is often difficult.|$|E

5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} {{to the lower}} back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for those with low back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although only a few <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> spinal fusion experience good results. There {{are a number of}} different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E
5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E

5|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{attempted}} {{to find an}} escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E

A number of items in its collection have been, or are in the process of being, digitised, and a catalogue listing search, along with a short description of each item, is available online on the Archives' web site. The Archives releases many of its publications, including periodical newsletters, its annual report and the State of the Archives report, on its web site, and maintains an 'e-shop' to facilitate the sale of copies of some of its text and image holdings to interested members of the public.

5|$|Epilepsy {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a number of other {{conditions}} including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth. Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases. The risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly. Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 4060%. <b>Of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> had a stroke, 2–4% develop epilepsy. In the United Kingdom strokes account for 15% of cases and it is believed to be the cause in 30% of the elderly. Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma. Mild brain injury increases the risk about two-fold while severe brain injury increases the risk seven-fold. In those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%.|$|E
5|$|Since a {{proposal}} by Butinov and Knorozov in the 1950s, {{the majority of}} philologists, linguists and cultural historians have taken the line that rongorongo was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an ideographic- and rebus-based mnemonic device, such as the Dongba script of the Nakhi people, which would in all likelihood {{make it impossible to}} decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. <b>Of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> attempted to decipher rongorongo as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was logographic, a few that it was syllabic or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.|$|E
