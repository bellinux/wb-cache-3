25|$|We {{have learned}} to turn out lots of goods and services, but we haven’t learned as well how to have {{everybody}} share in the bounty. The obligation of a society as prosperous as <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> {{to figure out how}} nobody gets left too far behind.|$|E
25|$|David Kellogg Lewis, {{another student}} of Quine at Harvard, was ranked {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} philosophers of the 20th century in a poll conducted by Brian Leiter (open access poll). He is well known for his controversial advocacy of modal realism, the position which holds that there is an infinite number of concrete and causally isolated possible worlds, of which <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> one. These possible worlds arise in the field of modal logic.|$|E
500|$|Bleeding Through was an American {{heavy metal}} band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended {{influences}} stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. [...] Although {{the band was}} often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati {{was asked if he}} considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: [...] "I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say we are a metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. <b>Ours</b> <b>is</b> just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long." ...|$|E

6000|$|And first, it {{is evident}} that the title [...] "Dark Ages," [...] given to the mediæval centuries, is, {{respecting}} art, wholly inapplicable. They were, on the contrary, the bright ages; <b>ours</b> <b>are</b> the dark ones. I do not mean metaphysically, but literally. They were the ages of gold: <b>ours</b> <b>are</b> the ages of umber.|$|R
500|$|Chamberlin was a Mormon, {{an active}} member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He {{believed}} {{that there should be no}} animosity between religion and science. Stake President George W. McCune described a 1922 meeting in which Chamberlin testified [...] "to the effect that all his labors and researches in the laboratories of science, while very interesting, and to a great extent satisfying to the intellect, did not satisfy the soul of man, and that he yearned for something more," [...] adding Chamberlin [...] "bore testimony that he knew that <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> the true Church of Jesus Christ." [...] University of Oregon doctoral student Tim S. Reid called Chamberlin clearly devout, however, Sterling McMurrin stated [...] "spiders are different from metaphysics, and I think Ralph was not such a devout Mormon." ...|$|E
500|$|The name {{first came}} into use to {{describe}} the north-western section of the Perth Road District in 1906. Hamersley Ward was a large area of land covering what is now Hamersley, Carine, Watermans Bay, North Beach, Gwelup and parts of Balcatta, Karrinyup and Trigg. The Hamersley townsite, consisting of Hamersley Ward, was gazetted in 1945. As a result, many facilities in North Beach, including a primary school, a golf course, several sporting clubs and residents' and seniors' associations, were called Hamersley. After the Hamersley Development Scheme started in 1968, confusion as to exactly what Hamersley referred to led to conflict between established organisations in North Beach and emerging ones in Hamersley – the Hamersley Gazette noted in 1973 that [...] "North Beach people have the prior claim but <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> more officially accepted".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} scheduled for release, August 18, 2009, but plans were changed for unknown reasons. Legacy received main production credits on the album. In {{an interview with}} Format Magazine he said, [...] "I started making beats because I didn’t want everybody else’s sound. We wanted our own sound. So, I {{had no choice but}} to make my own beats to get that sound." [...] In an interview with Ozone Magazine, when asked about their music and the revival of the [...] "newer west" [...] movement, Ben J stated, [...] "Everything is becoming positive out here. People are growing out of that old mentality. Rapping about gangs ain’t really what it’s about out here now. Everybody is having fun." [...] In the same interview, Legacy said, [...] "I think music like <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> coming from people being tired of ...|$|E

500|$|In 1996 Dibnah {{repaired}} the [...] chimney at Barrow Bridge—the same chimney he had scaled for a bet, in his youth. [...] He {{was also}} asked to install a peregrine falcon nest at the top. [...] He was later influential in ensuring the chimney was made a listed building. [...] As a notable raconteur he also became an after-dinner speaker and would wear his trademark flat cap with his dinner jacket. [...] He made an appearance in a 1996 television advertisement for Kelloggs, but the strain of living with a man so dedicated to his hobbies began to take its toll on his wife: [...] "Sometimes he'll have busted his thumb because he's hit it with a hammer; you couldn't really expect him then {{to come in and}} start doing things in the house. [...] I just don't think it's fair though, I think you've got to strike a balance and I think <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> about 90/10. [...] Me for 90 per cent of the housework and Fred for 10." [...] Susan met another man and moved out, taking Roger with her and leaving Jack with Fred.|$|E
2500|$|Vivekananda {{regarded}} Christianity as [...] "..collection {{of little}} bits of Indian thought. <b>Ours</b> <b>is</b> the religion of which Buddhism with all its greatness is a rebel child, and of which Christianity is a very patchy imitation." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Is the Holocaust Unique? (1995), Shimon Samuels {{described}} the acrimonious debate in Holocaust scholarship between [...] "specifists" [...] and [...] "universalists". The former fear debasement of the Holocaust by invidious comparisons. The latter consider it immoral {{to hold the}} Holocaust as beyond comparison. Peter Novick argued that it is [...] "deeply offensive" [...] to view the Holocaust as unique: What else can all of this possibly mean except 'your catastrophe, unlike <b>ours,</b> <b>is</b> ordinary'...." ...|$|E

We have started trial colonies at Encinitas and at Mt. Washington in Los Angeles, and we have some colonies in India too. <b>Ours</b> <b>is</b> not a church in the ordinary sense. We never ask anyone if he is Jew, Gentile, Mohammedan, or Catholicwillingness and good character are the criterion of acceptance....|$|E
2500|$|The First Labour Government (1935–1949) {{pursued a}} more {{independent}} path in foreign affairs, {{in spite of}} the statute remaining unadopted. In 1938 Deputy Prime Minister Peter Fraser told Parliament, [...] "this country has to make up its own mind on international problems as a sovereign country – because under the Statute of Westminster <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> a sovereign country". In the 1944 Speech from the Throne the Governor-General announced the government's intention to adopt the Statute of Westminster. It was forced to abandon the proposal when the opposition accused the government of being disloyal to Britain at a time of need.|$|E
2500|$|So for Michael Palmer, this {{tendency}} seems {{there from the}} beginning. Today these concerns continue through multiple collaborations across the fields of poetry, dance, translation, and the visual arts. Perhaps similar to Olson's impact on his generation, Palmer's influence remains singular and palpable, if difficult to measure. Since Olson's death in 1970, we continue to be, following upon George Oppen's phrase, carried into the incalculable, As Palmer recently noted in a blurb for Claudia Rankine's poetic testament Don't Let Me Be Lonely (2004), <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> [...] "a time when even death and the self have been re-configured as commodities".|$|E

2500|$|With {{the deaths}} of Nardi and Greene, Licavoli assumed {{complete}} control of criminal activities in Cleveland. Under Licavoli, the Cleveland syndicate successfully infiltrated the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Cleveland branch. They accomplished this by bribing a female clerk to update them on organized crime investigations and provide the identities of government informants. In a later conversation with lifelong friend and FBI informant Jimmy Fratianno (described in Fratianno's biography The Last Mafioso), Licavoli ironically commented [...] "Jimmy, sometimes, you know, I think this fucking outfit of <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> like the old Communist party in this country. It's getting so that there's more fucking spies in it than members." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s Schneerson's talks became {{increasingly}} {{focused on the}} topic of Moshiach, that Moshiach was about to come, and what was needed to accomplish this. These talks would often take on a sense of urgency. This, coupled with Schneerson's frequent statement that <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "Last Generation of galut (exile) and it is the first generation of Geulah, the redemption" [...] is one of the arguments put forward that the Rebbe is the messiah. On one occasion, during the Rebbe's talk at the International Conference of Shluchim ("emissaries"), he stated, [...] "the work of the Shluchim has already finished, and the only task left is to welcome Moshiach".|$|E
2500|$|... all {{mediation}} is remediation. We are not claiming {{this as an}} {{a priori}} truth, but rather arguing that at this extended historical moment, all current media function as remediators and that remediation offers us a means of interpreting the work of earlier media as well. Our culture conceives of each medium or constellation of media as it responds to, redeploys, competes with, and reforms other media. In the first instance, we may think of something like a historical progression, of newer media remediating older ones and in particular of digital media remediating their predecessors. But <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> a genealogy of affiliations, not a linear history, and in this genealogy, older media can also remediate newer ones. (p. 55) ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the tumultuous events, Madame Nhu {{appeared}} on NBC-TV's Meet the Press on 13 October 1963, defending her actions and those of the South Vietnamese government. [...] "I don't know why you Americans dislike us ... Is it because the world is under a spell called liberalism? Your own public, here in America, is not as anti-Communistic as <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> in Vietnam. Americans talk about my husband and I leaving our native land permanently. Why should we do this? Where would we go? To say that 70 percent of my country's population is Buddhistic is absolutely true. My father, who was our ambassador to the United States until two months ago, has been against me since my childhood." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sarawak {{government}} defended its logging {{policy by}} stating that revenue from timber sales is needed to feed more than 250,000 of the state population. Sarawak chief minister Abdul Taib Mahmud said, [...] "It is hoped that outsiders will not interfere in our internal affairs, especially people like Bruno Manser. The Sarawak government has nothing to hide. <b>Ours</b> <b>is</b> an open liberal society." [...] Sarawak Minister of Housing and Public Health, James Wong said that [...] "We don't want them [...] running around [...] like animals. No one has the ethical right to deprive the Penans {{of the right to}} assimilation into Malaysian society." [...] The Sarawak government tightened the entry of foreign environmentalists, journalists, and film crews into the state. Sarawak government also allowed logging companies to hire criminal gangs to subdue the indigenous people.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{reported}} that Japanese troops were astonished by other Alliance troops raping civilians. Roger Keyes, who commanded the British destroyer Fame and accompanied the Gaselee Expedition, noted that the Japanese had brought their own [...] "regimental wives" [...] (prostitutes) to the front to keep their soldiers from raping Chinese civilians. Thousands of Chinese women committed suicide; The Daily Telegraph journalist E. J. Dillon stated it was to avoid rape by Alliance forces, and he witnessed the mutilated corpses of Chinese women who were raped and killed by the Alliance troops. The French commander dismissed the rapes, attributing them to [...] "gallantry of the French soldier." [...] A foreign journalist, George Lynch, said [...] "there are things that I must not write, and {{that may not be}} printed in England, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of <b>ours</b> <b>is</b> merely a veneer over savagery." ...|$|E
