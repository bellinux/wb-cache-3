25|$|The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) {{reported}} that growth for stock and commodities traders was forecast {{to be greater}} than 21% between 2006 and 2016.

U.S. Treasury bonds would also be traded on a more fluctuating basis. Stock traders just entering the field suffer since few entry-level positions exist. While entry into this career field is very competitive, increased ownership of stocks and mutual funds drive substantial career growth of traders.

40|$|With {{increasing}} numbers <b>of</b> women <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> retirees in the U. S., {{the issue of}} lack of financial security after retirement due to limited resources has begun to draw attention in policy and research areas. However, few {{studies have focused on}} the predictors of financial retirement planning. The purpose of this study includes the following: (1) to examine relations between demographic characteristics and attitudes toward retirement and financial retirement planning <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> women, and (2) to examine the longitudinal trajectories of financial retirement planning <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> women, and to identify the roles of demographic characteristics and attitudes toward retirement in predicting those trajectories. It was hypothesized that the rates of financial retirement planning increase over time, but the rates of financial retirement planning vary across individuals and time. Specifically, it was hypothesized that demographic variables and attitudes toward retirement relate to the rates of financial retirement planning across time. This study utilized data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Women at the National Science Foundation (NSF). Among 22 waves of the data set, four recent surveys (1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001) were utilized for the current study. Sample sizes of cross-sectional analysis and longitudinal analysis were 2, 146 and 1, 250, respectively. The mean age was 45. 32 (SD = 2. 23, range = 42 - 49) at the first time. The results demonstrated that race/ethnicity, educational attainment, marital status, and annual income <b>of</b> <b>baby</b> <b>boomer</b> women were significantly related to their financial retirement planning. Also, positive attitudes toward retirement were associated with higher rates of financial retirement planning. Moreover, longitudinal analyses demonstrated that individual changes in marital status and in income level significantly related to financial retirement planning over time. ^ KEY WORDS: Financial Retirement Planning, <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> Women, Demographic Characteristic, Attitudes toward Retirement, Longitudinal Study...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{congruency}} between the self-identity <b>of</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer,</b> Generation X and Generation Y consumers with the generational label and popularised identity of each generational cohort. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected using a mixed methods approach of focus groups (n= 49) followed by an online survey (n= 627) <b>of</b> <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer,</b> Generation X and Generation Y consumers. Focus group data were thematically analysed. Descriptive, ANOVA and factor analysis was conducted on the survey data. Findings - The results show that most consumers only have a vague association with their generational label and profile and find it easier to characterise generations that are different to their own. Generation self-identity congruency is greater among members <b>of</b> the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> cohort compared to the younger generations. Yet, even in the <b>Baby</b> <b>Boomer</b> cohort, generational identity is not homogenous among its members. Practical implications - The results challenge the explicit use of generational labels and stereotypes in marketing strategy. Originality/value - Given the immense interest and application of generational cohort segmentation, understanding whether and why consumers identify with cohort labels and profiles is critical. The paper questions the longevity of generational cohort analysis given the limited understanding and relevance of this concept to consumers.
