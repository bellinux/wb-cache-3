On the January 29 episode, Chu made a Final Jeopardy! wager that caused him to tie fellow contestant Carolyn Collins. Chu claimed that he {{made the decision to}} wager for a tie not out of kindness but because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> of 2003 College champion Keith Williams, who claims that game theory favors wagering for a tie over the more common practice of wagering to win by a dollar. Chu defeated Collins on the January 30 episode.|$|E

Holst's death was a severe personal and professional blow to Vaughan Williams; the two had been each other's closest friends and musical advisers since their college days. After Holst's death Vaughan Williams was glad <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> and support of other friends including Boult and the composer Gerald Finzi, but his relationship with Holst was irreplaceable.|$|E

Ai's failure to comprehend shifgrethor and to trust Estraven's motives leads him to misunderstand much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> that Estraven gives him. As Ai's relationship to Estraven changes, their communication also changes; they are both more willing to acknowledge mistakes, and make fewer assertions. Eventually, the two are able to converse directly with mindspeech, but only after Ai is able to understand Estraven's motivations, and no longer requires direct communication.|$|E

5|$|The {{dramatic}} {{contrast between}} Ranavalona's isolationism and her son's pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama's absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his Prime Minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, {{who took the}} throne name Rasoherina, was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband {{on the condition that}} she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the Hova (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of Prime Minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy. However, there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been {{made on the basis of}} significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island.|$|E

40|$|We use the {{recently}} introduced advising scheme framework for measuring <b>the</b> difficulty <b>of</b> locally distributively computing a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). An (m, t) -advising scheme for a distributed problem P is a way, for every possible input I of P, {{to provide an}} ”advice” (i. e., a bit string) about I to each node so that: (1) <b>the</b> maximum size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advices</b> is at most m bits, and (2) the problem P can be solved distributively in at most t rounds using <b>the</b> <b>advices</b> as inputs. In case <b>of</b> MST, <b>the</b> output returned by each node of a weighted graph G is the edge leading to its parent in some rooted MST T of G. Clearly, there is a trivial (⌈log n⌉, 0) advising scheme for MST (each node is given the local port number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> edge leading to <b>the</b> root <b>of</b> some MST T), and {{it is known that}} any (0, t) -advising scheme satisfies t ≥ ˜ Ω (√ n). Our main result is <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> an (O(1), O(log n)) -advising scheme for MST. That is, by only giving a constant number of bits of advice to each node, one can decrease exponentially the distributed computation time of MST in arbitrary graph, compared to algorithms dealing with the problem in absence of any a priori information. We also consider <b>the</b> average size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advices.</b> On <b>the</b> one hand, we show that any (m, 0) -advising scheme for MST gives advices of average size Ω(log n). On the other hand we design an (m, 1) -advising scheme for MST with advices of constant average size, that is one round is enough to decrease <b>the</b> average size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advices</b> from log n to constant.

25|$|The account which Herodotus gives of the {{hostilities}} {{between the}} two states {{during the early years}} of the 5th century BC is to the following effect. The Thebans, after the defeat by Athens about 507 BC, appealed to Aegina for assistance. The Aeginetans at first contented themselves with sending the images of the Aeacidae, the tutelary heroes of their island. Subsequently, however, they contracted an alliance, and ravaged the seaboard of Attica. The Athenians were preparing to make reprisals, in spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> of the Delphic oracle that they should desist from attacking Aegina for thirty years, and content themselves meanwhile with dedicating a precinct to Aeacus, when their projects were interrupted by the Spartan intrigues for the restoration of Hippias.|$|E

25|$|Despite his {{pioneering}} work with gas Murdoch {{never made any}} money from this invention due to his failure to obtain a patent. This may have been partly a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> of James Watt, Junior, that the discovery was not patentable, and partly {{a result of the}} commercial failure of his earlier patent of 1791 for an early form of aniline dye. This failure to apply for a patent, despite the commercial participation of Boulton and Watt in this field, left the fledgling industry of gas production and lighting open for exploitation by other commercial interests, such as his former assistant Samuel Clegg and Frederick Albert Winsor. In large part this was due to the failure of Boulton and Watt to make sufficient effort to expand from the factory and mill lighting market which they dominated by 1809 into the street and domestic lighting market. This reason for this lassitude is unknown but can be attributed to lack of interest, a failure to appreciate the size of the potential market, and a lack of desire to be involved in smaller, less prestigious projects. By May 1809 Boulton and Watt faced little competition in any gas market due to their success in lobbying Parliament to block the granting of a charter for the National Heat and Light Company, their only real competitor in this field. However, despite blocking the charter until 1812 this advantage was squandered as Boulton and Watt did not develop the gas market, or technology, and in 1814 abandoned the gas business. A few decades later most towns in Britain were lit by gas and most had their own gasworks.|$|E

Her mother Jean was involved in local politics in the United Party, Progressive Party and as city councilor.

During her youth she {{spent some time in}} Southern Rhodesia before leaving for Scotland where she was educated at the Edinburgh College of Domestic Science, qualifying in 1953.

They stayed there for eight years before returning to South Africa in 1963 and joining the Black Sash and would be the chairman of the Transvaal region. On the retirement of her mother in 1975, Duncan became president of the Black Sash from 1975 until 1978 then serving as vice president before being elected again in 1982 until 1986.

500|$|Ernest, {{like his}} brother, {{was in favor}} of a German unified, federal state. To best realize this goal, Ernest liked to dabble in {{whatever}} political system promised the most success. He subsequently watched the growth of liberalism in Germany with much interest and tried to build links with the movement's leaders. During Albert's lifetime, Ernest took a close interest in the movement for reform, and was perceived as a progressive within Germany. His favorable view of liberalism caused his duchy to become an asylum for political refugees from other German states. In 1863, he attended the liberal Frankfurt Conference, which was openly avoided by more conservative Prussia. Though his attendance made him no friends in Prussia, he developed such strong contacts in Austria that many looked to him as a potential leader in the mounting conflict between the northern and southern powers. He grew tired <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> he received from Albert on the subject however; as Ernest [...] "was by no means inclined to consent to an energetic rule such as I adopted immediately afterwards for the perfection of the constitutional system", according to Albert's letters.|$|E
