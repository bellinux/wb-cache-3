5|$|Much of play {{consists}} of interactions between characters. Some LARP scenarios primarily feature interaction between PCs. Other scenarios focus on interaction between PCs and aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting,</b> including NPCs, {{that are under}} the direction of the GMs.|$|E

5|$|As well as E-Groups, the Maya built other {{structures}} dedicated to observing {{the movements of}} celestial bodies. Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations. The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure. It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus. At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark the position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> sun at the equinoxes.|$|E
25|$|The Kakutani {{fixed point}} theorem generalizes the Brouwer fixed-point theorem in a {{different}} direction: it stays in Rn, but considers upper hemi-continuous correspondences (functions that assign to each point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> a subset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set).</b> It also requires compactness and convexity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set.</b>|$|R

5|$|In early editions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting,</b> The Realms {{shared a}} unified {{cosmology}} with various other campaign settings called the Great Wheel. In this way {{each of the}} Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various planes of existence. With {{the release of the}} 2001 Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting, the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.|$|E
5|$|Little, Brown and Company heavily {{promoted}} {{the book and}} it became the first debut novel to become number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale. As of 2005, it was the fastest-selling hardback debut novel in U.S. history. In general, the novel received mixed reviews. While some praised the book's description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting,</b> others criticized its structure and lack of tonal variety. Kostova received the 2006 Book Sense award for Best Adult Fiction and the 2005 Quill Award for Debut Author of the Year. Sony has bought the film rights and, as of 2007, was planning an adaptation.|$|E
5|$|Oxenfree was {{developed}} primarily using the Unity game engine, Adobe Photoshop, and Autodesk Maya. The game's artwork {{was made by}} Heather Gross. The game's camera distance from the player characters and 2D look {{were the result of}} functional necessity, as the team needed to show multiple characters, dialogue bubbles, and places to explore in the environment on the screen simultaneously. Working with these requirements, Gross created parallaxing, painterly backgrounds. The dark, organic elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> were put in opposition to the supernatural elements, which are bright and geometric.|$|E

5|$|Simcoe County Road90 is two lanes wide between McKinnon Road, {{north of}} Angus, and Ferndale Drive in Barrie, {{although}} a passing lane is provided for eastbound traffic between Angus and Essa. The road also widens to four lanes {{briefly at the}} junction with former Highway131 west of Barrie, as well as within the city and within Angus. The land use surrounding the route is mixed, with pastures and forests composing the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting.</b> Residences and small businesses are also scattered throughout {{the length of the}} route.|$|E
5|$|In this way, the Quenya {{language}} was {{symbolic of the}} high status of the Elves, the firstborn of the races of Middle-earth, because of their close connection to Valinor, and its decreasing use also became symbolic of the slowly declining Elven culture in Middle-earth. In the Second Age of Middle-earth's chronology the Men of Númenor learnt the Quenya tongue. In the Third Age, the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> of The Lord of the Rings, Quenya was learnt {{as a second language}} by all Elves of Noldorin origin, and it continued to be used in spoken and written form, but their mother-tongue was the Sindarin of the Grey-elves. As the Noldor remained in Middle-earth, their Noldorin dialect of Quenya also gradually diverged from the Vanyarin dialect spoken in Valinor, undergoing both sound changes and grammatical changes.|$|E
5|$|She {{reunited with}} Eguchi {{to create the}} soundtrack to Final Fantasy X-2 in 2003, with Matsueda {{contributing}} most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> themes. Having replaced Final Fantasys regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu to create a work entirely different from the predecessor Final Fantasy X, their score {{has become one of}} the most criticized soundtracks in the series. However, despite the negative response and a low budget, it was commercially successful. The following year, she worked on Final Fantasy X-2s international version Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission and provided three arrangements to the Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection album. The Piano Collections album was her last credited work, and she has since left Square Enix along with Eguchi.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} Episode III was {{composed}} by Yuki Kajiura. Having previous {{contributed to the}} score of Episode II by composing the cimenatic tracks, Kajiura was brought back to compose the entire score. Despite the increased work load of handling an entire game's soundtrack, Kajiura found the difficulty similar to the work she did on Episode II. She drew inspiration from the game's artwork and impression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> when creating the score. Takahashi, {{in addition to his}} other roles in production, acted as coordinator for the score. A soundtrack album titled Xenosaga Episode III: Also Sprach Zarathustra Original Sound Best Tracks, featuring selections from the game's score, was published by Victor Entertainment on July 12, 2006. The album's brevity was {{due to the fact that}} the full soundtrack would have taken up six CDs, and so Kajiura was asked by sound producer Keiichi Nozaki to create samples for a two-disc release.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{for the film}} began in May 1979 with {{the writing of the}} story and storyboarding for the film. Miyazaki began by drawing a bird's eye view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> before creating the story to completion. After the first draft scenario was returned to Miyazaki without change, he began the storyboards. The story was divided into four parts, but after reaching the third part changes had to be made at the storyboard phase in order to not exceed the decided running time. Animation work began in July while the storyboards were only a quarter complete; Miyazaki had to complete them during the animation production. Production wrapped {{up at the end of}} November and the film's premier on December 15, 1979 was a short seven and a half months from the project's undertaking, with only five months of production time.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of habitats {{is a necessary}} step in the maintenance of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs, the animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may take the form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>setting</b> up of national parks, forest reserves and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans {{with the objective of}} benefiting wildlife. The laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the {{protection of}} habitats may be more difficult to implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar concept has been incorporated into some Australian legislation.|$|E

By combining these two theorems, we can derive the following result dealing with bi-inductive properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> fixed points.|$|R
