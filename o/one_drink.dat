5|$|The main active {{ingredient}} of beer is alcohol, and therefore, {{the health effects}} of alcohol apply to beer. Consumption of small quantities of alcohol (less than <b>one</b> <b>drink</b> in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and diabetes mellitus. The long term health effects of continuous, moderate or heavy alcohol consumption include the risk of developing alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease.|$|E
5|$|Drinking {{more than}} <b>one</b> <b>drink</b> {{a day for}} women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

50|$|The tale of Four Bird Brothers first {{appeared}} in the novel The Bird That Drinks Tears, through the mouth of the character Keygon Draka. The riddle involves four brother birds, who each had different tastes. <b>One</b> bird <b>drank</b> water, <b>one</b> <b>drank</b> poison, <b>one</b> <b>drank</b> blood and <b>one</b> <b>drank</b> tears. There are four riddle that can be asked, each one with a different answer.|$|R
50|$|It is {{expected}} that Lee Yeongdo will write two more sequels, because of the quote in the series that mentions four birds. In the book there is a riddle about four bird brothers. <b>One</b> bird <b>drank</b> water, <b>one</b> <b>drank</b> poison, <b>one</b> <b>drank</b> blood and <b>one</b> <b>drank</b> tears. The riddle asks who of the four birds will die first. This riddle appears repeatedly throughout both The Bird That Drinks Tears and The Bird That Drinks Blood, and is entwined {{with many of the}} themes that run through two series.|$|R

25|$|Combs {{served in}} the United States Naval Air Corps during World War II and was {{discharged}} in 1947. After helping combat flooding near the town on Betsy Layne, Combs and some friends purchased a bottle of whisky before returning home. Although Combs said he had only taken <b>one</b> <b>drink,</b> {{he was arrested for}} public intoxication; he said he believed his muddied appearance led the arresting constable to assume he was drunk. In jail, he decided to forego re-enlistment in the Navy and enter the legal profession to correct what he saw as injustices in the legal system. After completing a law curriculum at Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee, he was admitted to the bar in 1951 and began practice in his native Eastern Kentucky. He received his juris doctor degree from Samford University's Cumberland School of Law in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Greater than 75–95% of {{colorectal}} cancer occurs {{in people with}} little or no genetic risk. Risk factors include older age, male gender, high intake of fat, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise. Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity. The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than <b>one</b> <b>drink</b> per day. Drinking 5 glasses of water a day is linked to a decrease in the risk of {{colorectal cancer}} and adenomatous polyps. Streptococcus gallolyticus is associated with colorectal cancer. Some strains of Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe. 25 to 80% of people with Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. Seroprevalence of Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population. It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.|$|E

His addiction to betting on horse racing cost him £3,000 a month, and left him asking friends and family for money.|$|E

McGee {{had to learn to}} walk, speak and function again after his first overdose. McGee said that his path into drug and alcohol abuse began when he started to hang out with [...] "the wrong people - drinking, partying." [...] After suffering an injury to his clavicle and elbow, McGee became dependent to painkillers, which he later mixed with alcohol. McGee had taken cocaine and heroin before overdosing. After his near-death experience, McGee suffered a couple of relapses. On an episode of The Ultimate Fighter, McGee said [...] "I took <b>one</b> <b>drink</b> in Vegas and I ended up in Iowa four days later with no pants on and a long sleeve shirt, looking for meth." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the initial}} {{absorption}} phase, arterial blood alcohol concentrations {{are higher than}} venous. After absorption, venous blood is higher. This is especially true with bolus dosing. With additional doses of alcohol, the body can reach a sustained equilibrium when absorption and elimination are proportional, calculating a general absorption rate of 0.02/drink and a general elimination rate of 0.015/hour. (<b>One</b> <b>drink</b> is equal to [...] of liquor, [...] of beer, or [...] of wine.) ...|$|E

2500|$|A theory {{called the}} [...] "primrose path" [...] is {{intended}} to explain how preference reversal can lead to addiction in the long run. As an example, a lifetime of sobriety may be more highly valued than a lifetime of alcoholism, but, at the same time, <b>one</b> <b>drink</b> now may be more highly valued than not drinking now. [...] Because it is always [...] "now," [...] the drink is always chosen, and a paradoxical effect occurs whereby the more-valued long-term alternative is not achieved because the more-valued short-term alternative is always chosen. This {{is an example of}} complex ambivalence, when a choice is made not between two concrete alternatives but between one immediate and tangible alternative (i.e., having a drink) and one delayed and abstract alternative (i.e., sobriety).|$|E

2500|$|In {{much the}} same way as Buffy had been both a homage and parody of {{traditional}} horror films, Angel gave the same treatment to the classical film noir. [...] Producer Kelly Manners said [...] "Angel is a dark show about a man looking for redemption... We have an alcoholic metaphor with Angel. [...] Angel is a guy who is <b>one</b> <b>drink</b> away from going back to his evil roots" [...] He attempts to find redemption through helping the helpless of Los Angeles in a fashion similar to that of noir detectives. [...] The first episode even included a Philip Marlowe-style voiceover. [...] Angel filled the role of the reluctant, streetwise detective who has dealings with a variety of underworld characters. [...] In this case, the [...] "underworld" [...] is a literal underworld of demons and supernatural beings. [...] In one instance, Angel is explicitly compared with fictional noir private-detective Marlowe. [...] Many traditional noir stories and characters were explored in earlier episodes, including the ditzy but attractive secretary, the cagey but well-informed partner, and clashes with crooked lawyers, femme fatales and meddlesome, too-good-for-their-own-good cops. [...] These were usually given a modern or supernatural twist.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the loss}} of his IBO belt, Booth spent almost two years away from the ring as he {{struggled}} with an alcohol addiction. Speaking about the matter in 2010 Booth said [...] "I took time off boxing because I was too drunk...No manager would look at me and all the doors were shut. I'd go on these mad binges and spend loads of money." [...] After earning £10,000 in his fight with Damaen Kelly, Booth had spent the money on a combination of drink and drugs with the money disappearing within six weeks. Speaking about his addiction, Booth said that drink had always been a part of family life but the suicide of his sister Deana had hit him particularly hard. Booth said, [...] "It was too young to die. She was a funloving girl. I don’t know why she did it. She got run over when she was young. She’d had a tragic time. It mentally disturbed me." [...] Two weeks later, following the tragedy, Booth fought and beat the Bulgarian boxer Dimitar Alipiev whilst drunk, saying, [...] "I wanted to fight because I didn’t {{know what to do with}} myself after Deana died. I was drinking on the day of the fight. I was numb. I was in no pain. I just didn’t care. It was the only time in my life I didn’t care." [...] It was Booth's 12th professional contest. Booth said that he also fell into bad company: [...] "I was in parks and dosshouses. I was British champion but walking around with drunks and thinking they were mates. I’d get up, drink cider and top up during the day. Sometimes, I’d get a bottle of cheap vodka and walk around with it in my pocket." [...] Eventually Booth checked into an alcohol clinic and begun the process of getting clean: [...] "It frightened me and I wanted to stop, but it was only when my body rejected the drink that I found the courage. My stomach packed in. I was sicking blood every morning." [...] He began training once more with trainer Tony Harris and began to rebuild his boxing career despite occasionally relapsing into drink. Eventually he gave up drinking altogether, saying, [...] "I’m one of those who has to be abstinent, because <b>one</b> <b>drink</b> isn’t going to do anything for me except start it all again." ...|$|E
