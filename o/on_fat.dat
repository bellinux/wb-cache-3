5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely <b>on</b> <b>fat</b> stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E

40|$|Nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) {{is associated}} with caspase activation. However, a role for pro-inflammatory caspases or inflammasomes has not been explored in diet-induced liver injury. Our aims were to examine the role of caspase- 1 in high fat-induced NASH. C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type and caspase 1 -knockout (Casp 1 (-/-)) mice were placed on a 12 -week high fat diet. Wild-type mice <b>on</b> the high <b>fat</b> diet increased hepatic expression of pro-caspase- 1 and IL- 1 β. Both wild-type and Casp 1 (-/-) mice <b>on</b> the high <b>fat</b> diet gained more weight than mice on a control diet. Hepatic steatosis and TG levels were increased in wild-type mice <b>on</b> high <b>fat</b> diet, but were attenuated {{in the absence of}} caspase- 1. Plasma cholesterol and free fatty acids were elevated in wild-type, but not Casp 1 (-/-) mice, <b>on</b> high <b>fat</b> diet. ALT levels were elevated in both wild-type and Casp 1 (-/-) mice <b>on</b> high <b>fat</b> diet compared to control. Hepatic mRNA expression for genes associated with lipogenesis was lower in Casp 1 (-/-) mice <b>on</b> high <b>fat</b> diet compared to wild-type mice <b>on</b> high <b>fat</b> diet, while genes associated with fatty acid oxidation were not affected by diet or genotype. Hepatic Tnfα and Mcp- 1 mRNA expression was increased in wild-type mice <b>on</b> high <b>fat</b> diet, but not in Casp 1 (-/-) mice <b>on</b> high <b>fat</b> diet. αSMA positive cells, Sirius red staining, and Col 1 α 1 mRNA were increased in wild-type mice <b>on</b> high <b>fat</b> diet compared to control. Deficiency of caspase- 1 prevented those increases. In summary, the absence of caspase- 1 ameliorates the injurious effects of high <b>fat</b> diet-induced obesity <b>on</b> the liver. Specifically, mice deficient in caspase- 1 are protected from high fat-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation and early fibrogenesis. These data point to the inflammasome as an important therapeutic target for NASH...|$|R

25|$|The way {{the facial}} works {{is not entirely}} clear. The guano from the {{nightingale}} has {{a high concentration of}} urea and guanine. Because birds excrete a fecal and urine waste from a single opening, called the cloaca, the fecal-urine combination gives the droppings a high concentration of urea. Urea is sometimes found in cosmetics because it locks moisture into the skin. The guanine may produce shimmery, iridescent effects on the skin. It is claimed that because of the short intestine of the nightingale, the droppings have protein, a fat-degrading enzyme, and a whitening enzyme that acts <b>on</b> <b>fat</b> and scurf to whiten skin and even out blemishes.|$|E
25|$|Various {{optimizations}} and tweaks to {{the implementation}} of FAT file system drivers, block device drivers and disk tools have been devised to overcome most of the performance bottlenecks in the file system's inherent design without having to change the layout of the on-disk structures. They can be divided into on-line and off-line methods and work by trying to avoid fragmentation in the file system in the first place, deploying methods to better cope with existing fragmentation, and by reordering and optimizing the on-disk structures. With optimizations in place, the performance <b>on</b> <b>FAT</b> volumes can often reach that of more sophisticated file systems in practical scenarios, {{while at the same time}} retaining the advantage of being accessible even on very small or old systems.|$|E
25|$|In fact, seeking for {{files in}} large subdirectories or {{computing}} the free disk space <b>on</b> <b>FAT</b> volumes {{is one of}} the most resource intensive operations, as it requires reading the directory tables or even the entire FAT linearly. Since the total amount of clusters and the size of their entries in the FAT was still small on FAT12 and FAT16 volumes, this could still be tolerated on FAT12 and FAT16 volumes most of the time, considering that the introduction of more sophisticated disk structures would have also increased the complexity and memory footprint of real-mode operating systems with their minimum total memory requirements of 128 KB or less (such as with DOS) for which FAT has been designed and optimized originally.|$|E
40|$|Conjugated {{linoleic}} acid (CLA) {{has shown a}} number of health benefits, particularly <b>on</b> controlling body <b>fat</b> while improving lean mass. As one of CLA cognates, conjugated nonadecadienoic acid (CNA, 19 -carbon conjugated fatty acid) has been previously reported to have greater efficacy <b>on</b> body <b>fat</b> control. In this report, we compared the efficacy of dietary CLA and CNA <b>on</b> body <b>fat</b> regulation and also compared the mechanism of body fat control using a mouse model. Effects of 0. 1 % dietary CNA <b>on</b> body <b>fat</b> reduction were {{comparable to that of}} 0. 5 % dietary CLA. The mechanisms of dietary CNA <b>on</b> body <b>fat</b> control were similar to those of CLA: increased energy expenditure and increased fatty acid beta-oxidation. Dietary CNA, but not CLA, also improved expression of hormone-sensitive lipase from white adipose tissue, and this may help explain how CNA has better efficacy <b>on</b> body <b>fat</b> control than CLA. Dietary CNA had similar effects as CLA on liver weights; however, unlike CLA, CNA improved glucose tolerance. Thus, CNA has potential {{to be used as a}} pharmacological agent to assist current efforts to reduce obesity with less adverse effects than CLA...|$|R

25|$|The {{idea for}} the show {{occurred}} to actor James Corden during a wedding reception, and he then developed the idea with co-writer Ruth Jones, whom he had met during the filming of ITV drama Fat Friends. Corden claims to {{have been inspired by}} the story of his own real life best friend Gavin, who met his wife over the phone at work, and arranged to meet. They presented it to the BBC as a one-off play, but the BBC instead asked for a full series. The roles of Gavin and Stacey were cast through an auditioning process, but were almost immediately given to Mathew Horne and Joanna Page on the strength of their chemistry together. The roles of Nessa and Smithy were written by Corden and Jones for themselves. Some roles were written with certain actors in mind; Uncle Bryn was written specifically for Rob Brydon, who had been to school with Jones, whilst Pam was written specifically for Alison Steadman, who had also worked <b>on</b> <b>Fat</b> Friends. Jones had worked with Julia Davis in her sitcom Nighty Night, and the role of Dawn was written with her in mind. Additionally, Corden had appeared with Adrian Scarborough in the Alan Bennett-penned play and film, The History Boys, which led to him being cast in the role of Pete. An audition process was used to cast the roles of Mick and Gwen, whilst the roles of Gavin's friends were given to Corden's co-stars in The History Boys.|$|E
