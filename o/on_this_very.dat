25|$|The law was rediscovered by Thomas Harriot in 1602, who however did not publish {{his results}} {{although}} he had corresponded with Kepler <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> subject. In 1621, Willebrord Snellius (Snell) derived a mathematically equivalent form, that remained unpublished during his lifetime. René Descartes independently derived the law using heuristic momentum conservation arguments in terms of sines in his 1637 essay Dioptrics, {{and used it to}} solve a range of optical problems. Rejecting Descartes' solution, Pierre de Fermat arrived at the same solution based solely on his principle of least time. Interestingly, Descartes assumed the speed of light was infinite, yet in his derivation of Snell's law he also assumed the denser the medium, the greater the speed of light. Fermat supported the opposing assumptions, i.e., the speed of light is finite, and his derivation depended upon the speed of light being slower in a denser medium. Fermat's derivation also utilized his invention of adequality, a mathematical procedure equivalent to differential calculus, for finding maxima, minima, and tangents.|$|E

500|$|Stage 12, the Bastille Day stage, was {{the first}} {{particularly}} difficult mountain stage in this Tour. It ended at the hors catégorie climb Luz Ardiden, and also visited the hors catégorie Col du Tourmalet and a never-before-seen first category climb La Hourquette d'Ancizan. Sánchez effectively stayed with the group of overall favorites throughout the day, and attacked with 's Jelle Vanendert {{on the way up}} to Luz Ardiden, surpassing the morning breakaway. Starting his sprint for the finish line from [...] out, Sánchez won so convincingly that he opened up a 7-second time gap on Vanendert. It was Sánchez' first Tour stage win of his career and just the third in the team's history [...] one of them had come from former rider Roberto Laiseka <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>very</b> mountain in the 2001 Tour de France. Given the new points system for the mountains classification, Sánchez took the polka-dot jersey as mountains leader due to this win, even though he had not previously scored a single point. The result also installed him into the top ten overall for the first time, as he occupied eighth place. The next day, by winning the Col d'Aubisque climb, Jérémy Roy took the mountains classification lead from Sánchez. In stage 14, the overall favorites chased down a breakaway {{on the way to the}} Plateau de Beille summit finish. Once they occupied first position on the road, Andy Schleck tried numerous times to escape but was unable. Vanendert went, and no one but Sánchez put in any serious attempt to chase him down. Vanendert won the stage, and took the mountains classification lead, with Sánchez finishing second, exactly reversing their fates from stage 12. Sánchez also improved to sixth overall with this result. Sánchez improved further in stage 16. While previous race leader Thor Hushovd won the stage from a breakaway, Sánchez, as well as Cadel Evans and Alberto Contador, took time out of some of the race's other top riders by riding away from them on the descent to the finish. Evans was three seconds the better of Sánchez and Contador, who were in turn 18 seconds faster than race leader Thomas Voeckler, Fränk Schleck, Damiano Cunego, and others. They were also 51 seconds the better of Ivan Basso and more than a minute better than Andy Schleck. This result moved Sánchez up to fifth place. Sánchez lost time on stage 18 on the Col du Galibier, finishing 18th almost five minutes behind stage winner Andy Schleck and between one and three minutes behind the race's other top riders. He fell back to eighth because of this.|$|E

2500|$|In this connection, {{another thing}} {{also should be}} kept in mind: evil {{suggestion}} is not whispered into the heart of man only from outside by the satans from among men and jinn, but also by the self of man from within. His own wrong theories misguide his intellect, his own unlawful motives and desires lead his power of discrimination, will and power of judgment astray, and {{it is not only the}} satans from outside but within his satan of the self also beguiles him.
