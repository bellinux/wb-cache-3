40|$|Problem statement: The {{effects of}} excess feeding oxygen to the {{fuel-air}} mixture on the exhausts gasses emissions concentrations are investigated here. It {{is known that}} spark-ignition and diesel engines are considered as major sources of urban air pollution; such pollutants are CO 2, CO, HC. Hence, many techniques {{have been used to}} decrease such emissions such as: Catalytic converters, oxidizers, traps and Diesel Particulate Filters (DPF), but these techniques have some disadvantages represented by: Forming back pressure which affects the engine performance, plugging and high costs. Approach: In present study the effects of feeding more oxygen to the combustion mixture is studied experimentally. Results: It was found from tests applying on an engine that excess oxygen has positive results in decreasing concentration of both CO and HC's. Conclusion/Recommendations: CO 2 concentration at <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> test is greater than that at without <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> at the two cases: With load and without load tests and at nearly all engine speeds. CO concentration at <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> test is much less than that at without <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> at the two cases: With load and without load tests and at nearly all engine speeds. HC concentration at <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> test is less than that at without <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> at the two cases: With load and without load tests and at nearly all engine speeds. It also recommended using more amount of oxygen in the future to find the optimal value of oxygen can be fed and if anther fuel additives can be used...|$|R

Dissolving oxygen into the wastewater oxidises existing sulphides and inhibits further generation. Through recent advances in spectroscopy it is possible to measure Total Dissolved Sulphides (TDS). The oxygen dissolvers on Slade St and Cresswell Rd pump stations were investigated. Each system was monitored for a period without oxygen in order to determine base conditions; and then with <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection.</b> The TDS build up on the Slade system generally agreed with the literature model and using an annual dosage of 42, 500 m 3 oxygen reduced the TDS build up by 65 %. The TDS build up on the Cresswell system significantly deviated from the model and using an annual dosage of 60, 000 m 3 oxygen reduced TDS build up by 8 %. Although <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> continues to provide sulphide control, complete reduction in TDS is not possible. Further work will focus on the economic viability of <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> technology and identifying potential alternative control solutions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> is a {{commonly}} used mitigation strategy for sulfide control in sewers. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is also produced in sewers. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> may reduce methane generation/emission, but could potentially lead to N 2 O production {{due to the}} development of a nitrifying microbial community. The impact of oxygen dosing for sulfide control in sewers on CH 4 and N 2 O production was assessed in this study in laboratory sewer reactors. Results showed that <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> is able to reduce CH 4 formation in sewers, although full control of CH 4 was not achieved, likely due to partial oxygen penetration into sewer biofilm. The experimental results also revealed a nitrogen loss of around 5 mN/L. However, no significant N 2 O accumulation was detected...|$|R
40|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> {{is often}} used to control {{biogenic}} production of hydrogen sulfide in sewers. Experiments were carried out on a laboratory system mimicking a rising main to investigate the impact of <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> on anaerobic sewer biofilm activities. <b>Oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> (15 - 25 mgO(2) /L, per pump event) to the inlet of the system decreased the overall sulfide discharge levels by 65 %. Oxygen was an effective chemical and biological oxidant of sulfide but did not cause a cessation in sulfide production, which continued in the deeper layers of the biofilm irrespective of the oxygen concentration in the bulk. Sulfide accumulation resumed instantaneously on depletion of the oxygen. Oxygen did not exhibit any toxic effect on sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) in the biofilm. It further stimulated SRB growth and increased SRB activity in downstream biofilms due to increased availability of sulfate at these locations as the result of oxic conditions upstream. The oxygen uptake rate of the system increased with repeated exposure to oxygen, with concomitant consumption of organic carbon in the wastewater. These results suggest that optimization of <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> is necessary for maximum effectiveness in controlling sulfide concentrations in sewers. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of a direct <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> as a potential remediation strategy for contaminated aquifers on a bench scale. The mass transfer between a multi-component trapped gas phase and a mobile water phase was studied. Column experiments with dynamically compressed sediments and a direct gas <b>injection</b> of pure <b>oxygen</b> gas were performed. In addition, a new developed kinetic multi-component model was used to describe the experiments. The amount of gas that could be captured in the pore space during direct <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> and the time needed for a complete dissolution of the trapped gas phase were determined. Varying influences of different gases already dissolved in the mobile water phase on the dissolution process of a trapped oxygen gas phase were described for different flow regimes and confirmed by the model results.

40|$|In this study, a preset {{oxidation-reduction}} potential (ORP) {{was employed to}} regulate oxygen dosing for online sulfide toxicity control during anaerobic treatment of high sulfate wastewater. The experiment was conducted in an upflow anaerobic reactor (UAF), which was operated at a constant influent total organic carbon (TOC) of 6740 mg/L (equivalent to a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 18000 mg/L) but with different influent sulfates of 1000, 3000 and 6000 mg/L. The reactor was initially run without <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> at a natural ORP of about- 290 to - 300 mV and then was followed by oxygenation to raise ORP by + 25 mV above the natural level for each influent sulfate level. With 1000 and 3000 mg/L influent sulfates, the produced sulfide levels did not impose any appreciable toxicity to methanogens even without <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection.</b> However, with 6000 mg/L influent sulfate without <b>oxygen</b> <b>injections,</b> the dissolved sulfide level quickly went up to over 800 mg/L which imposed a significant suppression on methanogenesis. Upon <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> to raise the ORP by + 25 mV, the dissolved sulfide was quickly reduced to 160 mg/L. If more oxygen was injected to raise the ORP by + 50 mV, then dissolved sulfide further decreased to 12. 2 mg/L with a concomitant improvement in methane yield by 45. 9 %. With a + 25 mV preset ORP increase, {{it was found that}} at the 1000 mg/L influent sulfate the supplied oxygen was more than that needed for sulfide oxidation. The excess oxygen could be utilized readily by facultative heterotrophs for organic oxidation, which contributed 13. 5 % of the total COD removal in the UAF. At the higher sulfate levels of 3000 and 6000 mg/L, the facultative contributions to the total COD removal were only 4. 7 and 4. 1 %, respectively. This study has clearly demonstrated that ORP is a workable and reliable means for regulating <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> to achieve online sulfide toxicity control in a single-stage anaerobic system treating high sulfate wastewater...|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} for sulfide control {{was investigated in}} an upflow-anaerobic filter (UAF) treating high-strength, sulfate-rich wastewater. The technique used periodic <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> using oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) as a controlling parameter to regulate <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection.</b> The UAF was operated at a constant influent total-organic carbon of 6740 mg/L but with different influent sulfates of 1000, 3000, and 6000 mg/L. At 1000 and 3000 mg/L influent sulfates, the produced sulfide did not impose any inhibition to methane-producing bacteria (MPB). However, at 6000 mg/L influent sulfate, the produced dissolved sulfide of 804 mg S/L (free sulfide = 280 mg S/L) severely inhibited the methanogenesis, but not the sulfidogenesis. Upon <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> at elevated ORP of - 265 mV, sulfides were almost completely eliminated with a concomitant improvement in methane yield by 46 %. If oxygenation was excessive because of an oversetting of ORP, the excess oxygen could be used rapidly by facultative heterotrophs, thereby protecting the MPB from oxygen stress. Regarding online sulfide oxidation, {{it was found that}} the biogas and injected oxygen needed to pass through an aqueous layer containing trace metals, which were found to have a significant catalytic effect on abiotic sulfide oxidation...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{practice of}} employing a two-stage coal-fed gasification {{process is to}} feed all of the oxygen to provide a vigorous amount of combustion {{in the first stage}} but only feed the coal without oxygen in the second stage to allow the endothermic gasification process to occur downstream of the second stage. One of the merits of this 2 -stage practice is to keep the gasifier temperature low downstream from the 2 nd stage to extend the life of refractory bricks, decrease gasifier shut-down frequency for scheduled maintenance, and reduce the maintenance costs. In this traditional 2 -stage practice, the temperature reduction in the second stage is exchanged for a higher than normal temperature in the first stage. This study investigates a concept totally opposite to the traditional two-stage coal feeding practices in which the injected oxygen is split between the two stages, while all the coal is fed into the first stage. The hypothesis of this two-stage <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> is that a distributed <b>oxygen</b> <b>injection</b> scheme can also distribute the release of heat to a larger gasifier volume and, thus, reduce the peak temperature distribution in the gasifier.

The oxygen flow rate during the injection time was sufficient to switch the process to compound sputtering mode, while the oxygen flow was stopped in the rest of period to allow cleaning of target. Sputtering experiments have shown that the instability phenomena, typical of the reactive sputtering process and known as the “hysteresis effect”, are relatively weak due to the small reactivity of tungsten.
