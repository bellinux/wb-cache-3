5|$|Fellow street artist Shepard Fairey {{wrote in}} Swindle:Invader's pop art may seem shallow, but {{by taking the}} risk of {{illegally}} re-contextualizing video game characters in an urban environment that provides more chaotic social interaction than a gamer's bedroom, he makes a statement about the desensitizing nature of video games and consumer culture. In a postmodern paradox, a game like Grand Theft Auto takes the danger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> {{and puts it in}} a safe video game, while Invader takes a safe video game icon and inserts it into the danger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b>|$|E

5|$|He was {{appointed}} to several offices within the Buenos Aires Cabildo in the 1781-1794 period. On April 7, 1789, he helped a number of shoemakers to establish a guild. Although there were several in Spain, no guild constitution from Spain {{was used as a}} model. He promoted the pavement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> and the improvement of the buildings. Supported by the viceroy Nicolás Antonio de Arredondo, he collected $8,000 and provided 500 cattle to mine rocks from the Martín García Island for this work. He married his cousin Justa Rufina de Basavilbaso y Garfias on February 6, 1795.|$|E
5|$|Inhaúma's health {{steadily}} deteriorated, {{and he died}} on 8 March {{at around}} 04:30 in the morning. According to historian Eugênio Vilhena de Morais, malaria {{was the cause of}} death. His coffin was placed in a carriage reserved for the funerals of members of the imperial family. It was escorted by three cavalry squadrons and followed by three hundred carriages, while onlookers crowded both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> along the procession's route. Tamandaré and the future Viscount of Ouro Preto were among the pallbearers. He was buried in the São Francisco Xavier cemetery (popularly known as Caju Cemetery) in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E

5|$|The Domesday {{survey of}} 1086 {{revealed}} 110 households which were mainly rural.

See also the cartographer John Speed's plan of Ely, 1610. In 1563 there were 800 households and by 1753 the population was recorded as 3,000.|$|E
5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} firefighting efforts was the narrowness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets.</b> Even {{under normal}} circumstances, {{the mix of}} carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the undersized alleys was subject to frequent traffic jams and gridlock. During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled in vain to move in towards it.|$|E

5|$|Trollope leapt {{into the}} fray {{somewhat}} belatedly, {{in the pages of}} Saint Paul's in October 1869, with an article on the Formosa controversy that can be read as a defence of and an advertisement for The Vicar. He took exception to several of the arguments in The Times: young women of the 1860s, he wrote, were not unaware of the existence of prostitution; and attempting to keep them in ignorance would not conduce to virtue. Rather than promoting vice, an accurate depiction of the squalid and miserable life of a woman <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> would arm young people to resist temptation.|$|E
5|$|A {{combination}} of Federal and State funding was obtained, {{and despite the}} controversy over the number of stops and route, a groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 27, 1972 at Second Avenue and 103rd Street. Construction began shortly thereafter on what was to be the 99th–105th Streets segment, which was projected to cost $17.48 million (worth about $ today). However, the city soon experienced its most dire fiscal crisis yet, due to the stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs, and in September 1975 construction on the line stopped, and the tunnels were sealed. Over the next few decades, the MTA regularly inspected and maintained the tunnel segments (spending $20,000 a year by the early 1990s), to maintain the structural integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> above, and in case construction would ever resume. Trespassers would often camp in the tunnels until the MTA increased security.|$|E
5|$|Bath Abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th century and became a {{religious}} centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties {{of water from the}} springs, and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era. Georgian architecture, crafted from Bath stone, includes the Royal Crescent, Circus, Pump Room and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> and squares were laid out by John Wood, the Elder, and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{horseshoe}} numbering scheme, {{starting from}} one end, the buildings on <b>the</b> right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> were numbered sequentially from the near end to <b>the</b> far end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>The</b> next number was then {{assigned to the}} last building on the left, opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>the</b> following numbers sequentially doubling back along <b>the</b> left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>The</b> building with the highest number {{would be the first}} on the left side, facing building number 1 across <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>The</b> horseshoe numbering system remains in use in older streets in many German cities, notably Berlin, although newer adjoining streets may use modern European numbering. Kurfürstendamm in Berlin is a well-known example <b>of</b> a <b>street</b> where <b>the</b> horseshoe numbering scheme is still in use, although the numbering today starts with 11 at Breitscheidplatz, with number 237 across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> being <b>the</b> highest number.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of}} town was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
5|$|The Tree Streets is {{a network}} of streets in the Mount Pleasant portion of the village. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> are named after {{regional}} trees, including Satinwood Lane, Larch Road, and Oak Road. A number of houses in the neighborhood were constructed during a 1930s building boom, circling Jackson Park and near Todd Elementary School. The Crossroads {{is a group of}} 84 houses on streets named after local World War II veterans, including Schrade Road, Hazelton Circle, Matthes Road, and Dunn Lane. It was constructed at the end of World War II to provide affordable housing to returning veterans, and was completed in 1952.|$|E
5|$|In {{his senior}} season, the Vols {{opened the season}} with {{victories}} against Texas Tech and UCLA, but {{for the third time}} in his career, Manning fell to Florida 33–20. The Vols won the rest of their regular season games, finishing 10–1, and advanced to the SEC Championship game against Auburn. Down 20–7 in the second quarter, Manning led the Vols to a 30–29 comeback victory. Throwing for four touchdowns, he was named the game's MVP, but injured himself in the process. The #3 Vols were matched-up with #2 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl; if Tennessee won and top-ranked Michigan lost to Washington State in the Rose Bowl, the Vols would have won the national championship. However, the Vols' defense could not stop Nebraska's rushing attack, giving up over 400rushing yards in a 42–17 loss. As a senior, Manning won numerous awards; he was a consensus first-team All-American, the Maxwell Award winner, the Davey O'Brien Award winner, the Johnny Unitas Award winner, and the Best College Player ESPY award winner, among others. In 2005, Tennessee retired Manning's number (No. 16). One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> leading to Neyland Stadium has been renamed Peyton Manning Pass. While at the University of Tennessee, Manning excelled academically and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa Society in 1997 and awarded the National Football Foundation National Scholar-Athlete Award.|$|E
