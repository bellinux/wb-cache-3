The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime.

5|$|Typhoon Abe, {{known as}} Typhoon Iliang in the Philippines, was the fourteenth named storm of 1990 Pacific typhoon season. Forming on August23 from a {{tropical}} disturbance, the depression which would eventually develop into Typhoon Abe initially tracked {{in a steady}} west-northwestward direction. As {{a result of an}} intense monsoon surge, Abe's trajectory briefly changed to an eastward then northward path before returning to its original track. Abe only intensified by a small amount between 00:00UTC August24 and 06:00UTC August27 due to the disruptive effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surge,</b> and on August30, Abe peaked in intensity as a Category2-equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. After peaking in intensity, Abe crossed the Ryukyu Islands and the East China Sea, making landfall in China where it affected the provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu before entering the Yellow Sea, crossing South Korea, and finally transitioning into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
