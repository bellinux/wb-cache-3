The default way of reporting speech in Koine Greek is directly. Typically, when using direct speech, the reporter purports to reproduce the original speech verbatim.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{introduces}} {{aspects of}} an innovative method towards {{the development of}} a hybrid part <b>orienter.</b> Focusing on the principle of minimalism, we investigate the use of overhead pins of various classes over a slow moving conveyor to orient polygonal planar parts. We implement a simple planner that yields sequences of static passive pins to orient a given part from a random initial state to a final orientation set. We also encounter cases in which a single final orientation is not found, and thus, we introduce the use of a force/torque sensor (static active pin) to help distinguish between the possible orientations and be able to tell which results. Limitations in orienting parts with overhead pins exist due to the complexity of the problem. Therefore, the purpose of our work is to serve as an initial study towards developing a part feeder that uses a new class of orienting devices, such as overhead pins...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{special issue}} is centred upon a key mode of {{political}} regulation : {{how and why}} state representatives create markets when seeking to tackle a public problem. Our introduction is organized around two questions. The first deals with the generalization of this phenomenon as of the 1980 s; the second tackles {{the effects of this}} trend, notably in terms of the capacity of state representatives to impact upon economic and social regulation. Drawing upon the contributions made in the rest of this special issue, here two lines of analysis are developed. Firstly, we claim that because most of the creation of “state markets” builds upon previous bureaucratic practices, such as delegations of public authority, these instruments are not highly innovatory. Indeed, they are generally not the result of some over-arching, top-down design, but rather the progressively generated outcome of sector-specific experimentations. Secondly, we seek to go beyond overgeneral conclusions about the effects of states’ markets upon governmental influence and practice. One set of authors sees these markets as always strengthening the state through a process of “government at a distance”, whereas another instead sees these same markets as the sign of states that have given up power to economic actors. Considering that responses to this question need more empirical research, we claim instead that the effects of state markets can only be fully evaluated by taking into account the segment of the state involved and the precise types of market instruments they have respectively developed. Ce dossier prend pour objet une modalité de régulation politique centrale, celle par laquelle les agents de l’État, pour prendre en charge un problème public, initient un marché. La réflexion s’organise autour de deux questions : la première traite de la généralisation, à partir des années 1980, de cette pratique gouvernementale; la seconde porte sur ses effets, notamment la contribution des agents de l’État à peser sur les régulations économiques et sociales. Prenant pour appui les études de cas que regroupe ce dossier, cette introduction suggère deux lignes d’analyse : la première est que cette modalité de régulation, qui puise principalement dans les phénomènes traditionnels de délégation (privé et public), présente une faible innovation instrumentale. Son essor résulte non pas tant d’un grand dessein politique, mais davantage d’une série d’expérimentations qui ont gagné des secteurs toujours plus nombreux. Rejetant le débat clivé entre gouvernement à distance versus désengagement de l’État, la seconde ligne d’analyse est que la capacité de cette modalité de régulation politique à <b>orienter</b> les comportements des individus dépend de l’autonomie du segment administratif qui la porte, ainsi que des instruments que leurs agents développent...|$|E
40|$|Local {{organizations}} {{have witnessed the}} changes in French rural areas for over a century. Long ignored, they are currently in demand {{in the implementation of}} government policy regarding rural development. Local {{organizations have}} been asked or asked to advance participative democracy from the first local contracts in the 70 ’s to the LOADDT including the European LEADER program. They have been active in facilitating the setting up of common regional projects. This thesis deals with the relationship of local organizations with local communities and the way they are involved in development procedures. In the analysis of the setting up of local organizations we have adopted a socio-spatial approach to the network of organizations created. Government policy on rural development, by asking local organizations to participate, will interact {{to a greater or lesser}} degree with these organizations and cause them to redefine themselves. The political sphere chosen by the local elected officials will influence the socio-spatial configurations of the organizations and guide their involvement in the setting up of the regional project. Whether volunteered or requested, their involvement will vary according to the guidelines followed in the setting up of the regional plan by the local elected officials and project managers. This analytical model has been applied to Pays Quercy -Rouergue, a regional project which was never implemented, which led to the modifications in the LOADDT. Depuis plus d'un siècle, les associations accompagnent les changements que vivent les espaces ruraux français. Longtemps laissées à l’écart, elles sont aujourd'hui très sollicitées dans la mise en œuvre de l'action publique de développement rural. Des premiers contrats de pays des années 1970 à la LOADDT de 1999, en passant par le programme européen LEADER, les associations sont invitées, ou s’invitent, pour faire vivre une démarche de démocratie participative. Elles se mobilisent afin de faciliter la construction d'un projet partagé de territoire. Cette thèse s’interroge sur le rôle du rapport au territoire dans les modalités d’implication des associations dans ces procédures de développement. En analysant les processus de construction des mondes associatifs, nous proposons une lecture socio-spatiale de la nébuleuse associative. L’action publique de développement rural, en sollicitant les associations, va interagir, plus ou moins fortement, avec ces mondes associatifs et les amener à se redéfinir. L’espace politique choisi par les élus, va entrer en résonance avec les configurations socio-spatiales associatives et <b>orienter</b> les modalités d’implication des associations dans la construction du projet territorial.

40|$|When {{presented}} with a light cue followed by food, some rats simply approach the foodcup (Nonorienters), while others first orient to the light in addition to displaying the food-cup approach behavior (<b>Orienters).</b> Cue-directed orienting may reflect enhanced attentional and/or emotional processing of the cue, suggesting divergent natures of cue-information processing in <b>Orienters</b> and Nonorienters. The current studies investigate how differences in cue processing might manifest in appetitive memory retrieval and updating using a paradigm developed to persistently attenuate fear responses (Retrieval-extinction paradigm; Monfils et al., 2009). First, we examined whether the retrieval-extinction paradigm could attenuate appetitive responses in <b>Orienters</b> and Nonorienters. Next, we investigated if the appetitive memory could be updated using reversal learning (fear conditioning) during the reconsolidation window (as opposed to repeated unreinforced trials, i. e. extinction). Both extinction and new fear learning given within the reconsolidation window were effective at persistently updating the initial appetitive memory in the <b>Orienters,</b> but not the Nonorienters. Since conditioned orienting is mediated by the amygdala central nucleus (CeA), our final experiment examined the CeA’s role in the retrieval-extinction process. Bilateral CeA lesions interfered with the retrieval-extinction paradigm—did not prevent spontaneous recovery of food-cup approach. Together, our studies demonstrate the critical role of conditioned orienting behavior and the CeA in updating appetitive memory during the reconsolidation window...|$|R

New {{words are}} often {{a good way to}} prepare a hearty fight about issues "Automation", as a word, is eight years old. As a fact, some say it is just another phase of good old technological progress, and manage to trace its origins centuries away. Others maintain that "automation" is the second, or even the third "Industrial Revolution", that some of its characteristics are so dramatic as to leave man gasping for breath. On the one side, automation has been prepared by decades of research experimentation, and will not be in full swing before other decades; so, better let things take care of themselves, or even accelerate the process, since only good things for mankind can come out of technological "progress". On the other side, there is a solid regard for the marvels of technology, and, it seems, a genuine belief in the overall goodness of its long-run effects: more job opportunities, better products at lower prices for more people, and so on; but, as is quickly pointed out, "in the long run we are all dead", and no one has ever dared tell how "short" are the "short-run" effects, social, economic, psychological, and so on, of a given phase of the technological evolution. But before the fight gains in heat and size, it may be useful to have a quick look at what the fight is about, namely, the technical aspects of "automation' as it stands today.

40|$|Our {{research}} work {{is focused on}} innovation and more specifically {{on the role of}} information in the product's conception process. Web 2. 0 is quickly growing because contents are mostly generated by users and it represents now a wide and borderless source of information {{that can be used for}} innovation purposes. If Web improved information search techniques in technological and competitive surveys, we argue that Web 2. 0 allow a better knowledge of customers needs and expectations. We propose in this thesis a qualitative and quantitative analysis of information generated or relayed by Web 2. 0 users regarding their relevance into the innovation process. Our experiments deal with the study of Social Bookmarking and especially the Delicious. com Web application that allows users to memorize and share their bookmarks' lists. We would show that regarding to the increasing volume of information indexed by search engines, exploring this co-constructed directory offers a significant improvement in Web information retrieval. We also work on the social aspect of social bookmarking by proposing a way to sort participants in order to detect expert or influent users on a particular subject. Our study related to users comments on Amazon. com shows that customers are more and more involved into the innovation process of companies by providing them interesting and relevant comments about the product they bought. We therefore recommend meanings to extract then to analysis those customers feedbacks to improve the way that products are conceived. Finally, we define an innovation method that consists in setting up a permanent survey of Web 2. 0 activities then to produce a document named " expectations notes ". that could be used for directing the further innovation processes. Nos travaux de recherche portent sur l'innovation et plus particulièrement sur le rôle de l'information dans la conception de produits.

40|$|Le {{processus}} de conception d'une situation de travail résulte de la coopération de plusieurs acteurs (opérateurs, concepteurs, ergonomes). À travers trois études, nous illustrons le fait que les résultats de l'analyse de l'activité sont essentiels pour <b>orienter</b> le processus de conception, mais aussi pour favoriser la coopération des acteurs. La première étude met l'accent sur l'intérêt d'une analyse de l'activité collective en vue de la définition des nouvelles salles de régulation du trafic urbain. La deuxième étude souligne l'intérêt pour les concepteurs de réaliser l'évaluation d'un système d'assistance en situation réaliste d'utilisation. La troisième étude montre le rôle moteur que joue l'analyse de l'activité aux différentes phases d'un processus de conception informatique. This {{article is}} based on three empirical studies carried out in different work environments: metropolitan traffic control, car driving and software design. The article illustrates how ergonomics can contribute to different stages of design processes. Activity-centered design is described first. Designing truly supportive technologies requires an understanding of the user's actual activity. Therefore, it is necessary for ergonomists to collect data on natural work situations and to propose descriptions (sometime models) which are useful to cooperate with designers. Ergonomie studies may be carried out throughout the whole design process or they may be developed at specific stages of the process. The first study emphasizes the significance of analyzing collective work in order to define future metropolitan traffic control rooms. The characteristics of the collective handling of disruptions in traffic control rooms orients the design of new tools favouring cooperation and communications. We briefly present one of the proposais we have put forward: a device enhancing the computer system that is able to support the individual monitoring of an incident, as well as the collaborative supervision of train movements. The second study stresses the relevance of considering the evaluation of a support system in a realistic situation. The purpose was to evaluate how the drivers assimilated the "Autonomous Intelligent Cruise Control" System in their activities, and the actual support provided to them by the system. The methodology consisted in the observation of the drivers' behaviour during a highway trip of 900 km. The results of the activity analysis and the ergonomie approach allowed modifications of the designers' views on several points. In short, we have stressed the role of the driver throughout the design process, and demonstrated the limitations of the designers' views. The last study shows the importance of activity analysis in the different phases of a software design process. This study is an important illustration of how participants cooperate and how this cooperation evolves at each step of the process. Cooperation between the participants is studied in relation to a particular programme (the definition of a design methodology for a software help package). Three phases are detalled: the definition phase of the functional requirements, based on the analysis of the activity, in order to favour innovating proposais; the specification phase, based on a modeling of the activity (in our case, the modeling of human help), aimed at a precise software model, complete and consistent with the user's needs; the design phase, aimed at the definition of technical solutions consistent with the functional requirements. This latter phase saw the design of a dialogue prototype from which an ergonomie experiment was developed. In conclusion, we stress the need for collaboration between all the participants in the design process: users, ergonomists and designers who will need to confront and coordinate their points of view in seeking to transform the "work situation". Such cooperation has a strong influence on the behaviour of all the participants: the designer should broaden his or her approach, and should not adhere to a purely technical vision; the user, on the other hand, is not a mere executant, and should be involved in the different phases of the design; and the ergonomist cannot be concerned only with the end product, but has to be involved as early as possible in the design phase...|$|E
