If sued for {{copyright}} infringement, one {{can rely on}} fair dealing as a defence in court, but the defence [...] "only comes into play once a claimant has established that copyright has been infringed. Where this occurs, the <b>onus</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> [...] falls on the defendant to prove {{that one of the}} exceptions applies". This is done first by proving that the infringement falls within one of the three categories, which are liberally interpreted by the courts. The courts will not, however, give any consideration to what the infringer thought his work was for, or rely on a subjective test in any way; as in Hyde Park Residence v Yelland, it is not seen as necessary [...] "for the court to put itself in the shoes of the infringer of the copyright". Instead, a more objective test is used, to avoid providing [...] "any encouragement to the notion that all that is required is for the user to have a sincere belief, however misguided, {{that he or she is}} criticising a work or reporting current affairs".|$|E
2500|$|Until August 2010, WikiLeaks was {{hosted by}} PRQ, a Sweden-based company {{providing}} [...] "highly secure, no-questions-asked hosting services". PRQ {{is said to}} have [...] "almost no information about its clientele and maintains few if any of its own logs". Currently, WikiLeaks is hosted mainly by the Swedish Internet service provider Bahnhof in the Pionen facility, a former nuclear bunker in Sweden. Other servers are spread around the world with the main server located in Sweden. Julian Assange has said that the servers are located in Sweden (and the other countries) [...] "specifically because those nations offer legal protection to the disclosures made on the site". He talks about the Swedish constitution, which gives the information providers total legal protection. It is forbidden according to Swedish law for any administrative authority to make inquiries about the sources of any type of newspaper. These laws, and the hosting by PRQ, make it difficult for any authorities to eliminate WikiLeaks; they place an <b>onus</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> upon any complainant whose suit would circumscribe WikiLeaks' liberty, e.g. its rights to exercise free speech online. Furthermore, [...] "WikiLeaks maintains its own servers at undisclosed locations, keeps no logs and uses military-grade encryption to protect sources and other confidential information." [...] Such arrangements have been called [...] "bulletproof hosting".|$|E
2500|$|One of Anthony Flew's most {{influential}} professional works was his 1976 The Presumption of Atheism in which Flew forwarded {{the proposition that}} the question of God's existence should begin with the Presumption of Atheism:"What I want to examine is the contention that the debate about the existence of God should properly begin from the presumption of atheism, that the <b>onus</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> must lie upon the theist. The word 'atheism', however, has in this contention to be construed unusually. Whereas nowadays the usual meaning of 'atheist' in English is 'someone who asserts {{that there is no such}} being as God, I want the word to be understood not positively but negatively... in this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist.The introduction of this new interpretation of the word 'atheism' may appear to be a piece of perverse Humpty-Dumptyism, going arbitrarily against established common usage. 'Whyever', it could be asked, don't you make it not the presumption of atheism but the presumption of agnosticism?Flew's proposal to change his profession's use of the term atheism saw limited acceptance in the 20th century, but in the early 21st century Flew's negative sense of 'atheism' came to be forwarded more commonly. The impact of Flew's proposed negative atheism, which is often referred to today as 'weak atheism' or 'soft atheism', is illustrated by analytic Philosopher William Lane Craig's 2007 assessment that the Presumption of Atheism had become [...] "one of the most commonly proffered justifications of atheism." [...] And BBC journalist William Crawley 2010 analysis: [...] "The Presumption of Atheism (1976) made the case, now followed by today's new atheism, that atheism should be the ... default position". In recent debates, atheists often forward the Presumption of Atheism referring to atheism as the [...] "default position" [...] or has [...] "no burden of proof" [...] or asserting that the burden of proof rests solely on the theist.|$|E

60|$|There {{are evident}} in Europe four or five or more very {{distinct}} racial types, and since the methods and rewards of barbaric warfare {{and the nature of}} the chief chattels of barbaric trade have always been diametrically opposed to racial purity, their original separation could only have gone on through such an entire lack of communication as prevented either trade or warfare between the bulk of the differentiating bodies. These original racial types are now inextricably mingled. Unobservant, over-scholarly people talk or write in the profoundest manner about a Teutonic race and a Keltic race, and institute all sorts of curious contrasts between these phantoms, but these are not races at all, if physical characteristics have anything to do with race. The Dane, the Bavarian, the Prussian, the Frieslander, the Wessex peasant, the Kentish man, the Virginian, the man from New Jersey, the Norwegian, the Swede, and the Transvaal Boer, are generalized about, for example, as Teutonic, while the short, dark, cunning sort of Welshman, the tall and generous Highlander, the miscellaneous Irish, the square-headed Breton, and any sort of Cornwall peasant are Kelts within the meaning of this oil-lamp anthropology.[44] People who believe in this sort of thing are not the sort of people that one attempts to convert by a set argument. One need only say the thing is not so; there is no Teutonic race, and there never has been; there is no Keltic race, and there never has been. No one has ever proved or attempted to prove the existence of such races, the thing has always been assumed; they are dogmas with nothing but questionable authority behind them, and the <b>onus</b> <b>of</b> <b>proof</b> rests on the believer. This nonsense about Keltic and Teutonic is no more science than Lombroso's extraordinary assertions about criminals, or palmistry, or the development of religion from a solar myth. Indisputably there are several races intermingled in the European populations--I am inclined to suspect the primitive European races may be found to be so distinct as to resist confusion and pamnyxia through hybridization--but there is no inkling of a satisfactory analysis yet that will discriminate what these races were and define them in terms of physical and moral character. The fact remains there is no such thing as a racially pure and homogeneous community in Europe distinct from other communities. Even among the Jews, according to Erckert and Chantre and J. Jacobs, there are markedly divergent types, there may have been two original elements and there have been extensive local intermixtures.|$|E

The methodology and associated metrics are ascertained through a case study, an ASIC for a safety-critical gas burner control system, recently certified to be compliant to EN 298 safety standard. 1...|$|R

The following question is asked: Should the accused bear the <b>onus</b> <b>of</b> showing {{that his or her}} fundamental right has been infringed during the evidence gathering process, or should the prosecution bear the burden of proving that the disputed evidence has been obtained in a constitutional manner? South African case law and the opinions of scholarly writers are incompatible on this issue. This article explores the conflicting lines of reasoning followed by the Supreme Court of Appeal in Director of Public Prosecutions, Transvaal v Viljoen, and the full bench decision of the Transvaal Provincial Division (now Northern Gauteng) in S v Mgcina. The author concludes that, having regard to a contextual interpretation of s 35 (5) and the textual differences between s 24 (2) of the Canadian Charter and s 35 (5), the accused should not be saddled with a threshold burden. The prosecution should therefore bear the <b>onus</b> <b>of</b> showing that the evidence has been obtained in a constitutional manner, once the accused alleges that it has been obtained in violation of his or her rights...|$|R
