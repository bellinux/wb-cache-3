50|$|The {{instrument}} {{is designed to}} be a versatile camera capable of imaging astronomical targets over a very wide wavelength range and with a large field of view. It is a fourth-generation instrument for Hubble. The instrument has two independent light paths: an <b>optical</b> <b>channel</b> that uses a pair of charge-coupled devices (CCD) to record images from 200 nm to 1000 nm; and a near infrared detector array that covers the wavelength range from 800 to 1700 nm. Both channels have a variety of broad and narrow-band filters, as well as prisms and grisms, which enable wide-field, very-low-resolution spectroscopy that is useful for surveys.

50|$|An {{opto-isolator}} {{contains a}} source (emitter) of light, almost always a near {{infrared light-emitting diode}} (LED), that converts electrical input signal into light, a closed <b>optical</b> <b>channel</b> (also called dielectrical channel), and a photosensor, which detects incoming light and either generates electric energy directly, or modulates electric current flowing from an external power supply. The sensor can be a photoresistor, a photodiode, a phototransistor, a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) or a triac. Because LEDs can sense light in addition to emitting it, construction of symmetrical, bidirectional opto-isolators is possible. An optocoupled solid state relay contains a photodiode opto-isolator which drives a power switch, usually a complementary pair of MOSFETs. A slotted optical switch contains a source of light and a sensor, but its <b>optical</b> <b>channel</b> is open, allowing modulation of light by external objects obstructing the path of light or reflecting light into the sensor.|$|E
5000|$|Virtual {{dark fibre}} using {{wavelength}} multiplexing allows a service provider to offer individual wavelengths ("lambdas" [...] (λ) or [...] "colors"), where {{access to a}} dark narrowband wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) <b>optical</b> <b>channel</b> is provided over a wavelength division multiplexed fibre network that is managed at the physical level, but unlit by the network provider. This is typically done using coarse wavelength division multiplexing CWDM because the wider 20 nm spacing of the wave bands makes these systems much less susceptible to interference.|$|E
50|$|All opto-isolators {{described}} {{so far are}} uni-directional. <b>Optical</b> <b>channel</b> always works one way, {{from the}} source (LED) to the sensor. The sensors, be it photoresistors, photodiodes or phototransistors, cannot emit light. But LEDs, like all semiconductor diodes, are capable of detecting incoming light, which makes possible construction of a two-way opto-isolator {{from a pair of}} LEDs. The simplest bidirectional opto-isolator is merely a pair of LEDs placed face to face and held together with heat-shrink tubing. If necessary, the gap between two LEDs can be extended with a glass fiber insert.|$|E
40|$|Optical {{technologies}} {{can support}} thousands of high bandwidth <b>optical</b> <b>channels</b> to/from a single CMOS integrated circuit, and can thus {{allow for the}} construction of novel bandwidth-intensive computing architectures which are no longer constrained by conventional electronic wiring limitations. In this paper, the architecture of a dynamically reconfigurableIntelligent Optical Backplaneis described. The backplane consists {{of a large number of}} parallel <b>optical</b> <b>channels</b> (typically 1000 – 10, 000 bits) spaced a few hundred micrometers apart. The <b>optical</b> <b>channels</b> are arranged into upstream and downstream rings, where the channel access protocols are implemented by “smart pixel arrays. ” The architecture exploits thebandwith advantageof the optical domain and can be dynamically reconfigured to embed conventional interconnection networks, including multiple busses, rings, and meshes. Unlike all-optical and passive optical systems, the proposed backplane is intelligent and can support communication primitives used in shared memory multiprocessing, including broadcasting, multicasting, acknowledgment, flow and error-control, buffering, shared memory caching, and synchronization. The backplane is also manufacturable using existing optoelectronic technologies. A second generation backplane supporting a distributed shared memory multi-processor is under development...|$|R

50|$|In FλS, {{likewise}} in TDS, all packets in {{the same}} time frame are switched {{in the same}} way. Consequently, header processing is not required, which results in low complexity (hence high scalability) and enables optical implementation. The TF is the basic SVP capacity allocation unit; hence, the allocation granularity depends on the number of TFs per time cycle. For example, with a 10 Gbit/s <b>optical</b> <b>channel</b> and 1000 TFs in each time cycle, the minimum FλP capacity (obtained by allocating one TF in every time cycle) is 10 Mbit/s.|$|E
50|$|Optical burst {{switching}} (OBS) is {{an optical}} networking technique that allows dynamic sub-wavelength switching of data. OBS {{is viewed as}} a compromise between the yet unfeasible full optical packet switching (OPS) and the mostly static optical circuit switching (OCS). It differs from these paradigms because OBS control information is sent separately in a reserved <b>optical</b> <b>channel</b> and in advance of the data payload. These control signals can then be processed electronically to allow the timely setup of an optical light path to transport the soon-to-arrive payload. This is known as delayed reservation.|$|E

NICMOS contains three near-infrared detectors in three optical channels providing high (~ 0.1 arcsecond) resolution, coronagraphic and polarimetric imaging, and slitless spectroscopy in 11-, 19-, and 52-arcsecond square fields of view.

The system can operate in optical or radar mode and can switch between these modes during an engagement. A pulse-doppler search radar {{with a range of}} 15-18 km detects the target which can then be tracked either by the tracking radar or an optical tracker. The <b>optical</b> <b>channel</b> would normally be employed only in daylight against very low-level targets or in a heavy jamming environment.|$|E
5000|$|Liquid crystal {{switching}} avoids {{both the}} high cost of small volume MEMS fabrication and potentially some of its fixed channel limitations. The concept is illustrated in Figure 3 (to be uploaded). [...] A diffraction grating breaks the incoming light into a spectrum. A software controlled binary liquid crystal stack, individually tilts each <b>optical</b> <b>channel</b> and a second grating (or a second pass of the first grating) is used to spectrally recombine the beams. The offsets created by the liquid crystal stack cause the resulting spectrally recombined beams to be spatially offset, and hence to focus, through a lens array, into separate fibers. Polarization diversity optics ensures low Polarization Dependent Losses (PDL).|$|E
50|$|Opto-isolators {{rated for}} 2.5 to 6 kV employ a {{different}} layout called silicone dome.

The LED, the sensor and the gap between them are encapsulated in a blob, or dome, of transparent silicone. The dome acts as a reflector, retaining all stray light and reflecting it onto the surface of the sensor, minimizing losses in a relatively long <b>optical</b> <b>channel.</b> In double mold designs the space between the silicone blob ("inner mold") and the outer shell ("outer mold") is filled with dark dielectric compound with a matched coefficient of thermal expansion.|$|E
