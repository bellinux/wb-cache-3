40|$|Earned Value Management (EVM) {{has been}} a {{well-known}} methodology used since the 1960 s when the US department of defense proposed a standard method to measure project perfor-mance. This system relies {{on a set of}} often straightforward metrics to measure and evaluate the general health of a project. These metrics serve as early warning signals to timely detect project problems, or to exploit project opportunities. A key aspect of EVM is to estimate the completion cost of a project by considering both cost and schedule performance indices. However, good performance of cost and schedule performance indices does not necessarily guarantee cost effec-tiveness of the project regardless of the <b>overhead</b> <b>costs.</b> The reason is because, in most project-based organizations, <b>overhead</b> <b>costs</b> constitute a significant proportion of the total costs. Howev-er, EVM indices are usually calculated {{in the absence of the}} so-called <b>overhead</b> <b>costs.</b> This paper, first, seeks to remedy this problem by proposing a practical procedure of allocating <b>overhead</b> <b>costs</b> in project-based organizations.
