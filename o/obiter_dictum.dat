25|$|Vellama {{subsequently}} {{abandoned her}} application for the mandatory order but proceeded with her application for the declaration in the High Court. On 1 August 2012, the High Court dismissed her application. Dissatisfied, she {{appealed to the}} Court of Appeal which dismissed her appeal on 5 July 2013. However, in an <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum,</b> the Court of Appeal agreed with her interpretation of Article 49(1) of the Constitution rather than the Prime Minister's interpretation.|$|E
25|$|In this case, the claimants let a {{block of}} flats to the {{defendants}} at an annual rent of £2500. However, they agreed to accept a reduction in rent to £1250, because the defendants were unable to find enough tenants due to the evacuation of London during World War II. This promise to accept a lesser rent was unsupported by consideration. At {{the end of the}} war the flats became fully let, and the claimants demanded the return to payment of full rent. Denning J held that they were entitled to this from the last two quarters of 1945. Denning mentioned in an <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum</b> that had the plaintiffs tried to be reimbursed for the full amount they would have been estopped from doing so even though no consideration was present. This is because the plaintiff represented that he would accept half the rent and the defendant acted upon this.|$|E
500|$|The {{question}} of the citizenship status of U.S.-born children of alien parents had, up to this time, never been decided by the Supreme Court. [...] The U.S. government argued that Wong's claim to U.S. citizenship was ruled out by the Supreme Court's interpretation of jurisdiction in its 1873 Slaughterhouse Cases ruling, but the district judge concluded that the language in question was <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum</b> and not directly relevant to the case at hand. [...] The government also cited a similar statement in Elk v. Wilkins, but the judge was not convinced by this argument either.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court's 1873 Slaughterhouse Cases {{decision}} {{contained the}} statement that [...] "The phrase, 'subject to its jurisdiction,' was intended to exclude from its operation children of ministers, consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign states born within the United States." [...] However, since the Slaughterhouse Cases did not deal with claims of birthright citizenship, this comment was dismissed in Wong Kim Ark and later cases as a passing remark (<b>obiter</b> <b>dictum)</b> lacking any force as a controlling precedent. [...] As to whether the Wong Kim Ark was correct on this point or not, modern scholars are divided.|$|E
500|$|The {{protection}} of {{the free exercise of}} religion was also interpreted narrowly in early High Court judgments. [...] In 1912, the court in Krygger v Williams, held that a person could not object to compulsory military service on the ground of religious belief. The court considered that Section116 would only protect religious observance from government interference; it would not permit a person to be excused from a legal obligation merely because the obligation conflicted with his or her religious beliefs. In a 1929 case, Higgins, then a Justice of the High Court, suggested (as <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum)</b> that a person could lawfully object to compulsory voting on the grounds of religious belief. However, in 1943, the court continued the narrow approach it took in Krygger v Williams, upholding war-time regulations that caused the Adelaide branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses to be dissolved and have its property acquired by the Commonwealth government. The government had declared the branch to be an organisation whose activities were [...] "prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth": one of the branch's professed beliefs was that the government was an [...] "organ of Satan". Chief Justice John Latham held that the Constitution permitted the court to [...] "reconcile religious freedom with ordered government".|$|E

2500|$|This {{definition}} {{was overturned}} several times. The equality {{principles of the}} Indian Constitution void the patrilineal restrictions expressed in the third clause. The second clause was contested and overturned in 1948. [...] On appeal in 1950, the 1948 ruling was upheld and the entire 1909 definition was deemed an <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum</b> – a collateral opinion and not legally binding (re-affirmed in 1966). ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} {{the scope of the}} right, the Court wrote, in an <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum,</b> [...] "Although we do not {{undertake}} an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms." ...|$|E
2500|$|In R. (on the {{application}} of KM) v. Cambridgeshire County Council (2012), the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom declined to reconsider the case of Barry because any statement on the case would be merely an <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum.</b> However, Lady Hale suggested that Barry may have been [...] "widely misunderstood". According to her, insofar as the majority in Barry had thought that resources should be a relevant consideration in assessing {{the needs of the}} disabled person, they may have fallen into error; nevertheless, a closer analysis of the decision in Barry suggests that [...] "they did not fall into that error".|$|E
2500|$|Strictly speaking, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to enforce a floating charge at all - the charge must first crystallise into a fixed charge. [...] In the absence of any special provisions in the relevant document, a floating charge crystallises either upon the appointment of a receiver or upon the commencement of liquidation. [...] It has also been suggested, relying upon <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum</b> comments by Lord Macnaghten in Government Stocks and Securities Investments Co Ltd v Manila Rly Co that a charge should also crystallise upon the company ceasing to trade as a going concern. [...] However, this view is not yet supported by judicial authority.|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{categorical}} approach {{advocated by}} ex parte Coughlan, for a substantive legitimate expectation {{to be protected}} it had to fit into either category (a) or (c). However, classifying substantive legitimate expectations into distinct categories is difficult in cases where there are overlaps, leading Lord Justice Laws to suggest in ex parte Begbie that the categories mentioned in ex parte Coughlan are not [...] "hermetically sealed". In an <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum</b> in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005), Lord Justice Laws set out a more structured form of merits-based review. He expanded the categorical approach in ex parte Coughlan into a continuum based on proportionality, suggesting {{that in order for}} a public body's decision to resile from a legitimate expectation to be lawful, it must be [...] "a proportionate response to a legitimate aim pursued by the public body in the public interest".|$|E
2500|$|After the {{accident}} {{the port authority}} of Gibraltar obliged Anchor Line to light up the remains of Utopia. For a few days the wreck was illuminated by lights hoisted on each masthead. The precaution, however, did not prevent another incident: SS Primula, entering the harbour, collided with the wreck of Utopia. At the inquiry the crew of Primula {{said that they did}} see the lights, but not the ship. They recognized the masts and funnel protruding above the water when the collision was already inevitable. The court ruling on the second Utopia collision set a precedent of maritime law that remained in place for thirty-five years. Judge Sir Frances Jeune, contrary to established practice, absolved the owners of Utopia from liability because they had legitimately transferred [...] "control and management of the wreck" [...] to the Port of Gibraltar. In 1928 his <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum</b> was expressly overruled in Dee Conservancy Board vs. McConnell.|$|E
2500|$|The holding was an <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum,</b> that is, not {{required}} for the decision {{in the case and}} therefore not a binding precedent, though it may be persuasive in future cases. This was because the Court dismissed the appeal on the ground that the appellant, Madam Vellama, lacked standing. She had originally applied for judicial review in 2012 to ask the High Court to order the Prime Minister to call a by-election in Hougang Single Member Constituency following the expulsion of her Member of Parliament (MP) by his political party, the Workers' Party of Singapore. However, by the time the matter came on appeal, the 2012 by-election had been called and held. Therefore, she was arguably no longer directly affected by the lack of an MP in her constituency. Her only remaining interest was in having the Prime Minister correctly interpret Article 49(1) of the Constitution. This was a public right that she shared equally with all other citizens. Since she was unable to prove [...] "special damage"– she was neither affected to a greater extent nor in a different manner from other citizens– she did not have standing to proceed with the appeal.|$|E

60|$|A {{wonderful}} {{amount of}} controversial capital {{has been made}} out of my assertion in the note to which I have referred, as an <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum</b> of no consequence to my argument, that if Renan's work[71] were non-extant, the main results of biblical criticism, as {{set forth in the}} works of Strauss, Baur, Reuss, and Volkmar, for example, would not be sensibly affected. I thought I had explained it satisfactorily already, but it seems that my explanation has only exhibited still more of my native perversity, so I ask for one more chance.|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Munro, however, [...] "sees {{nothing against}} the supposition" [...] that [...] "Dr. Murray is right," [...] but Dr. Munro's {{remarks about the}} {{hypothesis}} of modern cairns, as a theory [...] "against which he sees nothing," [...] have the air of being an inadvertent <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum.</b> For, in his conclusion and summing up he writes, [...] "We claim to have established that the structures of Dunbuie, Dumbuck, and Langbank are remains of inhabited sites of the early-Iron Age, dating to some time between the fifth and twelfth centuries." [...] {46a} I accept this conclusion, and will say as little as may be about the theory of a modern origin of the sites, finally discarded by Dr. Munro. I say [...] "discarded," [...] for his {{theory is that the}} modern corporation utilised an earlier structure as a cairn or beacon, or boundary mark, which is perfectly possible. But, if this occurred, it does not affect the question, for this use of the structure has left no traces of any kind. There are no relics, except relics of the fifth (?) to twelfth (?) centuries.|$|E
6000|$|... "This case," [...] he said, {{as though}} he were giving judgment, [...] "is, doubtless, of a {{remarkable}} nature, and I cannot at the moment lay my hand upon any authority bearing on the point--if, indeed, any such are to be found. But I speak off-hand, and must not be held too closely to the <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum</b> of a viva voce opinion. It seems to me that, notwithstanding its peculiar idiosyncrasies, and the various 'cruces' that it presents, it will, upon closer examination, be found to fall within those general laws that govern the legal course of testamentary disposition. If I remember aright--I speak off-hand--the Act of 1. Vic., cap. 26, specifies that a will shall be in writing, and tattooing may fairly be defined as a rude variety of writing. It is, I admit, usual that writing should be done on paper or parchment, but I have no doubt that the young lady's skin, if carefully removed and dried, would make excellent parchment. At present, therefore, it is parchment in its green stage, and perfectly available for writing purposes.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Hartland's point, however, {{seems to}} be that, in the Making of Religion, I had {{selected}} certain Australian beliefs as especially [...] "sacred" [...] and to be distinguished from others, because they are inculcated at the religious Mysteries of some tribes. His aim, then, is to discover low, wild, immoral myths, inculcated at the Mysteries, and thus to destroy my line drawn between religion {{on one hand and}} myth or mere folk-lore on the other. Thus there is a being named Daramulun, of whose rites, among the Coast Murring, I condensed the account of Mr. Howitt.(1) From a statement by Mr. Greenway(2) Mr. Hartland learned that Daramulun's name is said to mean [...] "leg on one side" [...] or [...] "lame". He, therefore, with fine humour, speaks of Daramulun as [...] "a creator with a game leg," [...] though when [...] "Baiame" [...] is derived by two excellent linguists, Mr. Ridley and Mr. Greenway, from Kamilaroi baia, [...] "to make," [...] Mr. Hartland is by no means so sure of the sense of the name. It happens to be inconvenient to him! Let the names mean what they may, Mr. Hartland finds, in an <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum</b> of Mr. Howitt (before he was initiated), that Daramulun is said to have [...] "died," [...] and that his spirit is now aloft. Who says so, and where, we are not informed,(3) and the question is important.|$|E
6000|$|When Judge Webb {{argued that}} in matters of science ('falsely so called') Bacon and Shakespeare were identical, Professor Tyrrell, of Trinity College, Dublin, was shaken, and said so, in 'The Pilot.' Professor Dowden then proved, in 'The National Review,' that both Shakespeare and Bacon used the widely spread pseudo-scientific ideas of their time (as is conspicuously the case), and Mr. Tyrrell confessed that he was sorry he had spoken. 'When I read Professor Dowden's article, I would gladly have {{recalled}} my own, {{but it was too}} late.' Mr. Tyrrell adds, with an honourable naivete, 'I AM NOT VERSED IN THE LITERATURE OF THE SHAKESPEAREAN ERA, and I assumed that the Baconians who put forward the parallelisms had satisfied themselves that the coincidences were peculiar to the writings of the philosopher and the poet. Professor Dowden has proved that this is not so. [...] .' Professor Dowden has indeed proved, in copious and minute detail, what was already obvious to every student who knew even such ordinary Elizabethan books as Lyly's 'Euphues' and Phil Holland's 'Pliny,' and the speculations of such earlier writers as Paracelsus. Bacon and Shakespeare, like other Elizabethans, accepted the popular science of their period, and decorated their pages with queer ideas about beasts, and stones, and plants; which were mere folklore. A sensible friend of my own was staggered, if not converted, by the parallelisms adduced in Judge Webb's chapter 'Of Bacon as a Man of Science.' I told him that the parallelisms were Elizabethan commonplaces, and were not peculiar to Bacon and Shakespeare. Professor Dowden, out of the fulness of his reading, corroborated this <b>obiter</b> <b>dictum,</b> and his article (in 'The National Review,' vol. xxxix., 1902) absolutely disposes of the Judge's argument.|$|E
