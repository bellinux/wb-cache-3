500|$|Like all mouse lemurs, {{this species}} is nocturnal and arboreal. It is very active, {{and though it}} forages alone, groups {{of males and females}} form {{sleeping}} groups and share tree holes during the day. [...] It exhibits a form of dormancy called torpor during the cool, dry winter months, and in some cases undergoes seasonal torpor (or hibernation), which is unusual for primates. [...] The gray mouse lemur can be found in several types of forest throughout western and southern Madagascar. [...] Its diet consists primarily of fruit, insects, flowers, and nectar. [...] In the wild, its natural predators include owls, snakes, and endemic mammalian predators. [...] Predation pressure is higher for this species than among any other primate species, with <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>four</b> individuals taken by a predator each year. [...] This is counterbalanced by its high reproductive rate. [...] Breeding is seasonal, and distinct vocalizations are used to prevent hybridization with species that overlap its range. [...] Gestation lasts approximately 60days, and typically two young are born. [...] The offspring are usually independent in two months, and can reproduce after one year. [...] The gray mouse lemur has a reproductive lifespan of five years, although captive individuals have been reported to live up to 15years.|$|E
