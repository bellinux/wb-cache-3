Early rulers of the later Pahang Sultanate, which was established as a vassal to Melaka, promulgated court traditions based on the Melakan system as enshrined in both Undang-Undang Melaka and Undang-Undang Laut Melaka, and enforced the existing adat and religious rules to maintain social order. All rules, prohibitions and customs that have been codified as laws, were in turn collected through oral traditions and memorized by senior ministers.|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} investment and deployment of IT {{in the public}} sector, the topic of eGovernment is garnering interest among practitioners and researchers. In spite of the increased investment, public organizations are perceived to lag behind {{the private sector in}} terms of IT implementation and management. The salience and challenges of IT deployment in the public sector point to a greater need for research in eGovernment. However, this theme has largely been missing in mainstream IS research, with the majority of work <b>originating</b> from public <b>administration</b> scholars. This paper articulates various reasons for the lack of IS research in eGovernment and argues for increased research attention towards this topic. It summarizes the previous IS research and identifies differences between the private and public sectors that implicate work in this area.

40|$|Women {{continue}} to be under-represented in administrative positions in intercollegiate athletics. Women in this study offered unique insights into challenges they face in the field. This study explored career profiles and challenges facing women working in intercollegiate athletic administration. The subjects were women working in intercollegiate athletic administration across National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) divisions I, II, III; National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA); National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA); Junior Colleges; and Canadian Colleges. The study, which utilized the Female Sport Manager Career Survey, posed two research questions: (a) what are the profiles of females working in athletic administration?, and (b) what are the gender specific greatest challenges that women working in intercollegiate athletic administration face? This study included all 1834 women working in intercollegiate athletic administration listed by the National Directory of College Athletics in 2012, of which 28. 0 % (N= 514) provided usable responses. Frequencies were calculated for the demographics using SPSS 20. 0 and the qualitative {{data were analyzed using}} HyperResearch 2. 8. Several practical implications for women wanting to work in intercollegiate athletic <b>administration</b> <b>originated</b> from this study including developing networks, being prepared to balance work and family, being aware of stereotyping, and gaining as much experience as possible...|$|R
40|$|In this study, it {{is aimed}} to {{determine}} the reasons of organizational cynicism of {{the teachers in the}} secondary education and to reveal the effects of organizational cynicism. This study is important in terms of revealing the reasons and the effects of organizational cynicism which causes lots of negative attitudes and behaviours in organizations and in terms of providing suggestions to lessen its presence. It is a case study which belongs to qualitative design classification. The research sample consists of 21 teachers who have more than 10 years of teaching experience and are working in the secondary schools located in the center of Gaziantep province in 2012 - 2013 academic year. Data are gathered through interview method. Data are analyzed through descriptive and content analysis methods. In the data analysis process, a qualitative data analyze programme (ATLAS. ti 6) was utilized. Research results suggest that the reasons of organizational cynicism are <b>originating</b> from school <b>administration</b> (being unfair, not appreciating the teachers, not rewarding the teachers) and from teachers (not being pleased with the salary, the syndrome of being burnout, not having a suitable personality). In conclusion, it is revealed that education and instruction, cooperation in the school, the profession of teaching, commitment to school, motivation, professional burnout and performance are badly affected by organizational cynicism. Suggestions for practitioners and researchers are presented according to the findings of the study and the participants’ proposals in order to decrease organizational cynicis...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} medical {{self-government}} {{is connected with}} the development of the i 9 th-century idea of decentralizing administration. The source of this idea was the liberal doctrine that opted for constitutionalism and the rights and freedoms it guaranteed. The decentralization of <b>administration</b> <b>originated</b> in the conviction that a given group of citizens is {{able to take care of}} their own business and simultaneously consider the well-being of general public resulting from the tasks they were assigned. The idea of self-government, including a corporate self-government, appeared. Such modernizing processes took place in Prussia in the second half of the 19 th century. They were also present in the Polish lands incorporated by Prussia as a result of partition treaties, also in the Poznan Province. Poznan was also the first of the Polish cities under foreign rule that had its own medical self-government, the medical council. Medical councils were professional and self-governing organizations. They represented the professional interests of doctors before the authorities, they solved cases related to delivering medical services, they paid special attention to maintaining the dignity of medical profession and to the high standard of medical services provided in private practices. They also played a role of arbitration boards and solved disputes between physicians and institutions of citizens. During the councils meetings, the problems of spreading contagious diseases, introduction of vaccinations, functioning of health care institutions, issues concerning medical professions were discussed. The councils also examined the problems of prevention and hygiene in the province. Andrzej Grzybowsk...|$|R
40|$|Sodium 2, 3 -dimercapto- 1 -propane {{sulfonate}} (DMPS, Dimaval) is a water-soluble {{chelating agent}} {{that can be}} given by mouth or systemically and {{has been used to}} treat metal intoxication since the 1960 s in the former Soviet Union and since 1978 in Germany. To better approximate the body burdens of Hg and As in humans, DMPS-Hg andDMPS-As challenge tests have been developed. The tests involve collecting an overnight urine, administering 300 mg DMPS at zero time, collecting the urine from 0 to 6 hr, and determining the urinary Hg before and after DMPS is given. The challenge test, when applied to normal college student volunteers with and without amalgam restorations in their mouths, indicated that two-thirds of the Hg excreted in the urine after DMPS <b>administration</b> <b>originated</b> in their dental amalgams. In addition, there was a positive linear correlation between the amalgam score (a measure of amalgam surface) and urinary Hg after the challenge test. When the DMPS-Hg challenge test was used to study dental personnel occupationally exposed to Hg, the urinary excretion of Hg was 88, 49, and 35 times greater after DMPS administration than before administration in 10 dental technicians, 5 dentists, and 13 nondental personnel, respectively. DMPS also was used to measure the body burden of humans with a history of drinking water containing 600 microgram As/liter. DMPS administration resulted in a tripling of the monomethylarsonic acid percentage and a halving of the dimethylarsinic acid percentage as related to total urinary As. Because South American animals studied were deficient in arsenite methyltransferase, a hypothesis is presented that arsenite and arsenite methyltransferase may have had a role in the evolution of some South American animals...|$|R
40|$|Understanding whether {{regulation}} of tryptophan metabolites can ameliorate neurodegeneration is of high interest to investigators. A recent publication describes 3, 4 -dimethoxy-N-(4 -(3 -nitrophenyl) - 5 -(piperidin- 1 -ylmethyl) thiazol- 2 -yl) benzenesulfonamide (JM 6) as a novel prodrug for the kynurenine 3 -monooxygenase (KMO) in-hibitor 3, 4 -dimethoxy-N-(4 -(3 -nitrophenyl) thiazol- 2 -yl) benzenesul-fonamide (Ro- 61 - 8048) that elicits therapeutic effects in mouse models of Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases (Cell 145 : 863 – 874, 2011). Our {{evaluation of the}} metabolism and pharmacokinet-ics of JM 6 and Ro- 61 - 8048 indicate instead that Ro- 61 - 8048 con-centrations in mouse plasma after JM 6 <b>administration</b> <b>originate</b> from a Ro- 61 - 8048 impurity (< 0. 1 %) in JM 6. After a 0. 05 mg/kg Ro- 61 - 8048 oral dose alone or coadministered with 10 mg/kg JM 6 to mice, the Ro- 61 - 8048 areas under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) from 0 to infinity were similar (4300 and 4900 nM h, respectively), indicating no detectable contributions of JM 6 me-tabolism to the Ro- 61 - 8048 AUCs. JM 6 was stable in incubations under acidic conditions and Ro- 61 - 8048 was not a product of JM 6 metabolism in vitro (plasma, blood, or hepatic models). Species differences in the quantitative rate of oxidative metabolism indi-cate that major circulating JM 6 metabolite(s) in mice {{are unlikely to be}} major in humans: JM 6 is rapidly metabolized via the piperidyl moiety in mouse (forming an iminium ion reactive intermediate) but is slowly metabolized in human (in vitro), primarily via O-dealkyla-tion at the phenyl ring. Our data indicate that JM 6 is not a prodrug for Ro- 61 - 8048 and is not a potent KMO inhibitor...|$|R
40|$|The {{education}} and training module (ETM) in alertness management has now been integrated {{as part of the}} training regimen of the Pilot Proficiency Awards Program ("WINGS") of the Federal Aviation <b>Administration.</b> <b>Originated</b> and now maintained current by the Fatigue Countermeasures Group at NASA Ames Research Center, the ETM in Alertness Management is designed to give pilots the benefit of the best and most recent research on the basics of sleep physiology, the causes of fatigue, and strategies for managing alertness during flight operations. The WINGS program is an incentive program that encourages pilots at all licensing levels to participate in recurrent training, upon completion of which distinctive lapel or tie pins (wings) and certificates of completion are awarded. In addition to flight training, all WINGS applicants must attend at least one FAA-sponsored safety seminar, FAA-sanctioned safety seminar, or industry recurrent training program. The Fatigue Countermeasures Group provides an FAA-approved industry recurrent training program through an on-line General Aviation (GA) WINGS ETM in alertness management to satisfy this requirement. Since 1993, the Fatigue Countermeasures Group has translated fatigue and alertness information to operational environments by conducting two-day ETM workshops oriented primarily toward air-carrier operations subject to Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations pertaining to such operations. On the basis of the information presented in the two-day ETM workshops, an ETM was created for GA pilots and was transferred to a Web-based version. To comply with the requirements of the WINGS Program, the original Web-based version has been modified to include hypertext markup language (HTML) content that makes information easily accessible, in-depth testing of alertness-management knowledge, new interactive features, and increased informational resources for GA pilots. Upon successful completion of this training module, a participant receives a computer- screen display of a certificate of completion. The certificate, which includes the pilot s name and an identifying number, can be printed out and submitted, for ground training credit, with the pilot s WINGS application...|$|R
40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{fates of}} the synthetic surfactants, sodium [1 - 14 C]undecyltriethoxy sulphate and sodium [1 - 14 C]dodecyltriethoxy sulphate were {{studied in the}} rat. Both compounds were extensively metabolized regardless of the route of administration, oral, intraperitoneal or intravenous. Short-chain radioactive products were eliminated in the urine: the major metabolite of the dodecyl homologue in the urine was identified as −O 2 C 14 CH 2 - (OC 2 H 4) 3 OSO 3 − by n. m. r. and g. l. c. –mass spectrometry, whereas the major metabolite of the undecyl homologue in the urine was tentatively identified as −O 2 CCH 214 CH 2 - (OC 2 H 4) 3 OSO 3 −. In contrast with experiments with the dodecyl derivative, when [1 - 14 C]undecyltriethoxy sulphate was administered to rats, appreciable amounts of radioactivity were recovered as 14 CO 2 in expired air. Whole-body radioautography implicated the liver as the major site of metabolism of both surfactants. The nature of the metabolic products establishes that both compounds are degraded by ω,β-oxidation. Cleavage of the ether linkage proximal to the sulphate moiety {{may account for the}} small amounts of 14 CO 2 recovered in expired air after the administration of [1 - 14 C]dodecyltriethoxy sulphate. It is suggested the substantial amounts of 14 CO 2 recovered after [1 - 14 C]-undecyltriethoxy sulphate <b>administration</b> <b>originate</b> from −O 214 C(OC 2 H 4) 3 OSO 3 −, an unstable product of ω,β-oxidation.
