Reversing this process, if <b>one</b> augments a tree by {{connecting}} any two of its vertices by a new edge, {{the result is a}} 1-tree; the path in the tree connecting the two endpoints of the added edge, together with the added edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. If <b>one</b> augments a 1-tree by adding an edge that connects <b>one</b> of its vertices to a newly added vertex, the result is again a 1-tree, with <b>one</b> more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is to start with a single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number of times. The edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, <b>one</b> of which is a cycle and the other of which is a forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly <b>one</b> vertex of the cycle.|$|E
