We {{prove that the}} first-order theory <b>of</b> <b>Es</b> as a partial order is recursively isomorphic to the first-order theory of true arithmetic. Our coding <b>of</b> arithmetic in <b>Es</b> also shows that the Σ 30 -theory <b>of</b> <b>Es</b> as a lattice and the Σ 40 -theory <b>of</b> <b>Es</b> as a partial order are undecidable. Moreover, we show that the degree <b>of</b> <b>Es</b> as a lattice is 0 ‴ {{in the sense that}} 0 ‴ computes a presentation <b>of</b> <b>Es</b> and that every presentation <b>of</b> <b>Es</b> computes 0 ‴.
