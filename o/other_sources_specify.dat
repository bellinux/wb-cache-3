25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} {{differences between the}} original manuscripts and Mathers' edition. First, {{one of the four}} books was missing entirely from the French manuscript with which he worked. Second, Mathers gave the duration of the operation as six months, whereas all <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> <b>specify</b> eighteen months. Third, possibly due to a mistranslation, Mathers changed one of the ingredients within the recipe for Abramelin oil, specifying galangal instead of the original herb calamus. The oil in the German manuscript sources also contains cassia and is nearly identical to the biblical recipe for Holy anointing oil. The differences between the recipes cause several notable changes in the oil's characteristics, including edibility, fragrance, dermal sensation, and spiritual symbolism. Fourth, there are 242 word squares in Mathers' translation, while the original German has 251. Most of the squares in Mathers are not completely filled in, and those that are differ markedly from the German sources.|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{air quality}} model {{based on a}} set of chemical species mass conservation equations describes the time evolution of chemical species in the atmosphere. In order to solve this set of equations, proper choices of initial and boundary conditions are needed. Ideally, initial and boundary conditions should be determined on the basis of observations. However, since such high-resolution observations are generally not available, it becomes necessary to use <b>other</b> information <b>sources</b> to <b>specify</b> the initial and boundary values. The fact that both the initial and the boundary conditions are specified with some degree of presumption makes it important to evaluate their influence in the model results. In this paper we present a study of the impact of initial and boundary concentrations on the modelled surface ozone concentration over two environments: Huelva and Badajoz, an industrial and a rural zone, respectively. The impacts are analysed for the same meteorological period (10 &ndash; 15 August 2003) ...|$|R

40|$|This {{method is}} {{applicable}} to the determination of total reduced sulfur (TRS) emissions from recovery boilers, lime kilns, and smelt dissolving tanks at kraft pulp mills, and from <b>other</b> <b>sources</b> when <b>specified</b> in an applicable subpart of the regulations. The TRS compounds include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide. The flue gas must contain at least 1 percent oxygen for complete oxidation of all TRS to sulfur dioxide (SO 2). The lower detectable limit is 0. 1 ppm SO 2 when sampling at 2 liters/min for 3 hours or 0. 3 ppm when sampling at 2 liters/min for 1 hour. The upper concentration limit of the method exceeds TRS levels generally encountered at kraft pulp mills. 1. 2 Principle. An integrated gas sample is extracted from the stack. SO 2 is removed selectively from the sample using a citrate buffer solution. TRS compounds are then thermally oxidized to SO 2, collected in hydrogen peroxide as sulfate, and analyzed by the Method 6 barium-thorin titration procedure. Any modification of this method beyond those expressly permitted shall be considered a major modification subject to {{the approval of the}} Executive Officer. The term Executive Officer as used in this document shall mean the Executive Officer of the Air Resources Board (ARB), or his or her authorized representative. 1. 3 Interferences. TRS compounds other than those regulated by the emission standards, if present, may be measured by this method. Therefore, carbonyl sulfide, which is partially oxidized to SO 2 and may be present in a lime kiln exit stack, would be a positive interferant. Particulate matter from the lime kiln stack gas (primarily calcium carbonate) can cause a negative bias if it is allowed to enter the citrate scrubber; the particulate matter will cause the pH to rise and H 2 S to be absorbed prior to oxidation. Furthermore, if the calcium carbonate enters the hydrogen peroxide impingers, the calcium will precipitate sulfate ion. Proper use of the particulate filter described in Section 2. 1. 3 will eliminate this interference...|$|R
