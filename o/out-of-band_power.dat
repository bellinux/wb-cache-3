5000|$|Continuous phase {{modulation}} (CPM) {{is a method}} for modulation of data commonly used in wireless modems. In contrast to other coherent digital {{phase modulation}} techniques where the carrier phaseabruptly resets to zero {{at the start of}} every symbol (e.g. M-PSK), with CPM the carrier phase is modulated in a continuous manner. For instance, with QPSK the carrier instantaneously jumps from a sine to a cosine (i.e. a 90 degree phase shift) whenever one of the two message bits of the current symbol differs from the two message bits of the previous symbol. This discontinuity requires a relatively large percentage of the power to occur outside of the intended band (e.g., high fractional <b>out-of-band</b> <b>power),</b> leading to poor spectral efficiency. Furthermore, CPM is typically implemented as a constant-envelope waveform, i.e., the transmitted carrier power is constant.Therefore, CPM is attractive because the phase continuity yields high spectral efficiency, and the constant envelope yields excellent power efficiency. The primary drawback is the high implementation complexity required for an optimal receiver.|$|E

The sidelobes of the OFDM-modulated tones cause the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>power</b> which can induce large interference to the incumbent communication systems. Another major drawback of OFDM-based systems is the high peak-to-average power ratio. In this paper, we propose a scheme to jointly reduce the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>power</b> and the peak-to-average power ratio of the OFDM transmission. A subset of the frequency tones do not carry any data but are weighted and the time-domain OFDM symbol is expanded at both edges with a few adjusting chips. The joint reduction scheme is developed based on the low-complexity method of alternating projections onto convex sets. In a few iterations, the transmitter removes the large peaks of the time-domain OFDM signal and reduces the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>power.</b> The receiver detects the data on the subcarriers with little performance degradation.

40|$|Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) {{is one of}} the {{modulation}} {{techniques used}} in digital video broadcasting systems. A significant disadvantage of OFDM is that it has a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

One way to reduce the PAPR is to digitally limit the peak value before the signals reach the amplifier. Various clipping techniques have been described in the literature. This paper describes the application of the most effective of these techniques to the European digital video broadcasting system. It is shown that the PAPR can be reduced without significant increase in bit error rate.

Title: Spectrum Regrowth for OFDM-based LTE and WiMAX Systems. In OFDM-based (Orthogonal Frequency Dimension Multiplexing) LTE (Long Term Evolution) and WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) Systems, one of the critical components is the RF power amplifier. With current technologies, RF power amplifiers are not perfectly linear. The nonlinearity of an RF power amplifier {{is one of the}} main concerns in RF power amplifier design.
