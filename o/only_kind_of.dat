She argued {{that this kind of}} depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a sexist society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of [...] "occupation" [...] that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status as women.|$|E

2500|$|Many times an {{individual}} has a physical sickness {{and goes to the}} physician for help. But is that the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> sickness there is? Kierkegaard was interested in spiritual sickness called sin and the expectancy of forgiveness which are both Christian categories. We [...] "must want to understand the forgiveness of sins-and then despair of understanding it." [...] Later, in The Sickness Unto Death Kierkegaard writes of the sin of despairing over one's sin and the sin of despairing of the forgiveness of sins. Robert L. Perkins from Mercer University published a group of essays about these three discourses in 2006. Kierkegaard has moved forward from fear and trembling to fear and wonder within the two years of his published works. Wonder is more positive than fear.|$|E

2500|$|A year afterward, some {{administration}} officials admitted {{the nature of}} US involvement. John Mecklin claimed that the White House put [...] "direct, relentless, table-hammering pressure on Diem such as the United States had seldom before attempted with a sovereign, friendly government". Trueheart went on {{to admit that the}} US was well aware of the generals' actions. He said that there were loyalty issues of publicly supporting a government while knowing that a coup was underway, but that it was [...] "greatly offset by the feeling that we had been had by these people". Colby agreed with his colleagues that Richardson's removal was a major factor, regarding it as [...] "a policy decision just to indicate the end of a close relationship with Nhu". Richardson was close to Diem and the CIA provided both technical assistance and financing to Nhu's Special Forces. Trueheart insisted that Richardson had to be recalled so that Lodge could show that he spoke for the White House. Trueheart commented [...] "This was a clear signal, the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> really believable signal he could give".|$|E
2500|$|Since the Commonwealth {{introduced}} the Marriage Act Cth. 1961, marriage laws in Australia have {{been regarded as}} an exclusive Commonwealth power. The precise rights of states and territories with respect to creating state-based same-sex marriage laws have been complicated since the Howard Government amendment to the Marriage Act in 2004 to define marriage as the exclusive union of one man and one woman, {{to the exclusion of}} all others. In their December 2013 ruling striking down the ACT's same-sex marriage law, the High Court effectively determined that all laws with respect to marriage were an exclusive power of the Commonwealth and that no state or territory law legalising same-sex marriage or creating any type of marriage could operate concurrently with the federal Marriage Act; [...] "the kind of marriage provided for by the [...] Act is the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> marriage that may be formed or recognised in Australia". As a result, the only possible method for same-sex marriage legalisation to occur in Australia is via legislation passed into law by the Federal Parliament only.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1960s, Crick became {{concerned}} with {{the origins of the}} genetic code. In 1966, Crick took the place of Leslie Orgel at a meeting where Orgel was to talk about the origin of life. Crick speculated about possible stages by which an initially simple code with a few amino acid types might have evolved into the more complex code used by existing organisms. At that time, everyone thought of proteins as the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> enzymes, and ribozymes had not yet been found. Many molecular biologists were puzzled by the problem of the origin of a protein replicating system that is as complex as that which exists in organisms currently inhabiting Earth. In the early 1970s, Crick and Orgel further speculated about the possibility that the production of living systems from molecules may have been a very rare event in the universe, but once it had developed it could be spread by intelligent life forms using space travel technology, a process they called [...] "directed panspermia". In a retrospective article, Crick and Orgel noted that they had been overly pessimistic about the chances of abiogenesis on Earth when they had assumed that some kind of self-replicating protein system was the molecular origin of life.|$|E
2500|$|Rene Girard has {{demonstrated}} that the Gospels are a radical subversion of pagan notions of sacrifice. Instead of humans offering victims to angry deities (as is always the case with pagan sacrifice), Jesus, as the incarnate presence of God (YHWH), offers himself {{into the hands of}} violent humans to reveal what the Hebrew prophets meant when they said that [...] "the Lord" [...] (YHWH) rejects sacrifice and desires justice and mercy instead. The [...] "self-sacrifice" [...] of Christ is, therefore, a revelation that violent sacrifice {{has nothing to do with}} God. It is simply murder—which the story of Cain and Abel showed at the very dawn of civilisation (Cain is called [...] "father of cities"). Saint Paul calls on Christians in his Letter to the Romans (12:1) to do the very opposite of conventional religious sacrifice: [...] "offer your own bodies as a living sacrifice", he says, instead of the dead bodies of others. In other words, the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> [...] "sacrifice" [...] acceptable to God is to give one's life for others, which means to live one's life for others, even unto death, just as Jesus did. It is in that sense that Christ [...] "sacrificed" [...] himself; and in that sense that his [...] "pure sacrifice" [...] is celebrated in the sacrament of the eucharist.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his diagnosis, Jobs {{resisted}} his doctors' {{recommendations for}} medical intervention for nine months, instead {{relying on a}} pseudo-medicine diet to try natural healing to thwart the disease. According to Harvard researcher Ramzi Amri, his choice of alternative treatment [...] "led to an unnecessarily early death". Other doctors agree that Jobs's diet was insufficient to address his disease. Cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic David Gorski, for instance, said, [...] "My best guess was that Jobs probably only modestly decreased his chances of survival, if that." [...] Barrie R. Cassileth, the chief of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's integrative medicine department, said, [...] "Jobs's faith in alternative medicine likely cost him his life.... He had the <b>only</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> pancreatic cancer that is treatable and curable.... He essentially committed suicide." [...] According to Jobs's biographer, Walter Isaacson, [...] "for nine months he refused to undergo surgery for his pancreatic cancer – a decision he later regretted as his health declined". [...] "Instead, he tried a vegan diet, acupuncture, herbal remedies, and other treatments he found online, and even consulted a psychic. He was also influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts, bowel cleansings and other unproven approaches, before finally having surgery in July 2004." [...] He eventually underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (or [...] "Whipple procedure") in July 2004, that appeared to remove the tumor successfully. Jobs did not receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. During Jobs's absence, Tim Cook, head of worldwide sales and operations at Apple, ran the company.|$|E
