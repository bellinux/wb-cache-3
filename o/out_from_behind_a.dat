5|$|Enemy {{detection}} {{works on}} line-of-sight, with players {{being able to}} use cover or high areas out of enemies' cones of vision to stay undetected. Darkness can aid the player in staying hidden, {{but it is only}} effective at a distance. Enemy alert meters and musical cues let the player know if they've been spotted. Noise will cause enemies to go to investigate, including noise made by broken bottles or the player striking a sword against the wall; this may be used deliberately to lure guards into traps or disrupt their patrol route. Players can look through keyholes to help them survey a room before entering, and can lean to look from cover without fully exposing themselves. The player is now able to be detected if they peer <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> wall for too long, a feature not seen in Dishonored. To avoid detection, the player may choke people out or have their throat slit. Bodies can be carried away and concealed. Alarms can be disabled to assure that enemies are not alerted to the player's presence. Walls of Light, barriers powered by wind or whale oil, are subject to have their power turned off or be rewired so that only enemies are killed by going through them. Whale oil canisters explode on harsh impact, and can be thrown at enemies to that end.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus, {{dressed as}} Montana, premiered [...] "Let's Get Crazy", along with eight other songs, at the concert taping {{for the third}} season of Hannah Montana, which was set on October 10 in Irvine, California at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheatre. The {{performance}} began with Montana, in a T-shirt with a pink star, zebra-patterned skirt, tennis shoes and metallic jacket, coming <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> giant mirror ball. She then roamed the stage singing the number. The performance was later premiered on July 1, 2009 on Disney Channel to promote Hannah Montana 3.|$|E
500|$|The three then form a plan, {{which has}} Ed sitting {{alone on a}} bench in the {{playground}} with a [...] "Don't Touch!" [...] sign around his neck. Jonny (David Paul Grove) soon walks by, carrying his imaginary friend Plank, who is a board of wood. Impressed with Ed's hair cut, Jonny ignores the sign and rubs Plank against Ed's head. Eddy and Double D then jump <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> nearby bush and capture Jonny, accusing him of being the serial toucher. Eddy interrogates Jonny and Plank after tying them to chairs in Double Dee's garage and hooking them up to a homemade lie detector. However, when they give him no answers, he resorts to using chinese water torture on Plank. This makes Jonny need to use the bathroom and in his desperation, he falsely confesses to the crime. The Eds then collect their money and punish Jonny by trapping him in a tire.|$|E

60|$|Only Ol' Mistah Buzzard knew better. From way up {{high in the}} blue, {{blue sky}} he could look down and see many things. He could see all the little meadow and forest people who were {{watching}} Farmer Brown's boy. The harder Farmer Brown's boy worked, the more Ol' Mistah Buzzard chuckled to himself. What was he laughing at? Why, {{he could see the}} sharp face of old Granny Fox, peeping <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> old fence corner, and she was grinning. So Ol' Mistah Buzzard knew Reddy Fox was safe.|$|R
50|$|Tamawo or Tamao are mythogical creatures {{believed}} to be handsome having very fair to white skin with fangs and claws of gold. Believed to be clad in gold and wears putong and bahag like the nobles of pre-colonial Visayas.The tamawo were known by its different names: the bumalabag, male fairy who viewed and visited places; the manupongtupong, a male fairy who dresses like an ordinary man; the manla-awla-aw who looked <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> anthill; manilag-nilag, a female fairy who attended social gatherings and festivities; and the manbukay, a female fairy who dwelt in shallow wells.|$|R
500|$|Wilson, Borrow and the 35 others {{made for}} Lobengula's enclosure. The king's wagon was still there, but when Wilson called to him, {{there was no}} answer. The king had moved on during the night. At that moment, the troopers {{heard the sound of}} rifles being cocked in the wood {{surrounding}} them. A Matabele inDuna stepped <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> tree and announced that the enclosure was surrounded by thousands of Matabele who wanted to [...] "see if the white men were afraid to die." [...] He then fired his rifle to signal the start of the attack to his men. A volley from the Matabele riflemen followed, but most of the shots went too high; no Company trooper was hit. The only casualties of this opening volley were two of the patrol's horses. Wilson immediately ordered his men to fall back, first to an antheap, then to a thick wood. Three of them were wounded during this retreat, but none fatally.|$|E

60|$|Ol' Mistah Buzzard, sailing {{round and}} round, {{way up in}} the blue, blue sky, could see {{everything}} going on down below. He could see Reddy Fox running {{along the edge of the}} Green Forest and every few minutes stopping to chuckle and listen to Bowser the Hound trying to pick out the trail Reddy had made so hard to follow by his twists and turns. And he saw something else, did Ol' Mistah Buzzard. It looked to him very much like the barrel of <b>a</b> gun sticking <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> old tree just ahead of Reddy.|$|R

[...] It wouldn't have made any difference if they hadn't eaten it...Because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks under them you know perfectly well they won't give up. They'll get you in the end.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} defeat of the Confederates in New Mexico, General and Mrs. Canby were reassigned back East where Canby spent more than a year in bureaucratic service in Pennsylvania, New York, and Washington, D.C. {{sometimes}} as an unofficial administrative assistant to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. It was not until 1864 that Canby was allowed <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> desk, and he and Mrs. Canby were sent to the Trans-Mississippi region, eventually finding a home in New Orleans where Louisa stayed while her husband supported the Union's impending defeat of Confederate forces, which happened to include the remnants of Sibley's brigade; although, by this time, Sibley himself had been court-martialed for dereliction of duty during the Battle of Bisland. (Relieved of his command, he had gone to Richmond, Virginia.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The Tango drinker turns around, and {{the orange}} man slaps {{him across the}} cheeks, and then runs off, leaving the drinker startled, {{although}} the other men beside the drinker do not observe or respond to the orange man and the slap. Ralph becomes excited as he reveals this to be [...] "Tango taste sensation" [...] and asks Tony to rewind the clip again to the same point as before, this time showing the orange man sprint <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> pillar box and shows the same events as before with Ralph and Tony providing commentary. The advertisement ends with the drinker looking at his Tango can in question, followed by a behind shot of the Tango can {{on top of the}} orange man's head, which bears the slogan [...] "You Know When You've Been Tango'd". A deep male voice (Gil Scott-Heron) says the slogan at the same time.|$|E
60|$|When Reddy Fox put {{his tail}} {{between his legs}} and started away from that terrible {{creature}} coming down the hill where Prickly Porky lives, he thought of nothing but of getting {{as far away as}} he could in the shortest time that he could, and so, with a little frightened yelp with every jump, he ran as he seldom had run before. He forgot all about Unc' Billy Possum watching from the safety of a big pine-tree. He didn't see Jimmy Skunk poking his head <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>an</b> old stump and laughing fit to kill himself. When he reached the edge of the Green Forest, he didn't even see Peter Rabbit jump out of his path and dodge into a hollow log.|$|R

2500|$|He {{was painted}} {{at least twice}} as a boy by Adolfo Müller-Ury, who was a close friend of his mother and father and who had acted as an usher at their wedding in New York in February 1898, and who, along with the other ushers, had been given a gold {{cigarette}} box by 'Carlo' Seilern by way of thanks. The first portrait was in a group portrait with his two brothers which was certainly painted in London in the summer of 1906 and was exhibited at Knoedler in New York in December that year. The New York Herald, December 5, 1906, called the group 'graceful' and on December 8, 1906 commented that '...The boys are about 4, 6, and 7 years in age, and they have been painted out of doors.' [...] The second was in late 1906, a full-length dressed in ermine with a rabbit on a string (first exhibited in January 1907 at Knoedler and in February 1908 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington DC). Both are unlocated. A head and shoulders of Antoine peeping <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> red curtain and dated 1909 was in his possession at Princes Gate at his death in 1978 and is now in a private collection in Austria; {{what appears to be a}} reduced version of the full-length portrait survives in a private collection in Lucerne, Switzerland; the group portrait is only known through photographs.|$|E

5000|$|She {{looks like}} a sweet little girl, but is {{actually}} half fox demon and half human. Her bushy tail is always sticking <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind.</b> She is <b>a</b> tomboy with an unyielding spirit, but has long lived as a social outcast because she is half demon. She meets Keiichiro and starts to change as she develops an affection for him.|$|R
50|$|The day is {{interspersed}} with {{events leading up}} to the pageant. Lucy Swithin fusses around making all kinds of preparations, from the decorations to the food. Bartholomew frightens his grandson by jumping <b>out</b> at him <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> <b>a</b> newspaper and then calls him a coward when he cries. Mrs Manresa flirts with Bartholomew and Giles and is clearly being provocative, and William Dodge is dismissed as obviously homosexual.|$|R

Nora and the team's cameraman Fitzie (Buckley) flee, but after realizing they're trapped, they return to find Dr. Holden still alive tied to a scale. They learn the creature is the Egyptian god Anubis, who is seen weighing Dr. Holden's heart in an ancient ritual to determine his worthiness to enter the afterlife. Miles is deemed unworthy and dies when Anubis eats his heart.|$|R

Rose thinks she sees another zombie, and they both start running, but Domnic says he thinks he has seen a policewoman.|$|R
50|$|Kaihō {{was below}} average size for a rikishi and relied on his {{technical}} ability, employing a similar sumo style to Mainoumi. He won two special prizes for Technique. His favourite {{grip on his}} opponent's mawashi was hidari-yotsu, a right arm outside, left hand inside grip. He specialised in throws, and regularly used his inside grip to win by shitatenage, or underarm throw. He is also fond of uchigake, the inside leg trip. He was known for often employing henka, or sidestepping at the tachi-ai or initial charge, and was adept at using inashi, or ducking and moving diagonally back from the opponent. He had a higher than average number of wins by okuri-dashi, or push <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind,</b> as <b>a</b> result.|$|R

2500|$|In [...] 2, an {{alternate}} version of Alan Scott is featured. This Alan Scott's ring's origin is explained as having originally been a Green Lantern ring that was lost on Earth long ago. In this storyline, {{the first time}} Alan used his ring, he was knocked <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> by <b>a</b> man with a wooden club. This caused Alan to believe the ring was weak against wood, thereby causing a mental block that prevented him from truly exerting his power against wooden objects or attacks. (This was confirmed by the Guardians, who explained {{that this was the}} reason behind the weakness to yellow of the Green Lantern Corps' rings. They simply told all new Green Lanterns that their rings were powerless against yellow to establish the same mental block.) ...|$|R
60|$|We paid our threepence {{entrance}} fee {{in the stone}} hall and went upstairs. I {{opened the door of}} Number 8, and we were shut in our little cabin, looking down on the world. Then I found the barber, Luigi, bowing profusely in a box opposite. It was necessary to make bows all round: ah, the chemist, on the upper tier, near the barber; how-do-you-do to the padrona of the hotel, who is our good friend, and who sits, wearing a little beaver shoulder-cape, a few boxes off; very cold salutation to the stout village magistrate with the long brown beard, who leans forward in the box facing the stage, while a grouping of faces look <b>out</b> <b>from</b> <b>behind</b> him; <b>a</b> warm smile to the family of the Signora Gemma, across next to the stage.
