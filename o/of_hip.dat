40|$|Developmental {{dysplasia}} <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> is {{the result}} of a disruption in the normal relationship between the acetabulum and femoral head. The etiology of nonsyndromic developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> is largely unknown, but there is clear evidence genetic factors play a role in the etiology. Early recognition of developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> affords the best results from treatment and a better knowledge of the genetics of developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> could enhance early diagnosis. Gene variants in Type II collagene and vitamin D receptor genes have been associated with patients with osteoarthritis <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> secondary to developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> the <b>hip.</b> To explore the role of the Type II collagene gene/vitamin D receptor locus in nonsyndromic developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> the <b>hip,</b> we designed a linkage study on a group of 11 families with recurrence of developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> the <b>hip.</b> Our data show no evidence of linkage between the Type II collagene gene/vitamin D receptor locus and nonsyndromic developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> the <b>hip</b> suggesting although variants in these genes could play a role in osteoarthritis in patients with developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> the <b>hip,</b> they do not contribute to the nonsyndromic developmental dysplasia <b>of</b> the <b>hip...</b>|$|R

5|$|During evolution, some {{structures}} {{may lose}} their original function and become vestigial structures.

Fear of a Black Planet explores themes about organization and empowerment within the black community, social issues affecting African Americans, and race relations at the time. The record's criticism of institutional racism, White supremacy, and the power elite was partly inspired by Dr. Frances Cress Welsing's views on color.|$|E

5|$|Gangsta rap {{is a kind}} <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality and a dangerous, criminal image. Though the origins of gangsta rap {{can be traced back}} to the mid-1980s raps of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style is usually said to have begun in the Los Angeles and Oakland area, where Too Short, NWA and others found their fame. This West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy tone, often relying on samples from 1970s P-funk; the best-known proponents of this sound were the breakthrough rappers Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg.|$|E

5|$|Blake Harrison {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} that would become Flocabulary while in high school. Inspired by hip hop artists like Outkast and A Tribe Called Quest, Harrison wanted to combine the easy retainability <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> hop lyrics with educational content. Harrison graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in English. He then moved to San Francisco, where he met Alex Rappaport, a music graduate of Tufts University. Harrison shared his idea with Rappaport, and in 2004 the two made a demo recording of two songs with a combined total of 80 SAT words. Within two months Sparknotes made the songs available for free streaming, and soon afterward Harrison and Rappaport set up a Flocabulary website. Cider Mill Press published Flocabulary books and distributed them through Sterling Publishing to sell the book at Barnes & Noble and Borders stores. The Hip Hop Approach to SAT Vocabulary sold 10,000 copies in its first year of publication and was reprinted five times. In 2005, Flocabulary went on a promotional tour of concerts at schools.|$|E
5|$|Gangsta rap {{is a kind}} <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> hop, most {{importantly}} characterized by a lyrical focus on macho sexuality, physicality, and a dangerous criminal image. Though the origins of gangsta rap {{can be traced back}} to the mid-1980s style of Philadelphia's Schoolly D and the West Coast's Ice-T, the style broadened and came to apply to many different regions in the country, to rappers from New York, such as Notorious B.I.G and influential hip hop group Wu-Tang Clan, and to rappers on the West Coast, such as Too Short and N.W.A. A distinctive West Coast rap scene spawned the early 1990s G-funk sound, which paired gangsta rap lyrics with a thick and hazy sound, often from 1970s funk samples; the best-known proponents were the rappers 2Pac, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg. Gangsta rap continued to exert a major presence in American popular music through the end of the 1990s and early into the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Hip hop is a {{cultural}} movement, of which music is a part, along with graffiti and breakdancing. The music is composed of two parts, rapping, the delivery of swift, highly rhythmic and lyrical vocals, and DJing, the production of instrumentation either through sampling, instrumentation, turntablism or beatboxing. Hip hop arose in the early 1970s in The Bronx, New York City. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc {{is widely regarded as}} the progenitor <b>of</b> <b>hip</b> hop; he brought with him the practice of toasting over the rhythms of popular songs. In New York, DJs like Kool Herc played records of popular funk, disco and rock songs. Emcees originally arose to introduce the songs and keep the crowd excited and dancing; over time, the DJs began isolating the percussion breaks (the rhythmic climax of songs), thus producing a repeated beat that the emcees rapped over.|$|E
