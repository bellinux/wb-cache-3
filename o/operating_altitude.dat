5|$|Electrical {{generators}} {{mounted on}} each of the E-3's four engines provide the one megawatt of electrical power that is required by the E-3's radars and other electronics. Its pulse-Doppler radar (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its <b>operating</b> <b>altitude,</b> and the pulse (BTH) radar has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The radar, combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter (radar) returns.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{is among}} {{only a few}} {{aircraft}} that can supercruise, or sustain supersonic flight without using fuel-inefficient afterburners; it can intercept targets which subsonic aircraft would lack the speed to pursue and an afterburner-dependent aircraft would lack the fuel to reach. The Raptor's high <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> is also a significant tactical advantage over prior fighters. The use of internal weapons bays permits the aircraft to maintain comparatively higher performance over most other combat-configured fighters {{due to a lack}} of aerodynamic drag from external stores. The F-22's structure contains a significant amount of high-strength materials to withstand stress and heat of sustained supersonic flight. Respectively, titanium alloys and composites comprise 39% and 24% of the aircraft's structural weight.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E

25|$|The extreme {{speed and}} <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> of the Valkyrie was {{considered}} sufficient protection against Soviet interceptors of the time. However it was anticipated that future aircraft and missile developments {{would reduce the}} B-70's margin of superiority, especially following the SA-2 Guideline SAM being displayed during the 1957 May Day parade. Intelligence reports indicated that SAMs were being deployed in large numbers throughout Russia, and it was believed the SA-2 was capable of being fitted with a nuclear warhead. Therefore, {{it was decided that}} the B-70 would need an interceptor missile to defend itself against the perceived threat.|$|E
25|$|Multiple SM-73 {{missiles}} {{would be}} ground-launched from Strategic Air Command bases {{located in the}} continental United States. Fifty percent of the deployed SM-73 missiles would be launched within the first hour after an alert and the remaining missiles would be launched one hour later. The requirement called for 85 percent of the decoy missiles {{to arrive at the}} target area within 115nm (185km). The SM-73 was to fly 4,000nm (7,408km) at speed of at least 0.85 Mach at an <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> of 50,000ft (15,240 m) with a payload of 500lb (227kg). After flying 2,500nm (4,650km), the SM-73' would simulate the performance of the B-47 Stratojet or B-52 Stratofortress over the final 1,500nm (2,780km) of flight.|$|E
50|$|Its radar has a {{360-degree}} view, and at <b>operating</b> <b>altitudes</b> it {{can detect}} targets more than 320 kilometers (200 miles) away. AWACS mission equipment can separate, manage and display these targets individually on situational displays.|$|R

25|$|The Su-57 has a blended wing body {{fuselage}} and incorporates all-moving {{horizontal and}} vertical stabilizers; the vertical stabilizers toe inwards {{to serve as the}} aircraft's airbrake. The aircraft incorporates thrust vectoring and has adjustable leading edge vortex controllers (LEVCONs) designed to control vortices generated by the leading edge root extensions, and can provide trim and improve high angle of attack behaviour, including a quick stall recovery if the thrust vectoring system fails. The advanced flight control system and thrust vectoring nozzles make the aircraft departure resistant and highly maneuverable in both pitch and yaw, enabling the aircraft to perform very high angles of attack maneuvers such as the Pugachev's Cobra and the Bell maneuver, along with doing flat rotations with little altitude loss. The aircraft's high cruising speed and normal <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> is also expected to give it a significant kinematic advantage over prior generations of aircraft.|$|E
500|$|A sudden {{reduction}} in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew. Above , a sudden cabin depressurisation would leave a [...] "time of useful consciousness" [...] up to 10–15 seconds for a conditioned athlete. At Concorde's altitude, the air density is very low; {{a breach of}} cabin integrity {{would result in a}} loss of pressure severe enough so that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would soon suffer from hypoxia despite quickly donning them. Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss {{in the event of a}} breach, a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure, and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude. The FAA enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and noting Concorde's higher <b>operating</b> <b>altitude,</b> concluded that the best response to pressure loss would be a rapid descent. Continuous positive airway pressure would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks.|$|E

40|$|Human {{exposures}} to ionizing radiation have been vastly altered by developing {{technology in the}} last century. This has been most obvious {{in the development of}} radiation generating devices and the utilization of nuclear energy. But even air travel has had its impact on human exposure. Human exposure increases with advancing aircraft technology {{as a result of the}} higher <b>operating</b> <b>altitudes</b> reducing the protective cover provided by Earth's atmosphere from extraterrestrial radiations. This increase in <b>operating</b> <b>altitudes</b> is taken to a limit by human operations in space. Less obvious is the changing character of the radiations at higher altitudes. The associated health risks are less understood with increasing altitude due to the increasing complexity and new field components found in high-altitude and space operations...|$|R

2500|$|Because of the U-2's extreme <b>operating</b> <b>altitude,</b> Soviet {{attempts}} to intercept the plane using fighter aircraft failed. The U-2's course {{was out of}} range of several of the nearest SAM sites, and one SAM site even failed to engage the aircraft since it was not on duty that day. The U-2 was eventually brought down near Kosulino, Ural Region, by the first of three SA-2 Guideline (S-75 Dvina) surface-to-air missiles [...] fired by a battery commanded by Mikhail Voronov.

2500|$|Because of {{the high}} <b>operating</b> <b>altitude</b> and the cockpit's partial pressurization, {{equivalent}} to [...] pressure altitude, the pilot wears a partially pressurized space suit, which delivers the pilot's oxygen supply and provides emergency protection in case cabin pressure is lost. While pilots can drink water and eat various liquid foods in squeezable containers through a self-sealing hole in the face mask, they typically lose up to [...] of weight on an eight-hour mission. Most pilots chose to not take with them the suicide pill offered before missions. If put in the mouth and bitten, the [...] "L-pill"—containing liquid potassium cyanide—would cause death in 10–15 seconds. After a pilot almost accidentally ingested an L-pill instead of candy during a December 1956 flight, the suicide pills were put into boxes to avoid confusion. When in 1960 the CIA realized that a pill breaking inside the cockpit would kill the pilot, it destroyed the L-pills, and as a replacement its Technical Services Division developed a needle poisoned with a powerful shellfish toxin and hidden in a silver dollar. Only one was made because, as the agency decided, if any pilot needed to use it the program would probably be canceled. Like the suicide pill, not all pilots carried the coin, and Knutson {{did not know of}} any that intended to commit suicide; he carried it as an escape tool.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 March 1969, {{the wing}} {{proposed}} a new forward air control program to 7th Air Force.

The Fast FAC used call sign [...] "Falcon"; the photo recce plane used [...] "Atlanta". The call signs [...] "Laredo" [...] and [...] "Whiplash" [...] were also sometimes used. By July, {{they were asked to}} augment the efforts of the [...] "Tiger" [...] FACs in the Operation Barrel Roll area of Laos. While supporting Operation About Face, they improvised mass bombings by 16 to 20 fighter-bombers three times in September 1969. One of these mass raids inflicted heavy casualties on a concentration of about 1,000 communist troops. In November, they discovered 102 new targets; the following month, they found 172 more. To do this, they pressed lower than 4,000 feet altitude. In the last quarter of 1969, 21 of their aircraft suffered battle damage. They were then ordered to remain above 4,500 feet altitude to escape ground fire. Regardless of their <b>operating</b> <b>altitude,</b> their bomb damage assessment record was triple the average for 7th Air Force units.|$|E
