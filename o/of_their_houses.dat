5|$|Maya {{households}} interred {{their dead}} underneath the floors <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses,</b> with offerings {{appropriate to the}} social status of the family. There the dead could act as protective ancestors. Maya lineages were patrilineal, so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasized, often with a household shrine. As Maya society developed, and the elite became more powerful, Maya royalty developed their household shrines into the great pyramids that held the tombs of their ancestors.|$|E
5|$|The Muisca played music, {{sang and}} danced mainly {{as part of}} religious, burial and {{initiation}} rituals, with harvests and sowing and after the victory in battles. Also during the construction <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses,</b> the Muisca performed music and dances. The early Spanish chronicles noted that the music and singing was monotonous and sad. As musical instruments they used drums, flutes made of shells or ceramics, trumpets of gold, zampoñas and ocarinas. At the rituals, the people would be dressed in feathers, animal skins (mainly jaguar) and decorated their bodies with paint. At the dances the women and men held hands and both the commoners and the higher social classes participated in these activities. The main deities associated with the dances were Huitaca and Nencatacoa.|$|E
5|$|Tyler and the Kentish men {{advanced}} to Canterbury, entering the walled city and castle without resistance on 10 June. The rebels deposed the absent Archbishop of Canterbury, Sudbury, {{and made the}} cathedral monks swear loyalty to their cause. They attacked properties in the city with links to the hated royal council, and searched the city for suspected enemies, dragging the suspects out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> and executing them. The city gaol was opened and the prisoners freed. Tyler then persuaded a few thousand of the rebels to leave Canterbury and advance with him on London the next morning.|$|E

5|$|Scottish estate {{houses were}} {{increasingly}} adorned with paintings, including portraits, landscapes and later classical, genre and historical paintings. Thomas Warrender (fl. 1673–1713) {{made his living}} as a house decorator, working closely with architects, including William Adam. He may have trained James Norie (1684–1757), who with his sons James (1711–36) and Robert (d. 1766) also worked with the Adams, painting the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were pastiches of Italian and Dutch scenes. They tutored many artists and have been credited with {{the inception of the}} tradition of Scottish landscape painting that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century. The painters Allan Ramsay (1713–84), Gavin Hamilton (1723–98), the brothers John (1744–68/9) and Alexander Runciman (1736–85), Jacob More (1740–93) and David Allan (1744–96), mostly began {{in the tradition of the}} Nories, but were artists of European significance, spending considerable portions of their careers outside Scotland. Henry Raeburn (1756–1823) was the most significant artist of the eighteenth century to pursue his entire career in Scotland, and from this point Scottish painters would be able to be professionals in their homeland, often supplying the nobility and lairds with works to fill the walls <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses.</b>|$|E
5|$|The arid {{conditions}} of the spiny forest, which receives less than 600 millimeters of rainfall each year, largely shape Mikea economic activities. Nearly everything they consume is scavenged from the forest, and the average Mikea needs two hours or less to collect adequate food for the day. Their main source of food is tubers, particularly {{during the dry season}} when few other foods may be reliably available. Adults and children of both genders work to dig up using a metal-tipped digging stick (antsoro) and a digging bowl (kipao). The starchy ovy tuber is roasted or boiled before eating, while the Mikea eat the watery babo (or baboho) raw for hydration or use its water for boiling other foods; the tavolo tuber is dried and ground to make a flour that is sold at village markets. They also gather forest fruits, melons and honey, with the latter a particularly important source of income for the Mikea during the rainy season. To obtain water during the rainy season the Mikea capture rain run-off from the rooftops <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> using hollowed-out logs or transport water on foot or zebu-drawn wagon from the villages, while during the cool dry season the Mikea consume their store of water-engorged babo tubers and drink water from natural or man-made wells when possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{precursor}} to the disturbance brought locally heavy rainfall to the Yucatán Peninsula, with a maximum of 7.09inches (18cm) in Lázaro Cárdenas, Quintana Roo. The depression produced intense precipitation across central and eastern Cuba, peaking at 12.4inches (31.5cm) in Topes de Collantes. In Victoria de Las Tunas, a rainfall total of 8.6inches (21.8cm) set the new record most rainfall in 24hours. The rainfall caused flooding of rivers and lakes behind dams, and in some places, residents required rescue from the roofs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses.</b> Officials forced the evacuation of 40,000people in several provinces, and across the country, the storm destroyed 1,860homes and damaged 16,500more. The flooding blocked mountainous highways in Santiago de Cuba Province, and in Las Tunas Province railway lines were damaged. Widespread crop damage occurred just {{two months after the}} Storm of the Century left similar heavy damage. The flooding damaged 87sugar production centers. The depression killed seven people in the country with another five missing, as reported by a newspaper on the day after the depression left the island. After the storm passed, the Cuban government activated the Civil Defense, while National Relief Services worked to rescue all people affected by the flooding.|$|E

5|$|While Lili {{was still}} a {{tropical}} depression, the government of Cuba issued a hurricane watch for Isla de la Juventud and the provinces of Pinar del Rio and Havana provinces. On October16, a tropical storm warning {{was put in place}} for several provinces, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning the next day for eight provinces, eastward to Camagüey. The threat of the storm caused all flights to and from Cuba to be canceled, and the airport at Havana was closed. Officials set up shelters and ordered about 88,000people in Havana to evacuate from buildings prone to collapsing; however, only 5,000people had evacuated by the day before landfall, due to fears <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> being robbed. Ultimately, 269,995people evacuated due to the storm, along with over 270,000livestock. Officials also closed classes and sent workers home in areas along the projected path, and two hospitals were completely evacuated. Power lines in Havana were intentionally turned off before the storm to minimize potential damage. Before Lili, the last hurricane to strike Cuba was Hurricane Kate in 1985. The country was already experiencing economic difficulties when the storm struck, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in a crisis known as the Special Period.|$|E

25|$|Subsidence of {{the valley}} floor beneath has caused {{flooding}} problems as now {{much of the city}} has sunk below the natural lake floor. Currently, pumps need to work 24hours a day all year round to keep control of runoff and wastewater. Despite this, flooding is still common, especially in the summer rainy season, in lower-lying neighborhoods such as Iztapalapa, forcing residents to build miniature dikes in front <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> to prevent heavily polluted rainwater from entering their homes. Subsidence also causes damage to water and sewer lines, leaving the water distribution system vulnerable to contamination which carries risks to public health.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19th century, there was a {{stagnation}} in the production of decorative tiles, owing first to the incursion of the Napoleonic army and later to social and economic changes. When around 1840 immigrant Brazilians started an industrialized production in Porto, the Portuguese took over the Brazilian fashion of decorating the façades <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> with azulejos. While these factories produces high-relief tiles in one or two colours, the Lisbon factories started using another method: the transfer-print method on blue-and-white or polychrome azulejos. In the last decades of the 19th century, the Lisbon factories started to use another type of transfer-printing: using creamware blanks.|$|E
