5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s {{homeless}} problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated {{that people who}} were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of a willing family member <b>or</b> <b>friend</b> though the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of homeless rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage of the homeless population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some of the homeless population who would have ended up in jail were now being housed and treated.|$|E
5|$|On September 19, 2003, President George W. Bush {{declared}} {{the entire state}} of Maryland as a disaster area, which allowed residents affected by the hurricane to apply for federal aid. FEMA officials urged residents and business owners with significant damage to call as soon as possible, while those with minimal damage were asked to wait for a few days. All residents in the state who received damage from the storm had sixty days to apply for assistance. Federal and state officials opened disaster recovery centers in Annapolis, Baltimore, Essex, and Prince Frederick five days after the hurricane passed through the area, with the centers designed to provide more information to those who applied for federal assistance. About six days after Isabel made landfall, additional disaster recovery centers opened in Rock Hall in Kent County, California in Saint Mary's County, Silver Spring in Montgomery County, Chester in Queen Anne's County, Crisfield in Somerset County, Cambridge in Dorchester County, and Easton in Talbot County. Around a month after the hurricane, officials placed some residents unable to live in their damaged homes into travel trailers because they had no options for alternate housing, such as staying with a relative <b>or</b> <b>friend.</b>|$|E
5|$|The CPHC {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning for Oahu on September 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day. Though not hit by the hurricane, Iniki's large wind field caused nearly 30,000people to evacuate to 110public shelters in Oahu. Public school buildings acted as shelters, and were for refuge only, meaning they did not provide food, cots, blankets, medications or other comfort items. Roughly one-third of Oahu's population participated in the evacuation, though many others went {{to the house of}} a family member <b>or</b> <b>friend</b> for shelter. The execution of the evacuations went well, beginning with the vulnerable coastal area. For those in need, vans and buses gave emergency transportation, while police manned certain overused intersections. The two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlines.|$|E

25|$|By 2007, it was {{recognized}} that outreach to most patients who would need personal assistance from health advocates {{would have to}} come from the private sector. Individuals, some with backgrounds such as nursing or case management, and others who had experience helping loved ones <b>or</b> <b>friend</b> navigate the healthcare system, began establishing private practices to provide those services to client-patients. A new organization, The Alliance of Professional Health Advocates, was founded to support those new private advocates, plus those considering such a career, with legal, insurance, marketing and other business advice.|$|E
25|$|Sucking out venom, {{either by}} mouth {{or with a}} pump, does not work and may harm the {{affected}} area directly. Suction started after three minutes removes a clinically insignificant quantity—less than one-thousandth of the venom injected—as shown in a human study. In a study with pigs, suction not only caused no improvement but led to necrosis in the suctioned area. Suctioning by mouth presents a risk of further poisoning through the mouth's mucous tissues.

25|$|Many people interviewed {{after the}} suicide of a {{relative}} <b>or</b> <b>friend</b> {{have a tendency to}} simplify the issues; their grief can lead to their minimizing or ignoring significant factors. Studies show a high incidence of psychiatric disorders in suicide victims {{at the time of their}} death with the total figure ranging from 98% to 87.3% with mood disorders and substance abuse being the two most common. These are often undiagnosed or untreated and treatment can result in reductions in the suicide rate. Reports that minimize the effect of psychiatric disorders contribute to copycat suicides whereas reports that mention this factor and provide help-line contact numbers and advice for where sufferers may gain assistance can reduce suicides.|$|E

30|$|This {{study also}} {{revealed}} that the information provided by family <b>or</b> <b>friends</b> using OTCs and the information provided through family <b>or</b> <b>friends</b> had {{a negative impact on}} consumers’ purchase of OTCs. The vast majority of non-purchasers who used such information, however, utilized OTCs, indicating that perhaps they entrusted the purchase of OTCs that they needed to someone else, rather than that some negative information provided by family <b>or</b> <b>friends</b> using OTCs <b>or</b> through family <b>or</b> <b>friends</b> made them give up purchasing OTCs. This “entrustment of purchasing OTCs” may be the source of the negative impact on the purchase of OTCs mentioned above. Family <b>or</b> <b>friends</b> using OTCs made up one of the five information providers used most often by OTC purchasers, and those who valued the concreteness or availability of information tended to use those information providers, rather than pharmacists. We assume that OTC purchasers might use family <b>or</b> <b>friends</b> using OTCs as information providers, when they want to know the efficacy and safety of OTCs actually and personally experienced by the latter, instead of general explanations. They may also use these individuals when they want to know concrete features of OTCs, such as the shape, size, taste, and smell thereof, and the ease with which OTCs can be swallowed, along with the efficacy and safety of OTCs; when they want to know the efficacy and safety of household OTCs; or when they quickly want some reference information, before getting individualized information from pharmacists at pharmacies.|$|R
25|$|Falegan {{therefore}} remarked thus: ‘The {{supremacy of}} Oore {{as the most}} senior Ooba in Ekiti is contestable for several reasons... He {{was more of a}} mercenary (errand or junior) King at Kiriji war unlike principal kings who hardly leave their palaces ordinarily {{even in the face of}} war as attested to the Ewi... The Ewi controlled territories that are as large as 10 out of 16 Local Government Area of present-day Ekiti State while Oore controlled only a Local Government. Atolagbe noted that Oore was not a Prince of Oduduwa dynastic reign but a benefactor <b>or</b> <b>friend.</b> How then did he became a king, if he was neither a son or Oduduwa nor his lieutenant? The linkage of Oore to Obatala from other sources shows that Oore was either a prominent Ifa Chief or Obatala adherent who came to Ekitiland, if he was not an aboriginal king integrated into Yoruba culture under the dynastic reign of Oduduwa and his successors, children and grandchildren... He could not have been the most senior Yoruba king in Ekitiland, even if he's not an Ekiti aboriginal Oba or Ife aboriginal or an adherent of Obatala. Reference to Oore in Ifa tranche only deduced that he was an Ifa adherent too, whereas the same Ifa tranche adduced that Ado-Ekiti is the home (abode) of Ifa, which invariably made Oore an adherent while the Ewi who superintends over Ado would naturally remain the superior custodian of Ifa religion...The pelupelu where Oore was recognized by the British as the most senior Oba was an imposition at Oke-Imo in 1900 by Major Reeves Tucker. Otherwise, the history of Oore where he adduced to be a co-equal <b>or</b> <b>friend</b> of Oduduwa was never accepted in Ile-Ife tradition as a legend, but a fabrication of traditions.|$|E
25|$|Incest {{between a}} child or {{adolescent}} and a related adult is known as child incestuous abuse, and {{has been identified as}} the most widespread form of child sexual abuse with a huge capacity to damage the young person. One researcher stated that more than 70% of abusers are immediate family members or someone very close to the family. Another researcher stated that about 30% of all perpetrators of sexual abuse are related to their victim, 60% of the perpetrators are family acquaintances, like a neighbor, babysitter <b>or</b> <b>friend</b> and 10% of the perpetrators in child sexual abuse cases are strangers. A child sexual abuse offense where the perpetrator is related to the child, either by blood or marriage, is a form of incest described as intrafamilial child sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|The latter Greeks of {{the first}} {{millennium}} BC had a (still not very effective) cavalry arm, and the rocky terrain of the Greek mainland was unsuited for wheeled vehicles. Consequently, in historical Greece the chariot was never used to any extent in war. Nevertheless, the chariot retained a high status and memories of its era were handed down in epic poetry. Linear B tablets from Mycenaean palaces record large inventories of chariots, sometimes with specific details as to how many chariots were assembled or not (i.e. stored in modular form). Later the vehicles were used in games and processions, notably for races at the Olympic and Panathenaic Games and other public festivals in ancient Greece, in hippodromes and in contests called agons. They were also used in ceremonial functions, as when a paranymph, <b>or</b> <b>friend</b> of a bridegroom, went {{with him in a}} chariot to fetch the bride home.|$|E

25|$|Warez {{are often}} {{distributed}} outside of The Scene (a collection of warez groups) by torrents (files including tracker info, piece size, uncompressed file size, comments, and vary {{in size from}} 1k, to 400k.) uploaded to a popular P2P website by an associate <b>or</b> <b>friend</b> of the cracker or cracking crew. An nfo or FILE ID.DIZ is often made to promote who created the release. It is then leeched (downloaded) by users of the tracker and spread to other sharing sites using P2P, or other sources such as newsgroups. From there, it can be downloaded by millions of users all over the world. Often, one release is duplicated, renamed, then re-uploaded to different sites so that eventually, it can become impossible to trace the original file. Another increasingly popular method of distributing Warez is via one-click hosting websites. In the early 1990s, warez were often traded on cassette tapes with different groups and published on bulletin boards that had a warez section.|$|E
25|$|Critics have {{suggested}} that the system is fundamentally unfair as it restricts the choice for parents to choose schools and schools to choose their students although it does allow all students living in the community to have entry, as of right, regardless of their academic or social profile. In addition, there is evidence that property values surrounding some more desirable schools become inflated, thus restricting the ability of lower socio-economic groups to purchase a house in the zone, though this is off set by the fact that students are accepted from rental accommodation or from homes where they are boarding with a bona fide relative <b>or</b> <b>friend</b> living in the zone. Some parents have purposely flouted zone boundaries by giving false addresses, such as that of a business they own in the zone, or by renting homes in the zone only through the enrolment process and moving out before the student commences school. Schools are now requesting rates invoices, tenancy agreements, or power and telephone bills from parents to prove their residential address, Some schools have gone as far as requiring parents to make a statutory declaration before a Justice of the Peace or similar that they live in the school zone, which makes it impossible for a parent to cheat the zone without also committing a criminal offence (making a false statutory declaration is punishable by up to three years' imprisonment).|$|E
