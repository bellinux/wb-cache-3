2500|$|In {{addition}} to his ability as a player, Lazetich developed a reputation as [...] "a wild character {{if there ever was}} one." [...] Decades later, Los Angeles Times columnist Frank Finch wrote that, although modern players were bigger and faster, he preferred the characters of the early NFL over the [...] "faceless robots" [...] of the modern game. [...] He focused in particular on Lazetich: [...] "A character's character was Ram middle guard Milan (Sheriff) Lazetich. [...] He was a blithe spirit from Montana who'd played college football at Michigan before joining the Rams in '46 for a five-year stint. [...] That he lasted that long with the club is remarkable in light of what he pulled at Dan Reeves' Christmas party for the team {{at the end of the}} '46 season." [...] Reeves, the Rams' owner, invited the team to a party at his home; the centerpiece was a large cake in the design of a football field topped with a full-size football covered in chocolate. [...] Teammate and Pro Football Hall of Famer Tom Fears later recalled the incident this way:"During the course of predinner libations, someone asked Lazetich to demonstrate his punting prowess. [...] I don't think he'd ever kicked a football before in his life. [...] They dared him to boot the chocolate football, which was a big mistake because Laz wasn't the kind of guy to take a dare lightly. [...] He ambled <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> plucked the football off the top of the fancy cake, brought it out in the front room and drove his toe into it with beautiful form and a perfect follow through. [...] Cake, frosting and everything else that was loose was well distributed over the ceiling, walls, windows and drapes. ... It also was the last party Reeves ever held in his house for the Rams." ...|$|E

50|$|The Friends of Rock Castle {{was formed}} in 1969 at time when the mansion and grounds were sold <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state from a Smith descendant. Board members take pride {{in the fact that}} Smith {{relatives}} have only owned the house. Sarah Crosby Berry was one of the founding members of the board. Each board member, save one, serves a three-year term. There are fifteen board members, including a “board member for life” who is Melinda Gaines, who has been on the board over twenty years. Most board members are very active with the site.At the time of museum creation, the State of Tennessee removed years of updates <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mansion. One update was the removal of a concrete floor in a bathroom, which turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Sarah Berry assisted with the selection of the stones for the flooring based on her memory from when she was a child. Dormers were removed from the central portion of the house with the assumption that they were added later. However, they were actually original to that edition of the mansion, but are too expensive to restore at this point.|$|R

5000|$|When {{the rest}} of the cast and Sidney arrive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> house, Audrey vents her {{frustration}} to them. It is revealed that Agnes has been violently stalking Audrey for some time, going so far as <b>to</b> steal <b>the</b> Saturn Award that she won for her portrayal of Shelby. Audrey wants to leave but is convinced to stay by Shelby. Sidney distributes cellphones with only the camera's enabled and tells them that they should use them to film. He leaves and tensions begin to rise between all the participants. Later, the reenactors question the truth of their real life counterparts stories. Matt enters the room and asks them when they shot their reenactments. They tell him they shot during the summer and he promises them that during the Blood Moon will be different. An intertitle reveals that during the three days, {{all but one of the}} participants died. The planned series never made it to air and what remains is assembled from found footage. Tensions continue to flair up in the house, as Shelby tries to reconnect with Matt, Monet blames Lee for her drinking problem, and the arrival of Dominic leads Matt to attack him. Audrey goes to shower but is attacked by the Piggy Man. Rory furiously looks around for what he assumes to be a plant from Sidney only to be stabbed <b>to</b> death by <b>the</b> two nurses. Later, Matt goes into the living room and sees that the word [...] "Murder" [...] has been completely spelled <b>out.</b> He returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and relates what he found <b>to</b> <b>the</b> others, stating blankly that, [...] "R, is for Rory." ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{had to talk}} {{mostly with}} my husband, of course, {{and when they did}} talk to me it was through him. They were very {{intelligent}} about our world, much more than we are about Altruria, though, of course, it was by deduction from premises rather than specific information, and they wanted to ask a thousand questions; but they saw the joke of it, and laughed with us when Aristides put them off with a promise that if they would have a public meeting appointed we would appear and answer all the questions anybody could think of; {{we were not going to}} waste our answers on them the first day. He wanted them to let us go out and help wash the dishes, but they would not hear of it. I confess I was rather glad of that, for it seemed a lower depth to which I could not descend, even after eating with them. But they invited us <b>out</b> <b>to</b> look at <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> after they had got it in order a little, and when we joined them there, whom should I see but my own dear old mother, with an apron up to her chin, wiping the glass and watching carefully through her dear old spectacles that she got everything bright! You know she was of a simpler day than ours, and when she was young she used to do her own work, and she and my father always washed the dishes together after they had company. I merely said, [...] "Well, mother!" [...] and she laughed and colored, and said she guessed she should like it in Altruria, for it took her back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> America she used to know.|$|R

60|$|On {{the third}} evening William and Lily were sitting {{together}} in the parlour by {{the fire in the}} dark. At a quarter to eleven Mrs. Morel was heard raking the fire. William came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> followed by his beloved.|$|E
50|$|However, Brother Rus was {{an ambitious}} {{young man and}} came up with a plan <b>to</b> advance himself. <b>The</b> {{opportunity}} came one day when he found himself alone with <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> master, whom he struck so hard that he broke his skull. After making sure <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> master was dead, Brother Rus ran <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other monks calling for help because his master had been injured. <b>The</b> monks hurried <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and found that <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> master was dead. Not knowing that Brother Rus had any responsibility, the abbot appointed him as the new master of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> monks were so pleased at his good food that they suggested he become one of them, which he did.|$|R

40|$|A teleological {{explanation}} {{of human behavior}} explains the behavior by citing a state of affairs or goal towards which was directed. Canonical teleological explanations of action comprise mention of an agent, the agent’s behavior, a teleological connective, {{and the state of}} affairs towards which the behavior was directed. For example, Jane went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> in order <b>to</b> get coffee. In this example, the connective is the phrase “in order to, ” but explanations can be explicitly teleological with other connectives as well. For example, Jane went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> for <b>the</b> purpose of getting coffee. Jane went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>to</b> get coffee. Jane went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> with <b>the</b> aim of getting coffee. These teleological explanations of behavior are paradigm cases of explaining an agent’s action in terms of her reasons, and thus count as reason explanations of behavior. Like the examples above, many reason explanations of human behavior are in explicitly teleological form. Others are not in explicitly teleological form: (1) Jane went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> because she wanted coffee...|$|R

60|$|As I {{dropped into}} my {{accustomed}} nook of the veranda, the industrious Doña Maria hastened <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{to perform a}} remaining duty.

60|$|Her mother, without replying, went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Vera {{followed}} her. Frank, {{left alone}} with his father, moved uneasily, and bent his thin shoulders lower over his book. Siegmund remained with his arms on his knees, looking into the grate. From the kitchen came the chinking of crockery, and soon the smell of coffee. All the time Vera was heard chatting with affected brightness to her mother, addressing her in fond tones, using all her wits to recall bright little incidents to retail to her. Beatrice answered rarely, and then with utmost brevity.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the girls}} tripped <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> which {{was filled with}} appetizing odors emanating from the oven, where the {{chickens}} were already sizzling splendidly. Anne prepared the potatoes and Diana got the peas and beans ready. Then, while Diana shut herself into the pantry to compound the lettuce salad, Anne, whose cheeks were already beginning to glow crimson, as much with excitement as from {{the heat of the}} fire, prepared the bread sauce for the chickens, minced her onions for the soup, and finally whipped the cream for her lemon pies.|$|E
60|$|You {{never saw}} a more {{astonished}} dog than Mr. Riley. With a yell of terror he bolted <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> {{out of the kitchen}} into the hall, through the hall into the room, and so into the kitchen and round again. With each circuit he went faster and faster, until he looked like a brindled streak with a dash of black and white on top. Such a racket and commotion I never heard, and I laughed until the tears came into my eyes. Mr. Riley flew around and around, and William Adolphus held on grimly and clawed. Alexander Abraham turned purple with rage.|$|E
