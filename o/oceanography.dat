5|$|He {{became a}} full {{professor}} in 1963 and retired in 1980. He remained interested in <b>oceanography,</b> scuba diving, seashell collecting and the outdoors throughout his later years, {{and continued to}} work both on oceanographic research, {{as well as on}} the DUMAND deep ocean neutrino astronomy project, which combined his two careers in physics and <b>oceanography.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} study of water and Earth's water cycle is hydrology; hydrodynamics studies the physics of water in motion. The more recent study of the sea in particular is <b>oceanography.</b> This began as {{the study of the}} shape of the ocean's currents but has since expanded into a large and multidisciplinary field: it examines the properties of seawater; studies waves, tides, and currents; charts coastlines and maps the seabeds; and studies marine life. The subfield dealing with the sea's motion, its forces, and the forces acting upon it is known as physical <b>oceanography.</b> Marine biology (biological <b>oceanography)</b> studies the plants, animals, and other organisms inhabiting marine ecosystems. Both are informed by chemical <b>oceanography,</b> which studies the behavior of elements and molecules within the oceans: particularly, at the moment, the ocean's role in the carbon cycle and carbon dioxide's role in the increasing acidification of seawater. Marine and maritime geography charts the shape and shaping of the sea, while marine geology (geological <b>oceanography)</b> has provided evidence of continental drift and the composition and structure of the Earth, clarified the process of sedimentation, and assisted the study of volcanism and earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|A sign {{of global}} warming, the average surface {{temperature}} of the water at Scripps Pier in the California Current has increased by almost 3 degrees since 1950, according to scientists at Scripps Institution of <b>Oceanography.</b>|$|E
5|$|A weather ship, or Ocean Station Vessel, was a ship {{stationed}} in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in weather forecasting. They were primarily located in the north Atlantic and north Pacific oceans, reporting via radio. In addition to their weather reporting function, these vessels aided in search and rescue operations, supported transatlantic flights, acted as research platforms for oceanographers, monitored marine pollution, and aided weather forecasting both by weather forecasters and within computerized atmospheric models. Research vessels remain heavily used in <b>oceanography,</b> including physical <b>oceanography</b> and the integration of meteorological and climatological data in Earth system science.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, a {{wildlife}} monitoring organization, WildTrack, started using JMP with the Footprint Identification Technology (FIT) system to identify individual endangered animals by their footprints. In 2009, the Chicago Botanic Garden used JMP to analyze DNA data from tropical breadfruit. Researchers {{determined that the}} seedless, starchy fruit {{was created by the}} deliberate hybridization of two fruits, the breadnut and the dugdug. The Herzenberg Laboratory at Stanford has integrated JMP with the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS). The FACS system is used to study HIV, cancer, stem-cells and <b>oceanography.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, Duffield was {{secretary}} and executive assistant to Roger Revelle, {{the director of}} the Scripps Institution of <b>Oceanography.</b> In November 1967, she became secretary and executive assistant to Robert R. Wilson, the founding director of the National Accelerator Laboratory, and once again she helped establish a new scientific laboratory on a new site. In later life she moved to Colorado, where she served {{on the board of the}} Uncompahgre Medical Clinic.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry is {{a family}} of {{techniques}} in which waves, usually electromagnetic waves, are superimposed causing the phenomenon of interference in order to extract information. Interferometry is an important investigative technique {{in the fields of}} astronomy, fiber optics, engineering metrology, optical metrology, <b>oceanography,</b> seismology, spectroscopy (and its applications to chemistry), quantum mechanics, nuclear and particle physics, plasma physics, remote sensing, biomolecular interactions, surface profiling, microfluidics, mechanical stress/strain measurement, velocimetry, and optometry.|$|E
5|$|On 9 March 1904 Scotia {{reached its}} most southerly {{latitude}} of 74°01'S. At this point, {{the ship was}} held fast in the pack ice, and the prospect loomed of becoming trapped for the winter. It was {{during this period of}} inactivity that bagpiper Gilbert Kerr was photographed serenading a penguin. On 13 March the ship broke free and began to move slowly north-eastward under steam. Throughout this part of the voyage a regular programme of depth soundings, trawls, and sea-bottom samples provided a comprehensive record of the <b>oceanography</b> and marine life of the Weddell Sea.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Keli {{was first}} noted as a depression, to the {{northeast}} of the New Zealand territory of Tokelau during June 7, 1997. Over {{the next couple of}} days the system moved towards the south-west and gradually developed further, with the United States Naval Pacific Meteorology and <b>Oceanography</b> Center (NPMOC) issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system during June 9.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 {{study by}} {{researchers}} at the Scripps Institution of <b>Oceanography</b> concluded that the imbalance between global dimming and global warming at the surface leads to weaker turbulent heat fluxes to the atmosphere. This means globally reduced evaporation and hence precipitation occur in a dimmer and warmer world, which could ultimately lead to a more humid atmosphere in which it rains less.|$|E
5|$|The Showa Station is Japan's main {{research}} station in Antarctica. A {{vast array of}} research is conducted there, including upper atmosphere physics, meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy/mapping, <b>oceanography,</b> glaciology, geology, marine and terrestrial biology, and medical research. Japan's other station, Dome Fuji Station was opened {{as part of a}} major ice-coring project. It mainly studies climate change and conducts deep drilling and atmospheric observations.|$|E
5|$|William Beebe was {{a pioneer}} in the field now known as ecology. His theory that organisms must be {{understood}} {{in the context of the}} ecosystems they inhabit was completely new for its time, and has been highly influential. The method he invented of methodically analyzing all organisms within a small area of wilderness has become a standard method in this field. Beebe was also {{a pioneer in the}} field of <b>oceanography,</b> setting a precedent with his Bathysphere dives which many other researchers would follow.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 he {{attended}} the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from <b>oceanography</b> to nuclear weapons. In the course of discussing a small nuclear warhead for the Mark 45 torpedo, he started a discussion {{on the possibility of}} developing a physically small one-megaton nuclear warhead for the Polaris missile. His counterpart in the discussion, J. Carson Mark from the Los Alamos National Laboratory, at first insisted it could not be done. However, Dr. Mark eventually stated that a half-megaton warhead of small enough size could be developed. This yield, roughly thirty times that of the Hiroshima bomb, was enough for Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke, who was present in person, and Navy strategic missile development shifted from Jupiter to Polaris {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{supervised}} {{the construction of}} a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of <b>oceanography,</b> which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant land masses between the Eurasian continents and the North Pole, and confirmed the general character of the north polar region as a deep, ice-covered sea. Although Nansen retired from exploration after this expedition, the methods of travel and survival he developed with Johansen influenced all the polar expeditions, north and south, which followed in the subsequent three decades.|$|E
5|$|The Dania Beach Campus, {{also known}} as SeaTech, was founded in 1997 as a state-funded TypeII {{research}} center. The institute is part of Florida Atlantic's Department of Ocean Engineering {{which was founded in}} 1965 as the first ocean engineering undergraduate program in the nation. The campus is located on 8acres (0.03km²) of land between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway. SeaTech is home to university faculty and students engaged in sponsored ocean engineering research and development in the areas of acoustics, marine vehicles, hydrodynamics and physical <b>oceanography,</b> marine materials and nanocomposites. The Dania Beach Campus serves approximately 70students, roughly 1% of the university's total student body.|$|E
5|$|During the season, {{tropical}} cyclones were officially {{monitored by}} the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers (TCWC) in Brisbane, Australia and Wellington, New Zealand. Throughout the season the United States Navy also monitored the basin and issued unofficial warnings, through its Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and Naval Pacific Meteorology and <b>Oceanography</b> Center (NPMOC). Tropical cyclones that were located between 160°E and 120°W {{as well as the}} Equator and 25°S were monitored by RSMC Nadi while any that were located to the south of 25°S between 160°E and 120°W were monitored by TCWC Wellington. During the season the JTWC issued warnings on any tropical cyclone that was located between 160°E and 180° while the NPMOC issued warnings for tropical cyclones forming between the 180° and the American coast. RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington both used the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale, and measured windspeeds over a 10-minute period during the season, while the JTWC and the NPMOC measured sustained windspeeds over a 1-minute period.|$|E

5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1887, Bruce {{travelled}} north to Edinburgh to attend a pair of vacation courses in natural sciences. The six-week courses, at the recently established Scottish Marine Station at Granton on the Firth of Forth, were {{under the direction of}} Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson, and included sections on botany and practical zoology. The experience of Granton, and the contact with some of the foremost contemporary natural scientists, convinced Bruce to stay in Scotland. He abandoned his place at UCL, and enrolled instead in the medical school at the University of Edinburgh. This enabled him to maintain contact with mentors such as Geddes and Thomson, and also gave him the opportunity to work during his free time in the Edinburgh laboratories where specimens brought back from the Challenger expedition were being examined and classified. Here he worked under Dr John Murray and his assistant John Young Buchanan, and gained a deeper understanding of <b>oceanography</b> and invaluable experience in the principles of scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|Former {{changes in}} sea levels have left {{continental}} shelves, shallow {{areas in the}} sea close to land. These nutrient-rich waters teem with life, which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals, and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed. The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs. Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting. <b>Oceanography</b> has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters: even under enormous depths and pressures, nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem. Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea.|$|E
5|$|Mallory's {{first major}} speech in Congress {{was in favor}} of a return to flogging, which he argued was needed in order that a captain would be able to control his seamen in battle. His {{position}} was unpopular throughout the nation, and Congress refused to lift the ban. His views on flogging, for good or ill, were forgotten when he turned his energies to the second of President Fillmore's proposals, that of reforming the officer corps of the Navy. He was by this time chairman of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and the law that Congress passed was recognized as coming from his hand. It established a Retirement Board of senior naval officers, who examined the qualifications of all other commissioned officers. Those who were deemed incapable or unworthy of their rank were placed on a retired list, the first compulsory retirement {{in the history of the}} U.S. Navy. By most accounts, the board did its work creditably, but many of the officers who were adversely affected did not agree. Among those who were forced into early retirement was Matthew Fontaine Maury, too crippled to go to sea, but whose study of ocean currents formed the basis for the new science of <b>oceanography.</b> Maury and some of the other retirees enlisted other Senators to support their cases, and the debate was renewed. In the end, however, Mallory's views prevailed, a testimonial to his parliamentary skills. The enmity between Maury and Mallory lasted the remainder of their lives and distorted their performance in the Civil War, when both men sided with the South.|$|E
