5|$|The crowd {{eventually}} dispersed after Acting Governor Thomas Hutchinson promised an inquiry, but {{the crowd}} re-formed the next day, prompting {{the withdrawal of the}} troops to Castle Island.

Defended by lawyer and future American president John Adams, six of the soldiers were acquitted, while the other two were convicted <b>of</b> <b>manslaughter</b> and given reduced sentences. The men found guilty <b>of</b> <b>manslaughter</b> were sentenced to branding on their hand. Depictions, reports, and propaganda about the event, notably the colored engraving produced by Paul Revere (shown at top-right), further heightened tensions throughout the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E

5|$|The {{church does}} not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, and in a few cases convicted <b>of,</b> <b>manslaughter</b> or neglect.|$|E

5|$|In 1882, Crease {{presided over}} the trial of John Hall, who owned {{most of the land}} on Burrard Inlet that now makes up the {{community}} of Belcarra, British Columbia, and who was accused of murdering his mother in law. Hall and Crease had known each other for years, and Crease had once employed him as his agent in a dispute with trespassers who illegally logged on land he and his friend Robert Burnaby owned near Hall's ranch.

5|$|Italian {{prosecutors}} brought {{legal proceedings}} against six people {{in connection with}} Senna's death. They were Frank Williams, Patrick Head and Adrian Newey of Williams; Fedrico Bendinelli representing {{the owners of the}} Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari; Giorgio Poggi as the circuit director and Roland Bruynseraede who was race director and sanctioned the circuit. The trial verdict was given on 16 December 1997, clearing all six defendants <b>of</b> <b>manslaughter</b> charges. The cause of Senna's accident was established by the court as the steering column breaking. The column had been cut and welded back together at Senna's request in order for him to be more comfortable in the car.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of Mr. X. was a closely held secret for 40 years. In {{the process of}} reopening the case, Mitchell, Bradford and the three students discovered the {{identity of}} Mr. X.

5|$|The jury {{agreed with}} Adams and acquitted {{six of the}} {{soldiers}} after two and one-half hours' deliberation. Two of the soldiers were found guilty <b>of</b> <b>manslaughter</b> because there was overwhelming evidence that they had fired directly into the crowd. The jury's decisions suggest that they believed the soldiers had felt threatened by the crowd, but should have delayed firing. Patrick Carr, the fifth victim, corroborated this with deathbed testimony delivered to his doctor. The convicted soldiers were granted reduced sentences by invoking Benefit of clergy, which reduced their punishment from a death sentence to branding of the thumb in open court.|$|E

5|$|As {{a test to}} see if his gubernatorial {{authority}} was still recognized, Taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted <b>of</b> <b>manslaughter</b> in Knott County. The pardon was signed by the proper county officials, but officers at the penitentiary refused to release the man. It was feared that Taylor would dispatch the state militia to remove the prisoner, but no further {{attempts were made to}} secure his release. Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office, Taylor was criticized for not having offered a reward for the capture of Goebel's unknown assailant. Responding that he was not authorized to make an offer {{in the absence of a}} request to do so by the officials in Franklin County, he offered a $500 reward from his own money.|$|E

5|$|Edgefield {{was known}} as a violent place, even by the {{standards}} of antebellum South Carolina, where matters of personal honor might be addressed with a killing or duel. Before Tillman Sr.'s death from typhoid fever in 1849, he had killed a man and been convicted of rioting by an Edgefield jury. One of his sons died in a duel; another was killed in a domestic dispute. A third died in the Mexican-American War; a fourth of disease aged 15. Of Benjamin Jr.'s two surviving brothers, one died of Civil War wounds after returning home, and the other, George, killed a man who accused him of cheating at gambling.

He later served several terms in Congress.|$|E
5|$|In 1576, Elizabeth I {{granted the}} castles of Brownsea and Corfe for life to Sir Christopher Hatton, {{making him the}} Admiral of Purbeck. Hatton argued with the town of Poole, {{claiming}} {{that he had the}} right to search and inspect ships going into Poole Harbour, as well as the rights to the revenues from the local ferry service; he lost his legal case around the ferrying rights in 1581. In 1589, the Bountiful Gift refused to pull in for inspection, arguing that it had had a valid pass to leave, and Brownsea Castle fired on the vessel, killing two of the crew. The castle's captain, Walter Partridge, was tried and conflicted <b>of</b> <b>manslaughter,</b> but ultimately pardoned. The rest of the island, but not the castle, was leased out to various landowners over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|The club's {{supporters}} {{have been involved}} in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters were killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse. UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters, and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990–91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990. Twenty-seven fans were arrested on suspicion <b>of</b> <b>manslaughter</b> and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial. In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14Liverpool fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter; half of the terms were suspended.|$|E
