5|$|The {{stress of}} {{maintaining}} a career and a household {{can also lead to}} a loss of sleep. In traditional gender roles it is usually the mother who is the <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the family going in the morning as she fixes breakfast and takes the children to school before she goes to her own job. At night the mother cooks and does various other activities around the house that cause her to be the last person to retire for the night as well. Although this is merely just a few gender roles that are not set in stone, they may hold to be true. It was found that working women sleep twenty-five minutes less a night due solely to their responsibility for domestic work. Applying this statistic in larger scale leads to the assumption that women on average lose up to thirteen hours of sleep per month due to domestic duties. It can be assumed that it is possible for an average woman to lose up to one hundred and fifty-six hours of sleep during a year because of domestic work and motherly duties.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} his {{weakness}} as ruler is seen in his utter indifference to the vital decision of choosing a new French regent; as Somerset and York debate the issue, each trying to convince Henry {{that they should be}} the <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the job, Henry dismissively declares, [...] "For my part, noble Lords, I care not which:/Or Somerset or York, all's one to me" [...] (1.3.102-103). This lack of concern is forcibly emphasised when Somerset later tells Henry that all French territories have been lost, and Henry responds nonchalantly, [...] "Cold news, Lord Somerset; but God's will be done" [...] (3.1.86). His lack of decisive leadership is even referred to by others; Margaret claims that [...] "Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,/Too full of foolish pity" [...] (3.1.224–225). Later, when the Irish post appears with news of rebellion, York says he will do whatever Henry deems necessary, to which Suffolk responds [...] "Why, our authority is his consent,/And what we do establish he confirms" [...] (3.1.316-317).|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} activities {{inside the park}} in summer are sport fishing as well as boat or canoe trips. Navigation by boat is in fact {{one of the best}} ways to explore the park, and the island of Sandön is particularly popular. The park also attracts many bird watchers in winter and spring, especially near Tinäset where the birdlife is the richest. However, the part of the road that enabled <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there was closed because it traversed the park — which closing was decided during the park's creation. As a result, the number of tourists at this location diminished considerably. A visitor, information, and nature center was built inside an old barn (dating from 1814) of the Gysinge forge. At Skekarsbo, an observation tower [...] in height was constructed in 1995 and offers a panoramic view over the major part of the park. Several hiking trails exist inside the park, in particular in the north part: on the isle of Mattön (between Gysinge and Sevedskvarn), a part of Gästrikeleden across the park from Gysinge, and from Kyrkstigen up to Skekarsbo. In the southern part, a long trail leads to Tinäset.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reviewing}} the existing {{law on the}} subject of vagueness, starting with the Supreme Court's decision in Grayned v. City of Rockford eight years earlier, Leighton considered Hoffman Estates' ordinance. [...] "It is obvious that [...] is not a model of legislative clarity," [...] he began. [...] "Its purpose, nonetheless, is evident." [...] The words [...] "item", [...] "effect", [...] "paraphernalia", [...] "accessory" [...] or even [...] "thing" [...] were not used in a technical sense; [...] "they are, in fact, ordinary words." [...] Since no precedent had considered their definition, he resorted to a dictionary and found clear and specific definitions for all but <b>one.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> a better handle on the remaining word, [...] "paraphernalia", he looked to a 1954 decision in a bookmaking case by a California appellate court, which noted that it was [...] "not a technical word in the law of crimes, although it may be in the law of property." [...] More recently, he noted, both law enforcement and drug users had begun referring to the items targeted by the ordinance collectively as parpahernalia, and the Eighth Circuit had taken notice of that usage in a case where it upheld the seizure of such items based on search warrant which had used the word.|$|E

2500|$|With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in {{the last}} hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and {{defeated}} the Threshing Machines Bill. If your readers ask me why Mr. Biggar defeated the Threshing Machines Bill, I really must confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do – I mean it was daring in <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up with the knowledge that you must talk for a half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, the honourable member for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.|$|E
2500|$|İnalcık also {{mentions}} that while scholars from for example Persia travelled to the Ottomans {{in order to}} share their knowledge, Ottomans travelled as well to receive education from scholars of these Islamic lands, such as Egypt, Persia and Turkestan. Hence, this reveals that similar to today's modern world, individuals from the early modern society travelled abroad to receive education and share knowledge and {{that the world was}} more interconnected than it seems. Also, it reveals how the system of [...] "schooling" [...] was also similar to today's modern world where students travel abroad to different countries for studies. Examples of Ottoman madaris are the ones built by Mehmed the Conqueror. He built eight madaris that were built [...] "on either side of the mosque where there were eight higher madaris for specialised studies and eight lower medreses, which prepared students for these." [...] The fact that they were built around, or near mosques reveals the religious impulses behind madrasa building and it reveals the interconnectedness between institutions of learning and religion. The students who completed their education in the lower medreses became known as danismends. This reveals that similar to the education system today, the Ottomans' educational system involved different kinds of schools attached to different kinds of levels. For example, there were lower madaris and specialised ones, and for <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into the specialised area meant that he had to complete the classes in the lower one in order to adequately prepare himself for higher learning.|$|E
2500|$|Bo Duke (John Schneider) is the blond-haired, younger Duke boy (Wopat and Schneider {{are nine}} years apart from each other's age when Bo and Luke are {{supposed}} to be three years apart from each other's age). He is more of the [...] "shoot first, ask questions later" [...] type than Luke, and is often the <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the duo into the various scrapes in which they find themselves, although the character did mature slightly as the series progressed; he is also the one more likely to have his eye, or heart, distracted by a pretty girl. Bo has a crush on many women in some episodes, which proves to be the Achilles' heel that leads the Dukes into trouble in several episode plots. Bo usually wears a cream-yellow shirt; it is a stronger yellow in the first and second season, a lighter cream color from the third season, and in the sixth and seventh season has more of a grey hue to it, in season 6 and season 7 he wears a tan brown shirt and more of dark blue jeans. (The only break from this norm is in the second episode produced and broadcast, [...] "Daisy's Song," [...] where Bo wears a red shirt for much of the story, and a sequence in the fifth episode, [...] "High Octane," [...] where he wears a light blue shirt. Many early publicity shots show the character to be wearing a dark blue denim shirt.) For the first two seasons he wears a blue T-shirt underneath (brown in the first episode); this was slowly phased out during the third season. An ex-stock car driver, Bo is the one who drives The General Lee most of the time with Luke riding shotgun. He and Luke take turns of driving the General Lee in some episodes as they share the car with each other (very early episodes suggest that it belongs solely to him; Luke is said to have a car that Cooter had wrecked shortly {{prior to the start of}} the opening episode, [...] "One Armed Bandits"). Bo is known for his rebel yell, [...] "Yeeeee-Haaa," [...] which he usually yells when the General Lee is airborne during a jump. The Duke boys share the CB call sign or handle [...] "Lost Sheep".|$|E
