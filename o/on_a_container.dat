500|$|An {{extended}} flashback reveals Finn's origin, {{and what}} happened to the other humans. Roughly a thousand years prior to the main events of the series, a group of humansaided by Marcelinefled Ooo <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>container</b> ship (as seen in Stakes). They eventually settled on a secluded island chain far from the mainland. [...] Over the next thousand years, their community thrived and developed into an advanced technological society. While it was a veritable utopia, there were those few who occasionally grew dissatisfied with their rigidly structured lives and attempted to flee the island; these [...] "hiders" [...] were in turn hunted down and returned by specially trained [...] "seekers". It is revealed that Susan's real name is Kara, and that she was once a seeker in training. [...] Kara was friends with a fellow human, Frieda (voiced by Jasika Nicole), who began expressing a desire to flee the safe albeit authoritarian island. This revelation causes Kara some discomfort, so she approaches Dr. Gross (voiced by Lennon Parham), the cybernetic human in charge of training seekers, asking if the humans can live off the island. Dr. Gross convinces her that the outside is dangerous and, to prevent her from fleeing, she controls Kara with a remote control. Now fully under Dr. Gross's control, Kara stops Frieda from leaving and drags her away crying. Back in the present, Susan tells Finn her real name and decides to take Finn to Founders Island so that he can be reunited with his mother, Minerva Campbell (voiced by Sharon Horgan).|$|E
2500|$|The three {{prototype}} {{boats were}} withdrawn between 1994 and 1997, {{the third of}} which then went {{on display at the}} National Lifeboat Museum. The production series boats were taken out of regular service between 1998 and 2007. While a few have found new uses around the coast of Great Britain, the majority have been sold to other lifeboat operators around the world, predominantly in China, Finland and Iceland [...] and some further boats were built new for service in Canada and Greece. Those travelling long distances go as deck cargo on larger ships but those going to closer harbours are generally sailed across under their own power. The first boat to go to Iceland, the Richard Evans, was loaded as deck cargo <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>container</b> ship but was washed overboard during the passage – the only Arun to have been lost at sea.|$|E

5000|$|The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, or UNCTAD, in its 2010 Review of Maritime Trade tracks {{two aspects}} of {{container}} shipping prices. [...] The first is a chartering price, specifically the price to time-charter a 1 TEU slot for a 14 metric ton cargo <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>container</b> ship. [...] The other is the freight rate, or comprehensive daily cost to deliver one-TEU worth of cargo on a given route. [...] As {{a result of the}} late-2000s recession, both indicators showed sharp drops during 2008-2009, and have shown signs of stabilization since 2010.|$|E
50|$|After the war, {{a concept}} called the {{shipborne}} containerized air-defense system (SCADS) proposed a modular system to quickly convert a large RORO into an emergency aircraft carrier with ski jump, fueling systems, radar, defensive missiles, munitions, crew quarters, and work spaces. The entire {{system could be}} installed in about 48 hours <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>container</b> ship or RORO, when needed for operations up to a month unsupplied. The system could quickly be removed and stored again when the conflict was over. The Soviets flying Yakovlev Yak-38 fighters also tested operations using the civilian RORO ships Agostinio Neto and Nikolai Cherkasov.|$|E
2500|$|In jars, fresh honey {{should appear}} as a pure, {{consistent}} fluid, and should not set in layers. Within {{a few weeks to}} a few months of extraction, many varieties of honey crystallize into a cream-colored solid. Some varieties of honey, including tupelo, acacia, and sage, crystallize less regularly. Honey may be heated during bottling at temperatures of [...] to delay or inhibit crystallization. Overheating is indicated by change in enzyme levels, for instance, diastase activity, which can be determined with the Schade or the Phadebas methods. <b>A</b> fluffy film <b>on</b> the surface of the honey (like a white foam), or marble-colored or white-spotted crystallization <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>container's</b> sides, is formed by air bubbles trapped during the bottling process.|$|R
50|$|This {{generality}} {{also comes}} at a price at times. For example, performing <b>a</b> search <b>on</b> <b>an</b> associative <b>container</b> such as <b>a</b> map or set can be much slower using iterators than by calling member functions offered by the container itself. This is because <b>an</b> associative <b>container's</b> methods can take advantage of knowledge of the internal structure, which is opaque to algorithms using iterators.|$|R
