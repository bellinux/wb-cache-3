50|$|All {{decisions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sacred <b>congregations</b> require pontifical approval, unless {{special powers}} {{have been given}} previously by the pope. <b>The</b> officials <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregations</b> are divided into two classes: minor officers, who are to be chosen by competitive examination and named by a letter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cardinal-prefect, and major officers, freely selected by the pope, and named by a note <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cardinal Secretary <b>of</b> State. There is to be henceforth no cumulation <b>of</b> offices in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> one individual, not only to satisfy <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> distributive justice, but also because <b>the</b> tenure <b>of</b> several offices by the same person often results in detriment to the service. Wherefore, it is forbidden for an officer <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregations</b> to serve in any way as an agent, or as a procurator or advocate, in his own department {{or in any other}} ecclesiastical tribunal.|$|R

People cried as the Blessed Sacrament was carried {{out of the church}} by the pastor. The congregation followed the pastor up to the new church.|$|E
5|$|The Lansbury home at 39 Bow Road was {{destroyed}} by bombing during the London Blitz of 1940–41.

5|$|The M.A. {{concentration}} in Pastoral Care and Counseling {{can serve as}} an excellent path of study for those who support the life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregation,</b> desire a career in pastoral counseling in a non-profit agency, or who envision chaplaincy – in fields such as health care, corrections, community or the military – {{as an expression of}} their call to ministry.|$|E

5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> are disputed; its {{establishment}} in 1885 {{may have been}} a re-organization of a congregation founded in 1860. Located initially close to the Romanian quarter at 70 Hester Street, and later situated at the heart of it with the move to Rivington Street, the synagogue was the preferred house of worship for the quarter's inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The {{tensions}} between liberal-minded {{members and the}} traditional Levy were never resolved, and in 1891, the rabbi moved to San Francisco's Congregation Beth Israel.
