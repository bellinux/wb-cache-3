50|$|All {{decisions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sacred <b>congregations</b> require pontifical approval, unless {{special powers}} {{have been given}} previously by the pope. <b>The</b> officials <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregations</b> are divided into two classes: minor officers, who are to be chosen by competitive examination and named by a letter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cardinal-prefect, and major officers, freely selected by the pope, and named by a note <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cardinal Secretary <b>of</b> State. There is to be henceforth no cumulation <b>of</b> offices in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> one individual, not only to satisfy <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> distributive justice, but also because <b>the</b> tenure <b>of</b> several offices by the same person often results in detriment to the service. Wherefore, it is forbidden for an officer <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregations</b> to serve in any way as an agent, or as a procurator or advocate, in his own department {{or in any other}} ecclesiastical tribunal.|$|R

People cried as the Blessed Sacrament was carried {{out of the church}} by the pastor. The congregation followed the pastor up to the new church.|$|E
5|$|The Lansbury home at 39 Bow Road was {{destroyed}} by bombing during the London Blitz of 1940â41.

5|$|The M.A. {{concentration}} in Pastoral Care and Counseling {{can serve as}} an excellent path of study for those who support the life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregation,</b> desire a career in pastoral counseling in a non-profit agency, or who envision chaplaincy â in fields such as health care, corrections, community or the military â {{as an expression of}} their call to ministry.|$|E

5|$|The origins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>congregation</b> are disputed; its {{establishment}} in 1885 {{may have been}} a re-organization of a congregation founded in 1860.
