5000|$|Zwerg {{attended}} Beloit College, {{where he}} studied sociology. He developed an interest in civil rights from his interactions with his roommate, Robert Carter, an African-American from Alabama.Zwerg recalls: “ I witnessed prejudice against him… {{we would go to}} a lunch counter or cafeteria and people would get up and leave the table. I had pledged a particular fraternity and then found out that he was not allowed in the fraternity house. I decided that his friendship was more important than that particular fraternity, so I depledged.” [...] He participated in a <b>one-semester</b> student <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> in January 1961 at Nashville’s Fisk University, a predominantly black school. [...] At Fisk, Zwerg met John Lewis, who was active in the Civil Rights movement, and was immediately impressed with the way Lewis handled himself and his commitment to the movement. Lewis {{was a member of the}} Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), a student organized Civil Rights activist group focused on nonviolent direct action. Zwerg joined SNCC and suggested that the group attend a movie. SNCC members explained to Zwerg that Nashville theaters were segregated. Zwerg began attending SNCC nonviolence workshops, often playing the angry bigot in role-play. His first test was to buy two movie tickets and try to walk in with a black man. When trying to enter the theater on February 21, 1961, Zwerg was hit with a monkey wrench and knocked unconscious.|$|R

Secondly, these types of exchanges allow for participants and others to grow and to develop new or refined skills. The third role is economic as people brought to the United States necessarily expend money and benefit local economies. The final role that the Alliance states is integral to <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> is in leadership training.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This paper {{provides}} 1996 {{information on}} the status of US syringe <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> and compares these findings with data from our 1994 survey. METHODS: In November 1996, questionnaires were mailed to 101 syringe <b>exchange</b> <b>programs.</b> Program directors were contacted to conduct telephone interviews based on the mailed questionnaires. Data collected included number of syringes <b>exchanged,</b> syringe <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> operations, legal status, and services offered. RESULTS: Eighty-seven programs participated in the survey. A total of 46 (53 %) were legal, 20 (23 %) were illegal but tolerated, and 21 (24 %) were illegal-underground. Since 1994, there has been a 54 % {{increase in the number of}} cities and a 38 % increase in the number of states with syringe <b>exchange</b> <b>programs.</b> Eighty-four <b>programs</b> reported <b>exchanging</b> approximately 14 million syringes, a 75 % increase from 1994. Syringe <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> also provided a variety of other services and supplies, and legal programs were more likely than illegal ones to provide these services. CONCLUSION: Despite continued lack of federal funding, syringe <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> expanded in terms of the number of syringes exchanged, the geographic distribution of programs, and the range of services offered...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} {{university}} {{students participating in}} <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> has risen sharply over the last decade, but a survey of Swiss university graduates (class of 1999 and 2001) shows that participation in student <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> significantly prolongs {{the period of time}} spent studying at university. Given this fact, the advantages of <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> for students need to be identified. Analyses show that student <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> are associated with higher starting salaries and an increased likelihood of opting for postgraduate study - but only if all exchange semesters are factored in, not just those accredited by the university of matriculation. Using instrumental variable estimations (IV), however, shows that the cited outcomes are not causally related to participation in <b>exchange</b> <b>programs.</b> Therefore the big question is: Where's the benefit that justifies having to study for almost a whole year longer...|$|R

40|$|Korean ethnic {{schools in}} China have {{difficulty}} {{in their school}} management {{because the number of}} students has decreased since the 1990 's, and these schools face a crisis of Korean ethnic education in China. In this situation, there are some cases in which the Korean schools in China have a sister-school <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> with schools in South Korea. The sister-school <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> between the schools in South Korea and Korean ethnic school in China is regarded as one form of educational support for Korean Chinese by South Korea. If Korean Chinese improve their ethnic identity and get economical support from South Korea for the <b>exchange</b> <b>program,</b> it will be promoted. In this study, based on two cases related to the sister-school <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> between Korean ethnic schools in China and the schools in South Korea, the goal, meaning and problems of the program are analyzed from a {{point of view of the}} schools in South Korea. The result shows the goal of the <b>exchange</b> <b>programs</b> is that each student raises ethnic identity and makes a contribution to the world. The <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> has an educational effect on the schools in South Korea, and both sets of students increase consciousness of their ethnic identity through the exchange. Especially, South Korean students come to understand ethnic Korean students in China more deeply than before. This result also shows each side has a great influence on each other through the <b>exchange</b> <b>program.</b> The study shows that the expense for the <b>exchange</b> <b>program</b> becomes a burden for the schools in South Korea. One of the reasons is that the economic differentials between South Korea and the north-east area of China are so great. There are several factors to continue the sister-school exchange program; 1. the abundant financial resource of the school, 2. the form of school management, 3. the possibility of expanding <b>exchange</b> <b>programs,</b> 4. the maintenance of an equal relationship based on respect for each other, and 5. a positive attitude of the students for the <b>exchange</b> <b>program...</b>|$|R
