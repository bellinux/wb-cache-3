50|$|With {{the three}} phases <b>oil</b> <b>decanter,</b> {{a portion of}} the oil {{polyphenols}} is washed out due to the higher quantity of added water (when compared to the traditional method), producing a larger quantity of vegetation water that needs to be processed.|$|E
50|$|The two-and-a-half-phase <b>oil</b> <b>decanter</b> is a {{compromise}} between the two previous types of decanters. It separates the olive paste into the standard three phases, but has a smaller need for added water and also a smaller vegetation water output. Therefore, the water content of the obtained pomace comes very close {{to that of the}} standard three-phase decanter, and the vegetation water output is relatively small, minimizing the residue management issues.|$|E
50|$|The {{two phases}} <b>oil</b> <b>decanter</b> was created {{as an attempt}} to solve these problems. Sacrificing part of its {{extraction}} capability, it uses less added water thus reducing the phenol washing. The olive paste is separated into two phases: oil and wet pomace. This type of decanter, instead of having three exits (oil, water, and solids), has only two. The water is expelled by the decanter coil together with the pomace, resulting in a wetter pomace that is much harder to process industrially. Many pomace oil extraction facilities refuse to work with these materials because the energy costs of drying the pomace for the hexane oil extraction often make the extraction process sub-economical. In practice, then, the two phases decanter solves the phenol washing problem but increases the residue management problem. This residue management problem has been reduced by the collection of this wetter pomace and being transported to specialized facilities called extractors which heat the pomace between 45ºc and 50ºc and can extract up to a further 2 litres per 100 kilos of pomace using adapted two-phase decanters.|$|E

Characterization of decanter cake and soil is necessary prior to pot application as metal mobility increases with lowering of pH and enhancement of organic carbon in the receptor soil.

This would, over time, reduce the dependency on synthetic chemicals that have resulted in severe damages to flora and fauna communities and by extension to man.|$|R
40|$|Being among of {{the largest}} palm oil producer, Malaysia also {{produces}} large quantities of palm oil biomass such as empty fruit bunch (EFB), palm oil mill effluent (POME), palm kernel cake (PKC), decanter cake and palm shell. Due to the large of waste production, {{there should be a}} way to reuse this waste. Generally, most of oil palm biomass can be used as combustion fuel. This study is to produce the decanter cake as bio-briquettes. Decanter cakes are very difficult for storing, handling and burning because of the high moisture content levels in the residue and when associated with the organic contents in the decanter cakes, it will cause air pollution and exert polluted gaseous like ammonia gaseous. Utilization of palm <b>oil</b> <b>decanter</b> cake will improve the environment because the disposal of sludge solid waste will increase the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) of the land. The testing that been done moisture content analysis, volatile matter and ash content analysis, calorific value analysis and density testing. In order to produce the briquettes from the decanter cake, the raw material is dried at the temperature of 105 oC for 12 hours using oven in order to get rid the moisture. After that, the dry decanter cake will be grinding to make it into smaller size and separate into three class of sizes which is small, medium, and large to see the effect of the particle sizes. The briquetting process is done by using hydraulic press. In order to make the DC briquette more compact and and reduce the ash content of DC briquette, the raw material is mix with sawdust. Apart from that, DC briquette is compare to the sawdust briquette from Yoltan and pellet rice straw. As conclusion, particle sizes does not really affect the moisture content, volatile matter, ash content and the calorific value of the decanter cake since the raw material is been dry at the same temperature.

40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{investigate}} the potential of palm <b>oil</b> <b>decanter</b> cake (PDC) as the new substrate for bio-oil production. Conversion of PDC into bio-oil was conducted through vacuum pyrolysis. Maximum bio-oil yield was 22. 12 % obtained at pyrolysis temperature of 500 ºC. The chemical characterisation of bio-oil was studied using 1 H-NMR, FTIR, CHNS analyzer and GC–MS. The other properties like pH, calorific value and thermal volatilization were also determined. For comparison purpose, pyrolysis of palm kernel shell (PKS) was also conducted using the same method in PDC pyrolysis. The results indicate PDC bio-oil characteristic is better than that of PKS bio-oil in terms of lower oxygen content, higher pH and heating value. The pH value of PDC recorded to be 6. 38, which {{is found to be}} higher as compared to that of other bio-oils. The calorific value of PDC bio-oil was found to be 36. 79 MJ/kg, which is slightly lower than that of conventional liquid fuel such as gasoline and diesel fuel and much higher than that of bio-oils derived from lignocellulosic biomass. Fatty acid derived from decomposition of triglycerides dominated the composition of PDC bio-oils, while phenolic compounds were prominently found in PKS bio-oil. Effect of catalyst addition was studied by using single and dual stages of pyrolysis reactor. Single stage catalytic pyrolysis was conducted by mixing the catalyst with the biomass in a certain ratio prior to the experiment and was placed into the vacuum pyrolysis reactor. Catalytic reaction reduced the yield of PDC bio-oils, from 22. 12 wt% to 15. 22 – 17. 09 wt%. Catalytic activity of CaO and MgO enhanced the formation of methyl ester through the transesterification reaction of fatty acid, which was produced from decomposition of PDC. Generally, the oxygen content was decreased in presence of catalysts. H-ZSM 5 provides better oxygen content reduction than that of other catalysts, both for PDC and PKS. The presence of catalysts slightly affected the pH value and HHV of bio-oils. Dual stage catalytic pyrolysis was conducted by placing the catalysts separately into a catalyst reactor bed to catalyse the upgrading of pyrolytic vapor occurred. Less bio-oil were produced by dual stages catalytic pyrolysis. However, the ratio of O/C decreased while the calorific value slightly increased in dual stage pyrolysis. Bio-oils produced from PDC catalytic pyrolysis has relatively high calorific value than that of other bio-oils, and comparable to the HHV of petroleum fuels. Therefore, PDC bio-oil can be considered as potential alternative fuel. Kinetic studies of PDC pyrolysis were conducted by using thermogravimetry data. Coats-Redfern approach was employed to describe the kinetic model of the PDC thermal decomposition. It was found that the major decomposition of PDC occurred at 220 – 530 °C, represent for decomposition of hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and triglycerides contained in PDC. Two stages of reaction were identified, first stage at 220 – 300 °C obeyed first order kinetic model, while second stage at 300 – 530 °C was best fit for second order kinetic model. Triglyceride decomposition dominated the whole pyrolysis reaction.

Converting palm <b>oil</b> mill waste, <b>decanter</b> cakes into solid fuels is {{objective}} of this study especially to extract its potentiality to replace the existing boilers feed and to find the optimum condition {{that leads to the}} maximum energy recovery. The main steps involve in the process is pyrolysis at temperature ranges from 300 °C to 600 °C, the drying or heating process for 24 hours at temperature of 110 °C and studying the combustion characteristics in terms of heating values and comparing it to that of the commercial solid fuels. The works carried in this research also involve the proximate analysis and semi-quantitative analysis that leads to the computation of HHV and it is compared with that from the Oxygen-bomb Calorimeter (OBC). It also involve the combustion test of different diameter of DDCs and PDCs spheres to determine the optimum diameter. Based on the study, the decanter cakes is feasible to replace fiber and shell as boiler’s feed that promotes more than sufficient heat to dry the 70 kg/ton of decanter cake in-plant and hence generates electricity with and excess steam around 289. 075 kg/hr.

The theoretical background of oily water emulsion which is the characteristic of POME was reviewed. A range of experiments was performed on samples made up of different combinations {{of the three major}} components of POME namely, palm <b>oil,</b> solid from <b>decanter</b> and water. The results suggest that the development of a pre-treatment system to remove the 0. 5 - 1. 2 % residue oil and 3 - 4 % solid matter from the fresh POME is feasible thus it could improve the efficiency of further downstream POME treatment. Experiments were conducted to examine the rate of oil flotation from the mixtures of different ratios of palm oil and water treated with different concentrations of HCl, and temperatures and magnetic stirring. Similarly, a series of experiments were performed to determine the rate of solid settlement from palm oil-solid mixture, solid-water mixture and palm oil-solid-water mixture of different ratios treated with different concentrations of HCl and different temperatures. The data obtained from the experiments were used to determine the optimum dosage of HCl used and the temperature required for best oil recovery and solid settlement. From the kinetic studies, the models of the kinetic rate of palm oil flotation and solid settlement were derived. A macro kinetic modeling was adapted to the oil flotation while a power model was used for solid settling. The results showed that treatment with 0. 5 % HCl was sufficient to increase the rate of oil flotation significantly in Palm oil-water mixture. However, the effect was dependent on the oil-water ratio. An increase in temperature gave higher rate of oil flotation but not as great as that of HCl treatment. Dilution was found to be the two other factors that affected the rate of flotation. The solid settling rates in all tested samples were not significantly affected when they were treated with HCl. The rate of solid settlement was found to be temperature dependent. The optimum temperature for the rate of solid sedimentation was found to be in the region of 800 C.
