The presence of soil fauna would help the decomposition process <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> which fertilize the soil.

The sampling of mesofauna data used soil extraction “Barlesse-Tulgreen” method, meanwhile the macrofauna data were obtained from “Hand- Sorting” method and “Fill-Trapp” method. The sampling of decomposition rate data used Pudjiharta’s method (1995). The data which have been obtained were analyzed by using Analysis of Variance (ANAVA) and continued with DMRT test. The Correlation test was done to find out the relationship between the rate of decomposition <b>of</b> crop <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> and the soil mesofauna and macrofauna diversities. It can be concluded that the applying <b>of</b> crop <b>organic</b> <b>matters</b> influenced the soil mesofauna and macrofauna diversities.

Most early stage larvae and some late stage ones are collector-gatherers, picking up fragments <b>of</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> from the benthos.

Some species are scrapers, feeding on the film of algae and other periphyton that grows on underwater objects in sunlight. Others are shredder-herbivores, chewing fragments off living plant material while others are shredder-detritivores, gnawing at rotting wood or chewing dead leaves that have been pre-processed by bacteria and fungi; most of the nutrients of the latter group come from consumption of the bacteria and fungi. The predatory species either actively hunt their prey, typically other insects, tiny crustaceans and worms, or lie in wait for unwary invertebrates to come too close. A few species feed opportunistically on dead animals or fish, and some Leptoceridae larvae feed on freshwater sponges.|$|E
