25|$|Commercial station TCN-9 Sydney was {{the first}} to {{broadcast}} in Australia, soon followed by the ABC's own ABN-2 Sydney and later ABV-2 in Melbourne. Six stations, three in Melbourne and three in Sydney, were in operation in time to cover the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. The ABC's first television broadcast was inaugurated by Prime Minister Robert Menzies on 5 November, at the Gore Hill studios in Sydney, followed two weeks later by transmission in Melbourne. Outside broadcasting was also initiated on 5 November, from the ABC's first <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>van.</b> The van, now {{in the collection of the}} National Museum of Australia, was instrumental in the production of thousands of outside broadcasts. It was restored in time to be displayed at the Sydney Olympic Games and was used to film the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to the site of the National Museum in 2000.|$|E

50|$|LS3/5AIn {{the early}} 1970s, the BBC was {{in need of}} a small monitor speaker for use in {{restricted}} areas <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>vans</b> during location recording. To that end, they commissioned their Research Department to develop such a compact speaker, and an experimental loudspeaker developed during preliminary work on acoustic scaling provided the basis for the LS3/5A. The outcome was then licensed to commercial speaker companies for production. Aside from Rogers, other manufacturers licensed by the BBC to produce the LS3/5a included Chartwell, Audiomaster, Spendor, and Harbeth. The LS3/5A was Rogers most successful loudspeaker, and to date 50,000 pairs have been built worldwide.|$|R

5000|$|In 1955, {{the company}} diversified into music {{production}} with Pye Records. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) started public transmissions {{in the same}} year so Pye had to produce new television designs that could receive ITV and the availability of a second channel introduced the need for tuners. Pye's VT4 tunable television was launched in March 1954 and was followed by the V14. The V14 proved to be technically unreliable and so tarnished the Pye name that many dealers transferred their allegiance to other manufacturers. This failure so damaged corporate confidence that Pye avoided being first to market thereafter, although they developed the first British transistor in 1956. Pye TVT Ltd was formed to produce broadcast television equipment, including cameras, which were very popular with British broadcasters including the BBC as well as international sales. The early cameras were called [...] "the Photicon" [...] and the later ones by their Mk number: 2, 3, etc. The Mk7/8 solid state monochrome cameras were the last ones produced. The Pye Mk6 Image Orthicon camera was the last version supplied to BBC <b>Outside</b> <b>Broadcasts</b> in 1963 for a new fleet of eight <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>vans.</b> The ITV companies purchased the popular Pye Mk3s, {{and to a lesser extent}} the Mk4s and Mk7s. Unfortunately, Pye (TVT) never made it into producing a colour broadcast television camera, but there was an abortive colour telecine camera; few if any were sold. The reason for this was probably the financial difficulties the company was in.|$|R
40|$|Production {{networks}} {{require the}} transport of high-quality multimedia traffic between <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>vans</b> and the main studio. This is typically done through dedicated terrestrial or satellite links, with bandwidth purchased from third party network providers, which is expensive and lacks flexibility. Given the emergence of IP networks and the Internet as the multi-service network of choice, it is plausible to consider their use for transporting production network traffic with high bandwidth and low delay and packet loss requirements. Emerging technologies for quality of service such as Differentiated Services and MPLS {{can be used for}} premium quality traffic. In this paper we try to use the emerging IP technologies to support services like production network traffic. We present a Traffic Engineering and Control System that starts from agreed services with customers and provisions the network according to the expected traffic demand so as to meet the requirements of contracted services while optimising the use of network resources. We devise a non-linear programming formulation of the problem and show through extensive simulations that we can achieve the objectives and meet the requirements of demanding production network traffic. Our solution is generic enough and not only tuned to production networks, so it can be used in other contexts for supporting services with stringent quality of service requirements...|$|R
2500|$|TVNZ's primary {{television}} channel TV One is provided as four distinct terrestrial feeds, localising to viewers within {{and around the}} Auckland, Waikato, Wellington and Christchurch regions. [...] Localised satellite feeds were made available in 2010 to channel-locked SD receivers. Localised content currently only consists of targeted regional advertising spots {{toward the end of}} a commercial break. [...] Localised regional news programming was discontinued in the late 1980s and all localised versions for TV2 were discontinued in the early 2000s in favour of only national advertising. TVNZ's predecessor, NZBC started as distinct stations in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. Nationwide networked services were first introduced in July 1969 to broadcast the Apollo 11 landing footage, flown in specially from Australia, from Wellington simultaneously across all stations. However, the network was still incomplete, and in some places, <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>vans</b> were strategically placed to temporarily complete missing links. The network was fully completed in November that year. [...] TVNZ also used to run telethons up until 1990 at locations around the country, viewers would be shown full coverage of the Telethon nearest their location. Originally when TVNZ began broadcasting TV One and TV2 on Sky Digital at the end of 2001 viewers would see only nationwide or Auckland advertisements when watching these channels through the Sky Digital service. In 2004 this was expanded to show one of three feeds for regional advertising spots targeting Auckland, Wellington or Christchurch with viewers outside of these regions seeing advertisements from the closest region. This was again dropped in March 2007 with a return to only nationwide advertising on TVNZ channels on Sky Digital before being reintroduced through the Freeview SD service. Regional advertising spots are only shown on TV One on both Digital and Analogue platforms however those that receive the HD version of TV One through their HD receiver will only see Auckland advertisements. Standard DVB satellite receivers will scan in all versions to be selected by the viewer.|$|R

There were no injuries. The audience then had to enter the hall past noisy demonstrators who were penned behind barricades.|$|E
50|$|VoC is also rapidly gaining use in {{electronic}} news-gathering and remote broadcasting, {{where it is}} used in place of remote pickup units (RPUs), which must be temporarily fixed in a certain position, with an antenna often on a telescoping pole or satellite dish atop an <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>van.</b> RPUs are also limiting in terms of setup time and space, safety regarding overhead powerlines, and the requirement for a line of sight back to the TV station or a remote receiving antenna.|$|E
50|$|On July 22, 2016, exactly 30 {{years after}} its first sign-on, DZMM aired its anniversary special called Kuwento ng Tatlong Dekada (The Story of Three Decades), in {{different}} portions. An interview portion with former and present Radyo Patrol reporters #12 Rod Izon, #2 Claude Vitug, #26 Dindo Amparo and #38 Noel Alamar recalling the most notable stories of the past 30 years and their experiences was aired with Noli de Castro on Kabayan, while the most notable stories in the past 30 years were aired in between shows (mostly before) and some throwback remembrances are aired in some shows like Dr. Love Radio Show, Tandem: Lima at Oro, Dos Por Dos, Failon Ngayon, Pasada Sais Trenta, Todo-Todo Walang Preno, Aksyon Ngayon, Sakto, OMJ, Magandang Morning with Julius and Zen, Teka Muna, Usapang De Campanilla, Suhestiyon, Reaksyon at Opinyon, Ito ang Radyo Patrol, Radyo Patrol Balita Linggo and Omaga Diaz Report.

50|$|Some of the {{surviving}} live transmissions of the Nazi German television station Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow, dating {{as far back as}} the 1930s, were recorded by pointing a 35mm camera to a receiver's screen, although most surviving Nazi live television programs such as the 1936 Summer Olympics (not to confuse with the cinematic footage made during the same event by Leni Riefenstahl for her film Olympia), a number of Nuremberg Rallies, or official state visits (such as Benito Mussolini's) were shot directly on 35mm instead and transmitted over the air as a television signal, with only a two minutes' delay from the original event, by means of the so-called Zwischenfilmverfahren (see intermediate film system) from an early <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>van</b> on the site.|$|E

Dehydrators & TXs switched off. The collapse left sections of twisted mast strewn over the transmitter site, and across the junction of Common Lane and Jagger Lane, and the surrounding fields. Although a falling stay cable cut through a local church and across the transmitter site buildings, no one was injured. It completely disabled the BBC2 UHF transmitter and the ITV VHF transmitter, leaving several million people without service. BBC1 VHF television transmissions continued from Holme Moss. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) owned a collapsible emergency mast, 61 m tall, which was moved to Emley from the Lichfield transmitting station so that some service could be restored. ITV signals were restored to 2.5 million viewers within four days. The BBC provided a mobile mast on an <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> <b>van</b> to restore a restricted BBC2 colour service within two days. The ITA bought a larger temporary mast from a Swedish company. A crew of Polish riggers were hired, and a 204 m mast was erected in under 28 days {{at a cost of}} ¬£100,000. This mast could hold only one set of antennas, so many viewers in outlying areas still could not receive colour programmes. The taller mast was brought into service on 16 April. Some weeks later, the BBC erected a 91 m mast, improving coverage.|$|E
