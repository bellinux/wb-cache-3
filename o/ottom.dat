40|$|The {{volume is}} a {{collection}} of essays on the history of Sufism in Egypt, and more generally in the Arab world, during three centuries of Ottoman rule. In line with recent trends within historiography on the Ottoman period, all the authors share the aim of challenging a paradigm that formerly shaped research on Sufism, i. e. the decline paradigm, which assumed a progressive loss and corruption of true mystical quest due to the institutionalisation and popularisation of ṭarîqa Sufism under <b>Ottom</b> [...] ...|$|E

The results indicated that performance was generally equivalent with the 2 D and the 3 D display and was best with the auditory-verbal re uest mode. It was scanning required. The spatial vector mode offered performance that was faster than print, but considerably less accurate.

50|$|In 1910 {{due to the}} new {{centralization}} {{policies of}} the Young Turk Ottoman government towards Albanians Albanian nationalists Isa Boletini and Idriz Seferi started an uprising against the Ottomans in the Kosovo vilayet. After subduing the Ottoman garrisons in towns such as Prishtina and Ferizaj, the Ottoman government declared martial law and sent a military expedition of 16,000 men led by Shefqet Turgut Pasha Simultaneously forces under Idriz Seferi captured the Kaçanik pass. They successfully defended the pass from the Ottoman expeditionary force thus, forcing them to send a force of 40,000 men. After two weeks the pass was lost to the Ottomans After fierce fighting, the rebels retreated to Drenica and the <b>Ottoms</b> seized control of Prizren, Gjakova and Peja Afterwards Ottoman forces incurred into Northern Albania and Macedonia. Ottoman forces were stopped for more than 20 days in the Agri Pass, from the Albanian forces of Shalë, Shoshë, Nikaj and Mërtur areas, led by Prel Tuli, Mehmet Shpendi, and Marash Delia. Unable to repress their resistance, this column took another way to Scutari, passing from the Pukë region. On July 24, 1910, Ottoman forces entered the city of Scutari. During this period martial courts were put in action and summary executions took place. A large number of firearms were collected and many villages and properties were burned by the Ottoman army.|$|R

40|$|Seafloor {{drill rigs}} are {{remotely}} operated systems {{that provide a}} cost-effective means to recover sedimentary records of the upper sub-seafloor deposits. Recent increases in their payload included downhole logging tools or autoclave coring systems. Here we report on another milestone in using seafloor rigs: the development and installation of shallow borehole observatories. Three different systems {{have been developed for}} the MARUM-MeBo (Me eresboden- Bo hrgerät) seafloor drill, which is operated by MARUM, University of Bremen, Germany. A simple design, the MeBoPLUG, separates the inner borehole from the overlying ocean by using o-ring seals at the conical threads of the drill pipe. The systems are self-contained and include data loggers, batteries, thermistors and a differential pressure sensor. A second design, the so-called MeBoCORK (C irculation O bviation R etrofit K it), is more sophisticated and also hosts an acoustic modem for data transfer and, if desired, fluid sampling capability using osmotic pumps. In these MeBoCORKs, two systems have to be distinguished: the CORK-A (A stands for a utonomous) can be installed by the MeBo alone and monitors pressure and temperature inside and above the borehole (the latter for reference); the CORK-B (B stands for b <b>ottom)</b> has a higher payload and can additionally be equipped with geochemical, biological or other physical components. Owing to its larger size, it is installed by a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) and utilises a hot-stab connection in the upper portion of the drill string. Either design relies on a hot-stab connection from beneath in which coiled tubing with a conical drop weight is lowered to couple to the formation. These tubes are fluid-saturated and either serve to transmit pore pressure signals or collect porewater in the osmo-sampler. The third design, the MeBoPUPPI (P op- U p P ore P ressure I nstrument), is similar to the MeBoCORK-A and monitors pore pressure and temperature in a self-contained manner. Instead of transferring data on command using an acoustic modem, the MeBoPUPPI contains a pop-up telemetry with iridium link. After a predefined period, the data unit with satellite link is released, ascends to the sea surface, and remains there for up to 2 weeks while sending the long-term data sets to shore. In summer 2012, two MeBoPLUGs, one MeBoCORK-A and one MeBoCORK-B were installed with MeBo on RV Sonne, Germany, in the Nankai Trough area, Japan. We have successfully downloaded data from the CORKs, attesting that coupling to the formation worked, and pressure records were elevated relative to the seafloor reference. In the near future, we will further deploy the first two MeBoPUPPIs. Recovery of all monitoring systems by a ROV is planned for 2016...|$|E
40|$|The Black Sea North-western shelf (NWS) is {{a shallow}} {{eutrophic}} {{area in which}} seasonal tratification of the water column isolates bottom waters from the atmosphere and prevents entilation {{to compensate for the}} large consumption of oxygen, due to respiration in the bottom aters and in the sediments. A 3 D coupled physical biogeochemical model is used to investigate he dynamics of bottom hypoxia in the Black Sea NWS at different temporal scales from seasonal o interannual (1981 - 2009) and to differentiate the driving factors (climatic versus eutrophication) f hypoxic conditions in bottom waters. Model skills are evaluated by comparison with 14500 in- itu oxygen measurements available in the NOAA World Ocean Database and the Black Sea ommission data. The choice of skill metrics and data subselections orientate the validation rocedure towards specific aspects of the oxygen dynamics, and prove the model’s ability to esolve the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of oxygen concentration as well as the patial location of the oxygen depleted waters and the specific threshold of hypoxia. During the eriod 1981 - 2009, each year exhibits seasonal bottom hypoxia at the end of summer. This henomenon essentially covers {{the northern part of the}} NWS, receiving large inputs of nutrients rom the Danube, Dniestr and Dniepr rivers, and extends, during the years of severe hypoxia, owards the Romanian Bay of Constanta. In order to explain the interannual variability of bottom ypoxia and to disentangle its drivers, a statistical model (multiple linear regression) is proposed sing the long time series of model results as input variables. This statis- tical model gives a eneral relationships that links the intensity of hypoxia to eutrophication and climate related variables. The use of four predictors allows to reproduce 78 % of hypoxia interannual variability: he annual nitrate discharge (N), the sea surface temperature in the month preceding tratification (T), the amount of semi-labile organic matter in the sediments (C) and the duration f the stratification (D). Eutrophication (N,C) and climate (T,D) predictors explain a similar mount of variability (∼ 35 %) when considered separately. A typical timescale of 9. 3 years is found to describe the inertia of sediments in the recovering process after eutrophication. From his analysis, we find that under standard conditions (i. e. average atmospheric conditions, ediments in equi- librium with river discharges), the intensity of hypoxia can be linked to the evel of nitrate discharge through a non-linear equation (power law). Bottom hypoxia does not ffect the whole Black Sea NWS but rather exhibits an important spatial variability. This heterogeneous distribution, in addition to the seasonal fluctuations, complicates the monitoring f <b>ottom</b> hypoxia leading to contradictory conclusions when the interpretation is done from different ets of data. We find that it was the case after 1995 when the recovery process was verestimated due to the use of observations concentrated in areas and months not typically ffected by hypoxia. This stresses out the urging need of a dedicated monitoring effort in the WS f the Black Sea focused on the areas and the period of the year concerned by recurrent hypoxic events.
