25|$|RESR, the {{equivalent}} series resistance which summarizes all <b>ohmic</b> losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as “ESR”.|$|E
25|$|A key {{advantage}} of every film capacitor's internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes {{on both ends}} of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths very short. The design behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal <b>ohmic</b> losses (ESR) and ESL. The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in low <b>ohmic</b> losses and a low parasitic inductance, which makes them suitable for applications with high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.|$|E
25|$|The name {{varistor}} is a portmanteau {{of varying}} resistor. The term is only used for non-ohmic varying resistors. Variable resistors, {{such as the}} potentiometer and the rheostat, have <b>ohmic</b> characteristics.|$|E
25|$|A key {{advantage}} of modern film capacitor internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes {{on both ends}} of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths to the entire electrode very short. The setup behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal <b>ohmic</b> losses (ESR) and the parasitic inductance (ESL). The inherent geometry of film capacitor structure results in very low <b>ohmic</b> losses and a very low parasitic inductance, which makes them especially suitable for applications with very high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors {{with higher}} ripple current nbsp&loads, such as {{electrolytic}} capacitors, are specified with {{equivalent series resistance}} ESR. ESR can be shown as an <b>ohmic</b> part in the above vector diagram. ESR values are specified in datasheets per individual type.|$|E
25|$|A second {{limitation}} of the current-carrying capacity {{is caused by the}} <b>ohmic</b> bulk resistance of the electrodes themselves. For metallized film capacitors, which have layer thicknesses from 0.02 to 0.05μm the current-carrying capacity is limited by these thin layers.|$|E
25|$|Electrolytic {{capacitors}} {{with an open}} vent are in {{the process}} of drying out, regardless of whether they have good or bad electrolyte. They always show low capacitance values and very high <b>ohmic</b> ESR values. Dry e-caps are therefore electrically useless.|$|E
25|$|At {{frequencies}} {{greater than}} 200GHz, waveguide dimensions become impractically small, and the <b>ohmic</b> {{losses in the}} waveguide walls become large. Instead, fiber optics, which are a form of dielectric waveguides, can be used. For such frequencies, the concepts of voltages and currents are no longer used.|$|E
25|$|This {{provides}} an indirect avenue for obtaining numbers such as <b>ohmic</b> conductivity and thermal conductivity by extracting results from equilibrium statistical mechanics. Since equilibrium statistical mechanics is mathematically well defined and (in some cases) more amenable for calculations, the fluctuation-dissipation connection {{can be a}} convenient shortcut for calculations in near-equilibrium statistical mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Resistors (and other {{elements}} with resistance) oppose {{the flow of}} electric current; therefore, electrical energy is required to push current through the resistance. This electrical energy is dissipated, heating the resistor in the process. This is called Joule heating (after James Prescott Joule), also called <b>ohmic</b> heating or resistive heating.|$|E
25|$|For a {{wide variety}} of {{materials}} and conditions, V and I are directly proportional to each other, and therefore R and G are constant (although they can depend on other factors like temperature or strain). This proportionality is called Ohm's law, and materials that satisfy it are called <b>ohmic</b> materials.|$|E
25|$|The highest {{density of}} CNTs was {{achieved}} in 2013, grown on a conductive titanium-coated copper surface that was coated with co-catalysts cobalt and molybdenum at lower than typical temperatures of 450nbsp&°C. The tubes averaged {{a height of}} 380nbsp&nm and a mass density of 1.6 g cm−3. The material showed <b>ohmic</b> conductivity (lowest resistance ∼22 kΩ).|$|E
25|$|The <b>ohmic</b> {{losses of}} ceramic {{capacitors}} are frequency, temperature and voltage dependent. Additionally, class 2 capacitor measurements change because of aging. Different ceramic materials have differing losses over the temperature range and the operating frequency. The changes in class 1 capacitors {{are in the}} single-digit range while class 2 capacitors have much higher changes.|$|E
25|$|For either enhancement- or depletion-mode devices, at drain-to-source {{voltages}} {{much less}} than gate-to-source voltages, changing the gate voltage will alter the channel resistance, and drain current will be proportional to drain voltage (referenced to source voltage). In this mode the FET operates like a variable resistor and the FET {{is said to be}} operating in a linear mode or <b>ohmic</b> mode.|$|E
25|$|This method {{can be used}} {{to compute}} the {{radiation}} resistance for any antenna whose far field radiation pattern has been found in terms of a specific antenna current. If <b>ohmic</b> losses in the conductors are neglected, the radiation resistance (considered relative to the feedpoint) is identical to the resistive (real) component of the feedpoint impedance. Unfortunately this exercise tells us nothing about the reactive (imaginary) component of feedpoint impedance, whose calculation is considered below.|$|E
25|$|High {{temperatures}} {{give the}} nuclei {{enough energy to}} overcome their electrostatic repulsion (see Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution). For deuterium and tritium, the optimal reaction rates occur at temperatures {{on the order of}} 100,000,000 K. The plasma is heated to a high temperature by <b>ohmic</b> heating (running a current through the plasma). Additional heating is applied using neutral beam injection (which cross magnetic field lines without a net deflection and will not cause a large electromagnetic disruption) and radio frequency (RF) or microwave heating.|$|E
25|$|FETs can be majority-charge-carrier devices, {{in which}} the current is carried {{predominantly}} by majority carriers, or minority-charge-carrier devices, {{in which the}} current is mainly due to a flow of minority carriers. The device consists of an active channel through which charge carriers, electrons or holes, flow from the source to the drain. Source and drain terminal conductors {{are connected to the}} semiconductor through <b>ohmic</b> contacts. The conductivity of the channel {{is a function of the}} potential applied across the gate and source terminals.|$|E
25|$|The {{impedance}} {{seen at the}} feedpoint of a dipole {{of various}} lengths has been plotted above, {{in terms of the}} real (resistive) component Rdipole and the imaginary (reactive) component jXdipole of that impedance. For the case of an antenna with perfect conductors (no <b>ohmic</b> loss), Rdipole is identical to the radiation resistance, which can more easily be computed from the total power in the far-field radiation pattern for a given applied current as we showed for the short dipole. The calculation of Xdipole is more difficult.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of an n-type switch, the body is {{connected}} to the most negative supply (usually GND) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage, the MOSFET conducts. The higher the voltage, the more the MOSFET can conduct. An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than Vgate–Vtn. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or <b>ohmic)</b> mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} multi-layer {{ceramic capacitor}} has many opposing electrode layers stacked inside connected with two outer terminations. The X2Y ceramic chip capacitor however is a 4 terminal chip device. It is constructed like a standard two-terminal MLCC {{out of the}} stacked ceramic layers with an additional third set of shield electrodes incorporated in the chip. These shield electrodes surround each existing electrode within the stack of the capacitor plates and are low <b>ohmic</b> contacted with two additional side terminations across to the capacitor terminations. The X2Y construction results in a three-node capacitive circuit that provides simultaneous line-to-line and line-to-ground filtering.|$|E
25|$|In 1960 Martin Pope {{and some}} of his {{co-workers}} at New York University developed <b>ohmic</b> dark-injecting electrode contacts to organic crystals. They further described the necessary energetic requirements (work functions) for hole and electron injecting electrode contacts. These contacts are the basis of charge injection in all modern OLED devices. Pope's group also first observed direct current (DC) electroluminescence under vacuum on a single pure crystal of anthracene and on anthracene crystals doped with tetracene in 1963 using a small area silver electrode at 400 volts. The proposed mechanism was field-accelerated electron excitation of molecular fluorescence.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the moving}} parts of the speaker must be of low mass (to {{accurately}} reproduce high-frequency sounds without being damped too much by inertia), voice coils are usually made as light weight as possible, making them delicate. Passing too much power through the coil can cause it to overheat (see <b>ohmic</b> heating). Voice coils wound with flattened wire, called ribbon-wire, provide a higher packing density in the magnetic gap than coils with round wire. Some coils are made with surface-sealed bobbin and collar materials so they may be immersed in a ferrofluid which assists in cooling the coil, by conducting heat away from the coil and into the magnet structure. Excessive input power at low frequencies can cause the coil to move beyond its normal limits, causing knocking and distortion.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{conductive}} channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, carriers are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel enhancement-mode device, a depletion region {{exists in the}} p-type body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free {{to move out of}} the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to silicon. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the pinch-off point, increasing the resistance of the depletion region in proportion to the drain-to-source voltage applied. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed, independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage, quite unlike its <b>ohmic</b> behavior in the linear mode of operation. Thus, in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a constant-current source rather than as a resistor, and can effectively be used as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.|$|E
25|$|A {{direct current}} flows uniformly {{throughout}} the cross-section of a uniform wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced {{away from the}} wire's center, toward its outer surface. This is because the acceleration of an electric charge in an alternating current produces waves of electromagnetic radiation that cancel the propagation of electricity {{toward the center of}} materials with high conductivity. This phenomenon is called skin effect. At very high frequencies the current no longer flows in the wire, but effectively flows {{on the surface of the}} wire, within a thickness of a few skin depths. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50Hz – 60Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors. For example, the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57mm at 60Hz, so high current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. Since the current tends to flow in the periphery of conductors, the effective cross-section of the conductor is reduced. This increases the effective AC resistance of the conductor, since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. The AC resistance often is many times higher than the DC resistance, causing a much higher energy loss due to <b>ohmic</b> heating (also called I2R loss).|$|E
500|$|One of {{the main}} {{advantages}} of waveguide filters over TEM mode technologies {{is the quality of}} their resonators. [...] Resonator quality is characterised by a parameter called Q factor, or just Q. [...] The Q of waveguide resonators is in the thousands, orders of magnitude higher than TEM mode resonators. [...] The resistance of conductors, especially in wound inductors, limits the Q of TEM resonators. [...] This improved Q leads to better performing filters in waveguides, with greater stop band rejection. [...] The limitation to Q in waveguides comes mostly from the <b>ohmic</b> losses in the walls described earlier, but silver plating the internal walls can more than double Q.|$|E
500|$|Waveguides are a {{low-loss}} medium. [...] Losses in waveguides mostly {{come from}} <b>ohmic</b> dissipation caused by currents induced in the waveguide walls. [...] Rectangular waveguide has lower loss than circular waveguide {{and is usually}} the preferred format, but the TE01 circular mode is very low loss and has applications in long distance communications. [...] Losses can be reduced by polishing the internal surfaces of the waveguide walls. [...] In some applications which require rigorous filtering, the walls are plated with {{a thin layer of}} gold or silver to improve surface conductivity. [...] An example of such requirements is satellite applications which require low loss, high selectivity, and linear group delay from their filters.|$|E
500|$|The {{wiring to}} the {{subscriber}} in telephone networks is generally done in twisted pair cable. [...] Its impedance at audio frequencies, and {{especially at the}} more restricted telephone band frequencies, is far from constant. [...] It is possible to manufacture this kind of cable to have a 600 Ω characteristic impedance but it will only be this value at one specific frequency. [...] This might be quoted as a nominal 600 Ω impedance at 800Hz or 1kHz. [...] Below this frequency the characteristic impedance rapidly rises and {{becomes more and more}} dominated by the <b>ohmic</b> resistance of the cable as the frequency falls. [...] At the bottom of the audio band the impedance can be several tens of kilohms. [...] On the other hand, at high frequency in the MHz region, the characteristic impedance flattens out to something almost constant. [...] The reason for this response is explained at primary line constants.|$|E
2500|$|... over a {{wide range}} of {{voltages}} and currents. [...] Therefore the resistance and conductance of objects or electronic components made of these materials is constant. [...] This relationship is called Ohm's law, and materials which obey it are called <b>ohmic</b> materials. [...] Examples of <b>ohmic</b> components are wires and resistors. [...] The current-voltage (IV) graph of an <b>ohmic</b> device consists of a straight line through the origin with positive slope.|$|E
2500|$|The largest {{share of}} these losses in larger {{capacitors}} {{is usually the}} frequency dependent <b>ohmic</b> dielectric losses. Regarding the IEC 60384-1 standard, the <b>ohmic</b> losses of capacitors are measured at the same frequency used to measure capacitance. These are: ...|$|E

2500|$|The <b>ohmic</b> {{resistance}} [...] {{appears in}} series with the electrode impedance of the reaction and the Nyquist diagram is translated to the right.|$|E
2500|$|Resistors are circuit {{elements}} that impede {{the passage of}} electric charge in agreement with Ohm's law, and are designed to have a specific resistance value R. [...] In a schematic diagram the resistor is shown as a zig-zag symbol. [...] An element (resistor or conductor) that behaves according to Ohm's law over some operating range {{is referred to as}} an <b>ohmic</b> device (or an <b>ohmic</b> resistor) because Ohm's law and a single value for the resistance suffice to describe the behavior of the device over that range.|$|E
2500|$|The largest {{share of}} these losses in larger {{capacitors}} {{is usually the}} frequency dependent <b>ohmic</b> dielectric losses. For smaller components, especially for wet electrolytic capacitors, conductivity of liquid electrolytes may exceed dielectric losses. To measure these losses, the measurement frequency must be set. Since commercially available components offer capacitance values cover 15 orders of magnitude, ranging from pF (10−12nbsp&F) to some 1000nbsp&F in supercapacitors, {{it is not possible}} to capture the entire range with only one frequency. IEC 60384-1 states that <b>ohmic</b> losses should be measured at the same frequency used to measure capacitance. These are: ...|$|E
2500|$|Resistance and {{conductance}} {{can still}} be defined for non-ohmic elements. [...] However, unlike <b>ohmic</b> resistance, non-linear resistance is not constant but varies with the voltage or current through the device; i.e., its operating point.
