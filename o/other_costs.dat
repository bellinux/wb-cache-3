5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied. When nest density was greater, the females {{tended to be}} larger, which is more accurately explained by density-dependent mate preference and mating competition, as opposed to predation and resource competition. Moreover, as the two nest density regimes were compared, with one high and one low, {{there was no significant}} difference in brood survival between the two; however, the convict cichlids did prefer to breed farther away from each other, not in close proximity. This indicates that there are some <b>other</b> <b>costs</b> with breeding in an environment with high population density, an example being energy loss because of the resulting increased aggression when guarding territory.|$|E

Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack. As customers {{are not allowed to}} purchase battery packs, they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery swapping stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of sustainable electricity, and <b>other</b> <b>costs.</b> Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii.

5|$|A similar issue again {{arose in}} 2009 when Burger King {{diverted}} {{several million dollars}} of advertising rebates paid to its American franchises by Coca Cola Corporation and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group to its own coffers. The company intended to utilize these funds to increase its advertising presence in the United States {{at a time when}} corporate advertising costs were falling, which would allow an increased media presence of approximately 25% from the previous year (2008). The NFA contended that Burger King Corporation improperly redirected 40% of restaurant operating funds (ROF) paid by the two beverage suppliers to franchises since 1990 into the corporate advertising budget. These funds were often used by the franchises to pay for beverage support systems such as filtration units and local marketing, and diversion of the funds would cost franchises at least $65 million (USD) between 2010-2012. These funds often helped the franchises' bottom lines, as they were often used to offset <b>other</b> <b>costs</b> imposed on the franchises by Burger King, such as the $1 (USD) Double Cheeseburger.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of John's reign {{there was a sudden}} change in prices, as bad harvests and high demand for food {{resulted}} in much higher prices for grain and animals. This inflationary pressure was to continue {{for the rest of the}} 13th century and had long-term economic consequences for England. The resulting social pressures were complicated by bursts of deflation that resulted from John's military campaigns. It was usual at the time for the king to collect taxes in silver, which was then re-minted into new coins; these coins would then be put in barrels and sent to royal castles around the country, to be used to hire mercenaries or to meet <b>other</b> <b>costs.</b> At those times when John was preparing for campaigns in Normandy, for example, huge quantities of silver had to be withdrawn from the economy and stored for months, which unintentionally resulted in periods during which silver coins were simply hard to come by, commercial credit difficult to acquire and deflationary pressure placed on the economy. The result was political unrest across the country. John attempted to address some of the problems with the English currency in 1204 and 1205 by carrying out a radical overhaul of the coinage, improving its quality and consistency.|$|E

5|$|The first F-111C {{was officially}} {{delivered}} in 1968, finally giving Australia an aircraft that could fly to Jakarta, drop bombs, and return without refueling. (The RAAF only acquired air-to-air refueling for the F/A-18, possibly to avoid causing difficulties with other Asian countries {{by increasing the}} F-111C's already great range.) Training began in 1967, with RAAF personnel seeing terrain-following radar and other sophisticated equipment for the first time. However, development delays and structural problems delayed acceptance of aircraft by the RAAF until 1973. These issues were mainly {{to do with the}} wing attach points, and the redesign of the F-111 engine intakes. Completion of contractual requirements to the satisfaction of Australia also took time, damaging the morale of the hundreds of trained RAAF personnel who had little to do. The program costs, during 1963–1967, grew at an alarming rate; estimates by the USAF {{at the start of the}} program was placed at US$124.5 million, but by April 1967 had risen to $237.75 million. While the initial price of US$5.21 million per aircraft was capped at US$5.95 million, R, labor, and <b>other</b> <b>costs</b> were not. The rising price, three unexplained losses of USAF F-111As in Vietnam during their first month of deployment, and the British and U.S. Navy's orders' cancellations caused further controversy in Australia during 1968. By 1973, however, when the F-111A had accumulated 250,000 flight hours, it had the best safety record among contemporary aircraft, which presaged the F-111C's own excellent record.|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} an active control of {{vibration}} system depends upon both the cost function used and {{the positions of the}} controlling actuators. The cost function used also affects the best actuator positions since their performance is judged on the attenuation of this parameter. However, the physical success will be dependent on how well the cost function represents the actual physical vibration. Sometimes the most meaningful cost function can be calculated in a theoretical model but is difficult to measure in practice, and a compromise to a more practical one is often made. In this paper four cost functions are considered with the aim of reducing the vibration transmitted from the base {{to the end of a}} lightweight cantilever two-dimensional structure, and their performances compared with a view to evaluating the true success in using <b>other</b> <b>cost</b> function parameters in reducing the vibrational energy. Of the four cost functions studied, two are energy-based: one representing the total vibrational energy and one using only the flexural energy level. The <b>other</b> two <b>cost</b> functions are based on velocity measurements: the sum of the squares of the translational velocity components, and one additionally using rotational velocity measurements. An initial study confirms that the total vibrational energy is the cost function which most comprehensively represents the beam vibration and is used as the reference in a comparison of the <b>other</b> <b>cost</b> functions. Then, a ranking of the best actuator positions on the structure is determined to achieve the best reductions in each cost function. For each of these sets of actuator positions the consequential attenuation in the total vibrational energy is evaluated whilst minimizing the <b>other</b> <b>cost</b> functions. Thus, the effectiveness of these cost functions in reducing the total vibrational energy is evaluated...|$|R
