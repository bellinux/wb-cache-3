He decided to move to The Netherlands and accepted a post as prosector in the small Catholic St. Joannes de Deo hospital (now MCH Westeinde) in The Hague [...] and, in order to improve his financial situation also took a job in a small factory, producing <b>old</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (tuberculinum prestinum).He also published a number of papers, five of them being published in Dutch by the Royal Academy of Sciences. Yet working conditions proved to be not much better than in post-war Vienna. So Landsteiner accepted the invitation that reached him from New York, initiated by Simon Flexner, who was familiar with Landsteiner's work, to work for the Rockefeller Institute. He arrived there with his family in the spring of 1923. Throughout the 1920s Landsteiner worked on the problems of immunity and allergy. In 1927 he discovered new blood groups: M, N and P, refining the work he had begun 20 years before. Soon after Landsteiner and his collaborator, Philip Levine, published the work and in 1927, the types began to be used in paternity suits.|$|E

40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{has been}} reported to modify the presenting features of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), but data regarding the effect of diabetes on the presentation of PTB are highly variable. Objective: To determine whether DM alters the demographic, clinical, and radiological manifestations of tuberculosis and whether the effect of diabetes varies with the age group of PTB patients. Materials and Methods : This prospective observational study was conducted on new smear-positive PTB patients with DM (PTB-DM group) and non-diabetic PTB patients (PTB group). Patients of both groups were again divided into six age groups (15 - 29, 30 - 39, 40 - 49, 50 - 59, 60 - 69, and > 70 rears) to analyze and compare the impact of age on clinicoradiological presentations of PTB. Results: Patients in the PTB-DM group were significantly older (53. 34 ± 14. 06 year) in comparison to their nondiabetic counterparts (PTB group) (44. 35 ± 18. 14 year) (P < 0. 001). The former group also had a lower male:female ratio, although the difference was not statistically significant (1. 16 : 1 vs. 2. 05 : 1, P = 0. 101). Tuberculin positivity was significantly higher in the PTB group, compared with patients in the PTB-DM group (P < 0. 004). The proportion of patients with lower lung field involvement (P = 0. 003) and cavitations (P = 0. 005) was also higher in the former group compared with the latter.

A large number of the animals injected in utero with <b>Old</b> <b>Tuberculin</b> failed to develop skin hypersensitivity to P. P.

The failure of animals which had been injected with <b>Old</b> <b>Tuberculin</b> in fetal life to respond hypersensitively to P. P. D. after adult vaccination with tubercle bacilli is ascribed to their acquisition of a state of immunological tolerance to tuberculoprotein (tuberculin tolerance). Fetal injection with killed BCG conferred a state of tolerance on a few of the animals, and rendered others tuberculin-sensitive. Fetal injection with living BCG sensitized most of the animals to tuberculin, even when fetal exposure was as early as 46 days before birth, and induced tolerance in none. Fetuses of the same litter, injected simultaneously with identical inocula, often responded differently, some becoming tolerant to tuberculin, others developing hypersensitivity, and still others remaining immunologically unaffected, becoming neither sensitive nor tolerant.

By 48 h after injection during the second tuberculin skin test, 6 of the 80 macaques had developed eyelid reactions ranging from mild (grade 1) to severe (grade 4).

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{underlying the}} pyrogenic refractory state which develops rapidly during a continuous intravenous infusion of bacterial endotoxin have been further explored. The findings demonstrate that: (a) rabbits rendered refractory to a continuous intravenous infusion of E. coli endotoxin at a standard rate (18 x 10 – 4 µg/min) become highly refractory {{to a single}} intravenous test bolus of endotoxin, but remain fully responsive to preformed endogenous pyrogen and to substances known to release endogenous pyrogen, i. e. influenza virus, <b>old</b> <b>tuberculin</b> in specifically sensitized rabbits, and staphylococcal enterotoxin; (b) administration of fresh whole blood from normal donors containing an average of 1. 6 – 108 granulocytes fails to restore febrile responsiveness to the continuing E. coli endotoxin infusion; (c) refractory phase plasma and liver homogenates exhibit no enhanced capacity to inactivate E. coli endotoxin pyrogenicity; (d) splenectomized animals readily develop the pyrogenic refractory state during E. coli endotoxin infusions and exhibit diminished, rather than the increased inflammatory responses to intradermal endotoxin seen in sham-operated controls; (e) continuous intravenous infusions of gelatin-stabilized, heat-killed pneumococci produce sustained fevers; and (f) continuous intravenous infusions of <b>old</b> <b>tuberculin</b> into specifically sensitized animals rapidly elicit a pyrogenic refractory state. The present observations, considered together {{with those of other}} investigators, support the hypothesis that pyrogenic unresponsiveness to endotoxin involves two distinct immunologic mechanisms. In terms of this hypothesis, the rapid reduction in febrile responsiveness to endotoxin is mediated by desensitization at the cellular level. With small doses of endotoxin, such as those employed in the present studies, this desensitization is primarily specific; with larger doses, nonspecific mechanisms are superimposed. So long as the subsequent doses of endotoxin are closely spaced or continuously infused, optimal conditions are provided for cellular desensitization and pyrogenic unresponsiveness to a given quantity of endotoxin can be induced rapidly and maintained without the requirement for antibody. However, as the interval between endotoxin challenge is lengthened, cellular desensitization wanes and tolerance becomes increasingly dependent upon those antibodies directed against the common toxophore groupings responsible for endotoxin pyrogenicity which assist the reticuloendothelial system in the clearance and destruction of this molecule...|$|E

When normal splenic cells were treated with an extract of hypersensitive cells, their respiration was enhanced in the presence of OT.

Handicaps of <b>old</b> <b>tuberculin</b> and PPD (heterogeneous mixtures titrated biologically and unstable in solution) can be overcome by A 60 preparations (a single antigen spectrophoretically measurable and stable) ...|$|E
40|$|Forty-one {{children}} {{suspected of}} having tuberculosis were simultaneously given an intermediate strength Mantoux test, an <b>old</b> <b>tuberculin</b> tine test (OT), and a purified protein derivative (PPD) tine test. Each test was read at 48 hours, and the largest diameter of induration was recorded. Twenty-nine patients had a positive reaction to the Mantoux test, 20 patients had a positive reaction to the OT tine test, and 16 patients had a positive reaction to the PPD-tine test. There were seven instances of a doubtful reaction to the OT tine test and nine to the PPD-tine test. Two children with positive Mantoux tests had negative OT tine tests, and four with positive Mantoux tests had negative PPD-tine test reactions. There {{was a significant difference}} between the number of positive reactors to the Mantoux test and both tine tests. If all tine test reactions of 2 mm or more were considered positive (doubtful plus positive reactors), there was no significant difference between any of the tuber-culin tests. All suggestively positive tine reactors should, therefore, be retested with a Mantoux test to avoid false-negative interpretation of the tines...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} recent investigation, {{the pathogenesis}} of fever is incompletely understood. It has been postulated that many injected pyrogenic agents cause fever indirectly by liberating a product of tissue injury which, in turn, acts directly upon the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center (1). In rabbits, a fever-promoting material has been obtained from both sterile exudates and saline extracts of circulating granulocytes (2). Furthermore, {{the presence of a}} serum pyrogen, indistinguishable in its biologic properties from grannlocyfic pyrogen, has been demonstrated during fevers induced by a number of agents including endotoxins, viruses and bacterial infections (3 [...] 6). These findings have suggested that the release of an endogenous pyrogen from damaged cells, including granulocytes, is an essential step in {{the pathogenesis of}} a variety of experimental fevers. The fever elicited by <b>old</b> <b>tuberculin</b> (O. T.) in animals infected with B. C. G. (7) provides an appropriate system for the study of this hypothesis, for there is considerable evidence indicating that O. T. selectively damages tuberculin-sensitive ceils, ineluding granulocytes (8 - 16). Furthermore, passive transfer of tuberculin hypersensitivit...|$|E
