The scene in the film's end credits showing a resurgence of the yellow power ring of fear, with Sinestro becoming corrupted by its dark power, teased the planned sequel. In September 2011 Warner Bros., dismayed by the film's negative reviews and disappointing box office return, abandoned plans for sequels.|$|E

5|$|As Prapiroon neared Hong Kong, {{thousands}} of people were stranded in airports as hundreds of flights {{in and out of the}} area were cancelled. Twenty cargo containers in the harbour were tipped over and one person was injured by the falling containers. A total of 381 flights were cancelled and 725 were delayed, affecting about 10million people. Compensation costs from the travel delays amounted to $1.9million (2006USD). According to airport authorities, the storm caused the worst disruption in the airport's 20-year history. Winds were recorded up to 103km/h (63mph) in the harbour. The highest gust was recorded <b>on</b> <b>Green</b> Island at 193km/h (119mph). Seven people were injured by objects blown around by the wind.

5|$|The Bears won the toss and deferred. The {{first four}} drives {{of the game}} ended without scores, as the Packers turned the ball over on downs during their first drive and the ensuing series were punts. On the next drive, Tracy Porter intercepted Rodgers, but was penalized for illegal contact, and the play was nullified. Afterwards, Rodgers threw a 25-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Lacy. The Bears' woes continued with the following kickoff, when Marc Mariani and Deonte Thompson collided while attempting to catch the kick and the latter had to kneel in the endzone for the touchback. The next four possessions led to punts; <b>on</b> <b>Green</b> Bay's next drive, Lacy recorded a 15-yard run, but was hit from behind by Chris Prosinski and fumbled, with the ball being recovered by Lamarr Houston. Chicago {{took advantage of the}} takeaway when Jay Cutler threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller. However, on the next kickoff, nickelback Bryce Callahan missed a tackle and allowed Jeff Janis to record a 64-yard return; the Packers eventually converted it into a 22-yard field goal. Assisted by a 37-yard kickoff return by Thompson, the Bears offense scored with Cutler's 20-yard touchdown pass to Marquess Wilson, but the play was overturned after he was downed at the one. Afterwards, Jeremy Langford's one-yard run gave the Bears the 14–10 lead. Mason Crosby kicked a 50-yard field goal to end the half. The third quarter featured no scores, though the Bears' last drive of the quarter (which lasted into the final quarter) ended with Robbie Gould's 21-yard field goal to extend the lead by four points. After two further punts, Rodgers' slant pass for Davante Adams was intercepted by Porter. However, the Bears were unable to capitalize, and punted. With 2:23 left in the game, the Packers drove from their own 20-yard line to the Bears' eight. Rodgers' passes to James Jones, Richard Rodgers and Adams all fell incomplete, and Cutler kneeled once to seal the win.|$|E
