5|$|Author Hiromu Arakawa {{integrated}} several {{social problems}} into the plot, {{such as the}} way Edward and Alphonse live as brothers {{after the death of}} their mother, Trisha. She also looks at how the brothers help {{people all over the country}} to gain an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of family. When describing the character's personality, Arakawa comments that after his father's departure from home and his mother's death, Edward tried to replace the role of the man for the Elric family. As a result, Van Hohenheim's reappearance caused a shocking and terrified reaction in the character. Arakawa has noted that Edward is one of her favorite characters from the series, although she denied having the same personality as him when one of her assistants mentioned it.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask questions {{when they do not}} understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E

Ioannis Ziogas {{points out that the}} usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.|$|E

50|$|Rog (Hornwald) {{is named}} after Big Mount Rog (Veliki Rog, Hornbühel, Hornbühel, or Hornbichl, 1099 m), the highest {{elevation}} in the area. <b>The</b> name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kočevje Rog Plateau (Hornwald) is also derived from this mountain. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Slovene common noun rog is 'prominent/exposed hill', paralleled by one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German common noun Horn 'highest peak'.|$|R
5|$|The {{ratification}} {{of this law}} was not devoid of conflict, despite support from 66% of the population. Roman Catholic authorities in particular were adamantly opposed, criticising what they regarded as the weakening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of marriage. Other associations expressed concern over the possibility of lesbians and gays adopting children. Demonstrations for and against the law drew thousands of people {{from all parts of}} Spain. After its approval, the conservative People's Party challenged the law in the Constitutional Court.|$|E
5|$|Although Fodor {{originally}} {{rejected the}} idea that mental states must have a causal, externally determined aspect, he has in recent years devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> and reference of mental contents. His contributions in this area include the so-called asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism. Fodor strongly opposes reductive accounts of the mind. He argues that mental states are multiply realizable {{and that there is}} a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higher-level theory of psychology or linguistics, for example, cannot be captured by the low-level explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses. He has also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterizes as the ill-grounded Darwinian and neo-Darwinian theory of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|As no {{description}} of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so the question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriac of Ancona {{in the fifteenth century}} AD who referred to it as the “victories of Athens in the time of Pericles”. What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon gate, to the Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their Antiquities of Athens, 1787. Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city of Athens instead of the festival pompe has emerged.|$|E

The latter product is responsible for triggering public alert messages via television, radio stations and NOAA Weather Radio. The watch approximation product outlines specific regions covered by the watch (including the approximate outlined area in statute miles) and its time of expiration (based on the local time zone(s) of the areas under the watch), associated potential threats, a meteorological synopsis of atmospheric conditions favorable for severe thunderstorm development, forecasted aviation conditions, and a pre-determined message informing the public <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> behind the watch and to be vigilant of any warnings or weather statements that may be issued by their local National Weather Service office.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Alphonse's soul was sealed in a flying squirrel instead of armor {{as a result}} of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover their bodies. To match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit of armor to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa tends to make sketches of his human form so that she would not forget how to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey across the country to help people is meant to gain an understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that she does it because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{two patients}} who manifested opposite patterns of performance on test batteries that evaluated production, comprehension, and semantic analysis of action verbs {{on the one}} hand (e. g. smile, wave, run) and locative prepositions on the other (e. g. in, on, over). JP failed all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb tests but passed all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preposition tests, suggesting impaired knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> action verbs but intact knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> locative prepositions. In contrast, RR exhibited the reverse dissociation: he passed many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> verb tests but failed all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preposition tests, suggesting mostly intact knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> action verbs but impaired knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> locative prepositions. This behavioral double dissociation reflects the fact that <b>the</b> two categories <b>of</b> words differ along several conceptual parameters. To a large extent, the patients exhibited a neuroanatomical double dissociation as well, since JP’s lesion is predominantly in the left frontal operculum whereas RR’s is predominantly in the left inferior parietal lobe and the posterior superior temporal region. This constitutes preliminary evidence that <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> action verbs and locative prepositions are represented by partially independent neural networks in the brain...|$|R
