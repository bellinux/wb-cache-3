30|$|A major {{advance in}} {{diagnosing}} ILD through genetics was {{the discovery that}} cytogenetically invisible genome imbalances involving chromosome tips (telomeres) account for many <b>ILD</b> <b>cases</b> (Flint et al. 1995). Subsequently, a test assaying every telomere of an individual by fluorescence ‘in situ’ hybridisation to chromosomes (‘multi-telomere FISH’) was developed and widely adopted in diagnostic laboratories (Knight et al. 1997). Further technological advances led to a new approach, array comparative genome hybridisation (aCGH), that identifies cryptic genome imbalances at the genome-wide level (Knight and Regan 2006).|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the goals and the latest outcomes of the TALISMAN project which aims to carry out image-based diagnostic aid for interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with secondary data integration. Prototypes of the computer tools are implemented. High correct classification rates of lung tissue regions in high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) based on a high-quality dataset built from clinical routine suggests that the computerized analysis of HRCT image with integration of the clinical context {{is ready to be}} used for computer-aided diagnosis of ILDs. As future work, implementation of multimodal retrieval of <b>ILD</b> <b>cases</b> and the clinical evaluation of the software are planned in order to cope with clinical needs...|$|R
40|$|Background: The role of {{surgical}} biopsy for {{interstitial lung disease}} (ILD) is controversial, because of possible postoperative morbidity and mortality. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety {{of surgical}} biopsy for ILD. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the diagnostic performance and the postoperative complications of 161 consecutive surgical lung biopsy procedures carried out in suspected <b>ILD</b> <b>cases</b> that were undefined after multidisciplinary clinico-radiological evaluation. In 151 cases (93. 8 %) the biopsy was performed by videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), in 6. 2 % by limited thoracotomy. Results: A specific histological diagnosis was obtained in 154 (95. 7 %) of the surgically biopsied patients, while 4. 3 % remained histologically unclassified. The predominant histological patterns were granulomatous inflammation (29. 8 %), usual interstitial pneumonia/idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (UIP/IPF) (24. 2 %), organizing pneumonia (18. 6 %) and nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (8. 1 %). The postoperative course was uneventful in 142 cases. In 19 patients (11. 8 %) we observed postoperative complications, predominantly prolonged air leakage (5. 0 % of all cases). Thirty-day postoperative mortality was 3. 1 %, mostly due to acute exacerbation of respiratory insufficiency. Postoperative mortality independently correlated with preoperative need of oxygen therapy (OR, 5. 21; 95 % CI, 1. 19 - 22. 95) and with UIP/IPF histology (OR, 5. 67; 95 % CI, 1. 27 - 25. 25). Conclusions: Lung biopsy was performed mostly by VATS, with limited morbidity, and was effective in yielding a specific histological diagnosis {{in the vast majority}} of undefined <b>ILD</b> <b>cases.</b> Postoperative mortality was low, predominantly due to exacerbation of respiratory failure in patients with UIP/IPF...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Analyzing the {{molecular}} heterogeneity of {{different forms of}} organ fibrosis may reveal common and specific factors and thus identify potential future therapeutic targets. Objectives: We sought to use proteome-wide profiling of human tissue fibrosis to (1) identify common and specific signatures across end-stage interstitial lung disease (<b>ILD)</b> <b>cases,</b> (2) characterize <b>ILD</b> subgroups in an unbiased fashion, and (3) identify common and specific features of lung and skin fibrosis. Methods: We collected samples of ILD tissue (n = 45) and healthy donor control samples (n = 10), as well as fibrotic skin lesions from localized scleroderma and uninvolved skin (n = 6). Samples were profiled by quantitative label-free mass spectrometry, Western blotting, or confocal imaging. Measurements and Main Results: We determined the abundance of more than 7, 900 proteins and stratified these proteins according to their detergent solubility profiles. Common protein regulations across all <b>ILD</b> <b>cases,</b> as well as distinct ILD subsets, were observed. Proteomic comparison of lung and skin fibrosis identified a common upregulation of marginal zone B-and B 1 -cell-specific protein (MZB 1), the expression of which identified MZB 1 (+) /CD 38 (+) /CD 138 (+) /CD 27 (+) /CD 45 (+) /CD 20 (+) plasma B cells in fibrotic lung and skin tissue. MZB 1 levels correlated positively with tissue IgG and negatively with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. Conclusions: Despite the presumably high molecular and cellular heterogeneity of ILD, common protein regulations are observed, even across organ boundaries. The surprisingly high prevalence of MZB 1 -positive plasma B cells in tissue fibrosis warrants future investigations regarding the causative role of antibody-mediated autoimmunity in idiopathic cases of organ fibrosis, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis...|$|R
30|$|As smaller genomic {{imbalances}} can be clinically important, {{demand has}} increased for higher resolution assays to detect them. This {{is particularly true}} for idiopathic (without known cause) LD (<b>ILD)</b> <b>cases,</b> that represent ∼ 15 % of referrals to clinical genetics and paediatrics clinics. Despite ILD being incurable, a diagnosis is important for many reasons including, providing accurate prognostic information and genetic counselling, directing appropriate clinical care and educational needs, considering future preventative and therapeutic regimes and finally helping clinicians to answer the parents’ question “why?”. The clarification of genetic risk for both the immediate and wider family is particularly important because it enables meaningful reproductive choice. For example, a negative result can substantially reduce risk whereas a positive result can open an avenue for prenatal diagnosis (in appropriate cases).|$|R
30|$|To {{create a}} cost per diagnosis, cost data were {{combined}} {{with information on}} the predicted number of diagnoses for 100 hypothetical <b>ILD</b> <b>cases</b> referred via genetics clinics for genomic imbalance testing. Costs {{were assigned to the}} karyotyping route (factoring in one additional genome imbalance test, a telomere assay, for karyotypically normal samples) and for aCGH (where few, if any, additional genome imbalance tests are required). The number of diagnoses expected and the testing scenarios were derived from clinical diagnostic laboratory records (karyotyping), research experience (testing scenarios and 44  K aCGH results to date) and published data (karyotyping, subtelomeric studies and aCGH ILD studies) (de Vries et al. 2005; Knight 2005; Knight and Regan 2006; Menten et al. 2006; Miyake et al. 2006; Rauch et al. 2006; Ravnan et al. 2006; Rosenberg et al. 2005; Schoumans et al. 2005; Shaw-Smith et al. 2004; Tyson et al. 2005; Vissers et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|Diffuse parenchymal lung {{diseases}} in children (chDPLD) or interstitial lung {{diseases in}} children (chILD) represent a heterogeneous group of respiratory disorders that are mostly chronic and associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, the incidence of chDPLD is so low that most pediatricians lack sufficient knowledge of chDPLD, especially in China. Based on the clinico-radiologic-pathologic (CRP) diagnosis, we tried to describe (1) the characteristics of chDPLD and (2) the ratio of each constituent of chDPLD in China. Data were evaluated, including clinical, radiographic, and pathologic results from lung biopsies. We collected 25 cases of chDPLD, 18 boys and 7 girls with a median age of 6. 0 years, from 16 hospitals in China. The most common manifestations included cough (n = 24), dyspnea (n = 21), and fever (n = 4). There were three cases of exposure-related interstitial lung disease (<b>ILD),</b> three <b>cases</b> of systemic disease-associated <b>ILD,</b> nineteen <b>cases</b> of alveolar structure disorder-associated <b>ILD,</b> and no <b>cases</b> of <b>ILD</b> specific to infancy. Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (n = 9) was the two largest groups. Non-specific interstitial pneumonia is the main categories of chDPLD in China. Lung biopsy is always a crucial step in the final diagnosis. However, clinical and imaging studies should be carefully evaluated for their value in indicating a specific chDPLD...|$|R

30|$|This {{retrospective}} {{study was conducted}} at Kurashiki central hospital in Kurashiki City, Okayama, Japan. The diagnoses of PM and DM were based on Bohan and Peter’s criteria. The diagnosis of CADM {{was based on the}} criteria of Sontheimer (2002). In addition, patients who exhibited cutaneous manifestations of DM without muscle weakness for < 6  months and experienced fatal complications, such as acute or subacute ILD, were also diagnosed with CADM according to Gerami’s criteria (Gerami et al. 2006). From January 2005 to December 2012, 62 cases newly diagnosed with PM, DM, and CADM by two or more physicians (including a rheumatologist) were included in the study. There were no exclusion criteria. The patients were divided into five groups {{depending on the type of}} myositis and presence of ILD: PM with <b>ILD</b> (PM-ILD; 11 <b>cases),</b> PM without <b>ILD</b> (PM-no ILD; 12 <b>cases),</b> DM with <b>ILD</b> (DM-ILD; 11 <b>cases),</b> DM without <b>ILD</b> (DM-no ILD; 13 cases), and CADM with <b>ILD</b> (CADM-ILD; 15 <b>cases).</b> No cases of CADM without ILD were present.

40|$|Interstitial {{lung disease}} (ILD) is a {{heterogeneous}} group of parenchymal lung disorders having varied histopathologies. Although histologically different, the ILDs have rather similar clinical presentations consisting of increasing dyspnea, a restrictive lung function, impaired gas exchange, and widespread shadowing on chest radiography. Approximately two-thirds of <b>ILD</b> <b>cases</b> have no known etiology. The remaining one-third is either associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) or caused by various environmental or occupational exposures including inhalation of asbestos or other inorganic particles, inhalation of inorganic agents, certain drugs and radiation therapy. It is widely accepted that prevention, improved prognosis {{and quality of}} healthcare are dependent on {{a better understanding of}} disease epidemiology, and it is to this end that the present research contributes. This doctoral research project makes use of a large and well-validated primary care database to investigate the frequency of ILD, the incidence of comorbidity after diagnosis, and characteristics of ILD patients at diagnosis compared to a general population control group. For many ILD subgroups an increase in incidence density and prevalence over time was observed, however it is uncertain to what extent secular trends played a role in these findings. Rates for all-cause mortality and comorbidities varied greatly across ILD subgroups, as did patient characteristics at diagnosis. This research project also delved deeper into specific epidemiological topics relating to certain ILD subgroups within the more broadly-classified, non-idiopathic ILD disease category. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence, characteristics and outcomes of patients with unclassifiable interstitial lung disease (ILD) and to develop a simple method of predicting disease behaviour. Unclassifiable ILD patients were identified from an ongoing longitudinal cohort. Unclassifiable ILD was diagnosed after a multidisciplinary review did not secure a specific ILD diagnosis. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-IPF ILDs. Independent predictors of mortality were determined using Cox proportional-hazards analysis to identify subgroups with distinct disease behaviour. Unclassifiable ILD was diagnosed in 10 % of the ILD cohort (132 out of 1370 patients). The most common reason for being unclassifiable was missing histopathological assessment due to a high risk of surgical lung biopsy. Demographic and physiological features of unclassifiable ILD were intermediate between IPF and non-IPF disease controls. Unclassifiable ILD had longer survival rates when compared to IPF on adjusted analysis (hazard ratio 0. 62, p = 0. 04) and similar survival compared to non-IPF ILDs (hazard ratio 1. 54, p = 0. 12). Independent predictors of survival in unclassifiable ILD included diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (p = 0. 001) and a radiological fibrosis score (p = 0. 02). Unclassifiable ILD represents approximately 10 % of <b>ILD</b> <b>cases</b> and has a heterogeneous clinical course, which can be predicted using clinical and radiological variables...|$|R

40|$|Background: There are {{relatively}} few epidemiological studies on {{interstitial lung disease}} (ILD) worldwide. Objective: To report the incident <b>cases</b> of <b>ILD</b> and compare our data with reports from other populations. Methods: Newly diagnosed ILDs were prospectively collected at a single tertiary care hospital from January 2008 to December 2011. Detailed demographic and clinical data were collected {{at the time of}} diagnosis, along with the results from diagnostic procedures, including high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), serological tests, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), transbronchial lung biopsy, endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and surgical lung biopsy. Results: A total of 330 cases were included. The mean age was 55. 4 ± 14. 9 years. There was a slight predominance of females (202; 61. 2 %), and the male-to-female ratio was 1 : 1. 37. The most frequent disease was connective tissue disease (CTD) -associated ILD (34. 8 %), followed by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (23. 3 %), sarcoidosis (20 %), and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (6. 3 %). Non-classifiable ILD was present in 1. 8 % of the total <b>ILD</b> <b>cases.</b> HRCT was performed in 97. 3 % of the cases, BAL in 17. 5 %, transbronchial lung biopsy in 21. 8 %, EBUS-TBNA in 4. 5 %, and surgical lung biopsy in 22. 7 % (38. 6 % of which were performed among the idiopathic interstitial pneumonia cases). Conclusions: CTD-ILD and IPF were the most frequently observed ILDs in this Saudi Arabian population.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Interstitial {{lung disease}} (ILD) {{is a common}} manifestation of {{polymyositis}} (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), and clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM); however, {{little is known about}} the factors influencing the prognosis for PM/DM/CADM-associated ILD. (PM/DM/CADM-ILD). The aim of the present study is to assess prognostic factors for PM/DM/CADM-ILD. METHODS: The clinical features and survival of 114 consecutive patients diagnosed with PM/DM/CADM-ILD (39 men and 75 women; median age, 56 years) were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The study group included 30 PM-associated ILD, 41 DM-associated ILD, and 43 CADM-associated <b>ILD</b> <b>cases.</b> The clinical presentation of ILD was acute/subacute form in 59 patients (51. 8 %) and chronic form in 55 patients (48. 2 %). The major pulmonary symptoms were dyspnea, cough, and fever. High-resolution computed tomography frequently revealed ground-glass opacities, traction bronchiectasis, and consolidation. Most of the patients were treated with corticosteroids or corticosteroids in combination with immunosuppressive agents. The all-cause mortality was 27. 2 %. Acute/subacute form, % forced vital capacity (FVC), age, % of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and a diagnosis of CADM (vs. PM) were significantly associated with poor outcome in univariate Cox proportional hazards models. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis validated acute/subacute ILD, %FVC, age, and diagnosis of CADM (vs. PM) as significant predictors of overall mortality. Patients with acute/subacute ILD had a much lower survival rate than those with the chronic form (p< 0. 001). Patients with CADM-ILD had a lower survival rate than those with PM-ILD (p =  0. 034). CONCLUSIONS: Acute/subacute form, older age, lower level of FVC and diagnosis of CADM predict poor outcome in PM/DM/CADM-ILD...|$|R
