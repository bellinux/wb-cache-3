5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, to watch as <b>our</b> <b>fathers,</b> our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for <b>our</b> <b>Fathers,</b> and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E
6000|$|Tecumseh {{with his}} Indians {{witnessed}} {{the battle of}} Lake Erie at Put-in-Bay, where Perry defeated the English fleet, {{and he was not}} deceived by the pretense of General Proctor that the Americans were beaten and the English ships were merely putting in there for repairs. Proctor was then preparing to retreat into Canada from Detroit, and Tecumseh demanded to be heard {{in the name of the}} Indians. He had some very bitter words to say: [...] "The war before this <b>our</b> British <b>father</b> gave the hatchet to his red children.... In that war <b>our</b> <b>father</b> was thrown upon his back by the Americans, and <b>our</b> <b>father</b> took them by the hand without our knowledge, and we are afraid <b>our</b> <b>father</b> will do so again at this time.... Our ships have gone away, and we are much astonished to see <b>our</b> <b>father</b> tying up everything and preparing to run away.... We are sorry to see <b>our</b> <b>father</b> doing so without seeing the enemy. We must compare <b>our</b> <b>father's</b> conduct to a fat dog that carries his tail on his back, and when affrighted drops it between his legs and runs off.|$|R

6000|$|... (1.) It may be thy great {{prayer is}} to say, [...] "Our Father which art in heaven," [...] &c. Dost thou know {{the meaning of}} the very first words of this prayer? Canst thou indeed, {{with the rest of the}} saints, cry, <b>Our</b> <b>Father?</b> Art thou truly born again? Hast thou {{received}} the spirit of adoption? Dost thou see thyself in Christ, and canst thou come to God as a member of him? Or art thou ignorant of these things, and yet darest thou say, <b>Our</b> <b>Father?</b> Is not the devil thy father? (John 8:44). And dost thou not do the deeds of the flesh? And yet darest thou say to God, <b>Our</b> <b>Father?</b> Nay, art thou not a desperate persecutor of the children of God? Hast thou not cursed them in thine heart many a time? And yet dost thou out of thy blasphemous throat suffer these words to come, even <b>our</b> <b>Father?</b> He is their Father whom thou hatest and persecutest. But as the devil presented himself amongst the sons of God, (Job 1), when they were to present themselves before the <b>Father,</b> even <b>our</b> <b>Father,</b> so is it now; because the saints were commanded to say, <b>Our</b> <b>Father,</b> therefore all the blind ignorant rabble in the world, they must also use the same words, <b>Our</b> <b>Father.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2006, Eastwood {{directed}} {{two films}} about World War II's Battle of Iwo Jima. The first, Flags of <b>Our</b> <b>Fathers,</b> {{focused on the}} men who raised the American flag on top of Mount Suribachi and featured the film debut of Eastwood's son Scott. This was followed by Letters from Iwo Jima, which dealt with the tactics of the Japanese soldiers {{on the island and}} the letters they wrote home to family members. Letters from Iwo Jima was the first American film to depict a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy. Both films received praise from critics and garnered several nominations at the 79th Academy Awards, including Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Original Screenplay for Letters from Iwo Jima. At the 64th Golden Globe Awards Eastwood received nominations for Best Director in both films. Letters from Iwo Jima won the award for Best Foreign Language Film.|$|E
