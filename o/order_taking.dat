Scores of 92 from Wallace, 66 from Griffith and 60 from Campbell {{contributed to a}} daunting 296/5 which the Irish never got anywhere near despite Smyth's 58, instead crawling to just 120/7. However, Northern Ireland came back well to beat Bangladesh by 114 runs: the Irish made a creditable 177 (McCallan 53) before Cooke ran through the Bangladeshi <b>order,</b> <b>taking</b> 5–35 as they were dismissed for 63.|$|E

On 2 August, four days before the police were due to go on strike, the leaders of the mutiny along with 200 dissident policemen were transferred from Belfast. Barrett and six other constables were dismissed from the RIC. The day after Barrett's dismissal, the strikers carried him from one police barracks to another; a mass demonstration followed where he addressed a crowd of 5,000 people, mainly striking workers. The police mutiny, however, was effectively crushed without their threatened strike having taken place.|$|E

25|$|The first Test at Chennai {{turned out}} to be a very high scoring affair, with South Africa batting first and making 540, then India {{responding}} strongly, led by Virender Sehwag who scored 319 from 304 balls, to reach 468/1 by the end of the third day. On the fourth day Steyn helped to restrict India's lead to 87 runs by dismissing MS Dhoni with a bouncer then blasting through the lower <b>order,</b> <b>taking</b> three wickets in two overs for the cost of two runs, all bowled with reverse swinging deliveries. He finished the innings, and the match which petered out into a tame draw, with four wickets for 103 runs. On the morning of the second Test at Ahmedabad, South Africa demolished the much vaunted Indian batting line within twenty overs, for the meagre total of 76 runs. Steyn was the pick of the bowlers taking five wickets for 23 runs, dismissing Sehwag and Rahul Dravid then mopping up the last three batsmen for the cost of 11 runs. In the second innings he added a further three wickets to his match tally, finishing the game with eight wickets for 114 runs, as South Africa completed a crushing victory by an innings and 90 runs. The final Test at Kanpur saw Steyn pick up three first innings wickets which took him to 15 wickets in the series at an average of 20.20. As a result of this, the cumulation of an outstanding 2007/08 season in which he took 75 wickets in 11 matches, Steyn moved up to joint first place (alongside Muttiah Muralitharan) in the ICC Test match bowling rankings.|$|E

Some historians have {{questioned}} whether he ever took Holy Orders; in any case he was known for a rather secular lifestyle.

Soon he became involved in political activism, and in 1774 he published (anonymously) a brochure titled Saggio intorno al luogo del seppellire, which focused on the issue of hygiene and burials near churches. Also in 1774 he received permission to leave the Piarists, and resumed using the name Scipione. He would, however, keep and use the title of [...] "the priest" [...] (l'abbé) for most of his life. By the turn of the decade, Piattoli found himself in a faction that was losing in the politics of Modena, and decided to move, giving up his professorship in 1782.|$|E

The West Indies won the series 5 Tests to nil and Hall took 27 wickets at an average of 15.74. When the second Test at Sabina Park was heading towards what looked to be a tame draw on a placid pitch, Hall broke the game wide open with some [...] "grand bowling", taking 6/49 and West Indies won the match by an innings.
