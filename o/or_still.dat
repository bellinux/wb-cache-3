5|$|For a long time, it was {{uncertain}} if Światło was dead <b>or</b> <b>still</b> alive. Information on him {{was protected by}} the US witness protection program; there were rumours that {{he died in the}} late 1960s, 1975 or 1985. In 2010, United States government stated that he had died on 2 September 1994. Documents relating to him are still classified in the United States and not available to researchers.|$|E
5|$|The Turkish {{army was}} at first {{quartered}} in Baghdad, but quickly came into conflict with {{the remnants of the}} old Abbasid establishment in the city and the city's populace. The latter resented their loss of influence and career opportunities to the foreign troops, who were furthermore often undisciplined and violent, spoke no Arabic, and were either recent converts to Islam <b>or</b> <b>still</b> pagans. Violent episodes between the populace and the Turks thus became more and more common.|$|E

5|$|The first {{attempts}} {{to create a}} breed registry in 1903 and 1904 failed. In 1912, another attempt was made, this time successful, and a stud book was created in Dijon in 1913. With {{the creation of the}} stud book, only purebred Auxois or Ardennais and Trait du Nord crosses could be registered. However, by 1917, the physical characteristics of the breed were still not fixed, and leaders of the equine community were critical, and doubtful of whether the Auxois was a breed in its own right <b>or</b> <b>still</b> merely a subtype of the Ardennais. They were also unsure whether {{it was a good idea}} to accept the recognition of another regional breed, of which France had many.|$|E
5|$|These crowns {{continue}} {{a history of}} monarchy in the Americas that reaches back to before European colonization. Both tribal and more complex pre-Columbian societies existed under monarchical forms of government, with some expanding to form vast empires under a central king figure, while others {{did the same with}} a decentralized collection of tribal regions under a hereditary chieftain. None of the contemporary monarchies, however, are descended from those pre-colonial royal systems, instead either having their historical roots in, <b>or</b> <b>still</b> being a part of, the current European monarchies that spread their reach across the Atlantic Ocean, beginning in the mid 14th century.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had thought that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played out differently, as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality <b>or</b> <b>still</b> is trapped in his delusion.|$|E
