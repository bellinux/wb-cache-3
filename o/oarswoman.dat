[...] "I have not rowed for a good while," [...] she said, [...] "but I am getting used to the oars already. Now then, I'm off," [...] and she began to pull with a {{strength}} which, had it been suitably paired with skill, would have made her an excellent amateur <b>oarswoman.</b> But the place of skill was supplied by enthusiasm and determination. Once or twice an oar slipped from the rowlock and she nearly went over backward, and several times one of the blades got under the water with the flat side up, so that she had difficulty in getting it out. She raised her oars much too high in the air, but she counterbalanced this by sinking them very deep into the water. But she got on, and although her course was somewhat irregular, its general trend was in the direction desired.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to develop an {{indirect}} method of estimating maximal oxygen uptake in oarsmen and <b>oarswomen</b> on the rowing ergometer based on both the submaximal exercises and the commonly used in this sport maximal exercise-type test that simulates rowing the distance of 2000 m. Forty-four oarsmen and 27 <b>oarswomen</b> from both the national team and the direct back-up were enrolled in the investigations. Two exercise tests on the Concept II rowing ergometer were employed: the submaximal test with incremental power output (anaerobic threshold test) and the maximal test, simulating rowing the distance of 2000 m in the shortest possible time (2 -km test). During both tests, oxygen uptake and heart rate were recorded and the highest values of these parameters registered during the 2 -km test were regarded as the VO 2 max and HRmax indices, respectively. The linear relation of the oxygen uptake to the power output (W) on the ergometer was detected in both the male (VO 2 = 1. 1328 + 0. 0113 W) and female (VO 2 = 0. 6652 + 0. 0128 W) athletes. Comparison of the regression lines demonstrated statistically significant differences between the oarsmen and <b>oarswomen</b> with respect to the intercept and the slope of the lines. Mean values of the directly measured VO 2 max equaled to 5. 48 ± 0. 59 and 3. 68 ± 0. 31 l•min- 1 in the groups of oarsmen and <b>oarswomen,</b> respectively. The most accurate predicted values of VO 2 max were obtained based on the linear regression of VO 2 max against the mean power output (WM) in the 2 -km test using the following formulas: VO 2 max (l•min- 1) in the males = 1. 682 + 0. 0097 WM; VO 2 max (l•min- 1) in the females = 1. 631 + 0. 0088 WM. In the males, the difference between the measured and predicted VO 2 max (∆%), correlation coefficient (r), standard estimation error (SEE), and total error (TE%) equaled to 0. 12 ± 4. 96 (NS), 0. 889 (P< 0. 001), 0. 274, and 4. 9, respectively. In the females, these values equaled to 0. 43 ± 5. 02 (NS), 0. 801 (P< 0. 001), 0. 19 and 4. 95, respectively. Based on the submaximal exercises, the relatively accurate predicted values of VO 2 max were obtained from the linear regression of VO 2 max against PWC 170 using the following formulas: VO 2 max (l•min- 1) in the males = 3. 2131 + 0. 0076 (PWC 170); VO 2 max (l•min- 1) in the females = 2. 4138 + 0. 0071 (PWC 170). In the males, the accuracy of prediction of VO 2 max was defined by the following indices: ∆%= 0. 37 ± 6. 15 (NS), r= 0. 826 (P< 0. 001), SEE= 0. 279, TE%= 6. 03. In the females, the respective values were as follows: ∆%= 0. 30 ± 6. 22 (NS), r= 0. 711 (P< 0. 001), SEE= 0. 158, TE%= 5. 82. The obtained results indicate that it possible to relatively precisely predict maximal oxygen uptake from the results of submaximal and maximal (2 -km test) exercises performed on the rowing ergometer...|$|R

50|$|The highest {{values in}} {{absolute}} terms for humans are often found in rowers, as their much greater bulk makes up for a slightly lower VO2 max per kg. Elite oarsmen measured in 1984 had VO2 max values of 6.1±0.6 L/min and <b>oarswomen</b> 4.1±0.4 L/min. Rowers are interested in both absolute values of VO2 max and in lung capacity, {{and the fact that}} they are measured in similar units means that the two are often confused. British rower Sir Matthew Pinsent is variously reported to have had a VO2 of 7.5 L/min or 8.5 L/min, although the latter may represent confusion with his lung capacity of 8.5 litres. New Zealand sculler Rob Waddell has one of the highest absolute VO2 max levels ever tested.|$|R
40|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the biomechanics of rowing during step testing {{with a focus on}} lumbo-pelvic kinematics and force output and noted that these parameters change with work intensity. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how the biomechanics of the rowing stroke changes over time as a result of coaching and training and to see if these change were related to a change in physiological performance. An electromagnetic motion measuring device in conjunction with a load cell was used to determine the ergometer rowing kinematics of 7 elite international <b>oarswomen</b> during routine step tests over a two year period. Force output was observed to improve over the two year time period, with peak force significantly rising by 40 - 80 N. This was associated with significant increases in stroke length of between 15 and 19 cm. Both of these are indicative of improvement in performance. Kinematic variables were also observed to change, with greater pelvic rotation and associated lumbar spine motion at the later time point. The findings of this study demonstrate that rowing technique changes with time, and suggest that kinematics measures of rowing technique may be important tools to monitor athlete...|$|R
40|$|Women athletes {{participating}} on the women's varsity crew {{team were}} assessed for skeletal, skinfold, and circumference measurements {{to provide a}} descriptive analysis of the phy-sique of female competitive rowers.

A reference group consisted of women employees of an insurance company. A single classifica-tion analysis of variance design suggested that the only sig-nificant difference found among the three groups for the skeletal measurements were the left arm length, right knee width, and right and left elbow widths. Otherwise, no sig-nificant difference among the groups for the skeletal assess-ments was observed. No significant difference among group means as found between groups in terms of skinfold assess-ments or body fat percentage.

40|$|Eight {{competitive}} <b>oarswomen</b> (age, 22 ± 3 years; mass, 64. 4 ± 3. 8 kg) performed three simulated 2, 000 -m time trials on a rowing ergometer. The trials, {{which were}} {{preceded by a}} 24 -hour dietary and training control and 72 hours of caffeine abstinence, were conducted 1 hour after ingesting caffeine (6 or 9 mg · kg- 1  body mass) or placebo. Plasma free fatty acid concentrations before exercise were higher with caffeine than placebo (0. 67 ± 0. 34 vs. 0. 72 ± 0. 36 vs. 0. 30 ± 0. 10 mM for 6 and 9 mg · kg- 1 caffeine and placebo, respectively; p <. 05). Performance time improved 0. 7 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0 to 1. 5 %) with 6 mg · kg- 1  caffeine and 1. 3 % (95 % CI 0. 5 to 2. 0 %) with 9 mg · kg- 1  caffeine. The first 500 m of the 2, 000 m was faster with the higher caffeine dose compared with placebo or the lower dose (1. 53 ± 0. 52 vs. 1. 55 ± 0. 62 and 1. 56 ± 0. 43 min; p =. 02).

40|$|Competitive oarsmen (n= 8) and <b>oarswomen</b> (n= 9) {{completed}} three on-water 1800 m time-trials, each {{separated by}} 48 h, under cool conditions (8. 4 ± 2. 0 0 C, 50. 0 ± 10. 2 % humidity). No weight limit was imposed {{for the first}} time-trial. However, one of the remaining two trials was undertaken following 4 % body weight loss (WT- 4 %) in the previous 24 h, the sequence of trials randomised between athletes. Aggressive nutritional recovery strategies were enforced in the 2 h following WT- 4 %. A linear mixed-effects model was used to analyse data with time-trial time, sex, weight and trial order as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect. The effect of sex was highly significant (mean 45. 0, 95 % CI 36. 1 – 53. 8 sec; P 0. 05). WT- 4 % had only a small and statistically non-significant effect on on-water time-trial performance (mean 1. 0, 95 % CI - 0. 9 – 2. 8 sec; P = 0. 29) compared with unrestricted trials. Similar to time-trials undertaken on the rowing ergometer[1], optimisation of nutrient intake in recovery following weigh-in minimises the impact of acute weight loss (4 %) upon on-water rowing performance. However, the performance of these same athletes on ergometer trials undertaken in thermally stressful conditions remained significantly compromised[1]. The discrepancy {{in the degree of}} impact of WT- 4 % on ergometer versus on-water trials may be a consequence of several factors: 1) on-water performance may be limited by the need to retain biomechanical efficiency, maintaining exertion below a threshold at which cardiovascular and/or thermoregulatory functions are compromised, and/or 2) overall cardiovascular strain is lower when exercising in cool conditions and is thus less likely to be challenged sufficiently to compromise rowing performance, even in the presence of hypohydration.
