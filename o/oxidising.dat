Iodates {{are by far the}} most important of these compounds, which can be made by <b>oxidising</b> alkali metal iodides with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by <b>oxidising</b> iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. Iodate has the weakest <b>oxidising</b> power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E

To a solution of <b>oxidised</b> glutathione a sufficient amount of acetic anhydride is added to obtain complete conversion of <b>oxidised</b> glutathione. After completion of the acetylation a fresh sample of <b>oxidised</b> glutathione is added. If the mixture of <b>oxidised</b> glutathione and diacetyl <b>oxidised</b> glutathione thus obtained is incubated, disulphide interchange occurs if a proper catalyst has been added. This interchange {{is evident from the}} appearance of monoacetyl <b>oxidised</b> glutathione. The three compounds involved in this reaction (<b>oxidised</b> glutathione, monoacetyl and diacetyl <b>oxidised</b> glutathione) were readily distinguished by paper electrophoresis at pH 1. 7. Using this method several compounds were tested for their catalysing or inhibiting effect upon disulphide interchange. SH-containing compounds catalyse the reaction, in conformity with literature data; the SH-generating compounds Na 2 SO 3 and KCN also catalyse the reaction, the latter compound being far less efficient than the former one. It was shown by amperometric titration that slow spontaneous disulphide interchange is due to traces of SH compound in the <b>oxidised</b> glutathione preparation.

The objective {{of this study is}} to compare the mechanical behaviour of thermally <b>oxidised</b> commercially pure titanium (CP-Ti) and commercially pure zirconium (CP-Zr). For this purpose, these two bio-metals were thermally <b>oxidised</b> under the same condition (650 °C for 6 h) and the <b>oxidised</b> specimens were characterised using various analytical and experimental techniques, including oxygen uptake analysis, layer thickness and hardness measurements, scratch tests, dry sliding friction and wear tests and tribocorrosion tests in Ringer’s solution. The results show that under the present thermal oxidation condition, 4 times more oxygen is introduced into CP-Zr than into CP-Ti and the oxide layer produced on CP-Zr is nearly 6 times thicker than that on CP-Ti. Thermally <b>oxidised</b> CP-Zr possesses a higher hardness, a deeper hardening depth and better scratch resistance than thermally <b>oxidised</b> CP-Ti. Under dry sliding and tribocorrosion conditions, thermally <b>oxidised</b> CP-Zr also possesses much better resistance to material removal and a higher load bearing capacity than thermally <b>oxidised</b> CP-Ti. Thus, thermally <b>oxidised</b> Zr possesses much better mechanical behaviour than thermally <b>oxidised</b> Ti...|$|R
5|$|Cerium(IV) aqueous {{solutions}} may {{be prepared}} by reacting cerium(III) solutions {{with the strong}} <b>oxidising</b> agents peroxodisulfate or bismuthate. The value of E⦵(Ce4+/Ce3+) varies widely depending on conditions due to the relative ease of complexation and hydrolysis with various anions, though +1.72V is a usually representative value; that for E⦵(Ce3+/Ce) is −2.34V. Cerium is the only lanthanide which has important aqueous and coordination chemistry in the +4 oxidation state. Due to ligand-to-metal charge transfer, aqueous cerium(IV) ions are orange-yellow. Aqueous cerium(IV) is metastable in water and is a strong <b>oxidising</b> agent that oxidizes hydrochloric acid to give chlorine gas. For example, ceric ammonium nitrate is a common <b>oxidising</b> agent in organic chemistry, releasing organic ligands from metal carbonyls. In the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction, cerium oscillates between the +4 and +3 oxidation states to catalyse the reaction. Cerium(IV) salts, especially cerium(IV) sulfate, are often used as standard reagents for volumetric analysis in cerimetric titrations.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} so that the possible effects of thermally-oxidised dietary oil and vitamin E supplementation could be determined on the performance, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant defence system and some blood and meat quality traits of broilers. Broilers were fed grower diets containing fresh or <b>oxidised</b> oil, supplemented with and without vitamin E (200 mg/kg) from {{four to six weeks}} of age. Neither <b>oxidised</b> dietary oil nor vitamin E supplementation had any adverse effect on weight gain, feed consumption or feed conversion ratio. However, the broilers that received <b>oxidised</b> oil had lower levels of plasma cholesterol and triglyceride compared to the control. The glucose level was neither influenced by <b>oxidised</b> oil nor by vitamin E supplementation. The plasma malondialdehyde level increased slightly in broilers fed <b>oxidised</b> oil, indicating increased lipid peroxidation. Higher glutathione peroxidise (GSH–Px) activity observed in the broilers fed <b>oxidised</b> oil suggests greater oxidative stress. Vitamin E supplementation partly depressed GSH–Px activity in broilers fed <b>oxidised</b> oil. This depression in enzyme activity might be the result of homeostatic compensation. The uric acid concentration was not affected by <b>oxidised</b> oil and vitamin E supplementation. Feeding <b>oxidised</b> oil did not cause a marked discolouration in breast meat. Vitamin E supplementation had some beneficial effects on colour measurements...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{death of}} macrophages {{contributes}} to atheroma formation. Oxidation renders low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cytotoxic to human monocyte-macrophages. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 (Lp-PLA 2), also termed platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, hydrolyses <b>oxidised</b> phospholipids. Inhibition of Lp-PLA 2 by diisopropyl fluorophosphate or Pefabloc (broad-spectrum serine esterase/protease inhibitors), or SB 222657 (a specific inhibitor of Lp-PLA 2) {{did not prevent}} LDL oxidation, but diminished the ensuing toxicity and apoptosis induction when the LDL was <b>oxidised,</b> and inhibited the rise in lysophosphatidylcholine levels {{that occurred in the}} inhibitors’ absence.

40|$|AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Pro-atherogenic and pro-oxidant, <b>oxidised</b> LDL trigger {{adverse effects}} on {{pancreatic}} beta cells, possibly contributing to diabetes progression. Because <b>oxidised</b> LDL diminish the expression of genes regulated by the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), we investigated the involvement of this transcription factor and of oxidative stress in beta cell failure elicited by <b>oxidised</b> LDL. METHODS: Isolated human and rat islets, and insulin-secreting cells were cultured with human native or <b>oxidised</b> LDL or with hydrogen peroxide. The expression of genes was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Insulin secretion was monitored by EIA kit. Cell apoptosis was determined by scoring cells displaying pycnotic nuclei. RESULTS: Exposure of beta cell lines and islets to <b>oxidised</b> LDL, but not to native LDL raised the abundance of ICER. Induction of this repressor by the modified LDL compromised the expression of important beta cell genes, including insulin and anti-apoptotic islet brain 1, {{as well as of}} genes coding for key components of the secretory machinery. This led to hampering of insulin production and secretion, and of cell survival. Silencing of this transcription factor by RNA interference restored the expression of its target genes and alleviated beta cell dysfunction and death triggered by <b>oxidised</b> LDL. Induction of ICER was stimulated by oxidative stress, whereas antioxidant treatment with N-acetylcysteine or HDL prevented the rise of ICER elicited by <b>oxidised</b> LDL and restored beta cell functions. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Induction of ICER links oxidative stress to beta cell failure caused by <b>oxidised</b> LDL and can be effectively abrogated by antioxidant treatment...|$|R

Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{complexes}} tend to {{be similar}} to those of its lighter homologue copper.

5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly <b>oxidising</b> acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
40|$|While sulfide {{minerals}} {{generally are}} easy to recover by flotation, surface oxidation can {{have a significant impact}} on both the recovery and selectivity. The extent of this impact depended upon the mineral type for <b>oxidised</b> Nkomati sulfides (chalcopyrite < pentlandite not, vert, similar pyrrhotite). The floatability of these <b>oxidised</b> sulfides has been shown to be restored by sulfidisation with varying degrees of success (chalcopyrite < pyrrhotite < pentlandite). Electrophoretic measurements showed that the <b>oxidised</b> sulfides strongly adsorbed hydrosulfide ions during sulfidisation which corresponded with the onset of strong floatability. XPS analyses showed that the surface of the <b>oxidised</b> chalcopyrite was readily converted to a chalcocite-like stoichiometry through an electrochemical mechanism coupled with the oxidation of copper and iron. The sulfidisation of <b>oxidised</b> pyrrhotite proceeded through both an anionic exchange mechanism and a direct precipitation reaction to form a pyrrhotite-like surface, which was subsequently converted electrochemically to a pyrite-like composition via iron and copper oxidation. Under more intense sulfidisation, the precipitation reaction was more dominant and a more pyrrhotite-like surface was evident. For the sulfidisation of <b>oxidised</b> pentlandite, although small quantities of a millerite-like and a pyrite-like surface may have formed, significant flotation in the presence of other <b>oxidised</b> sulfides appears to have been achieved through either adsorbed ferric hydroxides that became sulfidised or precipitated iron sulfides generated from the <b>oxidised</b> pyrrhotite. A feature common to all the sulfidised surfaces was the presence of reasonable quantities of either polysulfides or elemental sulfur, which may well contribute to any subsequent flotation...|$|R
40|$|Apoptosis of macrophages {{and smooth}} muscle cells is {{observed}} in atherosclerotic lesions and may {{play an important}} role in the disease progression. <b>Oxidised</b> low density lipoprotein (LDL) is cytotoxic and induces apoptosis in a variety of cell types. We reported previously that ascorbate protects arterial smooth muscle cells from apoptosis induced by <b>oxidised</b> LDL containing the peak levels of lipid hydroperoxides. We now demonstrate that macrophages undergo apoptosis when treated with this species of <b>oxidised</b> LDL, as detected by increased annexin V binding and DNA fragmentation. Ascorbate treatment of macrophages did not protect against the cytotoxicity of <b>oxidised</b> LDL, and modestly increased the levels of annexin V binding and DNA fragmentation. <b>Oxidised</b> LDL treatment also increased the expression of the antioxidant stress protein heme oxygenase- 1 in macrophages; however, this increase was markedly attenuated by ascorbate pretreatment. Although apoptosis induced by <b>oxidised</b> LDL was modestly promoted by ascorbate, ascorbate apparently decreased the levels of oxidative stress in macrophages, suggesting that this pro-apoptotic effect was not mediated by a pro-oxidant mechanism, but may instead have been due to intracellular protection of the apoptotic machinery by ascorbate.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether oxidation {{alters the}} self-aggregation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and the inhibition of such aggregation by albumin. Incubation with copper for different durations produced mildly, moderately, and highly <b>oxidised</b> LDL (having, respectively, ca. 60, 300 and 160 nmol lipid hydroperoxides/mg protein, and electrophoretic mobilities 1. 2, 2. 6 and 4. 4 {{times that of}} native LDL). The rate of flow-induced aggregation was the same for native, mildly <b>oxidised</b> and moderately <b>oxidised</b> LDL, but decreased for highly <b>oxidised</b> LDL. The inhibitory effect of albumin (40 mg/ml) on aggregation was reduced by mild oxidation and further reduced by moderate or severe oxidation. The net result of the two effects {{was that in the}} presence of albumin, moderately <b>oxidised</b> LDL had the highest rate of aggregation and native the lowest. The reduction in the anti-aggregatory effect of albumin provides a new mechanism by which LDL oxidation might enhance net aggregation in vivo. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements.

Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination.

40|$|Various {{studies suggest}} that {{oxidative}} modifications of low density lipoprotein (LDL), and also other lipoproteins, {{have an important role}} in the development of atherosclerosis. In addition to the oxidation products formed endogenously, <b>oxidised</b> triacylglycerols (TAG) and oxysterols in the diet contribute to the <b>oxidised</b> lipoproteins found in circulation. However, studies on both the effect of <b>oxidised</b> dietary lipids on lipoprotein lipid oxidation and the reactions that modify <b>oxidised</b> fat after ingestion have been scarce. Studies on the effects of dietary antioxidants on the lipid oxidation in vivo and the risk of atherosclerosis have been inconclusive. More clinical trials are needed to test the importance of lipoprotein oxidation as a cardiovascular risk factor in humans. In the recent years, various methods have been optimised and applied to the analysis of lipid oxidation products in vivo, and information on the molecular structures of <b>oxidised</b> lipids in plasma, lipoproteins and atherosclerotic plaques has started to accumulate. However, specific structures of <b>oxidised</b> TAG molecules present in these tissues and lipoprotein fractions have not been investigated earlier. In the orginal research in this thesis, an approach based on highperformance liquid chromatographyelectrospray ionisationmass spectrometry (HPLCESIMS) and baseline diene conjugation (BDC) methods was used in order to investigate lipid oxidation level and <b>oxidised</b> TAG molecular structures in pig and human lipoproteins after dietary interventions. The approach was optimised with human LDL samples, which contained various oxidation products of TAG. LDL particles of hyperlipidaemic subjects contained an elevated amount of conjugated dienes. In the pig studies, several <b>oxidised</b> TAG structures with hydroxy, keto, epoxy or aldehydic groups were found in chylomicrons and VLDL after diets rich in sunflower seed oil. Also, the results showed that <b>oxidised</b> sunflower seed oil increased the oxidation of lipoprotein lipids and their TAG molecules. TAG hydroperoxides could be detected neither in the small intestinal mucosa of the pigs fed on the <b>oxidised</b> oil nor in their chylomicrons or VLDL. 6 In the clinical studies, dietary flavonol aglycones extracted from sea buckthorn berries did not have an effect on lipoprotein lipid oxidation and other potential risk factors of atherosclerosis, but their absorption was demonstrated. Oil supplementation seemed to increase the bioavailability of the flavonols. <b>Oxidised</b> TAG molecules were detected in LDL particles of the subjects after both flavonol and control diets...|$|R

5|$|Bromine is {{the third}} halogen, being a nonmetal in group 17 of the {{periodic}} table. Its properties are thus {{similar to those of}} fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration 3d104s24p5, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong <b>oxidising</b> agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell. Corresponding to periodic trends, it is intermediate in electronegativity between chlorine and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker <b>oxidising</b> agent than chlorine, but a stronger one than iodine. Conversely, the bromide ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride. These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, whose work foreshadowed the periodic law for chemical elements. It is intermediate in atomic radius between chlorine and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine, such as first ionisation energy, electron affinity, enthalpy of dissociation of the X2 molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. The volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.|$|E
