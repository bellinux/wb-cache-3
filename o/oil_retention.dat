First part contains basic data {{that we have}} to take into consideration in order to achieve good hydraulic design for cleaning facilities. Road and highway categorization and their typical features in Slovenia and Germany are also written as basics for runoff hydraulic design. Following, most of the storm water cleaning facilities and structures in Slovenian directive Navodilih projektantom za izdelavo tehnične dokumentacije: odvodnjavanje meteornih voda iz avtocestnih površin and German ATV-A 166 guideline are described. Hydraulic design of runoff structures and cleaning facilities is written in second part. Runoff structures as ditches, canalization tubes are recapitulated from German Ras-Ew guideline.

40|$|Basil, garlic, {{and ginger}} {{essential}} oil were extracted by steam distillation, and analyzed by GC and GC-ms. The major components of basil essential oil were methyl chavicol (about 86 %) and 1, 8 -cineole (6 %); those of garlic essential oil were diallyl disulfide (39 %) and diallyl trisulfide (31 %) etc.; {{and those of}} ginger essential oil were camphene (16 %) and geranial (19 %) etc [...] In terms of charater-impact compounds, methyl chavicol which gave fragrance, sweet, fresh, and minty, and 1 -octen- 3 -o 1 which gave unpleasant strongly green odor existed in the basil essential oil. Diallyl disulfide which gave strongly pungent garlic-like aroma existed in the garlic essential oil. Neral which gave fragrance, sweet, fresh, cooling, and woody aroma, and those of genarial and beta-sesquiphellandrene + ar-curcumene + genaryl acetate which gave pungent and warm odor existed in the ginger essential oil. In addition, six different kinds of basil essential oils were analyzed by sensory evaluation and gaschromatography. Furthermore, the data were calculated by SAS stepwise regression method {{trying to find a}} regression equation which could be used as an estimation for the quality of basil essential oil. Microcapsules of basil, garlic, and ginger essential oil were prepared by spray drying. Changes of components of essential oils during spray-drying process were found. For instance, among the percentage compositions of basil essential oil methyl chayicol etc. tended to decrease, while linalool and 1, 8 -cineole etc. increasing. In garlic essential oil, the percentage compositions of diallyl sulfide, methyl allyl disulfide, diallyl disulfide, and 2 -vinyl- 4 H- 1, 3 -dithiin tended to decrease, while methyl allyl trisulfide and diallyl trisulfide increasing. In ginger essential oil, the percentage compositions of alphapinene, camphene, myrcene, limonene, beta-phellandrene, and geranial tended to decrease, while 1, 8 -cineole, 2 -heptanol + 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, linalool and zingiberene increasing. In respect of the properties of microcapsules which added amounts of core materials were different, the <b>oil</b> <b>retentions</b> decreased with increasing the added amounts of core materials, and the amounts of surface oil were about 0. 4 - 1. 7 % of <b>oil</b> <b>retentions.</b> The particle size and flowability of microcapusles increased with increasing the added amounts of core materials, and there were no significantly difference for the surface structures of micro-capsules. On the other hand, changes of essential oils fo microcapsules which were stored for one year at room temperature were also investigated. The results of gaschromatography and sensory evaluation showed that the gtarlic essential oil was the most stable followed by basil and ginger essential oil, respectively. Corn and waxy maize native starches were modified by acetylation or phosphation. The high and low degree of substitutions (D. S.) for acetylations were around 0. 14 - 0. 18 and 0. 5 - 0. 54, respectively; while those for phosphations were about 0. 01 and 0. 12, respectively. The structures of native starches were damaged during the modifications, the higher degree of modification the more damage was. The starch damage of high D. S. of phosphation, especially high, was about 55 - 62 %, The gelatini- zation temperature and enthalphy of modified starches lowered 15 - 18 0 c and 3 - 12 j/g starch, respectively, compared with native starches. The modified starches of high D. S. of phosphation even formed cold water soluble starches. Generally, the emulsufying properties, which are important to the preparation of microcapsules, of modified starches mentioned above were better than those of native starches. The properties of microcapusles, which prepared from using corn and waxy maize native and modified starches stated above as carriers and basil essential oil as core material, were studied. The <b>oil</b> <b>retentions</b> were around 90 % when corn modified starch of high D. S. of phosphation and waxy maize modified starches of low D. S. of acetylation and phosphation were used as carriers. The surface oils were around 0. 22 - 0. 58 % of <b>oil</b> <b>retentions.</b> The effects of substituted groups on the percentage compositions of basil essential oil of microcapsules were also investigated. For example, there were higher percentage compositions of esters and 1, 8 -cineole in basil essential oil when using acetylated modified starches as carrier. In respect of surface structure of micro- capsules, different carrier had its own characteristics according to the results from SEM. For instance, corn native starch as carrier gave deeply dent but smooth surface structure similar to those of phosphated modified starches. However, waxy maize native starch as carrier gave slightly dent and more crinkly surface structure similar to those of acetylated modified starches. In order to improve the flowability and dissolution ability of spray-dried microcapsules, agglomerated microcapsules were prepared by combination of spray drying and agglomeration techniques using different concentrations of flycerol aqueous solutions as binding agent. According to the results, the optimum concentration of binding agent was 30 %. This level gave the agglomerated microcapsules outstanding dissolution ability in water compared to that of the control. The average particle size was 2 - 3 times as large in the agglomerated sample greater than that of the control. Also the flow rate of the sample was 130 times than that of the control. 以水蒸氣餾法分別萃取羅勒、蒜、薑之精油，經由氣相層析儀與氣相層析儀一質譜儀 之分析鑑定，得知羅勒精油之主成分為methyl chavicol (約 86 ％) 與 1, 8 -ci-meole (約 6 ％) ；蒜精油為diallyl disulfide(約 39 ％),deallyl trisulfide(約 31 ％) 等；而薑精油則為camphene(約 16 ％),geramial(約 19 ％) 等。至於在精油成分之味道貢獻方面，羅勒精油中，methyl cha-vicol與 1 - octen- 3 -o 1 均為特徵化合物，methyl cha-vicol帶有香味，甜味，清涼薄荷味等好的 羅勒味道，而l-octen- 3 -o 1 則賦予令人不悅的青草味，惟此一成分僅在於羅勒梗精油 中含量較多，因此對於整株羅勒精油的味道並不會產生太大的影響；在蒜精油中，以 diallyl di-sulfide對於香味貢獻最大，具有非常強的蒜刺鼻味；在薑精油中，則以 neral,g eranial,beta-sesquiphel-landrene＋ar-curcumene ＋geranyl acetate 等成分對 於香味最有頁獻，neral 具有香味，甜味，清涼味與木材味等，而geranial與beta-s esquiphellandrene ＋ar-curcumene＋geranyl acetate 具有刺鼻與溫暖的味道。另 外，就羅勒精油之品質而言，採用品評與氣相層析之分析方法，針對六種不同植體部 位與不同處理之精油進行研究，並配合逐步迴歸之統計方法，求得一條迴歸方程式， 用以作為羅勒精油品管的標準． 以噴霧乾燥法製備羅勒，蒜，薑精油徵膠囊，發現在噴霧乾燥過程中有精油成分變化 的現象。例如羅勒精油成分百分組成中之methyl chavicol 等則有增加的傾向；蒜精 油成分中diallyl sulfide,methyl allyl disulfide,diallyl disulfide, 2 -vinyl- 4 H- 1, 3 -dithiin等減少,而methyl allyl trisulfide 與diallyl trisulfide增加；薑精油中之alpha-phellandrene,camphene,myrcene,limoneme,beta-phellandrene,geranial等減少，而 1 ， 8 -cineole, 2 -heptanol ＋ 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one,linalool,zingiberene等增加。至於在各種不同精油 添加量之微膠囊性狀方面，微膠囊之精油保留率隨精油添加量增加而降低，而表面油 為保留量之 0. 4 ∼ 1. 7 ％左右。微膠囊之粒度與流動性則隨著精油添加量之增加而增加 ，但不同精油添加量之微膠囊之表面構造並無顯著性差異。另外，精油微膠囊在室溫 下貯藏一年後，其精油成分有所變化，由氣相層析與品評結果顯示，蒜精油成分變化 最小，羅勒精油次之，而以薑精油變化最大． 將天然玉米與糯玉米澱粉以醋酸或磷酸修飾後，醋酸低、高取代度則分別為 0. 14 與∼ 0. 54 左右，而磷酸低、高取代度則分別為 0. 01 與 0. 1 ∼ 0. 12 左右。經過修飾之澱粉， 其天然澱粉結構遭受破壞，隨著修飾程度愈高，破壞度愈大，尤以磷酸高取代修飾澱 粉之破壞率更高達 55 ∼ 62 ％左右；糊化溫度與糊化所需熱能則分別下降 15 ∼ 18 ℃與 3 ∼ 12 焦耳／克澱粉，甚至形成冷水可溶澱粉。一般而言，醋酸或磷酸修飾澱粉之乳化 性質較天然者為佳，而此等性質對於微膠囊之製備相當重要． 以玉米、糯玉米之天然及醋酸與磷酸修飾澱粉進行羅勒精油微膠囊之製備。精油保留 量以玉米磷酸高取代修飾澱粉，糯玉米醋酸低取代與磷酸代取代修飾澱粉為膠囊壁物 質時較佳，約為 90 ％左右；而表面油一般為保留量之 0. 22 ∼ 0. 58 ％左右。由各種膠囊 壁中之羅勒精油組成結果可以發現，膠囊壁物質之取代基不同，其所保留之精油組成 亦有所差異。例如以醋酸修飾澱粉為膠囊壁物質時，其所保留之精油成分組成中，以 酯類與 1, 8 -cineole 之量較高。至於在微膠囊之表面構造方面，結果顯示各種不同膠 囊壁物質所製得之微膠囊，其表面構造各具特色。例如玉米天然澱粉者具有凹陷而光 滑的表面特徵，與磷酸修飾澱粉者較為相似；而糯玉米天然澱粉者，其表面凹陷較淺 ，呈現出皺折較多的特徵，與醋酸修飾澱粉者較為相似． 為了改進噴霧乾燥精油微膠囊之流動性與速溶性，以不同濃度之甘油水溶液作為黏著 劑，採用造粒技術配合噴霧乾燥技術，製備造粒微膠囊。結果顯示以 30 ％甘油水溶液 為黏著劑時之造粒微膠囊具有最佳性狀，其表現出優越的溶出速率，而平均粒徑是對 照組的 2 ∼ 3 倍，且流動速率是對照組的 130 倍．目錄 前言 第一章：文獻整理 第二章：羅勒、蒜、薑精油成分之鑑定與品評 壹、實驗目的 貳、材料與方法 參、結果與討論 第三章：噴霧乾燥精油微膠囊之製備及其性狀之探討 壹、實驗目的 貳、材料與方法 參、結果與討論 第四章：醋酸與磷酸修飾澱粉之製備及其性質之研究 壹、實驗目的 貳、材料與方法 參、結果與討論 第五章：採用醋酸與磷酸修飾澱粉製備羅勒精油微膠囊及其性質之探討 壹、實驗目的 貳、材料與方法 參、結果與討論 第六章：造粒微膠囊之製備及其性狀之研究 壹、實驗目的 貳、材料與方法 參、結果與討論 中文摘要 英文摘要 參考文獻 誌...|$|R

30|$|Here, we can {{see that}} the {{different}} esters of fatty acids (FAEs), which compose the lipid profile of the sunflower <b>oil,</b> display <b>retention</b> times (RTs) slightly higher than those of cetane (n-hexane) used as internal standard. Thus, whereas RT of cetane is around 10  min, all RTs of FAEs appear in the range of 16 to 26  min. These are composed of methyl, ethyl, and glycerol esters (the latter constitute MGs) of palmitic, stearic, linoleic, and oleic acids. Thus, palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) derivatives are grouped in a narrow range of RT, 16 to 17  min. Derivatives of oleic (C 18 : 1) and linoleic acid (C 18 : 2) are grouped in RT of 19 to 21  min, with the exception of glycerol ester of oleic acid, or what is the same, the MG of the oleic acid has a different behavior, with a RT[*]=[*] 26  min. Glycerol RT appears at 5  min, before cetane. The absence of this compound in the obtained chromatograms clearly demonstrates the selective nature of the studied enzymatic transesterification reaction.|$|R

The qualitative and quantitative composition of the volatiles in the total oil extracts was similar to the starting oil which is confirmed the high inhibition zone as antifungal and high antioxidant properties after encapsulation to beta-cyclodextrin.

To assess C-arm angiographic computed tomography (CCT) for detecting iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> during TACE, CCT images were obtained of 40 tumours (24 HCC patients). The primary CCT images showed complete iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> patterns (type I) in 29 / 40 (73 %) tumours, at which point embolization was terminated; incomplete iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> requiring further iodized oil embolization occurred in 11 / 40 (28 %) tumours and, of these, complete iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> patterns were achieved in eight tumours.

40|$|Essential oils are {{amongst the}} most complex samples an analyst can face {{in terms of the}} number of {{compounds}} involved. In many cases, minor components are of interest as they can impart a distinctive fragrance character to the oil. Because of the closely related structures and molecular weights among terpenes, positive identification of individual compounds is very difficult with a single chromatographic technique. Further, most of the analytical information is lost when a single technique is used because of the limited peak capacity and the resulting peak overlap. For many years, gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has been the benchmark technique for qualitative and quantitative analysis of essential <b>oils.</b> <b>Retention</b> indices and mass spectra have to be used in combination for confirmation of the identity of components in an essential oil. Other multidimensional or hyphenated techniques also offer advantages that aid in the identification of essential oil components. This thesis demonstrates the application of a comprehensively coupled supercritical fluid and fast temperature programmed gas chromatograph (SFCxGC) to the analysis of essential oils. An SFCxGC instrument was used to analyse the essential oils of Cymbopogon (lemongrass), Artemisia afra (wilde als), Tagetes minuta (kakiebos) and Pelargonium (geranium) species. The unique application of a porous layer open-tubular (PLOT) column, used in conjunction with supercritical carbon dioxide is demonstrated to effect group separation of polar, oxygenated compounds. This separation and elution of very polar compounds from a silica gel column is believed to occur due to the reduced phase ratio (ƒÒ) of the system obtained by increasing the volume available to the mobile phase compared to that of a packed column. This separation obtained in the SFC is used to separate essential oils into different chemical classes such as non-polars, ethers, alcohols. Separated chemical classes are re-injected on-line by use of a modulator into a fast, second dimension, temperature programmed GC to effect separation of individual compounds based on their volatility. The entire sample is analysed by both the SFC and GC in such a way that the resolution obtained in the first dimension is conserved by the GC analyses. By using a range of standards, some of the peaks in these oils could be assigned. The identification of compounds was greatly aided by the combination of the two separation dimensions. The comprehensive two-dimensional technique arranges component peaks in a plane from which chemical class and volatility information of each component is readily obtained. The elution pattern within the two-dimensional chromatograms may also be used for direct comparison of oils without identification of the components in the essential oils.

The effect of oil on pressure drop was found to be most profound at high vapor qualities where the local oil mass fractions are the highest. An analytical model for the annular flow pattern to estimate the <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> was developed. According to the analysis of CO 2 and oil flow in the suction line, the interfacial friction factor should be expressed as the function of CO 2 gas Reynolds number as well as the dimensionless oil film thickness.

50|$|In the full-cell process, {{the intent}} is to keep {{as much of the}} liquid absorbed into the wood during the {{pressure}} period as possible, thus leaving the maximum concentration of preservatives in the treated area. Usually, water solutions of preservative salts are employed with this process, but it is also possible to impregnate wood with <b>oil.</b> The desired <b>retention</b> is achieved by changing the strength of the solution. William Burnett patented this development in 1838 of full-cell impregnation with water solutions. The patent covered the use of zinc chloride on water basis, also known as Burnettizing. A full-cell process with oil was patented in 1838 by John Bethell. His patent described the injection of tar and oils into wood by applying pressure in closed cylinders. This process is still used today with some improvements.|$|R

40|$|The {{filtration}} efficiency of a shallow fluidized bed of silica sand has been measured at 800 DEGREESC and 1000 DEGREESC for redispersed fly ash from a fluidized combustor and char fines from the NCB fluidized gasifier. Efficiency {{is much higher}} for fly ash, because of better retention due to stronger adhesion forces, but the filtration of both dusts is limited by retention {{on the surface of}} the collector. Retention can be enhanced by addition of a liquid retention aid to the collector, or by operating under conditions where the dust is sufficiently soft to experience better adhesion. For fly ash complete retention is achieved by operating the filter at 1000 DEGREESC, near the sintering point of the ash. For gasifier fines retention is improved substantially by using heavy fuel <b>oil</b> as a <b>retention</b> aid, but further development is needed to improve efficiency towards the theoretical limit of collection...|$|R
40|$|In {{refrigeration}} systems a {{small amount}} of compressor lubricant is entrained in the refrigerant and circulated through the system, where some is retained in each component. The suction line to the compressor has the largest potential for <b>oil</b> <b>retention.</b> This paper presents results from an experimental apparatus that has been constructed to circulate POE (polyolester) oil and R 410 A at a controlled mass flux, OCR (oil in circulation ratio), and apparent superheat, and to directly measure the pressure drop and mass of oil retained in horizontal and vertical suction lines. The bulk vapor velocity and overall void fraction are determined from direct mass and temperature measurements. The <b>oil</b> <b>retention,</b> pressure drop, and flow regimes near the minimum ASHRAE recommended mass flux condition are explored. It was found that <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> begins to increase sharply even above the minimum recommended flux, so conditions near the minimum should be avoided. Two relationships were developed to predict the <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> in the vertical and horizontal suction lines. The average error from the predictions method was 10. 9 % for the vertical tube, and 7. 9 % for the horizontal tube...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} efficacy, safety, and risk factors influencing local tumor progression, following CT-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of recurrent or residual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), around iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention.</b> Materials and Methods: Sixty-four patients (M: F = 51 : 13, 65. 0 ± 8. 2 years old) with recurrent or residual HCC (75 index tumors, size = 14. 0 ± 4. 6 mm) {{had been treated}} by CT-guided RFA, using retained iodized oil as markers for targeting. The technical success, technique effectiveness rate and complications of RFA were then assessed. On pre-ablative and immediate follow-up CT after RFA, we evaluated the size of enhancing index tumors and iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention,</b> presence of abutting vessels, completeness of ablation of iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention,</b> {{and the presence of}} ablative margins greater than 5 mm. Also, the time interval between transarterial chemoembolization and RFA was assessed. The cumulative local tumor progression rate was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazards model was adopted, to clarify the independent factors affecting local tumor progression. Results: The technical success and technique effectiveness rate was 100 % and 98. 7 %, respectively. Major complications were observed in 5. 6 %. The cumulative rates of local tumor progression at 1 and 2 years were 17. 5 % and 37. 5 %, respectively. In multivariate analyses, partial ablation of the targeted iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> was the sole independent predictor of a higher local tumor progression rate. Conclusion: CT-guided RFA of HCC around iodized <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> was effective and safe. Local tumor progression can b...|$|E

40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of post {{processing}} quality loss was conducted after high pressure processing (600 MPa, 40 degrees C, 4 min) or thermal pasteurisation (80 degrees C, 60 s) of fresh Navel orange juice. Selection of processing conditions was mainly based on pectin methylesterase inactivation. Ascorbic acid loss, colour, viscosity and sensory characteristics were measured during storage at different isothermal conditions (0 - 30 degrees C). Increased shelf life (based <b>oil</b> ascorbic acid <b>retention)</b> was achieved for high pressurised compared to thermally pasteurised juice, ranging from 49 % (storage at 15 degrees C) to 112 % (storage at 0 degrees C). Activation energy values for ascorbic acid loss were 68. 5 and 53. 1 kJ/mol, respectively, for high pressurised and thermally treated juice. High pressure processing resulted in better retention of flavour of untreated juice and superior sensory characteristics compared to thermal pasteurisation. Colour change was linearly correlated to ascorbic acid loss for {{both types of}} processing. Slightly higher apparent viscosity values were determined for high pressurised juice.

40|$|The {{design of}} any system needs to {{consider}} a number of parameters according different needs. In heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems the overall efficiency, {{the reliability of the}} components, the cost and volume, and the refrigerant/oil charge are only some examples of variables that can be optimized. An important aspect is the selection of lubricants that provide the same or improved characteristics relative to traditional mineral oils. In HVAC systems, the oil exists only because the compressor requires it for lubrication and sealing. Proper oil management is necessary in order to improve the compressor reliability, increase the overall efficiency of the system, and minimize the system cost by avoiding redundancy. Several literature sources focused on oil/refrigerant properties (Thome, 1995), oil return characteristics (Biancardi et al., 1996) and oil transport phenomena (Mehendale, 1998). An analytical and experimental study of the <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> has been developed for automotive air conditioning systems using carbon dioxide (Jun-Pyo Lee, 2002). However, a general comprehensive model for <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> and oil distribution in heat pump systems using other refrigerant/oil mixtures does not exist and is of importance to future design considerations. The purpose of this thesis is to experimentally and theoretically investigate the physics of <b>oil</b> <b>retention</b> and oil transport in different components of the system. Condenser, evaporator, suction and liquid lines are studied using different pairs of refrigerant-oil mixtures. <b>Oil</b> <b>retention</b> is measured directly using an experimental apparatus, and oil film thickness is estimated. At oil mass fractions of 8 wt. %, the pressure drops increase up to 40 % in the suction line, 20 % in the evaporator and 30 % in the condenser as compared to oil-free operating conditions. New pressure drop correlations need to include this penalty factor due to <b>oil</b> <b>retention.</b> An analytical model for vapor and two-phase refrigerant flows utilizing minimal empirical data is developed. The model is able to estimate the oil distribution in the entire system providing good design guidelines for the selection of the proper refrigerant/oil mixture, the optimization of the component geometries, and the management of the oil/refrigerant charge...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{interest}} in oils and silicones as hydrophobic agents creates {{the need for}} testing, {{with the aim of}} better understanding their field performance and preparation for an eventual market entrance of these products. This study reveals the aboveground test performance of wood impregnated with epoxidised linseed oil (ELO) and organofunctional alkoxysilanes and compares the achieved results with the significantly more severe inground exposure and initial laboratory tests. Since ELO and siloxanes are not active ingredients, they were combined with fungicides for better performance. Various <b>oil</b> and alkoxysilane <b>retentions</b> and combinations with boric acid, organic fungicides, and creosote were impregnated in wood and tested. Untreated, chromium-copper-arsenate (CCA) -treated and thermally modified samples served as references. Long-term aboveground and inground testing of the studied formulations enforced the conclusion that ELO combined with biocides is suitable protective formulation for timber in both above-and in-ground exposure. Two alkoxysilanes were more effective in timber exposed aboveground.
