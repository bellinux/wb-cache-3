40|$|The essay concludes the {{analysis}} of <b>organisational</b> <b>meetings,</b> specifically focusing on forms of conflict management. Normative conflict resolution is identified as the main strategy of conflict direct management emerging in interactions. This is based on hierarchical relationships between camp directors and their staff, on the one hand, and adults who are leading the delegations {{of children and adolescents}} on the other. Most frequently, however, conflicts are avoided through withdrawals, minimisations, elusions/diversions, mitigations and postponements. Overall, the actions of directors and their staff are frequently oriented to the disempowerment of other participants, who frequently adapt to these strategies. Coordination and mediation characterising empowering dialogue are not frequent in conflict management, although some interesting dialogic actions are highlighted...|$|R

40|$|Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc), or scleroderma, is {{a chronic}} multisystem autoimmune disorder characterised by thickening and fibrosis {{of the skin}} and by the involvement of internal organs such as the lungs, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. Because there is no cure, feasibly-implemented and easily accessible evidence-based interventions to improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are needed. Due {{to a lack of}} evidence, however, specific recommendations have not been made regarding non-pharmacological interventions (e. g. behavioural/psychological, educational, physical/occupational therapy) to improve HRQoL in SSc. The Scleroderma Patient-centred Intervention Network (SPIN) was recently organised to address this gap. SPIN is comprised of patient representatives, clinicians, and researchers from Canada, the USA, and Europe.

40|$|This book {{explores the}} {{meanings}} of educational interactions which aim to promote peace and positive relationships. This analysis is based on theories of communication and active participation in education systems, in particular in intercultural settings. The book investigates the cultural presuppositions of dialogues which can empower participants’ expressions in interactions through the management of discussions and conflicts. These presuppositions are observed {{in the use of}} language in participants’ narratives and interactions. The book draws on the fine-grained analysis of a large corpus of questionnaires, interviews and videotaped interactions collected in 12 camps promoted by CISV (Children’s International Summer Villages), an international organisation which is active in 70 countries. The analysis encompasses both <b>organisational</b> <b>meetings</b> and educational activities involving adults, children and adolescents of several nationalities, and shows the importance of the different ways in which the adults who coordinate these meetings and activities act and use language. These different ways of acting in interactions can promote both empowering dialogues and disempowering monologues, with important consequences for the fulfilment of educational purposes.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. To most woven textiles, retail value is added through the twin processes of dyeing and colourprinting for short runs (e. g. 100 - 150 metres) vat dyeing may add as much as, £ 5 /metre and screen-printing a repeat pattern as much as £ 2. 50 to £ 5 per metre (Angela Hamilton of Stead McAlpine 2005, pers comm., 20 October). In the current globalised textile and clothing industry, {{as a result of}} cheap imports from China and the Far East, the UK's screen and rotary printing industries are facing annihilation, their current printing methods unable to meet market requirements, i. e. short delivery times, quick response to changing design, colour and cloth, elimination of inventory holding, mass customisation, and deferment of coloration to the completed garment stage. The present doctoral research accepts the challenge to the UK's archaic fabric printing technology by suggesting an alternative route of dye uptake and surface design. The study is guided by the following research problem: How might lasers/intense pulsed light radiation be used to increase the uptake of dye at the surface of a fabric weave, while minimising the potential degradation in a particular fibre? The problem is resolved through five main questions and two distinct methodologies. The section comprising Questions 1 to 4 successfully investigates (a) pyrolysis in natural and man-made fibres in the course of laser-marking, (b) surface heating of a fabric weave without impairing fabric strength, (c) computer-aided transfer of artwork to the laser-marking program: specifically, how tonal images may be encoded in a limited palette of grey tones; and (d) the laser-marking process, generating interaction between dye and fibre through selective absorption of a single wavelength of radiation. An experimental scientific method is employed to calibrate all findings. The fifth research question examines how these scientifically monitored findings might be applied in commercial garment production. Collaboration was set up between `haute couture' designers and a laser machinery manufacturer, in which the author's intermediary role put to the test her theoretical and practical experience of design and lasers. The process of collaboration were closely monitored, and raw data in the form of <b>organisational</b> <b>meeting</b> talk, annotated drawings, laser-marked fabric samples, have been analysed using the `Framework' method. Based on this research, future investigations will aim to (a) explore the selective absorption of a single wavelength of radiation by dye, fibre and dye liquor, (b) investigate the tonal marking of a 4 -colour design on dyed impregnated fabrics, and (c) explore niche market strategy in a wide spectrum of collaboration between industry and `haute couture'...|$|E

40|$|This thesis, 'Living with HIV/AIDS: An {{ethnography}} of care in Western Kenya', {{is based}} upon 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork carried out in Central Nyanza, Kenya, between 2005 - 2007. It studies practices of care {{against the backdrop of}} the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which has impacted the region severely. The thesis explores how home and hospital are established as domains of care through practice. It draws upon ethnographic material collected from within a District Hospital, a Community-Based Organisation and people's homes. The thesis follows practices of care across divergent domains of social life to consider how practices of care within Luo networks of kinship and relatedness intersect with governmental interventions to manage HIV/AIDS. The thesis describes two governmental projects introduced to administer HIV/AIDS care in this region. It considers Home-Based Care, an HIV/AIDS response in which Community Health Workers are trained to support particular aspects of care at home, focusing on the practices of care employed by Community Health Workers as they visit sick people at home and attend <b>organisational</b> <b>meetings.</b> The thesis also describes the landscape of HIV care in the District Hospital, including the delivery of antiretroviral therapy. The focus here is on the relationships between caring practices in the hospital and at home, and the divergent responsibilities to care experienced by hospital staff and family members. The main argument of the thesis is that care is a particularly useful analytical tool for anthropology because practices of care take place across many different domains of social life, cutting across the boundaries that have formed the traditional focus of anthropological study. Studying practices of care illuminates the production of bounded domains of social life whilst simultaneously drawing attention to similarities of practice across different domains. Care provides a way of understanding the complex social landscape that has developed as people in Western Kenya endeavour to live with HIV/AIDS.

40|$|Abstract Background Depression {{and related}} {{disorders}} represent {{a significant part}} of general practitioners (GPs) daily work. Implementing the evidence about what works for depression care into routine practice presents a challenge for researchers and service designers. The emerging consensus is that the transfer of efficacious interventions into routine practice is strongly linked to how well the interventions are based upon theory and take into account the contextual factors of the setting into which they are to be transferred. We set out to develop a conceptual framework to guide change and the implementation of best practice depression care in the primary care setting. Methods We used a mixed method, observational approach to gather data about routine depression care in a range of primary care settings via: audit of electronic health records; observation of routine clinical care; and structured, facilitated whole of organisation meetings. Audit data were summarised using simple descriptive statistics. Observational data were collected using field notes. <b>Organisational</b> <b>meetings</b> were audio taped and transcribed. All the data sets were grouped, by organisation, and considered as a whole case. Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) was identified as an analytical theory to guide the conceptual framework development. Results Five privately owned primary care organisations (general practices) and one community health centre took part over the course of 18 months. We successfully developed a conceptual framework for implementing an effective model of depression care based on the four constructs of NPT: coherence, which proposes that depression work requires the conceptualisation of boundaries of who is depressed and who is not depressed and techniques for dealing with diffuseness; cognitive participation, which proposes that depression work requires engagement with a shared set of techniques that deal with depression as a health problem; collective action, which proposes that agreement is reached about how care is organised; and reflexive monitoring, which proposes that depression work requires agreement about how depression work will be monitored at the patient and practice level. We describe how these constructs can be used to guide the design and implementation of effective depression care in a way that can take account of contextual differences. Conclusions Ideas about what is required for an effective model and system of depression care in primary care need to be accompanied by theoretically informed frameworks that consider how these can be implemented. The conceptual framework we have presented can be used to guide organisational and system change to develop common language around each construct between policy makers, service users, professionals, and researchers. This shared understanding across groups is fundamental to the effective implementation of change in primary care for depression. </p...|$|R

40|$|Despite their pervasiveness and {{significance}} in everyday <b>organisational</b> life, <b>meetings</b> have received comparatively little serious academic attention as organisational phenomena. This paper argues that studying meetings as strategizing episodes {{can add to}} our understanding of the social dynamics of shaping strategy. Drawing on Hendry and Seidl’s (2003) theoretical framework of strategizing episodes as micro-evolutionary mechanisms in the strategy process and based on empirical data of 51 strategic-level meeting observations, the paper elucidates the episodic nature of strategic meetings in shaping organizational strategy. In line with perspectives on strategy as a social practice, our study examines meetings as they occur within and contribute to the social dynamics of shaping an organization’s strategic orientations. The findings make three main contributions. First, they contribute to the strategy-as-practice research agenda by explaining how the conduct of meetings is related to consequential strategic outcomes, such as stabilization or change within an organization’s strategy. Second, they generate an empirically-informed taxonomy that shows how serial meetings link to each other, how topics are connected between these meetings, and how meetings have an impact upon wider organizational activities. Third, this taxonomy conceptually extends Hendry and Seidl’s (2003) framework by explaining the way different types of meetings shape the micro-evolutionary path tha...|$|R
40|$|Contribution to {{catalogue}} for related exhibition: Antonio Manuel, {{curated by}} Claudia Calirman. Notorious amongst Antonio Manuel's {{work of the}} 1960 s are the Flans (Flongs, or Stereotype Moldes). These were produced using high and low relief matrices for the printing process of newspaper pages, over which the artist applied paint. The actual process of production involved a semi-clandestine access to the newspaper’s printing workshop, leading eventually to interference in certain runs of the newspaper itself. The portrayal of ‘common people’ had been a widespread theme in Brazilian modern art and its re-emergence in the 1960 s could {{be considered as a}} project of demythication of prevailing associations with the ethnic composition of the nation. Antonio Manuel’s infatuation with the ordinariness of the human condition can be remarked in his early expressive drawing technique that recalls, in its repetitiveness, and its simple outlines, Dubuffet’s faux-naive paintings. These drawings developed into the Flan series where the work becomes inextricably associated with the newspaper’s content and process of production. As a result, visual interferences within the newspaper layout became increasingly economical as whole sections were allowed to become legible or visible, with particular emphasis being given to news items covering the violence perpetrated by the state on ordinary people. Shortly after Nova Objetividade Brasileira, Antonio Manuel participated in Apocalipopótese, an open air ‘happening’ at the Aterro do Flamengo landfill area that took place in 1968 on the eve of AI 5. The event, named as a consideration of the hypothesis of apocalypse, gathered a diverse group of artists including, Oiticica, Rogerio Duarte, Lygia Pape, dancers from the favela of Mangueira samba school, among others. Prior to the event, <b>organisational</b> <b>meetings</b> were held at Oiticica’s house where Antonio Manuel and Rogério Duarte discussed a possible collaboration. They proposed building a structure entitled Cabine do Amor (Love-hut) where the viewer would enter and through gaps in the wooden structure, see images of bodies projected within another compartment. A fascination with the relation between inside and outside and an engagement with the viewer as active participant within the work become at this moment key issues for Antonio Manuel. According to the artist, the actual structure had already been constructed by Oiticica but Duarte’s other commitments disrupted the project. Antonio Manuel developed an alternative project that involved around 20 wooden boxes of simple construction each containing images, newspaper cut-outs, poems and slogans. As the boxes were sealed, their content could only be revealed through a destructive act. The artist was interested in the revelation of their content by the public but admits being surprised by the violence demonstrated towards these boxes. They were named Urnas-Quentes, which translate literally into English as Hot-Ballot-Boxes...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from the {{publisher}} via the DOI in this record. BACKGROUND: Bullying refers to verbal, physical or psychological aggression repeated over time that is intended to cause harm or distress to the victims who are unable to defend themselves. It is a key public health priority owing to its widespread prevalence in schools and harmful short- and long-term effects on victims' well-being. There is a need to strengthen the evidence base by testing innovative approaches to preventing bullying. KiVa is a school-based bullying prevention programme with universal and indicated elements and an emphasis on changing bystander behaviour. It achieved promising results in a large trial in Finland, and now requires testing in other countries. This paper describes the protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of KiVa in Wales. METHODS/DESIGN: The study uses a two-arm waitlist control pragmatic definitive parallel group cluster RCT design with an embedded process evaluation and calculation of unit cost. Participating schools will be randomised a using a 1 : 1 ratio to KiVa plus usual provision (intervention group) or usual provision only (control group). The trial has one primary outcome, child self-reported victimisation from bullying, dichotomised as 'victimised' (bullied at least twice a month in the last couple of months) versus 'not victimised'. Secondary outcomes are: bullying perpetration; aspects of child social and emotional well-being (including emotional problems, conduct, peer relations, prosocial behaviour); and school attendance. Follow-up is at 12 months post-baseline. Implementation fidelity is measured through teacher-completed lesson records and independent school-wide observation. A micro-costing analysis will determine the costs of implementing KiVa, including recurrent and non-recurrent unit costs. Factors related to the scalability of the programme will be examined in interviews with head teachers and focus groups with key stakeholders in the implementation of school-based bullying interventions. DISCUSSION: The results from this trial will provide evidence on whether the KiVa programme is transportable from Finland to Wales in terms of effectiveness and implementation. It will provide information about the costs of delivery and generate insights into factors related to the scalability of the programme.

This paper {{reports on}} some of the {{recently}} completed work of the EU-supported Prisma project examining the best of e-government experience across Europe in relation to technology, <b>organisational</b> change and <b>meeting</b> the needs of the user (citizens and business). Future work of Prisma involves developing scenarios of change over the next ten years, building future-oriented best practice models and providing comprehensible and useful tools for practitioners and researchers to guide their decision making and research priorities respectively. Apart from examining e-government and e-governance generally, Prisma is also examining six service areas in detail: administrations, health, persons with special needs (the disabled and elderly), environment, transport and tourism. 1 Context and drivers of change in government and governance The importance of government is clear. Not only are we all dependent upon its services and the framework of law, peace and stability it provides, but in Europe it also contributes 40 % of GDP. Over the past few years, however, the concepts of government and governance have been dramatically transformed. Not only is this due t...|$|R
40|$|Key {{performance}} indicators (KPIs) {{are used to}} identify where <b>organisational</b> performance is <b>meeting</b> desired standards and where performance requires improvement. Valid and reliable KPIs depend {{on the availability of}} high-quality data, specifically, the relevant minimum data set (MDS; the core data identified as the minimum required to measure performance for a KPI) elements. However, the feasibility of collecting the relevant MDS elements is always a limitation of performance monitoring using KPIs. Preferably, data should be integrated into service delivery, and where additional data are required that are not currently collected as part of routine service delivery, there should be an economic evaluation to determine the cost of data collection. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesise the evidence base concerning the costs of data collection in hospitals for performance monitoring using KPIs, and to identify hospital data collection systems that have proven to be cost minimising.

40|$|Both the {{production}} {{and the use of}} official statistics are important in the business of government. In New Zealand, concern persists about many government advisors’ low level of statistical capability. One programme designed specifically to enhance capability is New Zealand’s National Certificate of Official Statistics, first introduced in 2007 and originally targeted at government policy analysts and advisors. It now includes participants from many agencies, including the National Statistics Office. The competency-based 40 -credit certificate comprises four taught units that aim to give students skills in basic official statistics and in critically evaluating statistical, research, policy, or media publications for their quality (of data, survey design, analysis, and conclusions) and appropriateness for some policy issue (e. g., how to reduce problem gambling), together with an ‘umbrella’ workplace-based statistics project. Case studies are used to embed the statistics learning into the real-world context of these students. Several surveys of students and their managers were undertaken {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the certificate in terms of enhancing skill levels and <b>meeting</b> <b>organisational</b> needs and also to examine barriers to completion of the certificate. The results were used to both modify the programme and extend its international applicability...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Building {{long-term}} customer relationships through {{customer satisfaction}} {{is one of}} the crucial keys to successful marketing including internet marketing. An organisation exists to satisfy customer wants and needs while <b>meeting</b> <b>organisational</b> objectives of increased sales and higher profit. The Internet is now firmly established as a new marketing tool. Marketers use the Internet to gather data for marketing planning. The Net has become an integral piece of the marketing mix, spawning new products and serving as both a digital distribution channel and an electronic storefront. Malaysians have not yet fully appreciated the benefits of Internet marketing in bringing increased customer satisfaction. However, this study indicates that there is a positive trend in increasing awareness of the benefits of Internet marketing. Some of them such as global access and the 24 -hour availability of the Internet, convenience, increase product information, and the availability of special services in the Internet were recognised as ways of enhancing customer satisfaction. One significant obstacle expressed by the respondents in this research was the fear of payment in security in the Internet. The time for rapid development in Internet marketing has come. It is inevitable that more and more businesses are and will be going online. The question in everyone’s mind is, “Will Internet marketing bring increased customer satisfaction, and hence, increased sales and profitability? ” The objective of this research is aimed at studying how Malaysians view Internet marketing in comparison with traditional marketing as a tool in building long-term customer relationships through customer satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} aimed at identifying {{the sources of}} influence on undergraduate students' satisfaction and academic performance at university. Preliminary findings showed that students' experiences at university were characterised {{by the quality of}} academic and pastoral support available, the extent to which their degree programme equipped them with the skills to succeed in life beyond university, their relationship with peers and the quality of their social life, their perception of the workload, anxiety while meeting academic challenges and motivation to succeed at university. Students' satisfaction was determined by {{the extent to which they}} felt that they received a good quality of teaching and support for personal problems, happiness with the degree programme, good relations with peers, an opportunity to think creatively and independently about the subject being studied, availability of study materials and the acquisition of skills that made them employable. Academic performance was predicted by the extent to which they were motivated to do well on their course, their <b>organisational</b> skills while <b>meeting</b> deadlines and not feeling overloaded by the academic demands on their course. An absence of distractions such as extracurricular activities and events in one's personal life, a positive perception of one's own academic ability in relation to peers, perfectionism, enhanced focussed when stressed, experience of multiple choice exams and having members of family who had attended university all correlated positively with performance while a positive perception of Blackboard and working only hard enough to obtain the sought degree class correlated negatively with performance. Higher A-level grades and attendance at a Comprehensive school were also associated with better academic performance. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
