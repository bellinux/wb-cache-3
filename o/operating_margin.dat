30|$|In this paper, we {{classify}} firms {{into four}} groups {{according to the}} values of <b>operating</b> profit <b>margin</b> and asset turnover each year. We identify the group of firms with higher <b>operating</b> profit <b>margins</b> and lower asset turnover as firms that adopt a product differentiation strategy and the ones with lower <b>operating</b> profit <b>margins</b> and higher asset turnover as firms with a cost leadership strategy. The <b>operating</b> profit <b>margin</b> is measured as operating profit divided by operating income (OPROF), while asset turnover is measured as operating income divided by average net fixed assets (ATURN). We also argue that the strategic positions should be persistent over years. If firms change strategy, their R&D spending likely change as well.|$|R

We find that nonprofit hospitals' medical service provision systematically varies by market mix. We find no significant effect of market mix on the <b>operating</b> <b>margins</b> of nonprofit hospitals, but find that for-profit hospitals have higher margins in markets with more for-profits.

40|$|ObjectiveEndovascular {{aneurysm}} repair (EVAR) {{is associated}} with significant direct device costs. Such costs place EVAR at odds with efforts to constrain healthcare expenditures. This study examines the procedure-associated costs and <b>operating</b> <b>margins</b> associated with EVAR at a tertiary care academic medical center. MethodsAll infrarenal EVARs performed from April 2011 to March 2012 were identified (n = 127). Among this cohort, 49 patients met standard commercial instruction for use guidelines, were treated using a single manufacturer device, and billed to Medicare diagnosis-related group (DRG) 238. Of these 49 patients, net technical <b>operating</b> <b>margins</b> (technical revenue minus technical cost) were calculated {{in conjunction with the}} hospital finance department. EVAR implant costs were determined for each procedure. DRG 238 -associated costs and length of stay were benchmarked against other academic medical centers using University Health System Consortium 2012 data. ResultsAmong the studied EVAR cohort (age 75, 82 % male, mean length of stay, 1. 7  days), mean technical costs totaled $ 31, 672. Graft implants accounted for 52 % of the allocated technical costs. Institutional overhead was 17 % ($ 5495) of total technical costs. Net mean total technical EVAR-associated <b>operating</b> <b>margins</b> were −$ 4015 per procedure. Our institutional costs and length of stay, when benchmarked against comparable centers, remained in the lowest quartile nationally using University Health System Consortium costs for DRG 238. Stent graft price did not correlate with total EVAR market share. ConclusionsEVAR is currently associated with significant negative <b>operating</b> <b>margins</b> among Medicare beneficiaries. Currently, device costs account for over 50 % of EVAR-associated technical costs and did not impact EVAR market share, reflecting an unawareness of cost differential among surgeons. These data indicate that EVAR must undergo dramatic care delivery redesign for this practice to remain sustainable...|$|R
