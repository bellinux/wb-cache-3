5|$|The {{music played}} at coronations has been {{primarily}} classical and religiously inspired. Much of the choral music uses texts from the Bible {{which have been}} used at coronations since King Edgar's coronation at Bath in 973 and are known as coronation anthems. In the coronations following the Reformation, court musicians, often the Master of the King's Music, were commissioned to compose new settings for the traditional texts. The most frequently used piece is Zadok the Priest by George Frideric Handel; one of four anthems commissioned from him for GeorgeII's coronation in 1727. It has featured in every coronation since, an achievement unparalleled by any <b>other</b> <b>piece.</b> Previous settings of the same text were composed by Henry Lawes for the 1661 coronation of CharlesII and Thomas Tomkins for CharlesI in 1621.|$|E
25|$|Davenport {{translated}} ancient Greek texts, {{particularly from}} the archaic period. These were published in periodicals, then small volumes, and finally collected in 7 Greeks.

50|$|Apart from these, {{reliable}} {{estimates are}} not be well established for many <b>other</b> <b>pieces.</b> Even {{when the same}} game format is assumed (board size and combination of <b>other</b> <b>pieces),</b> there is often little agreement on the specific value of many <b>other</b> <b>pieces.</b> Compound pieces are sometimes approximated as the sum of their component pieces, or estimated to be slightly higher due to synergistic effects (such {{as it is for}} the archbishop and chancellor).|$|R

25|$|The janus is {{the only}} piece in this game which is able to checkmate the opponent's king without the {{assistance}} of any <b>other</b> <b>piece,</b> if the king is {{in a corner and}} the janus is two squares away on a diagonal, but this checkmate cannot be forced. This chess variant has been popular in places such as Europe. Several chess grandmasters have played this game including Viktor Korchnoi, Péter Lékó and Artur Yusupov.|$|E
25|$|Hennepin County {{claimed that}} {{accepting}} the price set by an eminent domain judge {{was not an}} option for them, due to the infrastructure cap. Any additional money needed for the land would have to come out of some <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> of infrastructure. If the price set by a judge came in over their budget, they would have no funds to pay, and the project could collapse. But eminent domain did offer them the advantage of getting started on construction while working out the details of the land price later.|$|E

500|$|The prelude's central idea takes {{after its}} title – {{a girl with}} golden hair in a {{pastoral}} setting in Scotland. [...] Thus, {{it is one of}} many examples of Debussy's Impressionist music, since it conjures up images of a foreign place. [...] His utilization of pentatonic scales throughout the piece achieves this, and by blending this in with harmonizing diatonic chords and modal cadences, he creates a folk-like tune. [...] This prelude uses more plagal leading tones than any <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> composed by Debussy, and the prelude's melody alternates between conjunct and disjunct movement throughout.|$|E
500|$|In the {{introduction}} to Slavery by Another Name, Blackmon describes {{his experience as a}} reporter for the Wall Street Journal [...] "asking a provocative question: What would be revealed if American corporations were examined through the same sharp lens of historical confrontation as the one then being trained on German corporations that relied on Jewish slave labor during World War II and the Swiss banks that robbed victims of the Holocaust of their fortunes?" [...] His story describing corporate use of black forced labor in the post-Civil War South generated more response than any <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> he had written, and inspired him to pursue a book-length study of the subject (see Reconstruction Era).|$|E

500|$|Although mostly {{occupied}} with Thunderbird 6 and Doppelgänger, Derek Meddings briefly reprised {{his role as}} head of special effects to construct Professor McClaine's Jet Air Car. The design concept was a disappointment to Anderson, who commented: [...] "The car looked like no <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> of hardware we had had previously but I was wary of canning it as I feared I might be becoming stereotyped. Maybe {{the whole thing was}} becoming a bit narrow; all the ideas were becoming similar." [...] Stephen La Rivière, writer of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, views the Jet Air Car as an update of Supercar, the vehicle that appeared in Anderson's 1961 series of the same name, but agrees that while the Jet Air Car is the [...] "star vehicle" [...] of Joe 90, it is visually unappealing in comparison to the [...] "beautiful, sleek design of its predecessor." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, {{art critic}} Camille Paglia praised {{the film in}} Glittering Images, {{comparing}} some of its scenes to works by modern painters and calling it [...] "the greatest work of art in recent memory". Paglia explained that the film's finale, [...] "has more inherent artistic value, emotional power, and global impact than anything by the artists you name. It's because the art world has flat-lined and become an echo chamber of received opinion and toxic over-praise. It's like the emperor's new clothes -- people are too intimidated to admit what they secretly think or what they might think with their blinders off. Episode III epitomizes the modern digital art movement, more so than <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> from the last 30 years. I had considered using Japanese anime for the digital art chapter of the book, but it lacked the overwhelming operatic power and yes, seriousness of Lucas's Revenge of the Sith." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the south}} side of town, a Confederate {{artillery}} crew led by Captain John M. Oliver struggled to find horses to move their two artillery pieces. Finally securing horses, they moved toward Main Street with their two large weapons. Captain Gilmore, from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, became aware of the artillery threat, while a small group of Confederate soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Henry Bozang rushed to protect the artillery and its crew. [...] A combined force of cavalry and infantry, led by Lieutenant Abraham from Gillmore's Company, charged through Bozang's men while the artillery crew hurriedly tried to load their weapons. The Confederate artillerists were able to fire one shot, but its main effect was to cause the horses still attached to the <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> of artillery to panic and pull it over. Before the remaining artillery piece could be reloaded, Abraham's men captured it while killing Oliver and two gunners. The remaining artillery crew fled. Lieutenant Bozang was wounded and his command surrendered.|$|E
500|$|While Hemingway {{painstakingly}} describes seemingly extraneous minutiae from Nick's fishing trip, he avoids or barely {{hints at}} {{the driving force of}} the work: the emotional turmoil wrought on Nick by his return home from a catastrophic war. Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing [...] "'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy beat to the wide coming home from the war.... beat to the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence. So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war is omitted." [...] Flora believes that in [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] the concept of the iceberg theory is more evident than in any <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> written by Hemingway.|$|E
500|$|Two more {{issues are}} {{addressed}} in the Sunday Herald article, {{but not in the}} Daily Mail article. The first is of the knots used to tie up Carol's body [...] the knots on Carol's body were mostly granny knots, of which {{there was no evidence that}} Gordon ever used [...] indeed during the trial he was specifically asked this, and he responded, [...] "I do not use granny knots". The granny knot is always a mistake, used by someone who should have used a reef knot; those learning knot-tying frequently make this mistake. Gordon Park, an experienced knot-tyer, would likely never use a granny knot, and their frequent appearance on the body of Carol is strong evidence that it was not Gordon who tied them. The article also claims that the evidence of knots was irrelevant anyway, as climbers and yachtsmen were so common in the area. The <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> of evidence related to another rock taken from the lakebed, which had supposedly come from the Parks' roof. However, the prosecution eventually admitted that Westmoreland green slate had been worked in the area for hundreds of years, and could have come from anywhere. The Herald also mentions the fact that the police files from the original missing persons inquiry into Carol Park had gone missing themselves, but does not draw any conclusions from this.|$|E

500|$|Linguistic {{amendments}} {{were also}} included; {{the line in}} the preamble emphasising that authors possessed books as they would any <b>other</b> <b>piece</b> of property was dropped, and the bill moved from something designed [...] "for Securing the Property of Copies of Books to the rightful Owners thereof" [...] to a bill [...] "for the Encouragement of Learning, by Vesting the Copies of Printed Books in the Authors or Purchasers of such Copies". Another amendment allowed anyone to own and trade in copies of books, undermining the Stationers. Other changes were made when the bill went to the House of Lords, and it was finally returned to the Commons on 5 April. The aims of the resulting statute are debated; Ronan Deazley suggests that the intent was to balance the rights of the author, publisher and public {{in such a way as}} to ensure the maximum dissemination of works, while other academics argue that the bill was intended to protect the Company's monopoly or, conversely, to weaken it. Oren Bracha, writing in the Berkeley Technology Law Journal, says that when considering which of these options are correct, [...] "the most probable answer [...] all of them". Whatever the motivations, the bill was passed on 5 April 1710, and is commonly known simply as the Statute of Anne due its passage during the reign of Queen Anne.|$|E
