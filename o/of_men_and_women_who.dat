25|$|The primary {{symptoms}} of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort {{in association with}} frequent diarrhea or constipation and a change in bowel habits. Symptoms usually are experienced as acute attacks that subside within one day, but recurrent attacks are likely. There may also be urgency for bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete evacuation (tenesmus), bloating, or abdominal distension. In some cases, the symptoms are relieved by bowel movements. People with IBS, more commonly than others, have gastroesophageal reflux, symptoms relating to the genitourinary system, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, headache, backache, and psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety. About a third <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> have IBS also report sexual dysfunction typically {{in the form of}} a reduction in libido.|$|E

He also writes there that he found written in the ancient annals of Spanish history collected by the kings of Spain that the 50,000 Jewish households then residing in the cities throughout Spain were the descendants <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were sent to Spain by the Roman Emperor and who had formerly been subjected to him and whom Titus had originally exiled from places in or around Jerusalem.

25|$|In 2004, Urban Institute economists C. Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso {{created a}} Web-based Social Security {{benefits}} calculator. The calculator {{does not include}} the value or cost of the Social Security disability program. Using this calculator it is possible to estimate net Social Security benefits (i.e., estimated lifetime benefits minus estimated lifetime FICA taxes paid) for different types of recipients. In the book Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality Joseph Fried used the calculator to create graphical depictions of the estimated net benefits <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were at different wage levels, single and married (with stay-at-home spouses), and retiring in different years. These graphs vividly show that generalizations about Social Security benefits may be of little predictive value for any given worker, due to the wide disparity of net benefits for people at different income levels and in different demographic groups. For example, the graph below (Figure 168) shows the impact of wage level and retirement date on a male worker. As income goes up, net benefits get smaller – even negative.|$|E

40|$|Consistent {{with social}} role theory's {{assumption}} that the role behavior <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> shapes gender stereotypes, earlier experiments have found that men's and women's occupancy of the same role eliminated gender-stereotypical judgments of greater agency and lower communion in men than women. The shifting standards model {{raises the question of}} whether a shift to within-sex standards in judgments <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> in roles could have masked underlying gender stereotypes. To examine this possibility, two experiments obtained judgments <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> using measures that do or do not restrain shifts to within-sex standards. This measure variation did not affect the social role pattern of smaller perceived sex differences in the presence of role information. These findings thus support the social role theory claim that designations of identical roles for subgroups <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> eliminate or reduce perceived sex differences...|$|R

It was while working with this family that Dix traveled to St. Croix, where she first witnessed slavery {{as one of the}} evils of the world. In 1831, she established a model school for girls in Boston, operating it until 1836, when she had another health breakdown. Dix was encouraged to take a trip to Europe to help aid her health by her physician. When she was there she met the other reformers who inspired her to start working on equal rights for the mentally ill. These reformers were Elizabeth Fry, Samuel Tuke and William Rathbone with whom she lived during the duration of her trip in Europe. In hopes of a cure, in 1836 she traveled to England, where she met the Rathbone family. They invited her as a guest to Greenbank, their ancestral mansion in Liverpool. The Rathbones were Quakers and prominent social reformers. At Greenbank, Dix met their circle <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> believed that government should play a direct, active role in social welfare. She was also introduced to the reform movement for care of the mentally ill in Great Britain, known as lunacy reform.
