Family therapy or education, which addresses the whole family system of an individual, may reduce relapses and hospitalizations. Evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse is minimal.

5|$|There is {{considerable}} uncertainty about which forms <b>of</b> <b>psychosocial</b> and physical treatments {{of people who}} harm themselves are most effective. Psychiatric and personality disorders are common in individuals who self-harm {{and as a result}} self-harm may be an indicator of depression and/or other psychological problems. Many people who self-harm have moderate or severe depression and therefore treatment with antidepressant medications may often be used. There is tentative evidence for the medication flupentixol; however, greater study is required before it can be recommended.|$|E

However, in 2008, a study of young people and self-harm saw the gender gap close, with 32% of young females, and 22% of young males admitting to self-harm.

FAS interferes with normal development, which may cause stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed.

25|$|Studies on {{perpetrators}} {{of domestic violence}} find that abusers have high rates of psychopathy, with the prevalence estimated to be at around 15-30%. Furthermore, the commission of domestic violence is correlated with Factor 1 of the PCL-R, which describes the emotional deficits and the callous and exploitative interpersonal style found in psychopathy. The prevalence of psychopathy among domestic abusers indicate that the core characteristics of psychopathy, such as callousness, remorselessness, {{and a lack of}} close interpersonal bonds, predispose those with psychopathy to committing domestic abuse, and suggest that the domestic abuses committed by these individuals are callously perpetrated (i.e. instrumentally aggressive) rather than a case of emotional aggression and therefore may not be amenable to the types <b>of</b> <b>psychosocial</b> interventions commonly given to domestic abuse perpetrators.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the strong}} {{association}} between awake bruxism and psychosocial factors (the relationship between sleep bruxism and psychosocial factors being unclear), the role <b>of</b> <b>psychosocial</b> interventions {{could be argued}} to be central to the management. The most simple form of treatment is therefore reassurance that the condition does not represent a serious disease, which may act to alleviate contributing stress. Other interventions include relaxation techniques, stress management, behavioural modification, habit reversal and hypnosis (self hypnosis or with a hypnotherapist). Cognitive behavioral therapy has been recommended by some for treatment of bruxism. In many cases awake bruxism can be reduced by using reminder techniques. Combined with a protocol sheet this can also help to evaluate in which situations bruxism is most prevalent.|$|E

25|$|A 2013 study {{examined}} adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences, with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys. Despite these differences, they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being {{negatively associated with}} resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting <b>of</b> <b>psychosocial</b> skills {{as a form of}} intervention. Emotional intelligence has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress and as mentioned previously, the ability to manage stress and other negative emotions can be preventative of a victim going on to perpetuate aggression. One factor that is important in resilience is the regulation of one’s own emotions. Schneider et al. (2013) found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and Emotional Understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect.|$|E
25|$|Occupational health {{psychology}} (OHP) is {{an interdisciplinary}} area of psychology that {{is concerned with}} {{the health and safety of}} workers. OHP addresses a number of major topic areas including the impact of occupational stressors on physical and mental health, the impact of involuntary unemployment on physical and mental health, work-family balance, workplace violence and other forms of mistreatment, accidents and safety, and interventions designed to improve/protect worker health. OHP emerged from two distinct disciplines within applied psychology, namely, health psychology and industrial and organizational psychology, as well as occupational medicine. OHP has also been informed by other disciplines including industrial sociology, industrial engineering, and economics, as well as preventive medicine and public health. OHP {{is concerned with the}} relationship <b>of</b> <b>psychosocial</b> workplace factors to the development, maintenance, and promotion of workers' health and that of their families. Thus the field's focus is work-related factors that can lead to injury, disease, and distress.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{factors in}} health had been studied {{since the early}} 20th century by {{disciplines}} such as psychosomatic medicine and later behavioral medicine, but these were primarily branches of medicine, not psychology. Health psychology began to emerge as a distinct discipline of psychology in the United States in the 1970s. In the mid-20th century there was a growing understanding in medicine {{of the effect of}} behavior on health. For example, the Alameda County Study, which began in the 1960s, showed that people who ate regular meals (e.g., breakfast), maintained a healthy weight, received adequate sleep, did not smoke, drank little alcohol, and exercised regularly were in better health and lived longer. In addition, psychologists and other scientists were discovering relationships between psychological processes and physiological ones. These discoveries include {{a better understanding of the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>psychosocial</b> stress on the cardiovascular and immune systems, and the early finding that the functioning of the immune system could be altered by learning.|$|E

25|$|Because Music has {{the ability}} to access {{multiple}} parts of the brain, music therapy is highly effective in providing therapeutic support for individuals with all types of dementia. Research indicates that the sections of the brain weakened by dementia can be supported and in some cases strengthened by other areas of the brain through musical activities. Musical ability and awareness {{is also one of the}} last functions to be compromised in an individual with dementia, which makes it an especially effective intervention, even in people with very late stage forms of the disease. Music therapy is more than simply listening to or playing music. Through the use of evidence based interventions and clinical assessments, a music therapist works to improve the lives and abilities of individuals. These interventions can decrease anxiety, improve speech and self- expression, and a decrease in negative behaviors and isolation which are commonly found in individuals with dementia. Common negative behaviors that correspond with dementia are depression and agitation. According to Mary S. Mittelman, the director <b>of</b> <b>psychosocial</b> research at Langone Medical Center, music therapy helped to decrease both of these negative substantially. The reason for this is because in the brain, the parts corresponding to music are preserved even through the effects of dementia. Due to these being preserved, residents who live their lives in a blur find some clarity and familiarity through music, creating lower levels of stress and agitation.|$|E
