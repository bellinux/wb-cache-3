5|$|The Grand Commandant (also {{known as}} the Commander-in-Chief) was the head {{commander}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> Western Han, yet his office was irregularly filled (from 205–202 BC, from 196–195 BC, from 189–177 BC, from 154–150 BC, and in 140 BC). After 119 BC, the generals Huo Qubing (d. 117 BC) and Wei Qing (d. 106 BC) simultaneously held the title until their deaths, but when the post was revived in 87 BC it became politicized when conferred as a regent's title for Huo Guang (d. 68 BC). The regent was thus {{considered one of the}} Three Excellencies, although he was not technically part of the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|During the 1800s, Nadars, then an {{aspiring}} business community, established their commercial {{base in the}} town. By {{the end of the}} 19th century, the Nadars’ rapid rise as a business community and pursuit for higher social status caused resentment in higher castes. The mutual confrontation between the Maravars and Nadars reached its peak in 1899, leading to a series of riots which became known as the Sivakasi riots. A total of 22 people were killed, as many as 800 houses and the Big Chariot {{in the center of the}} city (used by the temple during festivals) were burnt during the riots. Eventually the riots came to an end after the intervention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> mid-July 1899.|$|E

5|$|From a {{military}} standpoint, the Portuguese regular army held {{the upper hand}} during the conflict against the independentist guerrilla forces. Nonetheless, Mozambique succeeded in achieving independence on June 25, 1975, after a civil resistance movement known as the Carnation Revolution backed by portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> Portugal overthrow the military dictatorship sponsored by US, thus ending 470 years of Portuguese colonial rule in the East African region. According to historians of the Revolution, the military coup in Portugal was in part fuelled by protests concerning the conduct of Portuguese troops in their treatment of some local Mozambican populace. The role of the growing communist influence over the group of Portuguese military insurgents who led the Lisbon's military coup, and, on the other hand, {{the pressure of the}} international community over the direction of the Portuguese Colonial War in general, were main causes for the final outcome.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{conscription}} and {{the drive}} to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of industrial unrest over time. Many workers were required to work long hours in poor conditions and {{were not able to}} change their employment due to the manpower laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' standards of living. As a result, strikes and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military.</b> <b>In</b> May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful industrial action to be conscripted into the military, but this had little impact due to the shortage of skilled labour in the industries most prone to industrial disputes.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to provide for their retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of violence as a means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E

5|$|Southsea is {{dominated}} by Southsea Common, a grassland covering an area of , which was first created by draining the marshland alongside {{the construction of the}} vapour baths in 1820. The common owes its existence to the demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> the early 19th century for a clear range of fire. The present day common lies parallel to the shore from Clarence Pier to Southsea Castle. Today, the common is a popular recreation ground, and also a venue for a number of annual events, which includes carnivals, Christmas markets, and Victorian festivals. The common also has a large collection of mature elm trees, believed to be the oldest and largest surviving in Hampshire, which have escaped Dutch elm disease owing to their isolation. Other plants include the Canary Island date palms Phoenix canariensis, which are some of the largest in Britain and have produced viable seed in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The mandate was {{dissolved}} in 1946 {{because of a}} British ultimatum to France, and Syria became an independent country on 17 April 1946. The same elite that had governed Syria during the mandate continued in power and they governed in the same manner. The failure in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War led to {{the downfall of the}} traditional elite and the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> politics. Husni al-Za'im became the first military dictator of Syria in 1949, but in 1950, military officer Adib Shishakli gained power behind the scenes, and by 1953 had established another military dictatorship. The military's introduction to the Syrian political scene destroyed the oligarchy enabling the middle class to participate in Syrian politics. However, while their powers were weakened, the traditional elite retained the majority of the wealth produced.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to drug smuggling, Noriega's associates such as Floyd Carlton and Cesar Rodríguez also eventually {{became involved with}} money laundering: large sums from drug revenues were brought in from Miami and elsewhere to Panama for laundering, and Noriega received protection payments in these instances as well. American Steven Kalish also began a large scale business selling drugs, laundering money and selling hardware to the Panamanian military for large profits with Noriega's assistance. Dinges writes that in {{at the time of}} the 1984 election, Kalish was preparing to ship a load of marijuana worth U.S. $1.4 million through Panama, for which Noriega had agreed to provide false Panamanian customs stamps to help it avoid scrutiny in the U.S.; Noriega was to be payed $1 million for this exercise. However, beginning in 1984 Noriega appeared to reduce the scale of his operations, and even ordered a raid against a cocaine factory in the interior of Panama, a raid which he then emphasized as evidence of his cooperation with the U.S. in their fight against drugs. He also ordered a crackdown on money laundering by the Colombian cartel. Noriega's new image was symbolized by his being invited as a speaker in 1985 to Harvard University, for a conference on the role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> Central America's wars, a speech which received a lot of attention in Panama's pro-government press.|$|E

25|$|Due {{to public}} fears {{concerning}} the deployment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> domestic matters, Robert Peel organised the force along civilian lines, rather than paramilitary. To appear neutral, the uniform was deliberately manufactured in blue, rather than red {{which was then}} a military colour, along with the officers being armed only with a wooden truncheon and a rattle to signal the need for assistance. Along with this, police ranks did not include military titles, {{with the exception of}} Sergeant.|$|E

25|$|Vice President Omar Suleiman, who {{announced}} Mubarak's resignation in February 2011, handed {{power to the}} Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Egypt came under martial law as top generals led by Mohamed Hussein Tantawi began directing Egypt toward democratic elections.

The Muslim Brotherhood emerged as a leading voice in criticizing military rule.|$|E
25|$|Concurrently, the Soviet Union {{began to}} retreat from {{building}} world communism under Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika policies, marking a dramatic reduction in aid to Ethiopia from Socialist Bloc countries. This resulted in more economic hardship and the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>in</b> the face of determined onslaughts by guerrilla forces in the north. The collapse of socialism in general, and in Eastern Europe during the revolutions of 1989, coincided with the Soviet Union stopping aid to Ethiopia altogether in 1990. The strategic outlook for Mengistu quickly deteriorated.|$|E
