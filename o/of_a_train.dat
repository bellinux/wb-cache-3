5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, McClellan became active in politics, supporting the presidential campaign of Democrat Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 election. He claimed to have defeated an attempt at vote fraud by Republicans by ordering the delay <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> that was carrying men to vote illegally in another county, enabling Douglas to win the county.|$|E
5|$|At 11:30am, March 27, {{recognizing}} {{his description}} from a newspaper story, the engineer and brakeman <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train,</b> from Philadelphia to Jersey City, crossing the Hackensack Bridge, spotted Jackalow running towards the woods. First two, then eight, New Jersey police officers {{went into the}} woods after him. Around noon, Jackalow was turned away from crossing a railroad bridge, then under construction in Newark, New Jersey, by workman William Jacobus, who recognized Jackalow. His colleague Henry Wilson mentioned a $1000 reward for Jackalow's arrest, and the pair—joined by John Sanford and John Douglass, and aided by a spy glass—spotted Jackalow heading for the Newark Plank Road. Jacobus and Douglass pursued Jackalow, while Wilson and Sanford took the car to Newark, hired a horse, {{and set out to}} intercept him on the road.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We {{propose a}} {{framework}} for an Intelligent Tutoring System to support instructors in the design <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>training.</b> This requires the partial capture of Instructional Design theories, which define processes for the creation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>training</b> and outline methods of instruction. Our architecture {{is based on a}} knowledge representation that is based on the use of ontologies. Reasoning based on Description Logics supports the modelling of knowledge, the retrieval of suitable teaching methods, and the validation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>training.</b> <b>A</b> small exemplary ontology is used to demonstrate the kind of Instructional Design knowledge that can be captured in our approach. ...|$|R

5|$|Brother Justin Crowe is {{introduced}} as a devoted Methodist minister, who {{is supported by}} his sister Iris. On a self-discovery trip {{in the middle of}} the first season, Brother Justin has an elaborate vision of two Russian immigrant children, Irina and her younger brother Alexei; Irina talks of her evil father. As revealed shortly afterwards, this vision is a repressed memory of Brother Justin of him and Iris as the only survivors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> accident which also cost their mother's life. Reverend Norman Balthus later saved Irina and Alexei and raised them in a church orphanage. A vision prompts Brother Justin to get his chest tattooed early in the second season.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, {{the first}} {{proposal}} was launched {{for using a}} bus service {{as an alternative to}} the train. This was rejected because buses were not able to give the comfort and reliability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train.</b> The idea was proposed again in 1922 by the director of the Norwegian Public Roads Administration. Among the strongest opponents to the bus alternative was Ingolf Elster Christensen, County Governor of Sogn og Fjordane and later parliamentarian, who stated that the Nordre Bergenhus County (today Sogn og Fjordane County Municipality) had paid part of the regional financing of the Bergen Line on condition that they receive a branch line to the Sognefjord.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NSB {{decided that they}} would replace the {{intercity}} trains with the Class 73 tilting multiple unit, and the locomotives for loco-hauled trains with the Swiss-designed El 18 (also with electric equipment from ABB, former BBC). In 1997, no. 2226 was put aside, and scrapped the following year. From 1998, the second series of El 17 was put into service on the Flåm Line, a steep tourist line that connects to the Bergen Line. The units were painted green and connected at each end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> of six B3 passenger cars. From 2003, the first series {{was taken out of}} regular service, and units 2222, 2224 and 2225 were put into shunting service at Lodalen. Unit 2223 was transferred to the Norwegian Railway Museum, where it was put on display.|$|E

5|$|Newark {{is one of}} nine {{cities in}} New Jersey {{designated}} as eligible for Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits by the state's Economic Development Authority. Developers who invest a minimum of $50 million within 0.5 miles <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> station are eligible for pro-rated tax credit. After the election of Cory Booker, {{millions of dollars of}} public-private partnership investment were made in Downtown development but persistent underemployment continue to characterize many of the city's neighborhoods. Poverty remains a consistent problem in Newark. As of 2010, roughly one-third of the city's population was impoverished.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 2012, the Land Transport Authority {{carried out}} a ground {{deployment}} exercise with SMRT to test their incident management plans in the event <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> service disruption. In total, about 135 personnel including representatives from the Singapore Police Force's Transport Command (TransCom) and SBS Transit participated in the exercise. Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise. Codenamed 'Exercise Greyhound', the exercise went through the scenario of a broken rail on the East West Line at Buona Vista. SMRT had also activated their Rail Incident Management Plan.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 2009, the new South Ferry station opened, {{replacing}} the original loop station. The loop station could only accommodate {{the first five}} cars <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> and required the use of gap fillers because of the sharpness of the loop curve. The new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The newer station {{does not have a}} connection to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and is underneath the loop station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the loop station. This was the first new station to open since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E

5|$|One morning Josh {{witnesses}} Arthur Shaw, {{a wealthy}} Tower resident, being kidnapped. Josh gives chase, but is tackled by FBI agent Claire Denham, who explains that Shaw {{was attempting to}} flee the country and avoid arrest for embezzling $2 billion in a Ponzi scheme. Josh confesses to the Tower staff that he gave their pensions to Shaw to invest, and they have lost everything; Lester attempts suicide by stepping in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train,</b> but survives. After visiting Lester in the hospital, Josh, Charlie, and Enrique confront Shaw, under house arrest in his penthouse apartment. Shaw expresses condolences, but is not sincere enough when he forgets to ask if Lester is all right, and out of anger, Josh smashes {{the windows of the}} 1963 Ferrari 250 GT Lusso displayed in Shaw's apartment. Josh's boss, Mr. Simon, fires him for his actions, as well as Charlie and Enrique.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on November19, 2010 on MTV and MTV.com. and it involves Mars's efforts to sing to a woman he loves after dragging an upright piano with a rope tied to it through Los Angeles. Scenes also feature the singer singing in a dark bedroom, looking out of a rainy window. He wears a suit and encounters a gang and a pit bull along the way. When he reaches the woman's house and finds out she is with another man, he drags himself and the piano in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> to attempt suicide. As the train approaches Bruno at full speed, the video cuts to black.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} fiercest rivalry is with Millwall. The {{two sides are}} local rivals, having both formed {{originally}} around local companies, with players {{living in the same}} localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to be the more successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which Isle of Dogs-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> during a fight with West Ham fans.|$|E

5|$|To {{take another}} example, in his {{screenplay}} for The Signalman Andrew Davies adds {{scenes of the}} traveller's nightmare-plagued nights at an inn, and reinforces the ambiguity of the traveller-narrator by restructuring the ending and matching his facial features {{with those of the}} spectre. The film also makes use of visual and aural devices. For example, the appearance of the spectre is stressed by the vibrations of a bell in the signalbox and a recurring red motif connects the signalman's memories <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> crash with the danger light attended by a ghostly figure.|$|E
5|$|Walter (John Noble) {{struggles with}} {{writing a letter}} to Peter (Joshua Jackson) to explain the events from 1985 that led Walter to bring Peter to his {{universe}} from the parallel one. As he contemplates the final letter, he {{and the rest of}} the Fringe team are called to investigate several dead bodies in a passenger car <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train.</b> Walter, after being told the victims' personal electronics were drained of power, suspects someone drew energy from both the people and their devices' batteries. They trace the man responsible to MIT astrophysics professor Alistair Peck (Peter Weller), and enter his residence to search for clues, finding evidence that Alistair was studying time travel. Alistair arrives while the Fringe team is there, and activates a mechanism on his body, causing him to travel back in time.|$|E
5|$|At 15:05, {{the train}} {{disappeared}} from the approach zone for the Vendenheim junction on the display being monitored by staff at the signalling control center. At 15:10, the control center initiated emergency procedures for the loss <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> and closed the non-high-speed rail lines that pass through the Vendenheim junction. At approximately the same time, {{one of the companies}} involved {{in the construction of the}} line received a call from an employee aboard the train, who informed them of the derailment. Shortly before 17:45, the local mass casualty plan was enacted. Emergency medical and fire rescue services along with 100 gendarmes responded to the incident. At its height, 104 engines from three départments responded to the incident—65 from Bas-Rhin and 39 from Moselle and Haut-Rhin. Those with minor injuries were treated by responders from the French Red Cross, which operated at the school in Eckwersheim. The French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Ségolène Royal, and the Secretary of State for Transport, Alain Vidalies, travelled to the site shortly after the crash. The president of SNCF, Guillaume Pepy, and the president of SNCF Réseau, Jacques Rapoport, also travelled to the site in the hours after the accident.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He {{was not interested in}} politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered politics by forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E
5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one at each end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train,</b> but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates {{at each end of the}} carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Production {{moved to}} Turkey in March 2012, with filming {{reported}} to be continuing until 6 May. Production was expected to take three months in the country. Adana stands in for the outskirts of Istanbul in the film. A group of Turkish teenagers infiltrated a closed set in a railway sidings in Adana to film rehearsals of a fight scene on top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>train</b> before being caught by security. The train scene depicted in trailers showed the Varda Viaduct outside Adana. Bond stunt double Andy Lister dived backwards off the 300-foot drop for the scene. A crane was set up on a train carriage to hold a safety line. Parts of Istanbul—including the Spice Bazaar, Yeni Camii, the Grand Post Office, Sultanahmet Square and the Grand Bazaar—were closed for filming in April. Store owners in the affected areas were reportedly allowed to open their shops, but {{were not allowed to}} conduct business, instead being paid TRY750 ($418) per day as compensation. Production faced criticism for allegedly damaging buildings while filming a motorcycle chase across rooftops in the city. Michael G. Wilson denied these claims, pointing out that the film crew had removed sections of rooftops before filming began and replaced them with replicas {{for the duration of the}} shoot; when filming finished, the original rooftops would be restored. The production team negotiated with 613 part owners of the Calis Beach in Fethiye, to film along the coastline.|$|E
