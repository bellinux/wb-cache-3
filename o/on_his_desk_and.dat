2500|$|Levene, {{proud of}} a massive sale he made that morning, takes the {{opportunity}} to mock Williamson in private. In his zeal {{to get back at}} Williamson, Levene accidentally reveals that he knows Williamson lied to Roma minutes earlier about depositing Lingk's check and had left the check <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> had not made the bank run the previous night — something only a man who broke into the office would know. Williamson catches Levene's slip of the tongue and compels Levene to admit that he broke into the office. Levene finally caves in and admits that he and Moss conspired to steal the leads. Levene attempts to bribe Williamson to keep quiet about the burglary. Williamson scoffs at the suggestion and tells Levene that the buyers to whom he had made his sale earlier that day are in fact bankrupt and delusional and just enjoy talking to salesmen. Levene, crushed by this revelation, asks Williamson why he seeks to ruin him. Williamson coldly responds, [...] "Because I don't like you." ...|$|E
60|$|Still, {{in spite}} of all this strenuous {{attention}} to forms, Tom had a Lurking dread that the devil, after all, would have his due. That he might not be taken unawares, therefore, it is said he always carried a small Bible in his coat pocket. He had also a great folio Bible <b>on</b> <b>his</b> counting-house <b>desk,</b> <b>and</b> would frequently be found reading it when people called on business; on such occasions he would lay <b>his</b> green spectacles <b>on</b> the book, to mark the place, while he turned round to drive some usurious bargain.|$|R

He then calls Gabe <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> phone <b>and</b> sets up the receiver next to a playback of the edited autobiography, prompting Gabe to listen to the entire audiobook.|$|R
2500|$|Jonathan Steinberg says of Bismarck's {{achievements}} to this point: The {{scale of}} Bismarck's triumph cannot be exaggerated. He alone had {{brought about a}} complete transformation of the European international order. He had told those who would listen what he intended to do, how he intended to do it, and he did it. He achieved this incredible feat without commanding an army, and without the ability to give an order to the humblest common soldier, without control of a large party, without public support, indeed, {{in the face of}} almost universal hostility, without a majority in parliament, without control of his cabinet, and without a loyal following in the bureaucracy. He no longer had the support of the powerful conservative interest groups who had helped him achieve power. The most senior diplomats in the foreign service ... were sworn enemies and he knew it. The Queen and the Royal Family hated him and the King, emotional and unreliable, would soon have his 70th birthday. ... With perfect justice, in August 1866, he punched his fist <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> cried [...] "I have beaten them all! All!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Lan Shi-de is a tall, {{handsome}} and successful {{young man who}} manages his family bathroom fixture business, {{but he is also}} cold, impatient and hot tempered who hates being deceived because he was betrayed by former employees in the past. He makes sure there is retribution to anyone who crosses him. The only soft spot in his life is his family (which consists of his grandmother, mother, older sister, aunt) and the pretty girl who lent him a pen during his final college exam. [...] He cannot forget the girl that lent him a pen and has been searching for her for 6 years. Not knowing her name or who she is the only memory he has of her is a fuzzy image in a picture he keeps <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> at home <b>and</b> the pen he never got the chance to return to her.|$|R
2500|$|Trujillo's [...] "central arch" [...] was his {{instinct}} for power. This was {{coupled with an}} intense desire for money, which he recognized {{as a source of}} and support for power. Up at four in the morning, he exercised, studied the newspaper, read many reports, and completed papers before breakfast. At the office by nine, he continued his work, and took lunch by noon. After a walk, he continued to work until 7:30 pm. After dinner, he attended functions, held discussions, or was driven around incognito in the city [...] "observing and remembering." [...] Until Santo Domingo's National Palace was built in 1947, he worked out of the Casas Reales, the colonial-era Viceregal center of administration. Today the building is a museum; <b>on</b> display are <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> <b>and</b> chair, along with a massive collection of arms and armor that he bought. He was methodical, punctual, secretive, and guarded; he had no true friends, only associates and acquaintances. For his associates, his actions towards them were unpredictable.|$|R

He is looking forward to seeing the hard copies of the new corporate brochures, which are part of a major re-branding exercise for the company. As he parks his car, memories of the trip to China still linger in his mind - the food, the colours, the smells, the enthusiasm of people to do deals are all part of a different world to his home county of Sligo. As he enters his office, the new orange <b>and</b> brown brochures <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> appear distinctive <b>and</b> bold.

50|$|They {{travel to}} a posting pole (like {{the ones in}} old Undertown, but they don't post up places on Sky Ships, they post up work around the 12 districts).

This figure is later {{revealed}} to be a banderbear, Weelum. Nate and the grey goblin go up {{and talk to the}} secretary of the man who runs the workshop, asking him for work, but because they have no experience working in stilt shops, he turns them away. Disappointed, they turn around, but the owner sees them and asks Nate to fix a lantern <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk.</b> He obliges, <b>and</b> the owner is pleased and rewards them by offering them both a job, accommodation and 60 gladers each per month, which they both gladly accept.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also studied}} {{psychology}} and psychiatry {{of everyday life}} and tirelessly popularized psychiatry among laymen. His name thus became famous enough to become popular as a synonym for a psychiatrist.; and so, people used to say, [...] "we'll call Heveroch psychiatrist on you", similarly as they later used the names of Mysliveček or Vondráček for the same purpose. [...] "Pinel {{is said to be}} the one who removed the shackles from the mentally ill, Heveroch has Bohemia opened the prison of psychiatry and let it get outside of the walls." [...] In his medical research, he frequently applied the therapeutic principles of psychotherapy (psychagogic, persuasion), but he did not use hypnosis and harshly rejected Freud's psychoanalysis. However, he acknowledged the existence of the subconscious. From a philosophical point of view he was close to vitalism. He refused psychophysical parallelism. His direct pupils were Vladimír Vondráček (1895-1978) and Otakar Janota (1898-1969). He himself was a pupil of Josef Thomayer (1853-1927). Vondráček described him as a respectable man, gentle, sober, with a focus on mathematics and philosophy, with a sense of humor, as an excellent speaker, trainer, organizer and debater. [...] "He was extremely tidy. He was a man [...] "adjusted to the vertical", which means that the pens <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> were carefully <b>and</b> vertically sorted (...) He walked quickly, often with <b>his</b> hands folded <b>on</b> <b>his</b> back, with his head tilted to the side." ...|$|R

60|$|As it {{happened}} Alton, who, though Miss Townshead {{did not know}} this, lived in the room adjoining his office, was busy about the stove just then. In those days, when Vancouver had more inhabitants than it could well find room for and its hotels overflowed, single men taking their meals in the public restaurants lived as best they could, over their stores and offices, or in rude cabins and shanties flung up anywhere {{on the outskirts of}} the city, while it is not improbable that a good many of them live in much the same fashion now. Alton had, however, missed the six o'clock supper, for reasons which the sheaf of papers <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> made plain, <b>and</b> was then engaged in cooking something in a frying-pan. A portable cedar partition partly shrouded the little table set out with a few plates, and the stove, while his old worked-deerhide slippers and loose jacket indicated that the man was just then not so much in his place of business as at home. He had been busy in the city <b>and</b> at <b>his</b> <b>desk</b> for ten hours that day, for the Somasco products were becoming known, and men had been toiling in the valley, driving roads, and building a new sawmill in the frost and snow. Part of Alton's business in the city was to raise the money that was needed to maintain them, and already he could foresee that if the time of prosperity was delayed it might go hardly with the Somasco Company.|$|R
