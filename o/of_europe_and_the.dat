5|$|A {{few months}} later, the band {{released}} their debut full-length record Four Minute Mile, bringing {{a great deal}} of attention from critics, fans and labels alike. The band was invited to join Braid on their 1998 tour <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> band rapidly created an overseas fanbase.|$|E
5|$|During {{the decade}} of the 530s, it seemed to many that God had {{abandoned}} the Christian Roman Empire. There were noxious fumes in the air; and the Sun, while still providing day, refused to give much heat. This caused famine unlike anything those of the time had seen before, weakening the people <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Middle East.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} White House, the Pierces {{remained}} in Washington {{for more than}} two months, staying with former Secretary of State Marcy. Buchanan altered course from the Pierce administration, replacing all of his appointees. The Pierces eventually moved to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where Pierce had begun to speculate in property. Seeking warmer weather, he and Jane spent the next three years traveling, beginning with a stay in Madeira and followed by tours <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas. In Rome, he visited Nathaniel Hawthorne; the two men spent much time together and the author found the retired president as buoyant as ever.|$|E

5|$|The BSA {{charters}} two councils for American Scouts living overseas, {{largely on}} {{military bases in}} Europe and Asia. The Transatlantic Council, headquartered in Livorno, Italy, serves BSA units in much <b>of</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Far East Council, headquartered in Japan, serves units in the western Pacific areas. The Direct Service branch makes the Scouting movement available to US citizens and their dependents living in countries outside these jurisdictions or in isolated areas. The Aloha Council in Hawaii also serves BSA units in the American territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and in the sovereign countries of the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau.|$|E
5|$|Though {{described}} {{often as}} a world, this was only physically true of Ivalice in Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, in which Ivalice was created parallel to the real world. The 'true' Ivalice, as witnessed in the remaining games, describes two distinct locations; a geographical region, and a smaller kingdom, both of which belong to a larger, unnamed world. Generally, however, the term Ivalice {{is also used to}} refer to the conceptual setting, rather as one might say the Medieval world <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} capital, foreign investment—in particular from Great Britain—was courted, but it was not sizable enough to initiate an economic recovery. Finally the new nations entered the world economy {{after the end of the}} French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, when the economies <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States were recovering and aggressively seeking new markets to sell their products after more than two decades of disruption. Ultimately Spanish America could only connect to the world markets as an exporter of raw materials and a consumer of finished products.|$|E

5|$|When {{the region}} of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a {{supporter}} of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador {{for the people of}} the new nation. The war ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence took its toll, he appealed to the people <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the U.S. in 1990, after a car accident left him partially disabled.|$|E
5|$|After Trump {{withdrew from}} {{sponsoring}} the event, DuPont became the primary sponsor. Between 1991 and 1995, national amateur teams took part alongside professional teams. The event attracted well-known competitors, including Lance Armstrong and Greg LeMond, and {{was attended by}} high-profile European-based professional cycling teams. In 1996, the Union Cycliste Internationale upgraded it to a 2.1 ranked race, meaning that amateurs could no longer compete. This made the race the highest ranked outside <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> first North American stage race to be ranked 2.1. The 1996 race {{was the subject of}} a number of legal issues, including a dispute over rights to its profits between the race owners, Billy Packer and president of the United States Cycling Federation Mike Plant, which resulted in them suing each other. DuPont itself was involved in a dispute about the anti-homosexual employment policies of the local government in Greenville, South Carolina, with the company insisting that the race organizers exclude the city from the route. After 1996, DuPont dropped its sponsorship and the race has not been run since.|$|E
5|$|By September, Brooks {{was back}} at a work camp, this time in Svitavy in the Sudetenland. He escaped that month with five other men, this time making it to Lüneburg inside a coal train prior to his recapture. Sent to a {{prisoner}} of war camp near Wiener Neustadt, he once more tried to escape but failed, suffered a severe beating {{at the hands of the}} Germans, and was again sent back to Stalag VIII-B for two weeks of solitary confinement. Working as a truck helper from a saw mill in Toszek, he slowly acquired maps <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> surrounding region as well as contact information for the Polish Underground State. Having escaped twice already, he risked transfer to a special punishment camp if caught again but, nevertheless, he fled his detention once more, this time with a Scottish soldier by the name of John Duncan, in May 1943.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, Seward {{was advised}} by his {{political}} supporters {{that he would}} be better off avoiding additional controversial statements, and left the country for an eight-month tour <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Middle East. Seward spent two months in London, meeting with the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, and was presented at Court to Queen Victoria. Seward returned to Washington in January 1860 to find controversy: that some southerners blamed him for his rhetoric, which they believed had inspired John Brown to try to start a slave insurrection. Brown was captured and executed; nevertheless, Mississippi representatives Reuben Davis and Otho Singleton each stated that if Seward or another Radical Republican was elected, he would meet with the resistance of a united South. To rebut such allegations, and to set forth his views in the hope of receiving the nomination, Seward made a major speech in the Senate on February 29, 1860, which most praised, though white southerners were offended, and some abolitionists also objected because the senator, in his speech, said that Brown was justly punished. The Republican National Committee ordered 250,000 copies in pamphlet form, and eventually twice that many were printed.|$|E
5|$|In November 1700, Charles II of Spain died childless. The {{dispute over}} who should succeed him– the Bourbon Prince Philip of Anjou, {{grandson}} of Louis XIV of France, or the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria– soon plunged Europe {{into a major}} war. Louis XIV supported Philip. England, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Savoy {{and some of the}} German states supported Charles, fearing that Philip's accession would result in French domination <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Americas. In accordance with Charles II's will, Philip was proclaimed king as Philip V of Spain and allied his new kingdom with France. The following February, the War of the Spanish Succession broke out when French forces arrived in the Spanish Netherlands and expelled the Dutch from the barrier towns. In May 1702, England's Queen Anne formally declared war on France.|$|E
5|$|The European Football League (EFL), {{run by the}} European Federation of American Football (EFAF), is {{an annual}} {{invitational}} tournament between the champions or co-champions of competitions run by EFAF members. The league's championship game is the Eurobowl. Other EFAF tournaments include the EFAF Cup, played between the top teams from national leagues {{in a similar manner}} to the UEFA Cup, the Atlantic Cup, played between teams from the Atlantic region <b>of</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Challenge Cup, played between teams from newer federations that are not eligible to play in the EFL or EFAF Cup. American football federations are also present in Asia, Oceania, and Pan America, and a total of 64 national football federations exist as of July 2012. The International Federation of American Football (IFAF), an international body composed of American football federations, runs tournaments such as the IFAF World Championship, which is held every four years since 1999, the IFAF Women's World Championship, the IFAF U-19 World Championship and the Flag Football World Championship. The IFAF also organizes the annual International Bowl game. At the international level, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are considered to be second-tier, while Austria, Germany, and France would rank among a third tier. All of these countries rank far below the United States, which is dominant at the international level.|$|E
