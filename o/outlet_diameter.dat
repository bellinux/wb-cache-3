Spray experiments were performed with each nozzle at two constant gas densities (15 and 30 kg/m 3) and an ambient temperature (673 K) at which evaporation occurs, with injection pressures ranging from 800 to 1600 bar. A light absorption and scattering method using visible and UV light was implemented, and shadow images of liquid and vapor phase fuel were recorded with high-speed video cameras. The cylindrical nozzle N 1 yielded larger local vapor cone angles than the convergent nozzles N 2 and N 3 at both gas densities, {{and the difference}} became larger as the injection pressure increased. The vapor phase penetration values for nozzle N 1 and N 3 were quite similar and always lower than those for N 2. This {{is consistent with the}} impingement measurements, which showed that the momentum flux of nozzle N 1 was only slightly greater than that of nozzle N 3, while that of nozzle N 2 was substantially greater.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, a strong {{foundation}} for the professional discipline of bulk solids handling has been provided, but so far, the theories for predicting funnel-flow are still quite empirical. In most cases, only two-dimensional stress field models are applied, which overestimate the stable pipe or rathole dimensions defining {{the core of the}} funnel and lead to draw-down and live capacity determinations, which are too conservative. More recently, Roberts [1] introduced a new, more realistic, hoop stress theory based on the three-dimensional stress state occurring in a rathole. To verify the validity of the new theory, the current research upon which this paper is based, involves an experimental study of rathole formation in laboratory scale model funnel-flow bins and gravity reclaim stockpiles. A two-dimensional laser line scanner is used to depict rathole profiles, while load cells and pressure sensors are applied to determine instantaneous loads and pressure conditions during filling, storage and discharge. Iron ore fines are used as the test material, with the test program including flat-bottom bins with different diameters as well as varying filling levels and <b>outlet</b> <b>diameters</b> and stockpiles with variable heights and <b>outlet</b> <b>diameters.</b> The tests demonstrate the capability of laser scanning to describe rathole profiles.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} nozzle geometry on diesel spray characteristics, spray experiments were car-ried out in a spray chamber. Three different single-hole nozzles were used: (1) nozzle N 1 - <b>outlet</b> <b>diameter</b> 140 µm with k-factor 0; (2) nozzle N 2 - <b>outlet</b> <b>diameter</b> 140 µm with k-factor 2; (3) nozzle N 3 - outlet diame-ter 136 µm with k-factor 2. Two constant gas densities of 15 kg/m 3 and 30 kg/m 3 were maintained under non-evaporating (ambient temperature 40 ºC) and evaporating (ambient temperature 400 ºC) conditions. The range of injection pressure was from 800 bar to 1600 bar. Liquid phase spray penetration and local spray cone angle along the spray profile were measured based on high speed shadowgraph images. In addition, spray momen-tum flux was measured. It {{was found that the}} effect of nozzle geometry on the liquid phase penetration and local spray cone angle were different for different gas density and injection pressure. Under non-evaporating conditions, as injection pressure was increased, nozzle N 1 without conicity showed slightly slower liquid penetration and larger local cone angle than nozzles N 2 and N 3 at the density 15 kg/m 3. As the gas density was increased to 30 kg/m 3, the difference between the three nozzles was more evident. Under evaporating conditions, nozzle N 3 with conicity showed shorter liquid phase penetration than nozzle N 1. As the gas densi-ty is increased to 30 kg/m 3, comparing the two nozzles (N 1 and N 2) which have the same <b>outlet</b> <b>diameter</b> but with different conicity, nozzle N 2 with conicity showed longer liquid phase penetration than nozzle N 1 with-out conicity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The pump {{design is}} {{facilitated}} {{by the development of}} computational fluid dynamics and the complex internal flows in water pump impellers can be well predicted. Various parameters affect the pump performance and energy consumption. The impeller <b>outlet</b> <b>diameter,</b> the blade angle and the blade number are the most critical. The present paper describes the simulation of the flow into the impeller of a laboratory pump in a parametric manner. In this study, the performance of impellers with the same <b>outlet</b> <b>diameter</b> having different outlet blade angles is thoroughly evaluated. The one-dimensional approach along with empirical equations is adopted for the design of each impeller. The predicted performance curves result through the calculation of the internal flow field and a successful correlation of local and global parameters. The numerical solution of the discretized three-dimensional, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations over an unstructured grid is accomplished with a commercial CFD finite-volume code. For each impeller, the flow pattern and the pressure distribution in the blade passages are calculated and finally the head-capacity curves are compared and discussed...|$|E

Introducing a valve to control the flow significantly improved the control of experiments and the ability to test for pressure compensation. It was found that the <b>outlet</b> hole <b>diameter</b> is directly correlated with outlet flow rate and activation pressure, but indirectly correlated with constancy of flow rate.
