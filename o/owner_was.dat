5|$|As {{with other}} sports, vinkensport {{has had its}} {{cheating}} scandals, as well as accusations of artificial enhancement. One finch sang a record 1,278 susk-e-weits in one hour, and the <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> later accused of doping the bird with testosterone. After one contestant sang exactly {{the same number of}} calls in two rounds, the box was opened and a mini CD player was discovered within.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} done on the {{property}} in the early 18th century, providing an additional service room and bedrooms. The Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 impacted on the hall, which {{was close to the}} Scottish border. In 1715, William Wybergh, the <b>owner,</b> <b>was</b> abducted by Scottish soldiers, and in 1745, shortly before the Clifton Moor Skirmish, it was occupied and looted by the rebel forces.|$|E

5|$|It is {{generally}} believed the house's first <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> Sir William Compton, Groom of the Stool to Henry VIII {{and one of}} the period's prominent courtiers, who acquired the manor of Tottenham in 1514.

5|$|McBride's {{tenure as}} <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> viewed favorably, {{partly because of}} the Browns' on-field success but also because he gave Paul Brown a free hand to coach and sign players.

5|$|Radyr's new <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> {{a wealthy}} landowner, Sir Edward Lewis, who was knighted by James I.

5|$|Talented slaves with a {{knack for}} {{business}} might accumulate a large enough peculium to justify their freedom, or be manumitted for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law (Lex Fufia Caninia) limited the number of slaves an <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> allowed to free in his will.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} had no Internet or landline telephone service. Its residents burned their refuse, {{unlike their}} neighbors, who set their garbage out for collection. Local residents called the building the Waziristan Haveli, {{because they believed}} the <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> from Waziristan. Following the American raid and killing of bin Laden, the Pakistani government demolished the compound in February 2012.|$|E
5|$|A {{full-size}} {{reproduction of}} September Morn was {{displayed in a}} window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and on grounds that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, the <b>owner,</b> <b>was</b> charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.|$|E

5|$|A {{system of}} hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland, with written records {{dating back to}} 1837. This program {{consisted}} of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion, whose <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> then awarded a monetary prize. The <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> then required, in return for additional monies, to take the stallion throughout a designated area, breeding to the local mares. Through this system and by purchase, Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England. Through extensive crossbreeding with local mares, these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed, and by 1840, Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same. In 1877, the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed, followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association (later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA), which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts. The first American stud book was published in 1882. In 1883, the short-lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded {{to compete with the}} Clydesdale Horse Society. It was started by two breeders dedicated to improving the breed, who also were responsible in large part for the introduction of Shire blood into the Clydesdale.|$|E
5|$|As the 999-year {{leasehold}} {{building has}} been gazetted by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) for architectural conservation, the new <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> asked {{to preserve the}} building's façade. There were, however, no similar restrictions on its interiors. Renovation works were carried out on the building from 1994 to 1995. The Nam Tin building was then converted into the Yue Hwa Chinese Products department store, and was renamed Yue Hwa Building. The department store was opened on 9 October 1996, and sells a range of traditional Chinese products including herbs, medicines, porcelain, furniture, arts and crafts, garments and textiles.|$|E
5|$|British {{businessman}} Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham {{during most}} of the 1970s and 1980s, and later became responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the 1992 season, the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing. The case was investigated by the United Kingdom Serious Fraud Office. In 2009, an unsuccessful attempt was made by a German organisation to enter the 2010 Formula One season using the Brabham name.|$|E

5|$|Part of the Ebenezer Avery House {{history is}} how {{it came to be}} used after the battle while its <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> absent.
