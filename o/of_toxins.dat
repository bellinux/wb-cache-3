The states, Indian tribes, and federal government are all engaged in efforts to restore and improve the water, land, and air quality of the Columbia River drainage basin and have committed to work together to enhance and accomplish critical ecosystem restoration efforts. A number of cleanup efforts are currently underway, including Superfund projects at Portland Harbor, Hanford, and Lake Roosevelt.|$|E

40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{activity of}} Shigella dysenteriae 1 was assayed by exposing HeLa cells in microtiter cultures to dilutions <b>of</b> <b>toxin.</b> Exposure to toxin caused either failure of cells in suspension to attach or detachment of cells from established monolayers. Estimates <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> potency {{were made by}} staining residual cells with crystal violet and visually inspecting the stained plates. Quantitation of the cytotoxic effect {{was made possible by}} eluting and spectrophotometrically measuring the stain. The dilution <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> causing 50 % cell detachment, the endpoint chosen for the assay, was estimated from plots of dye absorbance versus toxin dilution. The 50 % cell detachment dilution <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> varied as a function of cell concentration, incubation <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> with cells in suspension or as established monolayers, and the cell line used for assay. The HeLa cell line was the most sensitive of the cell lines examined. The method was easily utilized to monitor toxin purification and to measure antitoxin neutralization <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> activity...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{steps in}} the {{interaction}} <b>of</b> diphtheria <b>toxin</b> with HeLa cells were studied. It was demonstrated that lethal doses <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> are rapidly adsorbed to the cell. The kinetics of uptake, as measured by lethality, indicated that a single toxin molecule is able to cause cell death. Studies {{on the effect of}} pH on intoxication showed that adsorption <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> occurred over a wide pH range but was partially inhibited at high pH values. Experiments to determine the influence of the ionic environment on intoxication indicated that adsorption <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> did not take place in the absence of salts and was partially inhibited {{in the presence of a}} polyanion. The evidence indicates that the initial binding <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> to the cell is electrostatic in nature, involving positively charged surface groups. Attempts to demonstrate specific receptors for the attachment <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> to cells were unsuccessful, suggesting that toxin adsorption may be a nonspecific process. The effect of energy inhibitors on intoxication was examined. Sodium fluoride, an inhibitor of glycolysis, almost completely prevented intoxication in HeLa cells, whereas inhibitors of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation had no effect. Sodium fluoride did not prevent adsorption <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> but appeared to inhibit a later step in the intoxication process, perhaps the transport <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> to subsurface or intracellular levels...|$|R
40|$|Rapidly {{developing}} {{changes in}} the short-circuiting current (Isc), conductance (G), and potential (PD) of turtle bladders in Na-rich or Na-free media are seen after the mucosal addition, at 10 nM, of each <b>of</b> three <b>toxins</b> that contain ADP-ribosylation activity: Pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin A, diphtheria toxin, and cholera toxin. Toxin A irreversibility decreased the Isc, PD, and G of bladders in Na-rich media and the Isc and PD of bladders in Na-free media. Diphtheria or cholera toxin reversibly increased Isc and PD (not G), but only in Na-free media. The effects <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> A in the turtle bladder, like those in other host cell systems, were eliminated by preexposure <b>of</b> this <b>toxin</b> to heat, specific antitoxin, or dithiothreitol and urea. Because exposure to this last condition increases the ADP-ribosylation activity <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> A, {{it is suggested that}} the proenzyme is the required transport-inhibiting form <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> A. The effects <b>of</b> all three <b>toxins</b> occurred rapidly, possibly before any of the possible intracellular ADP-ribosylation reactions are initiated. Whereas a recognition binding <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> to receptors on the apical membrane completely accounts for the reversible effects of diphtheria or cholera toxin, this and additional toxin-membrane interactions (e. g., translocation) are needed to account for the irreversible effects <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> A...|$|R
5|$|The {{species is}} now known to contain two main groups <b>of</b> <b>toxins,</b> both multicyclic (ring-shaped) peptides, spread {{throughout}} the mushroom tissue: the amatoxins and the phallotoxins. Another toxin is phallolysin, which has shown some hemolytic (red blood cellâ€“destroying) activity in vitro. An unrelated compound, antamanide, has also been isolated.|$|E
5|$|These toxic {{mushrooms}} resemble several edible species (most notably caesar's mushroom and {{the straw}} mushroom) commonly consumed by humans, increasing {{the risk of}} accidental poisoning. Amatoxins, the class <b>of</b> <b>toxins</b> found in these mushrooms, are thermostable: they resist changes due to heat and so, their toxic effects are not reduced by cooking.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} authors {{have noted that}} the two explanations, as a {{chemical}} defence against predators and as a chemical defence against ectoparasites, are not mutually exclusive, and evidence for both explanations exists. The fact that the highest concentrations <b>of</b> <b>toxins</b> are bound in the feathers of the breast and belly, in both pitohuis and ifrits, has caused scientists {{to suggest that the}} toxins rub off on eggs and nestlings providing protection against predators and nest parasites.|$|E
40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> on the {{incorporation}} of uridine and thymidine into nucleic acids was investigated. P 32 orthophosphate incorporation into the nucleoside phosphate fraction was also investigated. No early effect <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> on nucleic acid synthesis was evident and only a slight effect <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> on nucleoside phosphate formation was found prior to 1. 5 hours after toxin addition. Both these processes, however, {{were found to be}} sensitive to dinitrophenol. These results are interpreted as indicating that toxin does not act by a general uncoupling of oxidation from phosphorylation. Other possible mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> action are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{suggesting}} that diphtheria toxin reaches the cytoplasm of susceptible mammalian cells by two independent mechanisms is presented. A schematic model describing the two processes <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> {{entry into the}} cell is developed. One process <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> uptake considered to by physiologically significant is passage <b>of</b> the protein <b>toxin</b> through the plasma membrane. This most likely happens by binding of fragment B to receptors on the membrane and by subsequent toxin-membrane interaction so that ultimately fragment A, the enzymatically active moiety, is transported tothe cell interior. This process, which ultimately leads to cessation of protein synthesis and cell death, involves a comparatively small number <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> molecules. A second mechanism <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> uptake is by classical pinocytosis. The majority <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> taken into the cell is accomplished by this process. The fate <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> taken into HEp- 2 cells via pinocytosis is proteolysis by lysosomal enzymes. Thus, such vesicle-bound toxin is ordinarily not expressed biologically. Evidence {{suggesting that}} ammonium chloride provides total protection to diphtheria toxin-susceptible cells by preventing entry <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> by the specific receptor-associated process is also provided; data showing that the ammonium salt immobilizes bound toxin on the plasma membrane of HEp- 2 cells are presented. Finally, {{it is suggested that}} actively endocytic cells such as guinea pig macrophages interact with toxin in a significantly different manner than do nonphagocytic cells...|$|R

5|$|All {{species of}} cone snails are venomous and can sting painfully when handled, {{although}} many species {{are too small}} to pose much of a risk to humans, and only a few fatalities have been reliably reported. Their venom is a complex mixture <b>of</b> <b>toxins,</b> some fast-acting and others slower but deadlier. The effects of individual cone-shell toxins on victims' nervous systems are so precise as to be useful tools for research in neurology, and the small size of their molecules makes it easy to synthesize them.|$|E
5|$|Boletus subluridellus is {{classified}} in the section Luridi of the genus Boletus. Section Luridi is characterized by boletes that immediately turn blue with cutting or bruising, narrow pores that are usually red, and the occasional presence <b>of</b> <b>toxins</b> in the fruit bodies. According to the scheme proposed by Smith and Thiers, {{the form of the}} dermatocystidia (cystidia on the cap cuticle) is important to species delimitation in section Luridi. In a 1993 study, however, Roland Treu found no major consistent microscopic differences between B.subluridellus, B.rufocinnamomeus, and B.roseobadius.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, James Dahlgren {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a small-sample pilot study assessing the project.

The study claimed to find evidence both of elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) in the rescue workers and improvement during the regime. Two scientists from Cambridge Environmental, Inc. published a thorough critique of the study. They questioned the premise that WTC rescue workers needed detoxification, citing studies that had found that their blood concentration <b>of</b> <b>toxins</b> was no greater than normal.|$|E
40|$|Transgenic Bt-modified crops release toxins into soil through root exudates {{and upon}} {{decomposition}} of residues. The fate <b>of</b> these <b>toxins</b> in soil {{has not been}} yet clearly elucidated. Nanogoethite {{was found to have}} a different influence on the lifetime and insecticidal activity <b>of</b> Bt <b>toxin.</b> The aim <b>of</b> this study was to elucidate the adsorption characteristics <b>of</b> Bt <b>toxin</b> on nanogoethite and its activity changes before and after adsorption. The adsorption <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> on nanogoethite reached equilibrium within 5 [*]h, and the adsorption isotherm <b>of</b> Bt <b>toxin</b> on nanogoethite conformed to the Langmuir equation (R 2 > 0. 9690). In the range of pH from 6. 0 to 8. 0, larger adsorption occurred at lower pH value. The toxin adsorption decreased with the temperature between 10 and 50 Â°C. The results of FTIR, XRD, and SEM indicated that toxin did not influence the structure of nanogoethite and the adsorption <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> only on the surface of nanogoethite. The LC 50 value for bound toxin was higher than that <b>of</b> free <b>toxin,</b> and the nanogoethite greatly accelerated the degradation <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> by ultraviolet irradiation. The above results suggested that nanogoethite is a potential material for controlling the environmental risk <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> released by Bt transgenic plants...|$|R
40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{development}} of symptoms was studied following injection of 3 MLD (minimum lethal dose) <b>of</b> tetanus <b>toxin</b> in each <b>of</b> the following {{sites in the}} rat: vein, muscle, endoneurium, epineurium, spinal cord, subarachnoid space, and subdural space. Similar observations were made when 3 MPD (minimum protective dose) of antitoxin were injected into each of the above sites {{a few minutes after}} the intramuscular injection <b>of</b> <b>toxin.</b> Local tetanus followed intramuscular, endoneurial, and epineurial injection of the toxin; blood-borne tetanus also appeared in the latter instance. Tetanus dolorosus followed intraspinal injection <b>of</b> <b>toxin.</b> Both dorsal tetanus and blood-borne tetanus developed after subdural administration <b>of</b> <b>toxin.</b> Blood-borne tetanus, alone, appeared following intravenous and subarachnoid injection <b>of</b> <b>toxin.</b> In no case did injection of antitoxin at the various sites listed above prevent local tetanus from developing after intramuscular injection <b>of</b> <b>toxin.</b> <b>Of</b> the various sites injected with antitoxin, the intramuscular, intraspinal, and intravenous were the most effective. It is suggested that the endoneurial tissue spaces serve as a conduit for tetanus toxin from the muscle to the CNS. The perilemma of the peripheral nerve trunk may act as a selectively permeable membrane which permits tetanus toxin to pass from the epineurium to the endoneurium. Outward diffusion <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> from the endoneurial spaces is apparently markedly reduced. The antitoxin probably is prevented from permeating this barrier in either direction. The importance of absorption <b>of</b> tetanus <b>toxin</b> by the lymphatic and blood circulation is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Toxin B from Clostridium difficile was {{purified}} to homogeneity and characterized. Purification <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> B {{was achieved}} by gel filtration, chromatography on two consecutive anion-exchange columns, and chromatography on a high-resolution anion-exchange column {{in the presence of}} 50 mM CaCl 2. The molecular weight <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> B was estimated to be 250, 000 by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 500, 000 by gel filtration.

5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation <b>of</b> <b>toxins,</b> including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases pollutant concentrations in their blood.|$|E

On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an issue with the oxygen provided.|$|E
5|$|Proteins {{can also}} be natural poisons or antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors (discussed above) that are found in some legumes, {{as shown in the}} figure above. A less common class <b>of</b> <b>toxins</b> are toxic enzymes: these act as {{irreversible}} inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is ricin, an extremely potent protein toxin found in castor oil beans. This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes. Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows just a single molecule of ricin to kill a cell.|$|E
40|$|Toxin A but not toxin B, {{appears to}} mediate {{intestinal}} dam-age in animal models of Clostridium difficile enteritis. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the electrophysio-logic and morphologic effects of purified C. difficile toxins A and B on human colonic mucosa in Ussing chambers. Luminal exposure of tissues to 16 - 65 nM <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> A and 0. 2 - 29 nM <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> B for 5 h caused dose-dependent epithe-lial damage. Potential difference, short-circuit current and resistance decreased by 76, 58, and 46 %, respectively, with 32 nM <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> A and by 76, 55, and 47 %, respectively, with 3 nM <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> B, when compared with baseline (P < 0. 05). 3 nM <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> A did not cause electrophysiologic changes. Permeability to [3 H]mannitol increased 16 -fold after expo-sure to 32 nM <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> A and to 3 nM <b>of</b> <b>toxin</b> B when compared with controls (P < 0. 05). Light and scanning electron microscopy after exposure to either toxin revealed patchy damage and exfoliation of superficial epithelial cells, while crypt epithelium remained intact.

5|$|The {{build-up}} <b>of</b> <b>toxins</b> and {{pollutants in}} seabirds {{is also a}} concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of DDT until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of western gulls in southern California. Oil spills are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.|$|E
5|$|The venom {{is a mix}} <b>of</b> <b>toxins,</b> {{including}} neurotoxins, that paralyzes {{the prey}} so the anemone can move it to the mouth for digestion inside the gastrovascular cavity. Actinotoxins are highly toxic to prey species of fish and crustaceans. However, Amphiprioninae (clownfish), small banded fish in various colours, are not affected by their host anemone's sting and shelter themselves from predators among its tentacles. Several other species have similar adaptions and are also unaffected (see Symbiotic relationships). Most sea anemones are harmless to humans, but a few highly toxic species (notably Actinodendron arboreum, Phyllodiscus semoni and Stichodactyla spp.) have caused severe injuries and are potentially lethal.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up <b>of</b> <b>toxins</b> in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} bodyâ€™s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP.
