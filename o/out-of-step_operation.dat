40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} an online technique for detecting <b>out-of-step</b> <b>operation</b> of interconnected power systems based on instantaneous apparent impedance relaying. The instantaneous apparent impedance {{seen by the}} relay {{as well as the}} peak values of the voltage and current signals at the relay location are highly influenced by the actual system frequency. Prony analysis is used to track the actual system frequencies by decomposing the measured voltage and current signals to its modal components: amplitude, frequency, damping factor and phase angle. Once the actual system modes are predicted, the instantaneous apparent impedance seen by the relay is calculated. The simulation results show that loci of the instantaneous apparent impedance are effective and reliable in predicting and describing the behavior of the system during <b>out-of-step</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Out-of-step</b> <b>operation</b> {{in power}} {{interconnection}} {{is one of}} the most severe emergency conditions. It is re-lated to the loss of stability in power interconnection, which may cause damage to equipment, interruption of power supply to consumers and unwanted development of emergency processes with severe consequences for the entire interconnection and its parts [1 - 3 et al]. With the future possibility for the UCTE and IPS/UP...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>out-of-step</b> <b>operation</b> {{conditions}} of a synchronous machine may {{occur as a}} result of a power system three-phase fault. The mostly used methods of identification of loss of synchronism are not secure enough. In the paper a new method using high-resolution spectrum estimation method is presented. In the case of asynchronous operation of a synchronous machine the current waveform in the stator winding can be resolved into three components, which frequencies differ insignificantly. High-resolution subspace methods enable to estimate the frequencies and on this way to identify the asynchronous operation. Copyright © 2003 IFA...|$|E
40|$|A {{new power}} system {{controlled}} separation scheme is proposed {{to prevent the}} propagation of cascading failures across a transmission network should it undergoes a major disturbance, thereby reducing {{the possibility of a}} large-scale blackout. This scheme is developed based on a set of conjectures, which state the following: (i) the locations of <b>out-of-step</b> <b>operations</b> are independent of the severity and the location of the initial faults; (ii) these <b>out-of-step</b> <b>operations</b> occur sequentially over a sufficiently long duration so that relay blocking and transfer tripping can take place to minimize the load-generation imbalance in the formed islands. To verify these conjectures, extensive dynamic stability simulations are executed on a 30 -bus and a 517 -bus system, which exhibit characteristics suitable for this study. Furthermore, we verify that these <b>out-of-step</b> <b>operations</b> do depend on the prevailing system topology and the operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the testing methodology for <b>out-of-step</b> protection system <b>operation</b> validation. The protection under consideration is a wide-area measurementbased system {{that consists of}} several parts: intelligent electronic devices, GPS measurement synchronization and communication network. The entire protection system must be tested in the laboratory before installation on site. The problem is, that communication network is hardly available at the laboratory testing stage and, at the same time, the communication network is {{a critical part of}} the system, which directly influences the entire system operation. To overcome this problem, the communication network emulator was elaborated that allows to test the entire protection system in real-time and in the presence of various, potentially vulnerable conditions...|$|R
40|$|The spectrum-estimation methods {{based on}} the Fourier {{transform}} suffer from the major problem of resolution. The methods were developed and are mostly applied for periodic signals {{under the assumption that}} only harmonics are present and the periodicity intervals are fixed, while periodicity intervals in the presence of interharmonics are variable and very long. A novel approach to harmonic and interharmonic analysis {{based on the}} “subspace” methods is proposed. Min-norm and music harmonic retrieval methods are examples of high-resolution eigenstructure- based methods. Their resolution is theoretically independent of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The Prony method as applied for parameter estimation of signal components was also tested in the paper. Both the high-resolution methods do not show the disadvantages of the traditional tools and allow exact estimation of the interharmonic frequencies. To investigate the methods, several experiments were carried out using simulated signals, current waveforms at the output of an industrial frequency converter, and current waveforms during <b>out-of-step</b> <b>operation</b> of a synchronous generator. For comparison, similar experiments were repeated using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). The comparison proved the superiority of the new methods...|$|E
