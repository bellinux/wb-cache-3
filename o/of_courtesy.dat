5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E
25|$|A {{working group}} {{made up of}} Finnish {{telephone}} companies, public transport operators and communications authorities has launched a campaign to remind mobile phone users <b>of</b> <b>courtesy,</b> especially when using mass transitwhat to talk about on the phone, and how to. In particular, the campaign wants to impact loud mobile phone usage as well as calls regarding sensitive matters.|$|E
25|$|Doors {{may have}} an {{aesthetic}} purpose in creating an impression of what lies beyond; for example, keeping administrative and factory areas of a building separate. In less formal settings, doors may {{also be seen as}} a sign of the desire for privacy. As a form <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> and civility, people often knock before opening a door and entering a room.|$|E

25|$|On Sunday, December 4, 1955, {{plans for}} the Montgomery Bus Boycott were {{announced}} at black churches in the area, and a front-page article in the Montgomery Advertiser helped spread the word.

25|$|After his release, Shalit {{returned}} to his parents' home in Mitzpe Hila. His release, {{the focus of attention}} in Israel and abroad, attracted many media outlets and ordinary citizens to Mitzpe Hila. Out <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> to Shalit, and given the sensitivity of the issue, many Israeli media outlets pledged to avoid intensive coverage that may compromise his privacy. Nevertheless, during the days after his release, many reports appeared about him. Shalit was also visited at his home by Israeli President Shimon Peres and French Ambassador Christophe Bigot.|$|E
25|$|Within Robin Hood's band, medieval forms <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> {{rather than}} modern ideals of {{equality}} are generally in evidence. In the early ballad, Robin's men usually kneel before him in strict obedience: in A Gest of Robyn Hode the king even observes that '' Their social status, as yeomen, {{is shown by}} their weapons; they use swords rather than quarterstaffs. The only character to use a quarterstaff in the early ballads is the potter, and Robin Hood does not take to a staff until the 17th century Robin Hood and Little John.|$|E

25|$|The National Courtesy Campaign was not {{actually}} {{the second of}} its kind to instill values <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> to Singaporeans, though they were not conducted on as big a scale as the National Courtesy Campaign over such a long period. More than 10 {{years prior to the}} introduction of the National Courtesy Campaign, there was already a Bus Safety and Courtesy Campaign, which was held in 1968, as well as the National Safety First Council Road Courtesy Campaigns and the Safety and Courtesy Campaign Week which were held between 1972 and 1973 among others.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Mayy Ziyadah began to host well-known men and women from intellectual, literary and political circles across the Arab world. Meetings were held at her family home, the first salon in Cairo in which men and women met together in the same room. In terms of etiquette, Ziyadah maintained a 'tactful correspondence' with guests of her salon, who were expected to inform her of their attendance through letters as a matter <b>of</b> <b>courtesy.</b> She and her guests also published letters they wrote from conversations in the salon.|$|E
25|$|In his speech, he {{stressed}} the importance of being courteous in one’s everyday life as it would make life better for everyone. It was a desirable attribute which could be found in all cultivated societies, and something which we should practice for Singapore’s own self-esteem. If tourists do find Singapore a courteous nation, it was because it was ‘incidental’. This ‘prodding’ by Lee Kuan Yew thus saw the birth of the National Courtesy Campaign, which became a recurrent, annual campaign that was seen as a long-term project of aiming to imbue values <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> into Singaporeans within a period of 10 years.|$|E

25|$|The {{parliament}} with a KMT and pan-blue coalition majority {{passed an}} amendment to the Act Governing Preferential Treatment for Retired presidents and Vice presidents (卸任總統副總統禮遇條例) on August 19, 2010. Introduced by the KMT, the amendment stipulated that former presidents and vice presidents will be stripped <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> treatment, including their monthly allowance and annual expenses, if convicted by a court of grave offense(s), such as sedition and graft. The number of bodyguards assigned to former presidents and vice presidents who are convicted of corruption in a first trial will also be reduced. Former president Chen's son stated the act was created to target the now imprisoned former president (陳水扁條款).|$|E
25|$|In December 1854, Canning {{agreed to}} have Lakeman {{relieved}} from his post, and he was given instead military assignments on the Crimean front. As the war ended and Austrian troops withdrew, he returned to Bucharest and became the owner of several estates, establishing his main residence in a house next to Enei Church. In June 1857, Stephen Bartlett Lakeman met with Carroll Spence, the American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, who was visiting Wallachia. Spence asked Lakeman to mediate between him and Wallachia's Kaymakam, Alexandru II Ghica, after being offended that the latter had failed to receive him upon arrival. Lakeman visited the Kaymakam, who agreed {{to meet with the}} diplomatic envoy and apologize for the lack <b>of</b> <b>courtesy.</b>|$|E
25|$|There was {{no legal}} {{recognition}} of same-sex relationships in Britain until 2005, following the legalisation of civil partnerships under {{the passage of}} the Civil Partnership Act on 18 November 2004. Civil partnerships are a separate union which give most (but not all) the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage, but there are recognition issues in other countries and with the use <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> titles. Civil partnerships can take place on any approved premise in the UK and in approved religious venues in England and Wales since 2011 (though religious venues are not compelled), but cannot include religious readings, music or symbols. Adultery and non-consummation are also not grounds for the dissolution of a civil partnership.|$|E

25|$|Bo Lewendal {{was hired}} in 1970 and was set to lead the {{development}} of a timesharing system, Nord-TSS. Monrad-Krohn articulated in 1972 that he hoped for the company to first grow into Scandinavia and then Europe. He emphasized that ND's small size was an advantage, as it allowed quicker production of newer and thus faster computers. The company decided to participate with eighty-seven other suppliers to win a contract with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) for its accelerator. The first tender was unsuccessful, but a delegation from CERN visited all the European manufacturers, largely out <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> as they had a long history of choosing American suppliers. ND chose to only demonstrate the computer from a terminal, rather than display the hardware.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} Antipas' {{involvement}} has been debated. Theodor Mommsen {{argued that the}} normal legal procedure of the early Roman empire was for defendants to be tried by the authorities of their home provinces. A. N. Sherwin-White re-examined the relevant legal texts and concluded that trials were generally based on {{the location of the}} alleged crimes, but that there was a possibility of referral to a province of origin in special cases. If Pilate was not required to send Jesus to Antipas, he may have been making a show <b>of</b> <b>courtesy</b> to the tetrarch and trying to avoid the need to deal with the Jewish authorities himself. When Jesus was sent back, Pilate could still have represented Antipas' failure to convict as support for his own view (according to Luke) that Jesus was not guilty of a capital offence, thus allowing him to avoid responsibility for Jesus' crucifixion.|$|E

In 1983, Avalon Hill took legal action against SSI for copying game mechanics from its board games; Computer Bismarck, among other titles, was involved in the case. The two companies settled the issue out of court. The game was later re-released as part of the company's [...] "SSI classics" [...] line of popular games at discounted prices. One of SSI's later games, Pursuit of the Graf Spee, uses an altered version of Computer Bismarcks core system.|$|E

[...] The prison doctor would visit every other day to attend to prisoners, and sometimes their children—to [...] "protect his reputation", according to a doctor testifying in 1815 to a parliamentary commission—but would not attend to their wives. This left women to give birth alone or {{with the help of}} other prisoners. The doctor told the commission he had helped just once with a birth, and then only as a matter <b>of</b> <b>courtesy,</b> because it was not included in his salary.|$|E
