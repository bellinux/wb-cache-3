5|$|As a {{political}} philosophy, one-nation conservatism reflects {{the belief that}} societies exist and develop organically, and that members within them have obligations towards each other.

5|$|These {{thoughts}} are employed on various important situations and {{incidents in the}} ordinary life of females, and are, in general, dictated with great judgment. Mrs. Wollstonecraft appears to have reflected maturely on her subject;… while her manner gives authority, her good sense adds irresistible weight to almost all her precepts and remarks. We should therefore recommend these Thoughts as worthy the attention <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more immediately concerned {{in the education of}} young ladies.|$|E
5|$|Globally, as of 2009, {{approximately}} 60% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{married and}} able to have children use birth control. How frequently different methods are used varies widely between countries. The most common method {{in the developed world}} is condoms and oral contraceptives, while in Africa it is oral contraceptives and in Latin America and Asia it is sterilization. In the developing world overall, 35% of birth control is via female sterilization, 30% is via IUDs, 12% is via oral contraceptives, 11% is via condoms, and 4% is via male sterilization.|$|E

However, Catholicism has {{the highest rate of}} retention. More than two-fifths <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> raised Protestant are no longer Protestant; the Catholic Church picks up 16% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> raised Protestants.|$|R

5|$|We earnestly {{recommend}} a longer recess from labour at noon, {{and a more}} early dismission from it in the evening, {{to all those who}} work in the cotton mills: but we deem this indulgence essential to the present health, and future capacity for labour, <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> under the age of fourteen; for the active recreations of childhood and youth are necessary to the growth, vigour, and the right conformation of the human body. And we cannot excuse ourselves, on the present occasion, from suggesting to you, who are the guardians of the public weal, this further very important consideration, that the rising generation should not be debarred from all opportunities of instruction at the only season of life in which they can be properly improved.|$|E
5|$|Without treatment, {{episodes of}} acute gout may develop into chronic gout with {{destruction}} of joint surfaces, joint deformity and painless tophi. These tophi occur in 30% <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> untreated for five years, {{often in the}} helix of the ear, over the olecranon processes, or on the Achilles tendons. With aggressive treatment, they may dissolve. Kidney stones also frequently complicate gout, affecting between 10 and 40% of people and occur due to low urine pH promoting the precipitation of uric acid. Other forms of chronic kidney dysfunction may occur.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, women {{are more susceptible to}} the harmful effects of smoke than men. In non-smokers, secondhand smoke is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of smoke, such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. For the same amount of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E
