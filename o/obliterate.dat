Hades attempts to launch a massive attack, but a revived Medusa injures him further, giving Palutena the chance to charge the Great Sacred Treasure's cannon with her power. Pit then uses the cannon to <b>obliterate</b> Hades' body, saving the world. At {{the start of the}} credits, Pit and Dark Pit are flying around as Palutena and Viridi have a brief argument.|$|E
5|$|The retreat {{continued}} until 11 May. On 12 May, Hampel carried out surrender {{negotiations with the}} British Army at Sankt Veit an der Glan. On 15 May {{most of the men}} were transported to Rimini in Italy, where they were incarcerated with other prisoners of war from 7th SS Division and 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS. Scattered remnants did not surrender until 18 May and many attempted to <b>obliterate</b> their SS blood group tattoo. Hampel escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp in Fallingbostel.|$|E
5|$|Forge and the Spartans {{return to}} the Spirit of Fire and the crew follows Anders' signal to an uncharted planet in another star system. The planet's surface is infested by the {{parasitic}} Flood, who attack and assimilate any sentient life they encounter. The Spirit of Fire inadvertently activates a Forerunner docking station and enters the planet's interior. Flood board the ship, and very soon Forerunner Sentinels appear to cleanse the Flood threat and also to destroy all UNSC forces in the process. The crew discovers the planet is actually hollow, with a habitable interior and a miniature sun. The Covenant's plan is to activate a dormant fleet of highly advanced Forerunner starships inside the planet, {{and use them to}} <b>obliterate</b> humanity.|$|E

30|$|For osseus bordered sinuses, mean {{surface area}} was 39.7  cm 2 and mean volume 17.1  cm 3. For the {{remaining}} pneumatized cavities, mean surface area was 36.4  cm 2 and mean volume 15  cm 3. The calculated mean volume of <b>obliterated</b> sinuses (42.2 % of all sinuses were <b>obliterated)</b> was 5.1  cm 3. Further, {{an association between}} the <b>obliterated</b> volume {{and the presence of}} pathologies was detected. Male patients showed a significantly higher mean osseus volume compared to female patients. No association was apparent between a patient’s age or dentition state and sinus volume, nor for communicating tooth roots and sinus pathologies or unilateral opacity and apical radiolucency. There was also no significant association between bilateral <b>obliterated</b> sinuses and the scan date being in autumn/winter.|$|R
5|$|Receiving a {{broadcast}} of CIA agent Daniels being interrogated by the 33rd, the team chooses to interfere. Tracing the signal's origin, they find Daniels already {{dead and the}} broadcast was a trap set for fellow CIA agent, Gould. Gould helps Delta escape, but is later captured and killed while assaulting a location called the Gate. The team heads there and continues the attack. Finding it heavily guarded by the 33rd, the team employs white phosphorus to <b>obliterate</b> their opposition and advance further into the city. While walking through the aftermath, they realize they accidentally killed 47 civilians moved to the Gate for shelter by the 33rd. Walker blames the 33rd and vows revenge.|$|E
5|$|Former {{criminal}} Sideshow Bob is {{declared a}} changed man by Reverend Lovejoy and released from prison on a work program, despite the protests of Bart. Bob is surprised {{to be taken into}} the care of his brother Cecil as the two had previously not spoken for ten years. A flashback reveals the cause of this rift: Cecil had auditioned to become the new sidekick for Krusty the Clown, a job he had long desired, but Bob, who had not originally intended to be the sidekick, was chosen instead. Cecil, who is Springfield's chief hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer, employs Bob to supervise the construction of a hydroelectric dam in a river near Springfield, while Bart, believing that Bob is still evil, continuously follows him around. Bob begins to become intensely annoyed by Bart's intrusions into his personal life and the dam's incompetent laborers (Cletus and his family), and he expresses a desire to see the dam burst and <b>obliterate</b> Springfield.|$|E
5|$|StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty {{introduces}} the fanatical Tal'Darim, {{who are at}} odds with Jim Raynor while he attempts to find Xel'Naga artifacts for the Moebius Foundation. More significantly, Zeratul discovers that some force has successfully combined Protoss and Zerg genetic material, creating a race of incredibly powerful hybrids. Zeratul travels to Aiur to probe the corpse of the Zerg Overmind for information on an apocalyptic prophecy, and unexpectedly finds Tassadar in an ethereal form. Memories found in the Overmind's cortex depict a vision of a future in which Kerrigan is killed, whereupon the hybrids (led by an entity known only as the Dark Voice) take control of the Swarm, destroy all other forms of life, then <b>obliterate</b> the Zerg as well. The Protoss are the last society left standing against the Dark Voice's armies. Zeratul finds Raynor, knowing his intent to track down and defeat the Queen of Blades, and tells him to spare her life.|$|E

5|$|Timmy and his fairies {{return to}} the Blue Moon via M.E.R.F.'s escape pod to {{retrieve}} the second wand. A weakened Turbo Thunder reveals the second wand only opens underneath a secret cave, which contains magical wands and the final part of the cave prophecy: to find the ice wand. The group returns to Fairy World with the wands to free the imprisoned fairies before everyone heads back to Earth. The fairies arrive and use their magic to remove the Earth's metal casing. Timmy heads into space with the Destructinator following him; the Destructinator attacks him, which sends him {{back down to the}} Earth, at its north polar region. After Timmy tricks the Destructinator into inhaling the explosives, he reveals that he stole the detonator remote from him back in space and uses it to <b>obliterate</b> him.|$|E
5|$|Tyrion {{discovers that}} the Sons of the Harpy are {{funded by the}} slavers of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, and {{arranges}} a meeting with representatives of those cities to give them seven years to abolish slavery. Despite Tyrion's insistence that compromise is necessary, this solution is met with disapproval by Daenerys' other advisors and the freedmen of Meereen. Tyrion also enlists {{the assistance of the}} red priestess Kinvara, who believes that Daenerys is a messianic figure prophesied by her faith and offers the support of the followers of R'hllor. Meereen begins to prosper, but the city's success attracts the ire of the slavers, who fear it will undermine the legitimacy of slavery, and so launch a massive naval attack against the city. Daenerys returns in the chaos, and though she is displeased with Tyrion's failure, she is persuaded by him to <b>obliterate</b> the slavers' fleet and force their ultimate surrender rather than destroy them outright. Soon after, Theon and Yara Greyjoy arrive in Meereen offering Daenerys the Iron Fleet; they are joined by the fleets of Dorne and the Reach, who have defected from the Lannisters. Daenerys names an honored Tyrion as her Hand of the Queen. Tyrion then joins her, the dragons, and her army as they sail to Westeros.|$|E

40|$|The {{failure of}} {{surgical}} treatment of <b>obliterating</b> atherosclerosis {{of the lower}} extremities {{may be associated with}} underestimation of changes in local hemodynamics, particularly in arterial hypertension. The objective of the research was to study the state of small muscular arteries in patients with arterial hypertension {{and its impact on the}} course of <b>obliterating</b> atherosclerosis and the results of surgical treatment. Materials and methods. There were examined 281 patients with <b>obliterating</b> atherosclerosis and 32 patients with arterial hypertension. Patients with <b>obliterating</b> atherosclerosis received presumptive treatment: an intravenous infusion of 4. 2 g of L-arginine, forceful intra-arterial injection of 20 - 80 ml of infusate (heparin, pentoxifylline, procaine), femoral and gluteal nerve block.         Results. Among hypertensive patients without <b>obliterating</b> atherosclerosis 13 persons had paraesthesia, feeling of coldness in the feet, platypodia, hypomyotonia, slow (63. 7 ± 1. 3 sec) reactive hyperemia, arterial stenosis (40 - 45 %), and low-amplitude or nonpulsative local blood flow. Among 97 patients with stable course of <b>obliterating</b> atherosclerosis 49 (50. 5 %) persons were diagnosed with uncomplicated arterial hypertension. Most of patients (80. 3 %) had single level occlusions of the iliac-femoral or femoral-popliteal segment. Presumptive treatment was effective in 87. 1 % of cases, reactive hyperemia was rapid (26. 2 ± 0. 4 sec), local blood flow was pulsative. Arterial reconstruction with limb preservation for more than 1 year was performed in 12 (12. 4 %) cases. Among 184 patients with progressive course of <b>obliterating</b> atherosclerosis 162 (88. 0 %) persons were diagnosed with complicated arterial hypertension. Most of patients (83. 7 %) had multilevel lesions with diffuse stenosis or occlusions of the tibial arteries. Presumptive treatment was effective in 9. 5 % cases, reactive hyperemia was slow (106. 3 ± 2. 7 sec), local blood flow was nonpulsative. Within 2 months 83 patients underwent above-knee amputation. Arterial reconstruction with limb preservation for more than 1 year was performed in 17 cases. Patients with arterial hypertension and <b>obliterating</b> atherosclerosis developed sclerosis of muscular arteries, intimal hyperplasia. Conclusions. Arterial hypertension causes lesions of small muscular arteries of the lower limbs. Hypertensive arteriopathy initiates the ascending development of <b>obliterating</b> atherosclerosis, causes hypertensive foot syndrome and unsatisfactory results of arterial reconstructions...|$|R

25|$|The play is {{composed}} {{almost entirely of}} speeches and contains little action since its protagonist is chained and immobile throughout. At the beginning, Kratos (Authority), Bia (violence), and the smith-god Hephaestus chain the Titan Prometheus to a mountain in the Caucasus, with Hephaestus alone expressing reluctance and pity, and then departing. According to the author, Prometheus is being punished not only for stealing fire, but also for thwarting Zeus's plan to <b>obliterate</b> the human race. This punishment is especially galling since Prometheus was instrumental in Zeus's victory in the Titanomachy.|$|E
