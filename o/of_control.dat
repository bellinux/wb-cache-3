40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at generalizing the {{theoretical}} provisions on <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing in enterprise: to clarify the place <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing within the management system, constituents, goals, tasks, and functions. The <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing was considered in terms of concepts such as management of enterprise, management of marketing, operative management <b>of</b> marketing, <b>controlling,</b> strategic and operational <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing, and operative management of marketing costs. The constituents and tools <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing at the strategic and the operational levels have been defined. The definition <b>of</b> operative <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing has been revised, which emphasizes managerial decision-making about marketing costs, taking account of current situation and optimality of such costs as to purposes of enterprise. A systematic approach to studying this issue provides a holistic view <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing within the enterprise management system. A study on the theoretical aspects <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>of</b> marketing as a modern management concept {{will make it possible}} to approach the issue of decision-making on marketing activity in a holistic manner...|$|R

His political backing ended with the retirement of Governor Broward, and the inauguration of his successor Albert Gilchrist in January 1909. The Florida Board of Education, which then consisted of the governor and the state's elected cabinet members, oversaw the Board <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> and made no secret of its desire to remove Sledd, in part because members of the Board of Education believed that Sledd's admissions standards were too high and that the university was not growing quickly enough. Nevertheless, the Board <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> continued to back Sledd, and its members threatened to resign in protest. Seeking to avoid an unwinnable political controversy, Sledd resigned, and the Board <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> replaced him with Albert Murphree, the political favorite of several legislative leaders and the Board of Education.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of the article: The {{contemporary}} {{research has}} shown that controlling as a method of management support is gradually becoming more and more popular and recognised in Polish enterprises. This article focuses on the features of the Polish concept <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> at each stage of its development. Methodology/methods: The paper is based on the conceptual analysis and conclusions drawn from the literature on the general review of controlling-related papers. It demonstrates the authors’ own view on the problem included at each stage <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> development in Poland. Scientific aim: The aim of the paper is – first of all – to present the evolution <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> in Poland and to point out the stages of its development [...] The intention of the authors is also to discuss both in theory and in practice the emerging new trends of this modern method of management support. Findings: The paper presents the evolution <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> in Poland. The beginnings <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> in Poland (1989 – 1994), growing academic and practical interest in controlling (1995 – 2005) and the start of the 21 st century – the golden age <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> (from 2006 till now) were distinguished as the main stages <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> development in Poland. Moreover, the paper points to the differences among the Polish and German and American ideas <b>of</b> <b>controlling.</b> Conclusions: It should be emphasised that the trend of Polish intensive development <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> theory and practice still continues. Controlling {{has become one of the}} most popular modern methods of management support in Poland. Despite this, there are few empirical studies into the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> in Poland. Conducting this research is necessary to identify the best practices in the field <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> in Poland...|$|R
