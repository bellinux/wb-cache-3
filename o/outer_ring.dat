5|$|The eyewall {{may vary}} {{over time in}} the form of eyewall {{replacement}} cycles, particularly in intense tropical cyclones. Outer rainbands can organize into an <b>outer</b> <b>ring</b> of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward, which is believed to rob the primary eyewall of moisture and angular momentum. When the primary eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone weakens temporarily. The outer eyewall eventually replaces the primary one {{at the end of the}} cycle, at which time the storm may return to its original intensity.|$|E

The outer rings differ from the inner narrow rings in a number of respects. They are broad, 17,000and 3,800km wide, respectively, and very faint. Their peak normal optical depths are 8.5×10−6 and 5.4×10−6, respectively. The resulting equivalent optical depths are 0.14km and 0.012km. The rings have triangular radial brightness profiles.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{interior}} of the northern half of the island is taken up by a large granite batholith that was created by substantial magmatic activity around 58 million years ago in the Paleogene period.

This granite was intruded into the Late Proterozoic to Cambrian metasediments of the Dalradian Supergroup. Other Paleogene igneous rocks on Arran include extensive felsic and composite sills in the south of the island, and the central ring complex, an eroded caldera system surrounded by a near-continuous ring of granitic rocks.|$|E

40|$|I {{propose a}} model for the {{formation}} of the two <b>outer</b> <b>rings</b> of SN 1987 A. The main new ingredient is a short-lived, few times 10 years, intermediate wind, of velocity of about 100 km/s and total mass of about 10 ^- 3 Mo - few times 10 ^- 2 Mo which is concentrated near the equatorial plane. This intermediate wind was formed during the few orbital periods when a binary companion entered the envelope of the progenitor of SN 1987 a, when the latter was a red supergiant. The intermediate wind formed a hollowed torus with a horseshoe-shaped cross section. The inner regions at the ends of the horseshoe torus are the two <b>outer</b> <b>rings</b> of SN 1987 A. The other regions of the torus were cleaned by the fast wind blown after the progenitor turns into a blue giant. The proposed scenario accounts for: (i) slow motion of the outer rings; (ii) the high density contrast of the <b>outer</b> <b>rings</b> to their surroundings; (iii) the presence of only two outer rings; (iv) the displacement of the rings relative to the central star; (v) the fact that no planetary nebulae have been observed to have a single pair of <b>outer</b> <b>rings.</b> Comment: Latex, uses aasms 4. sty, 13 pages + one figure, MNRAS, in pres...|$|R

It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial.
