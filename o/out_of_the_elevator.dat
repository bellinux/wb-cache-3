He killed eight people and wounded four others over the course of six minutes, before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head near the customer service desk. He fired more than 30 rounds, striking 12 people. Six were killed instantly, one died before reaching the hospital, and another died 45 minutes after reaching the ER of another hospital.|$|E
5|$|Alex realizes Geiger is {{controlling}} the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to Geiger's cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives inside the room. Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw {{to cut the}} door open and let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the navigator, Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the ballast doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she climbs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the fire door in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he got sick from copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.|$|E

500|$|The voiceover in the pre-title {{sequence}} is {{a reference to}} the 1963 television series The Outer Limits. The first segment, The Shinning, is a parody of the Stephen King novel The Shining and the Stanley Kubrick film of the same name. The basic plot of the segment {{is the same as the}} novel and there are also many references to specific moments from the film, such as the blood coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and Homer breaking though a door with an axe and yelling [...] "Here's Johnny".|$|E
2500|$|Both parodies and homages to The Shining are {{prominent}} in UK and U.S. popular culture, particularly in films, TV shows, {{video games and}} music. Images and scenes frequently referenced are: the Grady girls in the hallway, the word [...] "Redrum", the blood spilling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> doors and Jack sticking his head {{through the hole in}} the bathroom door, saying, [...] "Here's Johnny."

Jennings knocks out Rick with his flashlight; he steps <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and gets stopped by Jester and Decapitron along with Tunneler and Torch. As the elevator goes back down, Pinhead opens the door as Decapitron transforms his head into Jennings, informing Jennings that three lives were taken over Jennings' selfish greed. Tunneler and Torch go toward him and Torch flairs his flamethrower at Jennings as he falls to his death down the elevator shaft.|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} was dark, overcast, smoky, damp-the soft, unwholesome {{dampness}} that follows a spell of hard frost.

5000|$|Lassana Bathily, a Malian-born Muslim shop assistant, {{was also}} {{hailed as a}} hero in the hostage crisis for hiding people from the gunman and {{assisting}} police after his escape. During the hostage crisis, Bathily helped hide hostages in a cold storage container in the basement. Bathily then tried to call the police, but the line was busy, so he called his friend, a Frenchman named Dennis Mercier, and Mercier alerted the authorities about the hostage situation by flagging down a policeman. When Coulibaly opened fire in the store, killing Cohen, Hattab, Saada, and Braham and taking hostages, Bathily led fifteen people into the downstairs cold storage room for safety. Bathily was then able to escape alone by slipping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> store using <b>elevator</b> equipment. Upon leaving the store, he was immediately handcuffed and arrested by police who suspected him of {{playing a role in}} the attack. He was released after an hour and a half.

50|$|Located on the 94th floor, 360° Chicago is the John Hancock Center's {{observatory}}. <b>The</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observatory is 1,030 ft off <b>of</b> street-level below. <b>The</b> entrance can {{be found}} on <b>the</b> concourse level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> John Hancock Center; mainly accessible by the Michigan Avenue side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. The observatory, previously called the John Hancock Observatory, has been independently owned and operated since 2014 by the Montparnasse 56 Group <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Paris, France. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> are credited to be the fastest in the Western Hemisphere, at a top speed of 1,800 ft/min (20.5 mph). The observatory boasts larger floor space than its direct competitor, Skydeck at the Willis Tower. In addition, 360° Chicago has a cafe by Lavazza Coffee which stocks alcoholic beverages as well. In <b>the</b> summer <b>of</b> 2014, 360° Chicago added its TILT attraction. The TILT platform is an additional fee, and is a series of floor to ceiling windows that slowly tilt outside the building to 30°. The platform is on the observatory level, and faces south over the city. This observatory sees less attendance than the Skydeck at the Willis Tower, leading to a quieter and quicker experience.|$|R

5000|$|Air Ministry, 5th November, 1943.The King {{has been}} graciously pleased to confer the Victoria Cross on the undermentioned airman in {{recognition}} of most conspicuous bravery:—458181 Acting Flight Sergeant Arthur Louis Aaron, D.F.M., Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve, No. 218 Squadron (deceased).On <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> 12 August 1943, Flight Sergeant Aaron was captain and pilot of a Stirling aircraft detailed to attack Turin. When approaching to attack, the bomber received devastating bursts of fire from an enemy fighter. Three engines were hit, the windscreen shattered, {{the front and rear}} turrets put <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action and <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> control damaged, causing the aircraft to become unstable and difficult to control. The navigator was killed and other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crew were wounded.A bullet struck Flight Sergeant Aaron in the face, breaking his jaw and tearing away part of his face. He was also wounded in the lung and his right arm was rendered useless. As he fell forward over the control column, the aircraft dived several thousand feet. Control was regained by the flight engineer at 3,000 feet. Unable to speak, Flight Sergeant Aaron urged the bomb aimer by signs to take over the controls. Course was then set southwards in an endeavour to fly the crippled bomber, with one engine <b>out</b> <b>of</b> action, to Sicily or North Africa.Flight Sergeant Aaron was assisted to <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft and treated with morphia. After resting for some time he rallied and, mindful of his responsibility as captain of aircraft, insisted on returning to the pilot's cockpit, where he was lifted into his seat and had his feet placed on the rudder bar. Twice he made determined attempts to take control and hold the aircraft to its course but his weakness was evident and with difficulty he was persuaded to desist. Though in great pain and suffering from exhaustion, he continued to help by writing directions with his left hand.Five hours after leaving the target the petrol began to run low, but soon afterwards the flare path at Bone airfield was sighted. Flight Sergeant Aaron summoned his failing strength to direct the bomb aimer in <b>the</b> hazardous task <b>of</b> landing <b>the</b> damaged aircraft in the darkness with undercarriage retracted. Four attempts were made under his direction; at the fifth Flight Sergeant Aaron was so near to collapsing that he had to be restrained by the crew and the landing was completed by the bomb aimer.Nine hours after landing, Flight Sergeant Aaron died from exhaustion. Had he been content, when grievously wounded, to lie still and conserve his failing strength, he would probably have recovered, but he saw it as his duty to exert himself to the utmost, if necessary with his last breath, to ensure that his aircraft and crew did not fall into enemy hands. In appalling conditions he showed <b>the</b> greatest qualities <b>of</b> courage, determination and leadership and, though wounded and dying, he set an example of devotion to duty which has seldom been equalled and never surpassed.|$|R
