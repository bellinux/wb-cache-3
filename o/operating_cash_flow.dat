It aimed to explain the extent earnings, accruals, EBITDA and <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are able to predict listed Malaysian industrial products manufacturing corporations’ <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Ordinary least squares method was used to develop fifteen multiple linear regression models in examining {{up to three years}} of prediction horizon. Current <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> as proxy for future <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> are regressed on past one, two and three years of earnings, <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> combined with aggregated/disaggregated accruals and EBITDA as predictors. The sample was collected from annual financial statements of 97 listed corporations from 1999 to 2009 (11 years) and categorised into two subsamples; the within sample (1999 to 2008) to develop the models and the holdout sample (2009) to validate the robustness of the models. Results from the regression analyses revealed that all the accounting measures examined have significant predictive abilities but differing powers. Earnings are superior to <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> but EBITDA are stronger than both earnings and <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> while the <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> have the weakest predictive powers. The model comprising of both <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and disaggregated accrual components have the strongest predictive abilities. This suggests that disaggregating earnings into <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and accruals and further decomposing the aggregated accruals into the individual accrual components enhance the predictive abilities. These findings revealed that accruals have incremental explanatory powers beyond that contained in <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and disaggregated accrual components provided incremental explanatory powers exceeding that provided by aggregated accruals. Aggregated earnings masked the contributions of each accrual component. Disaggregating earnings and further decomposing the aggregated accruals unmask the contributions and effects of each accrual component. As individual predictors, both earnings and accruals have the significant abilities to predict future <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> for only one year-ahead (short term), EBITDA can predict up to two years-ahead (medium term) and <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> can predict up to three years-ahead (long term) ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - In {{response}} to recent concerns on earnings quality and a firm's fundamental performance, {{the purpose of}} this paper is to re-examine salient questions under accrual accounting: how earnings quality affects the role of earnings and <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> in a firm's valuation. Design/methodology/ approach - Using a large sample ranging from 1989 to 2008, the authors contrast the effects of three representative accrual-based earnings quality measures on the association between earnings, <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and a firm's abnormal stock returns. Findings - In the univariate analysis it was found that earnings explain returns similarly to <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> With control of earnings quality, the results indicate that earnings' role in explaining contemporaneous abnormal returns remains unchanged when earnings quality is better. Conversely, <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> explain more contemporaneous abnormal returns when earnings quality is better. The findings could suggest that the market reacts to <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> conditionally on earnings quality. Intriguingly, the results also indicate that the market perceives better earnings quality captures superior performance of <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> rather than that of earnings. These findings are further fortified by additional analyses revealing that the earnings quality measure with control of <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> affects the supplemental role of <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> most. Originality/value - The paper's findings provide insights on how the market processes firm value signals embedded in earnings quality, which have direct implications for regulators, standard setters, academics and practitioners.

This thesis is the first study in Australia that examines the presence and determinants of <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> asymmetric timeliness. Several explanations for <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> asymmetry documented in the US studies are tested, including product pricing, cost stickiness and firm's life cycle. Using firm’s stock return as the proxy for economic news and 23, 203 firm-year observations within the period of 1992 - 2012, the empirical results indicate that product pricing and cost stickiness are valid explanations for <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> asymmetric timeliness. However, although firm’s life cycle {{has been found to}} {{have a significant effect on}} <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> asymmetry in US studies, it is insignificant in Australia.

Accordingly, analytical comparisons between mining and non-mining firms are carried out in this thesis.

40|$|Contrary to {{the common}} {{perception}} that <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are better than accounting earnings at explaining equity valuations, recent studies suggest that valuations derived from industry multiples based on reported earnings are closer to traded prices than those based on reported <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> The question addressed in the article is whether the balance tilts in favor of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> when the following are considered: (1) forecasts rather than reported numbers, (2) dividends rather than <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> (3) individual industries rather than all industries combined, and (4) companies in non-U.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relative importance}} of earnings and <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> in equity valuation. In contrast to previous studies that use stock returns or future <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> we use ex post intrinsic value of equity as the criterion for comparison. Ex post intrinsic value of equity is determined adopting both the discounted dividend and residual income models with ex post (future) realizations of dividends/residual income over three- and five-year horizons as inputs. The advantage of using the ex post intrinsic measure is that this measure is not contaminated by the stock markets fixation on reported earnings (Sloan, 1996). Also, unlike future <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> ex post intrinsic value is a formal and comprehensive measure of the fundamental value of the firms equity.

40|$|I examine why <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> exhibit {{asymmetric}} timeliness {{with respect}} to stock returns and given this understanding, address the consequences for research into conditional accounting conservatism. Numerous studies document that <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are more sensitive to negative stock returns relative to positive returns. Because the properties of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are defined largely by the operating (rather than reporting) decisions taken by management, the asymmetric relation with returns cannot be explained by conditional conservatism. I find that the asymmetric timeliness of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> is primarily driven by product pricing, whereby managers are quick to cut prices in response to bad economic news, but {{do not appear to}} increase prices in response to good economic news. Consistent with this reasoning, I find that firms with greater pricing power exhibit lower asymmetric timeliness in <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> as well as in earnings. Variation in the asymmetric timeliness of earnings induced by <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> should not be interpreted as evidence of conditional conservatism.

A sample of Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) 200 indexed companies from 2006 to 2010 is used. Hypotheses are tested based on Heckman’s (1979) two-stage approach. Three regression models are developed to examine the association between carbon emissions and asset values/operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> This study finds that asset values and <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> will be adversely affected, if the reduction plan is implemented.

The book value of long-lived assets is further found to be negatively associated with listed companies’ carbon emission levels. This study also demonstrates that <b>operating</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> of emissions-liable companies will be adversely affected.
