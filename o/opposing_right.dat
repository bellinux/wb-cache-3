2500|$|Since the [...] "Old Eleventh" [...] was {{consolidated}} {{with the}} 10th Pennsylvania Regiment in July 1778 and {{was no longer}} in existence, the regiment became known as the [...] "New Eleventh". Assigned to Edward Hand's Brigade in April 1779, the unit joined the Sullivan Expedition that summer, where it was brigaded with the 4th Pennsylvania Regiment. The only major engagement was the Battle of Newtown on 29 August 1779. In this action, 250 men of Butler's Rangers and Joseph Brant's 800 Loyalists and Iroquois Indians attempted to ambush Sullivan's 4,000-man column. The American advance guard of riflemen detected the trap and Sullivan deployed his troops. While Enoch Poor's New Hampshire brigade supported by James Clinton's New Yorkers tried to envelop the enemy left flank, the brigades of Hand and William Maxwell pressed the <b>opposing</b> <b>right</b> flank. A Tory and Indian counterattack against Poor's men was driven off. Meanwhile, many Indians bolted when Thomas Proctor's artillery opened fire from a nearby hill. Faced with envelopment by a greatly superior force, Brant's men withdrew. Thereafter, the expedition did great damage to the Six Nations territory, burning 40 towns, despoiling crops, and cutting down orchards. The Iroquois people were forced to beg for food from the British that winter, but their ferocious attacks on frontier settlements continued. In August 1780, the regiment transferred to the 2nd Pennsylvania Brigade. On 17 January 1781 the [...] "New Eleventh" [...] consolidated with the 3rd Pennsylvania Regiment and ceased to exist.|$|E
60|$|But now the easy-fitting {{discipline}} of the Dower House style of hockey became apparent. Mr. Direck had last observed the tall young Indian gentleman, full of vitality and anxious for destruction, far away in the distance on the <b>opposing</b> <b>right</b> wing. But now, regardless of the more formal methods of the game, this young man had resolved, without further delay and at any cost, {{to hit the ball}} hard, and he was travelling like some Asiatic typhoon with an extreme velocity across the remonstrances of Mr. Britling and the general order of his side. Mr. Direck became aware of him just before his impact. There was a sort of collision from which Mr. Direck emerged with a feeling that one side of his face was permanently flattened, but still gallantly resolved to hit the comparatively lethargic ball. He and the staggered but resolute Indian clashed sticks again. And Mr. Direck had the best of it. Years of experience couldn't have produced a better pass to the captain....|$|E

50|$|Budde {{played for}} the Kansas City Chiefs for 14 years as the left {{offensive}} guard, longer than any other Chief except for punter Jerrel Wilson, by one year. From 1963 to 1971, he did not miss a single start, playing in all 14 games. Budde was 6'5 and 260 pounds (118 kg) with an unusual stance, in that he put his left hand down {{instead of the usual}} right. His explosive blocks often sprung a running back loose or kept defenders away from Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson. At the heart of the Chiefs’ offensive line with Jim Tyrer at left offensive tackle, his overpowering presence helped the Chiefs win two American Football League Championships (1966 and 1969) and a world championship in Super Bowl IV after defeating the NFL's Minnesota Vikings 23-7, with Budde able to handle the <b>opposing</b> <b>right</b> defensive tackle, Hall-of-Famer, Alan Page.|$|E

By that time, he was quite slow, not a big threat as a pass-rusher, but very stout against the run, rarely out of position, and quick to seize opportunities for turnovers. In 1972, the Redskins won the NFC championship game of the 1972-73 NFL playoffs against the Dallas Cowboys, when they limited the Cowboys to 3 points, 96 rushing yards on 21 carries, and, despite Roger Staubach as their quarterback, to 73 net passing yards, as McDole held his own against the <b>opposing</b> <b>right</b> offensive tackle, Rayfield Wright, {{a member of the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame. But, though the defense allowed only 14 points, the team lost Super Bowl VII to the Miami Dolphins.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{two-dimensional}} {{analysis using}} finite difference approach with "line method" is {{performed on the}} laminar magneto-hydrodynamic natural convection in a square enclosure filled with a porous medium to investigate the effects of viscous dissipation and radiation. The enclosure heated from left vertical sidewall and cooled from an <b>opposing</b> <b>right</b> vertical sidewall. The top and bottom walls of the enclosure are considered adiabatic. The flow in the square enclosure is subjected to a uniform magnetic field at various orientation angles (φ = 0, 30, 45, 60 and 90). Numerical computations occur at wide ranges of Rayleigh number, viscous dissipation parameter, magnetic field orientation angles, Hartmann number and radiation parameter. Numerical results are presented {{with the aid of}} tables and graphical illustrations. The results of the present work explain that the local and average Nusselt numbers at the hot and cold sidewalls increase with increasing the radiation parameter. From the other side, the role of viscous dissipation parameter is to reduce the local and average Nusselt numbers at the hot left wall, while it improves them at the cold right wall.
