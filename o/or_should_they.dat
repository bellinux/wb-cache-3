2500|$|Most {{codes are}} largely voluntary.

[...] For example, the guidelines issued by associations of directors, corporate managers and individual companies tend to be wholly voluntary but such documents may have a wider effect by prompting other companies to adopt similar practices.|$|E

6000|$|ON {{the banks}} of Mad River Mr. Hunt held a {{consultation}} with the other partners as to their future movements. The wild and impetuous current of the river rendered him doubtful whether it might not abound with impediments lower down, sufficient to render the navigation of it slow and perilous, if not impracticable. The hunters who had acted as guides knew nothing {{of the character of}} the river below; what rocks, and shoals, and rapids might obstruct it, or through what mountains and deserts it might pass.

6000|$|The free trappers are a more {{independent}} class; and in describing them, we shall {{do little more}} than transcribe the graphic description of them by Captain Bonneville. [...] "They come and go," [...] says he, [...] "when and where they please; provide their own horses, arms, and other equipments; trap and trade on their own account, and dispose of their skins and peltries to the highest bidder. Sometimes, in a dangerous hunting ground, they attach themselves to the camp of some trader for protection. Here they come under some restrictions; they have to conform to the ordinary rules for trapping, and to submit to such restraints, and to take part in such general duties, as are established for the good order and safety of the camp. In return for this protection, and for their camp keeping, they are bound to dispose of all the beaver they take, to the trader who commands the camp, at a certain rate per skin; <b>or,</b> <b>should</b> <b>they</b> prefer seeking a market elsewhere, they are to make him an allowance, of from thirty to forty dollars for the whole hunt." ...|$|E
60|$|Sometimes {{the way is}} cut off by huge thorny hedges and fences of barbed wire--man's devilish {{improvement}} on the bramble--brought down to the water's edge. The river-follower must force his way through these obstacles, in most cases greatly {{to the detriment of}} his clothes and temper; <b>or,</b> <b>should</b> <b>they</b> prove impassable, he must undress and go into the water. Worst of all is the thought that he is a trespasser. The pheasants crow loudly lest he should forget it. Occasionally, too, in these private places he encounters men in velveteens with guns under their arms, and other men in tweeds and knickerbockers, with or without guns, and they all stare at him with amazement in their eyes, like disturbed cattle in a pasture; and sometimes they challenge him. But I must say that, although I have been sharply spoken to on several occasions, always, after a few words, I have been permitted to keep on my way. And on that way I intend to keep until I have no more strength to climb over fences and force my way through hedges, but like a blind and worn-out old badger must take to my earth and die.|$|E
60|$|I {{must not}} let slip this opportunity, as another might not occur {{for a long}} time, of saying {{something}} about our friends at Norland Square.

I do honestly think that Mrs. Chance has made a terrible mistake; I pity her very much. But things may not after all turn out altogether badly, and if Merton has any good in him he ought to show it now, when he has such a woman as your friend for a wife and companion. At all events, I have made up my mind--and this is another secret, Miss Affleck--to forget all about the past and do what I can to assist him. Not only for auld lang syne, for we were great friends at school, but also for his wife's sake. My only fear is that he will keep out of my sight, but perhaps I am doing him an injustice in thinking so. But as you will continue to see your friend, may I ask you to let me know should they at any time be in very straitened circumstances, or in any trouble, <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>they</b> go away from Norland Square? I do hope {{you will be able to}} promise me this.|$|E

60|$|But {{then the}} three interfered, {{and it was}} likely that the other, the rich aristocracy, should now know all about it. It was not to {{save the lives of}} those unfortunate women and {{children}} that they went. There would be danger in that. And though the women and children were, at any rate, their near neighbours, why should they attempt to interfere and incur manifest dangers on their account? But they would creep along and see, and then they could tell; <b>or</b> <b>should</b> <b>they</b> be disturbed in their employment, they could escape amidst the darkness of the night. There could be no escape for those poor wretches, stripped in their bed; none for that aged woman, who could not take herself away from among the guns and rocks of her pursuers; none for those poor children; none, indeed, for the father of the family, upon whom the ten would come in his lair. If his wife had threatened to tell, he must pay for his wife's garrulity. Pat Gilligan had suffered for some such offence, and it was but just that she and he and they should suffer also. But the three might have to suffer, also, in their turns, if they consented to subject themselves to so bloody an aristocracy. And therefore they stalked forth at night and went up to Kerrycullion, at the heels of the other party, and saw it all. Now, one after another, the six were killed, or all but killed, and then the three went back to their homes, resolved that they would have recourse to the other aristocracy.|$|E
