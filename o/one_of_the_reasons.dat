The increasing Irish immigration {{was seen as}} an economic boon by these antipodean countries. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the increase was due to many Irish deciding against emigrating to the warring nations of North America.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{said that}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> why <b>the</b> royal court gave the Kalang People a special role in the royal {{services}} is because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court's disfavor on <b>the</b> entry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese and other foreign Orientals into their territories.|$|R
50|$|Cabruta {{is located}} near <b>the</b> {{geographical}} center <b>of</b> Venezuela.

5|$|June 1990: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Boris briefly caused heavy rainfall in southern California. This was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> {{why it was}} the wettest June in San Diego, since record-keeping began in 1850. Despite this, less than an inch (25mm) of rain fell in most locations.|$|E
5|$|The Abyssinian crisis {{showed how}} the League could be {{influenced}} by the self-interest of its members; <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> why the sanctions were not very harsh was that both Britain and France feared the prospect of driving Mussolini and Adolf Hitler into an alliance.|$|E

30|$|There is an {{additional}} complication to synchronization of chaotic systems when they are non-autonomous (They have some explicit time dependence.). <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> for considering non-autonomous systems is that in <b>the</b> some <b>of</b> physical systems, <b>the</b> parameters associated with these systems may vary with time.|$|R
2500|$|Côn River is {{the largest}} and most {{important}} river in Bình Định. It forms a small delta north of Quy Nhơn. Most of it can be used as an inland waterway for transportation.

50|$|Although <b>the</b> Battle <b>of</b> Pákozd was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smaller <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Revolution, its {{consequences}} were {{very important for}} the other fights for independence. The battle became an icon for the Hungarian army because of it is influence on politics and morale.

5|$|This {{incident}} and Phan's response are {{often cited as}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> {{why he was so}} admired by the populace and among future generations of Vietnamese anti-colonialists: he adhered to the highest personal standards of patriotism. He identified with a countrywide cause, far removed from the questions of family and region.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five {{years after}} the earthquake, the largest earthquake-monitoring network nationally was {{established}} in Yunnan.

5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, and this is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E
50|$|According to the Youth Travel Accommodation's Annual Survey <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>reasons</b> for a {{relatively}} strong performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hostel sector is the tendency for operators to innovate and adapt their products to suit market conditions.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the season, Wojtek Wolski was the Avalanche player seen as {{favorite}} to contend for the Calder Memorial Trophy; however, the scoring streak put Stastny into contention as well. Stastny's play was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> the Avalanche experienced their best run of the season towards the end, winning 15 of their last 19games but missing the playoffs by one point. Stastny ended his rookie season with 78points, finished second to Pittsburgh Penguins' Evgeni Malkin in the voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy and was named to the 2006–07 NHL All-Rookie Team.|$|E
5|$|By {{the reign}} of George I, the May Fair had fallen into disrepute and was {{regarded}} as a public scandal. The 6th Earl of Coventry, who lived on Piccadilly, considered the fair to be a nuisance and led a public campaign against it along with local residents. It was abolished in 1764. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for Mayfair's subsequent boom in property development was to keep out lower class activities.|$|E
5|$|Fedayeen {{actions were}} cited by Israel as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for its {{launching}} of the Sinai Campaign of 1956, the 1967 War, and the 1978 and 1982 invasions of Lebanon.

30|$|Since {{presented}} {{rare case}} of cerebellar metastasis of PTC {{was very similar}} to solid type cerebellar hemangioblastoma on imaging and histopathological findings, accurate diagnosis was challenging. Moreover, it is extremely rare for a cerebellar metastasis to occur as an initial distant metastasis of PTC, and hemangioblastoma {{is the most common}} primary cerebellar neoplasm in adults. This epidemiological data was also <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>of</b> difficulty to reach preoperative accurate diagnosis.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pain is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{most common}} <b>reasons</b> for {{individuals}} to seek medical advice, yet it remains poorly managed. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>reasons</b> that poor pain management persists is <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> adequate knowledge and skills of practicing clinicians, which stems from a perceived lack of pain education during <b>the</b> training <b>of</b> undergraduate medical students...|$|R

5|$|In 1941 the Soviet Union {{decided to}} cease {{production}} of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10). <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> was the disbanding of the Rifle Corps between August and September 1941 and the consequent removal of the corps artillery. Moreover, all 152mm howitzers were excluded from divisional artillery. As a result, there was no series production of 152mm howitzers during 1942.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Utah Department of Transportation petitioned {{to extend}} US666 {{northwest}} to Richfield, but {{the proposal was}} rejected. The proposed extension followed SR95, SR24, and SR119. A concurrency with US191 would have been routed through Blanding and Monticello to connect {{to the rest of}} the route. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> cited for rejecting the proposal was that portions of SR24 were not built to standards desired for additions to the U.S. Highway System.|$|E
5|$|Long-standing rivalries {{result in}} {{numerous}} rematches, especially {{if one of}} the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> that enforcers may fight {{at the beginning of a}} game, when nothing obvious has happened to agitate the opponents. On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an obvious advantage.|$|E

The developed solution approach can be used in any similar production and service system.|$|R

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, which was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E
5|$|Market Street is {{a unique}} set in the Modular Buildings series in that it has fewer than 2000 pieces and is {{recommended}} for builders 10 years and up rather than the usual 16. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> this set was smaller than the others {{was to provide a}} lower cost entry point into the Modular Houses series.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> the episode {{worked so well}} was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location.
