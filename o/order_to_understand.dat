5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism {{is the belief that}} all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of human physiology, which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E
5|$|Many {{songs are}} {{composed}} in English, but Viking metal bands often write lyrics in other languages, usually of the North Germanic family– Norwegian, Old Norse, Swedish, Danish and, less commonly, Icelandic and Faroese– {{and also in}} Finnish, which is non-Germanic. Other European languages, such as German, Old High German, Latin, Dutch, Sami languages, or Gaulish are sometimes used. Heavy metal fans around the world sometimes learn languages such as Norwegian or Finnish in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the lyrics of their favorite bands and improve their appreciation of the music.|$|E
5|$|The {{irreducible}} infinite-dimensional unitary representations {{may have}} indirect relevance to physical reality in speculative modern theories since the (generalized) Lorentz group appears {{as the little}} group of the Poincare group of spacelike vectors in higher spacetime dimension. The corresponding infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the (generalized) Poincaré group are the so-called tachyonic representations. Tachyons appear in the spectrum of bosonic strings and are associated with instability of the vacuum. Even though tachyons may not be realized in nature, these representations must be mathematically understood in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> string theory. This is so since tachyon states turn out to appear in superstring theories too in attempts to create realistic models.|$|E

5|$|British philosopher Richard Swinburne {{proposed}} {{a version of}} the Irenaean theodicy based on his libertarian view of free will, a view that one's free actions are not caused by any outside agent. He argued that, in order for people to make free moral decisions, they must be aware of the consequences of such decisions. Knowledge of these consequences must be based on experience—Swinburne rejected the idea that God could implant such knowledge, arguing that humans would question its reliability. Swinburne argued that humans must have first hand experience of natural evil in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the consequences of moral evil and that for God to give humans moral free will, he must allow human suffering. Swinburne conceived Hell as being a separation from God, rejecting the notion of eternal physical punishment, and argued that people who had chosen to reject God throughout their lives would continue to do so after death.|$|E
