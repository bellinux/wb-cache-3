Also, it deals with the characterization of the wooden solid residues generated from the same process. The quantities of the olive stone oil production as well as the air pollutants and solid wastes are depended on the three existing olive oil extraction methods: the old press extraction process, the 3 -phase process and the 2 -phase process. The characteristics of solid residues are almost independent of the raw material...|$|E
