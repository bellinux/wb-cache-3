40|$|We {{present a}} {{coarse-grained}} two dimensional mechanical {{model for the}} microtubule-tau bundles in neuronal axons in which we remove taus, as can happen in various neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tauopathies, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Our simplified model includes (i) taus modeled as entropic springs between microtubules, (ii) removal of taus from the bundles due to phosphorylation, and (iii) a possible depletion force between microtubules due to these dissociated phosphorylated taus. We equilibrate upon tau removal using steepest descent relaxation. In {{the absence of the}} depletion force, the transverse rigidity to radial compression of the bundle falls to zero at about 60 % tau <b>occupancy,</b> in <b>agreement</b> with standard percolation theory results. However, with the attractive depletion force, spring removal leads to a first order collapse of the bundles over a wide range of tau occupancies for physiologically realizable conditions. While our simplest calculations assume a constant concentration of microtubule intercalants to mediate the depletion force, including a dependence that is linear in the detached taus yields the same collapse. Applying percolation theory to removal of taus at microtubule tips, which are likely to be the protective sites against dynamic instability, we argue that the microtubule instability can only obtain at low tau occupancy, from 0. 06 - 0. 30 depending upon the tau coordination at the microtubule tips. Hence, the collapse we discover is likely to be more robust over a wide range of tau occupancies than the dynamic instability. We suggest in vitro tests of our predicted collapse.

40|$|The report {{presents}} {{a repeat of}} a 1989 - 90 postal survey to explore the land tenurial changes in England and Wales that have resulted from legislative and structural change. Clearly, since 1990, the introduction of Farm Business Tenancies means that {{the two sets of}} results, while not directly comparable, allows the occupancy of land under unconventional forms of tenancy to be explored and contrasted. Furthermore, many factors influence the occupancy of land including taxation, inheritance laws, the profitability of farming, and structural and policy changes within the industry. Therefore, the occupancy of agricultural land in 2007 should be set against this backcloth of socio-political changes that impact upon the industry.

40|$|Lotharmeyerite, calcium bis(zinc/manganese) bis(arsenate) bis(hydroxide/hydrate), Ca(Zn,Mn 3 +) 2 (AsO 4) 2 (H 2 O,OH) 2, is {{a member}} of the natrochalcite group of minerals, which are {{characterized}} by the general formula AM 2 (XO 4) 2 (H 2 O,OH) 2, where A may be occupied by Pb 2 +, Ca 2 +, Na+, and Bi 3 +, M by Fe 3 +, Mn 3 +, Cu 2 +, Zn 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +, Al 3 +, and Mg 2 +, and X by PV, AsV, VV, and SVI. The minerals in the group display either monoclinic or triclinic symmetry, depending on the ordering of chemical components in the M site. Based on single-crystal X-ray diffraction data of a sample from the type locality, Mapimi, Durango, Mexico, this study presents the first structure determination of lotharmeyerite. Lotharmeyerite is isostructural with natrochalcite and tsumcorite. The structure is composed of rutile-type chains of edge-shared MO 6 octahedra (site symmetry overline 1) extending along [010], which are interconnected by XO 4 tetrahedra (site symmetry 2) and hydrogen bonds to form [M 2 (XO 4) 2 (OH,H 2 O) 2] sheets parallel to (001). These sheets are linked by the larger A cations (site symmetry 2 /m), as well as by hydrogen bonds. Bond-valence sums for the M cation, calculated with the parameters for Mn 3 + and Mn 2 + are 2. 72 and 2. 94 v. u., respectively, consistent with the occupation of the M site by Mn 3 +.

40|$|The {{stability}} of pseudo-binary Mg- 6 (PdxNi 1 -x) compounds {{has been studied}} at T = 0 K via first-principles calculations and at 673 K by thermodynamic modelling of finite temperature effects. At 0 K, these compounds are not stable since their formation energy is above the convex hull defined by the Mg, Mg 2 Ni and Mg 6 Pd phases, although the energy difference is not very high. However, at 673 K, vibrational and configurational entropic effects allow the stabilisation {{of some of the}} calculated pseudo-binary Mg- 6 (PdxNi 1 -x) compounds. The vibrational contribution to the thermodynamic properties of the studied compounds has been calculated from Debye temperatures in the harmonic approximation. Also, the configurational entropy has been estimated taking into account the possible distribution of Pd and Ni between the several sites available in the pseudo-binary structure. The identification of intrinsic disorder and the associated energies and entropy are innovative features of this work. The phase diagram at the Mg-rich corner derived from these calculations is in fairly good agreement with recently published experimental results. In addition, the Ni for Pd substitution has been studied for the several sites available for Pd in the binary Mg 6 Pd compound.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} effects of firm's collaborative strategy on both demand and supply, and equilibrium to derive various welfare implications. I explain both horizontal mergers and vertical relationships, focusing on the U. S. airline industry. In the first study, I address significant limitations of traditional merger simulations which have focused solely on price changes while constraining the set of product characteristics to be identical pre- and post-merger. To overcome the limitations, I endogenize both prices and product characteristics by specifying a two-stage oligopoly game. After estimating demand and supply system, I simulate {{the effect of the}} Delta and Northwest Airlines merger on prices, product characteristics, and welfare. The simulation results show that the merged rm tends to increase product differentiation post-merger, the higher product differentiation reduces the firm's incentive to raise prices, and the changes in characteristics and prices increase not only the merged firm's profit but also consumer welfare. I also compare the predicted to actual post-merger outcome and find that endogenizing product characteristics is essential to better predict the actual outcome. The second study investigates the impact of contractual agreements regarding gates between airports and carriers on major carrier's market power. Competition Plans reported by thirty one hub airports provide information on a carrier's gate- <b>occupancy,</b> sublease <b>agreement,</b> and Majority-In-Interest clauses at an airport. I estimate {{the effects of}} these contractual practices on passengers' utility and carriers' marginal costs. The main results show that a carrier's gate dominance has a positive effect on the demand side through passengers' utility, and business travelers have a higher willingness to pay for gates than tourists. On the supply side, a carrier's gate dominance decreases its own marginal cost, especially when the airport is congested. Furthermore, the existence of sublease agreement at an airport is likely to increase non-signatory carriers' marginal costs, whereas the provision of Majority-In-Interest clauses increases signatory carriers' marginal costs. Based on the estimates, I execute a counterfactual analysis and nd that regulatory limits on gate occupancy can reduce the di erentials in costs and pro ts between signatory and non-signatory airlines...|$|R
40|$|The {{determination}} of selectivity {{is central to}} the development of molecular receptors. Competition binding experiments based on the relative binding ratios are commonly used to evaluate relative binding constants. When more than one species binds to the same active site of a receptor, the crystallographic evaluation of the occupancy factors of each ligand could be very informative about their relative affinity. However, in the presence of overlapped electron densities, the statistical occupancy factors are hard to retrieve using conventional crystal structure refinement. Here, we present an original method to evaluate the relative binding constants based on the direct treatment of the diffraction intensities obtained from isomorphous single crystals grown in the presence of binary mixtures of competitive ligands. This method was developed and first applied to evaluate the affinity of a tetraphosphonate cavitand receptor towards short-chain alcohols. In the easier cases, wherein the electron densities of the two alcohols are less overlapped, the occupancy factors for guest molecules obtained in conventional structural refinement are in good agreement with the values calculated from the direct comparison of diffraction intensities. The affinity constants were estimated from the calculated occupancy factors, considering the molar ratios of alcohols used in the competition experiments. The congruence of the method has been tested on several binary mixtures using different concentration ratios of alcoholic guests. In general, for a given alcoholic pair, the different molar ratios of alcohols, used in the crystallization batch, produce a trend of the <b>occupancy</b> factors in <b>agreement</b> with the binding constant ratios of the two alcohols. From 32 data sets collected at the Elettra synchrotron for six short alkylic chain guest molecules, we evaluated the binding constant ratios with a good internal consistency. The relative binding constants for these six alcohols were evaluated from the entire statistical sample (EtOH, 8. 8 > 1 -PrOH, 2. 2 > MeOH, 1. 3 > 2 -PrOH, 1. 00 > 2 -BuOH, 0. 32 > 1 -BuOH, 0. 11, using 2 -PrOH as reference with an arbitrary value of 1) and are in good agreement with the structural parameters of host–guest interactions observed in the corresponding crystal structures. In particular, the binding constant decreases with the increase in the host–guest H-bond distance, which follows the increase in the length of the alkyl chain of the alcoholic guest. Moreover, quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements and fluorescence data have been compared and discussed with respect to the relative affinity scale obtained by crystallography...|$|R

Specifically, we compared occurrence maps for 3773 taxa from the widely-used Atlas Florae Europaeae (AFE) with digitised range maps for 2049 taxa of the lesser-known Atlas of North European Vascular Plants. We calculated the level of agreement at a 50 -km spatial resolution using average latitudinal and longitudinal species range, and area of <b>occupancy.</b> <b>Agreement</b> in species distribution was calculated and mapped using Jaccard similarity index and a reduced major axis (RMA) regression analysis of species richness between the entire atlases (5221 taxa in total) and between co-occurring species (601 taxa).

The similarity index map showed high levels of agreement for central, western, and northern Europe. The RMA regression confirmed that geographical representation of AFE was low in areas with a sparse data recording history (e. g., Russia, Belarus and the Ukraine).
