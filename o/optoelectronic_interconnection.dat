40|$|Increasing {{bandwidth}} {{demands for}} cloud computing and autonomous applications push {{the need for}} system scaling instead of transistor scaling as predicted by Moore’s Law. <b>Optoelectronic</b> <b>interconnections</b> {{have the potential to}} enable system scaling at higher bandwidth, power efficiency, and lower cost than copper wiring. The objective of this research is to demonstrate polymer-based optical waveguides with integrated optical turning structures in ultra-thin glass interposers, for fiber-to-chip or chip-to-chip optical interconnections. The fundamental material and process challenges associated with achieving this objective are encompassed in: (1) polymer-glass interfaces and adhesion, (2) lithographically-defined polymer waveguides, and (3) integrated turning structures by inclined lithography. Process guidelines for substrate preparation, adhesion enhancement, and lithographic precision of siloxane-based polymer waveguides in glass were established by fundamentally breaking down and optimizing each process step. In addition, a new process was demonstrated to achieve, for the first time, waveguides with integrated turning structures with self-alignment and symmetry in a single exposure. The new process was enabled by fabricating pre-existing, direct-coated, metallic masks before the inclined exposure step. The demonstrated structures were imaged by polished cross-sectioning and Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM). M. S...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2000 The {{combination}} of optoelectronic arrays consisting of optical emitters and detectors with processing electronics constitutes {{the basis of}} smart pixel arrays. These architectures present an attractive basis for optoelectronic systems. Ideally, they combine the efficiency of electronic circuits with the interconnection capabilities of optics to achieve improved performance or implement new functionalities.

These concepts are first developed for a single pixel, and then generalized to in a matrix formalism for an arbitrary smart pixel array. An important part of a smart pixel array is the electronic circuits required to interface the optoelectronic devices and to perform the necessary signal processing tasks.

40|$|Introduction and System Architecture It is {{predicted}} that the i/o requirements of future generations of integrated circuits will exceed one terabit/s [1].

We describe the completed design of a demonstrator system being developed to investigate the free-space <b>optoelectronic</b> <b>interconnection</b> of silicon VLSI chips with aggregate i/o data rates in the Tbit/s domain [3].

40|$|Abstract: This paper proposes an {{efficient}} fault tolerant routing algorithm {{for the class}} of optoelectronic networks. Extended <b>Optoelectronic</b> Cube <b>interconnection</b> network; EOC for short; is introduced as a new member of this family. EOC is constructed from multiplying the hypercube as a factor network by it self. In this paper we utilize the features of optoelectronic networks which use both of electronic and optical networks. The EOC utilizes the good features of the Hypercube network due to its attractive features in terms of connectivity, semantic, low diameter, and multiple alternative paths {{in addition to the}} extended Optoelectronic capabilities of using both electronic and optical technologies. In this new proposed algorithm, each node A starts by computing the first level unsafety set, A S 1, composed of the set of unreachable direct neighbours. It then performs m- 1 exchanges with its neighbours to determine the k-level unsafety sets A S k for all 1 ≤ k ≤ m, where m is an adjustable parameter between 1 and 2 n. The k-level unsafety set at node A represents the set of all faulty nodes at Hamming distance k from A which either faulty or unreachable from A due to faulty nodes or links.

40|$|OTIS {{networks}} are interconnection networks amenable to deployment as hybrid networks containing both electronic and optical links. Deficiencies as regards symmetry {{led to the}} subsequent formulation of biswapped networks which were later generalized to multiswapped networks so as to still enable optoelectronic implementation (as it happens, multiswapped networks also generalize previously studied hierarchical crossed cubes). Multiswapped networks of the form Msw(H;G) are known to possess good (graph-theoretic) properties as regards their use as (<b>optoelectronic)</b> <b>interconnection</b> networks (in distributed-memory multiprocessors) and in relation {{to those of the}} component networks G and H. Combinatorially they provide a hierarchical mechanism to define new networks from existing networks (so that the properties of the new network can be controlled in terms of the constituent networks). In this paper we prove that if G and H are Hamiltonian networks then the multiswapped network Msw(H;G) is also Hamiltonian. At the core of our proof is finding specially designed Hamiltonian cycles in 2 -dimensional and heavily pruned 3 -dimensional tori, irrespective of the actual networks G and H we happen to be working with.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent studies have {{revealed}} that Optical Transpose Interconnection Systems (OTIS) are promising candidates as future high-performance parallel computers. In this paper we have proposed an efficient routing algorithm for Optical transpose Interconnection System. Some topological properties for the OTIS-Networks are derived including size, degree, diameter, and number of links. The proposed routing algorithm and the derived properties are general for all OTIS-Network, which will save the researchers effort to work on each on the OTIS-Networks individually. Two well-studied OTIS-Networks; OTIS-mesh and OTIS-hypercube are presented furthermore a broadcasting algorithm for OTIS-networks is discussed. This study provides new means for further testing {{the viability of the}} OTIS as alternative parallel computer architecture. Index Terms: <b>Optoelectronic</b> systems, OTIS, <b>interconnection</b> networks, parallel algorithms. optical technologies offer several fronts to improve this trade-off. The improved transmission rate, power consumption, and signal interference are few examples on these fronts [2, 10, 11, 12, 14]. Optoelectronic and optical networking will become the key enabling technologies of the future communications infrastructure through the elimination of the difficult limitation of bandwidth and bit-error rate inherent in traditional electromagnetic signal-based communications [5, 6]. Electromagnetic signals carried over copper (or coaxial) wires suffer from loss of strength and are subject to errors due to noise and hence such systems have limited data rates [13]. When copper or coax is replaced by fiber technology the achievable bandwidth is in excess of 50 terabits/second with an almost zero bit-error rate [13]. The full implications of essentially huge bandwidth and extremely low loss rates are only beginning to be recognized and will radically reshape the future network technologies. While in the past the communication link was the bottleneck, this link now holds the potential to become the enabler of new modes of computing far beyond those existing today [13]. 1...|$|R
