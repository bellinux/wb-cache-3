40|$|Most of {{the surveys}} in social {{sciences}} generally consist of <b>ordinal</b> <b>variables.</b> Sometimes researchers need to model behaviour of <b>ordinal</b> <b>variables</b> in simultaneous equation system involving many endogenous <b>ordinal</b> <b>variables.</b> This situation {{leads to a}} very complex likelihood function which is extremely hard to solve. The solutions suggested in the literature are even harder to understand by applied researchers. The present study suggests a simulation method to avoid this problem altogether by converting <b>ordinal</b> <b>variables</b> into continuous variables and use standard simultaneous regression models. The proposed method involves generating random numbers from continuous probability distributions (uniform and truncated normal distributions) within a discrete probability distribution. This method can be fruitfully be used in ordered logit and probit models. The limitations of this method are also discussed. ...|$|R

This class of methods incorporates some well-known techniques but also offers a series of interesting new alternatives for {{the analysis}} of nominal or quantitative <b>variables.</b> <b>Ordinal</b> <b>variables</b> have received hardly any attention in this class of methods, and are usually treated as if they are quantitative variables.

It can be considered an intermediate problem between regression and classification. Examples of ordinal regression are ordered logit and ordered probit. Ordinal regression turns up often in the social sciences, for example in the modeling of human levels of preference (on a scale from, say, 1-5 for [...] "very poor" [...] through [...] "excellent"), as well as in information retrieval.

40|$|The use of {{categorical}} variables in regression modeling is discussed. Some pitfalls {{in the use}} of numerically scaled <b>ordinal</b> <b>variables</b> are considered. ∗Prepared for delivery {{at the annual meeting of}} the Midwest Political Science Association, Chicago Illinois, April 2 - 5, 2009. In the day-to-day practice of social science, nominal and <b>ordinal</b> <b>variables</b> are the pre-dominant variable types. Survey data sets may contain the occasional numerical variable like “age ” (in years), but that type is grossly outweighed by the categorical indicators. Categor-ical variables are usually subdivided into “nominal ” and “ordinal ” types. The use of <b>ordinal</b> <b>variables</b> is the main focus of this paper. The presentation is not aimed at methodologists, but rather at practitioners who work with these very common data types. The basic idea that differentiates <b>ordinal</b> <b>variables</b> is that, in the eye of the person who uses the data, an observation’s membership in one category can somehow be interpreted as “less ” or “more ” than another observation’s membership in a different category. <b>Ordinal</b> <b>variables</b> may be based on judgment scales, so the ordering is not purely in the mind o...|$|R

40|$|Many quality {{characteristics}} {{of products or}} services are commonly evaluated on ordinal scales with a finite number of categories. A systematic analysis of categorical variables collected over time may be very useful for a profitable management strategy. In order to measure customer satisfaction or quality improvement in a process, two or more quality characteristics are often conjointly measured and summarized by suitable indexes. A common practice suggests evaluating a synthetic index by mapping each outcome of a multivariate <b>ordinal</b> <b>variable</b> into numbers. This procedure is not always legitimate from the measurement theory point of view. In this paper an alternative approach based on the algebraic theory of the ordered sets is proposed. This method avoids mapping multivariate components into numbers. Multivariate <b>ordinal</b> <b>variable</b> components are synthesized by ordering the multivariate sample space. The ordering criterion is defined {{on the basis of the}} specific {{characteristics of}} the process at hand.

This paper presents new results about the proper-ties of the optimal solution to this problem, and also discusses in detail the convergence of an alternating least squares algorithm. The set of sealings of an <b>ordinal</b> <b>variable</b> is a convex poly-hedral cone, which thus {{plays an important role}} in optimal scaling methods for the {{analysis of}} ordinal data. Monotone analysis of variance, and correspondence analysis subject to an ordinal constraint on one of the factors are both canonical analyses of a convex polyhedral cone and a subspace. Optimal multiple regression of a dependent <b>ordinal</b> <b>variable</b> on a set of independent ordinal variables is a canonical analysis of two convex polyhedral cones as long as the signs of the regression coefficients are given.
