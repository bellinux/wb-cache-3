5|$|Scholars {{agree that}} there are no {{completely}} reliable methods <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> exact chronology of musical instruments across cultures. Comparing and organizing instruments based on their complexity is misleading, since advancements in musical instruments have sometimes reduced complexity. For example, construction of early slit drums involved felling and hollowing out large trees; later slit drums were made by opening bamboo stalks, a much simpler task.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the determination of the windspeed and direction. These change over time, and also due to changes in location, altitude, or wind shear. This demanded an accurate determination of the wind in the general area of the target, and would normally be highly inaccurate if dialled in at the mission start. Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> wind. In the case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.|$|E
5|$|A {{convenient}} means <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> {{order of}} a given sigmatropic rearrangement is to number the atoms of the bond being broken as atom 1, and then count the atoms in each direction from the broken bond to the atoms that form the new σ-bond in the product, numbering consecutively. The numbers that correspond to the atoms forming the new bond are then separated by a comma and placed within brackets to create the sigmatropic reaction order descriptor.|$|E

40|$|Ultrasound wave {{propagation}} in bounded media results in {{change of the}} echo-pulse shape, therefore the use of traditional method <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> propagation time of the ultrasound pulse based on use of threshold device (comparator) gives a large error of measurement. To reduce this error the new methods <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>determining</b> <b>of</b> echo-pulse propagation time are proposed in this paper. The first method is the method based {{on the use of}} two comparators, the second one is the method based on second-order polynomial approximation of the echo-pulse envelope. Analysis showed that the steeper the rising edge of the echo-pulse envelope, the less <b>the</b> error <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulse start time. The more the difference between comparator thresholds the less <b>the</b> error <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulse start time. Application of the method of two comparators gives two times systematic error reducing. Minimal sampling of input signal is <b>determined</b> for <b>the</b> method based on echo-pulse envelope. Dependence of the error at start echo-pulse determining on adjacent samples amplitude ratio is obtained. Application of echo-pulse envelope gives three times systematic error reducing...|$|R

5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks {{relied on}} the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{wished to}} be sent to France, but was {{required}} first to take a course in French. In the meantime, he was assigned to a convalescent hospital. Shortly before being sent overseas, Marquis was assigned to Camp Forrest in Lytle, Georgia, an engineering camp, where he found himself treating victims of the beginning of the 1918 flu pandemic. Marquis arrived in England just as the war ended; the flu epidemic, however, had not. He continued to Cannes, where he was assigned the task <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> capacity of hotels for use as hospitals. In January 1919 he was assigned to the Hotel Metropole as assistant to the attending surgeon. They were soon overwhelmed with influenza cases. Marquis himself came down with flu but continued working. He was reassigned to the Hotel Suisse in Nice, but, still ill, was ordered back to the US. During the long wait for transport home, he took up medical duties in Gironde, finally docking in the US in June.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{left the}} Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began {{attending}} {{classes at the}} University of Edinburgh. He {{had the opportunity to}} attend the University of Cambridge, but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of Edinburgh University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy. He did not find his classes at Edinburgh University very demanding, and was therefore able to immerse himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair. There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, but his chief concerns regarded the properties of polarised light. He constructed shaped blocks of gelatine, subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly. Through this practice he discovered photoelasticity, which is a means <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> stress distribution within physical structures.|$|E

5|$|On 23 February 1948, No.23 Squadron was redesignated No. 6 Squadron. The {{unit was}} based at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland and {{equipped}} with Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. No 6 Squadron formed part of No.82 Wing, and was {{primarily responsible for}} training aircrews to serve with the wing's two front line units; No.1 and No.2 Squadrons. Its training effort was increased from 1950 when No.1 Squadron was deployed to Malaya as part of Australia's contribution to the Malayan Emergency. During October that year three of No.6 Squadron's Lincolns were deliberately flown through the cloud which resulted from the first British atomic bomb test (Operation Hurricane) {{which took place in}} the Montebello Islands off Western Australian. These aircraft had the role <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> level of radioactivity caused by the atomic blast, and No.6 Squadron performed similar duties for the subsequent British atomic bomb tests at Maralinga, South Australia. Several Lincolns were so heavily contaminated with radioactivity during these flights that they could not be flown again. The squadron lost three Lincolns in one day on 8 April 1953 when one was written off after its undercarriage collapsed while landing at Amberley and a further two were destroyed when they collided on the ground at Cloncurry, Queensland; no aircrew were injured in these accidents.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the tank the artillery was no longer required to aid the infantry by destroying obstacles and machine gun positions. Instead, the artillery assisted by neutralising the German artillery with Counter battery fire. British Army researchers under Lieutenant William Lawrence Bragg developed sound ranging, a method <b>of</b> <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> location of hostile artillery from the sound of its guns firing. A Counter Battery Staff Officer (CBSO) was appointed at each corps to co-ordinate the counter battery effort, collating reports from sound ranging and Royal Flying Corps observers. By the end of the war, it was realised that the important effect of the barrage was to demoralise and suppress the enemy, rather than physical destruction; a short, intense bombardment immediately followed by an infantry assault was more effective than the weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916.|$|E
