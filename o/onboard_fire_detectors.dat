40|$|Rack type {{warehouses}} {{are different}} from general buildings in the kinds, amount, and arrangement of stored goods, so the fire risk of rack type warehouses is different from those buildings. The fire pattern of rack type warehouses is different in combustion characteristic and storing condition of stored goods. The initial fire burning rate is different in the surface condition of materials, but the running time of fire is closely related {{with the kinds of}} stored materials and stored conditions. The stored goods of the warehouse are consisted of diverse combustibles, combustible liquid, and so on. Fire detection time may be delayed because the residents are less than office and commercial buildings. If <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> installed in rack type warehouses are inadaptable, the fire of the warehouse may be the great fire because of delaying of fire detection. In this paper, we studied what kinds of <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> are optimized in early detecting of rack type warehouse fire by real-scale fire tests. The <b>fire</b> <b>detectors</b> used in the tests are rate of rise type, fixed type, photo electric type, and aspirating type detectors.

In general, the smoke <b>fire</b> <b>detector</b> is broken by dust which flow in smoke detection chamber. In order to conduct accelerated life test of smoke <b>fire</b> <b>detector</b> dust is set accelerated factor in this paper. The dust is fly-ash which is test particle 5 th regulated by KS A 0090. The dust accelerated level is 60 g, 180 g and 360 g and failure time is measured by smoke sensitivity testing. It is considered to failure of detector if detector don't operate within 30 secconds when subjected to an air stream having a velocity of 20 cm/s~ 40 cm/s containing smoke with a concentration of 15 % of rate of light-response of 1 m.
