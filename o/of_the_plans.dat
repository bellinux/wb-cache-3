5|$|A new {{government}} center {{was to be}} built on the hills northeast of Manila, or what is now Quezon City. Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in Quezon City but several key government offices still reside in Manila.

5|$|After {{receiving}} highly exaggerated {{reports about}} the role of the Christians and their help to the British during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, Tipu decided to minimise the threat to his kingdom from the British and banish the Christians of Canara.

5|$|In 1913 the Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act {{was passed}} by Parliament and Pembroke College took the {{opportunity}} to place Framlingham into the guardianship of the Commissioner of Works. The undulating Inner Court was levelled up to its present form as part of the Commissioner's maintenance works. During the Second World War, Framlingham was an important defensive location for British forces; at least one concrete pill box was built near to the castle as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> to counter any German invasion, and Nissen huts were erected and a lorry park created in the Bailey.|$|E

5|$|Shoup opposed {{military}} action against Cuba, warning against any attempt to intervene militarily against Fidel Castro. He was initially not involved or aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> for the Bay of Pigs invasion. He {{was asked by the}} Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to furnish an officer, but became furious when he learned the CIA was requisitioning Marine supplies without his permission. He finally learned the intent of the CIA when the officer, Colonel Jack Hawkins, contacted him {{on the night of the}} invasion, pleading with him to appeal to Kennedy for air support. Following the failure of the operation, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were blamed, which Shoup thought was unfair, as they had not been aware of the early planning.|$|E
5|$|The New York Legislature {{passed a}} law in 1869 authorizing the {{creation}} of a large public park on the spot and the creation of the Board of Trustees of the Washington Park of the City of Albany (later Commissioners). John Bogart and John Cuyler drew the plans for Washington Park in 1870. Bogart had worked for Olmsted and Vaux on Central Park in New York and later Bogart was the chief engineer for the New York City Department of Parks from 1872 to 1877. From 1869 to 1872 R.H. Bingham was the chief engineer in charge of the drafting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> and the supervision of construction, after 1872 his assistant William S. Egerton took charge. It was under Egerton that the formal garden settings were planted.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts and}} tribunals were {{initially}} housed in a building in Birgu. After the Order moved their headquarters to Valletta, a new Castellania {{was built in the}} new capital. Meanwhile, the original Castellania in Birgu was converted into the Inquisitor's Palace in 1574. The building of a Castellania was made in the original plans of Valletta. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> for the Castellania was also to be built within the reserved area of the auberges of the knights, known as the Collacchio, but limiting access to a vast area in Valletta was found to be unpractical and the initiative was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{beginning}} of the American Revolutionary War, Spanish governor, Bernardo de Galvez, in New Orleans assisted the American rebels with weapons, food, blankets, tents and ammunition. The Spanish lieutenant governors at St. Louis also aided the colonials, particularly the forces of George Rogers Clark during the Illinois campaign. After the official entry of Spain into the American Revolutionary War in June 1779 {{on the side of the}} Americans and the French, the British began preparing an invasion to attack St. Louis and other Mississippi outposts. However, St. Louis was warned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plans,</b> and residents began to fortify the town.|$|E
5|$|With the {{progression}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plans,</b> the enhanced A Company was tasked with planning for {{an assault on}} the village of Magbeni, to the south of Rokel Creek, while the SAS would aim to release the captive Royal Irish soldiers by assaulting Gberi Bana, on the north bank. The Magbeni assault had several purposes: to neutralise weapons in the village which could disrupt the SAS operation, to distract the West Side Boys in Magbeni and prevent them from crossing Rokel Creek to interfere with the operation in Gberi Bana, to defeat the West Side Boys and destroy their military capabilities, and to recover the Royal Irish patrol's vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the failed}} Nordic bid to host the Euro 2008, Lerkendal was, along with Ullevaal Stadion, {{proposed}} as Norwegian venues. To reach the required spectator capacity of 30,000 seats, the plans called for {{the roof of the}} Adidas stand to be removed to allow for a temporary third tier. Additional seating would be created by adding a single row {{at the bottom of the}} four stands, and building capacity in the corners. The proposal would have given a spectator capacity of 30,849, although it would have been reduced after the championship by removing the extra tier. Similar plans were launched for the Norwegian–Swedish bid for Euro 2016, where the cost of the stadium upgrades was estimated at NOK800 million. In 2007, the club management stated that they wanted to sell out all matches before they made further expansions to the stadium, independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> to host the Euro. Construction of stands in the corners could give 4,000 additional seats, although these would be the most costly to build and at the same time give the worst view of the pitch. Construction could be done by first building two of the corners. Since then, Rosenborg has experienced a significant drop in attendance. The failed Trondheim bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics, launched in 2007, called for Lerkendal to be the Olympic Stadium and host the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E

Criterias addressed to quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> network, is examined through several qualitative interviews with actors from different sectors connected to the energy system. The analysis concludes that, as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> not being binding, and <b>the</b> anchoring <b>of</b> <b>the</b> content seems limited between actors in <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> network, Energiplan Fyn does not currently possess sufficient potential to support a strategic transformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> energy sector in Funen...|$|R

5|$|As {{proposed}} by the Admiralty, Moore's plans for the new attack on Kaafjord involved the Home Fleet's aircraft attacking the region over several days. While the fighter aircraft involved in the previous raids had used only their machine guns to strafe German defences {{in order to reduce}} the threat they posed to the Barracudas, it was decided to use some of these aircraft as dive bombers during Operation Goodwood. In preparation, the two squadrons of Corsairs and single squadron of Grumman F6F Hellcats selected to participate in the attack received training in dive-bombing tactics during the period between Operations Mascot and Goodwood. Another new element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> was a decision to use Fleet Air Arm aircraft to drop mines near Tirpitz and the entrance to Kaafjord. The mines dropped near the battleship were to be fitted with time-delay fuses, and it was hoped that the explosions of these devices would cause Tirpitzs captain to try to move the warship into safer waters and pass through the minefield at the fjord's entrance. During the period before Operation Goodwood, the Home Fleet's flying squadrons conducted training exercises using a target range at Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland; the terrain in this area is comparable to that around Kaafjord, and the loch had also been used for this purpose as part of the preparations for Operation Tungsten.|$|E
5|$|Dean {{later said}} {{he had tried to}} commit suicide because he feared he would break under torture and divulge {{critical}} intelligence to the North Koreans. He had been aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plans</b> for Operation Chromite, and feared he would reveal the information to the North Koreans under torture. Still he remained defiant during interrogations, refusing to divulge any information and acting unafraid, sometimes laughing off threats. He was given better treatment than most UN prisoners in North Korea, as he was regularly fed and rarely subjected to interrogations after his initial capture. He tried several times to escape but failed in doing so. He may have been moved to Manpo when the UN forces took P'yongyang, and returned when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the war and forced the UN forces back.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, {{a tunnel}} was {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the Connector, traveling underneath Horace J. Bryant Drive; however, the idea was rejected by Mayor James Whelan and the City Council as it would have displaced many homes in the area. The same year, Mirage Resorts president Steve Wynn proposed a new casino resort in the marina district, and stated that resort would not be built unless there was better access to the site. Additional plans were later researched, and six different plans were proposed. The plans included the tunnel underneath Horace J. Bryant Drive, a tunnel underneath the adjacent Penrose Canal, two alternative tunnel locations, the elevated highway above the wetlands, and the improvement of existing streets to direct traffic through the city. Transportation officials determined all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>plans,</b> except for the first two tunnel proposals, to have significant drawbacks.|$|E
