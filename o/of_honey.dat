5|$|Varroa {{destructor}} is a parasitic mite that colonizes beehives and preys on {{honey bees}} by consuming their hemolymph. Varroa mites parasitize all types <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> bees (workers, nurse bees, larvae) {{depending on their}} life cycle stage. During the phoretic stage, Varroa prefer to attach to nurse bees as this results in higher fitness leading into the reproductive stage. The mites then feed on larvae during their reproductive stage and increased fitness leads {{to an increase in}} mite fecundity (# of female offspring). Due to Varroas ability to feed on all types <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> bees, they are one of the biggest threats to colonies, especially over winter.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bumblebees}} {{are social}} insects that form colonies {{with a single}} queen. The colonies are smaller than those <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> bees, growing to as few as 50 individuals in a nest. Female bumblebees can sting repeatedly, but generally ignore humans and other animals. Cuckoo bumblebees do not make nests; their queens aggressively invade the nests of other bumblebee species, kill the resident queens and then lay their own eggs, which are cared for by the resident workers.|$|E
5|$|Some species {{including}} honey bees, bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are {{adapted for}} feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source {{and the latter}} primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> bees.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePollen spectrum, {{physicochemical}} {{parameters and}} volatile fraction <b>of</b> Corsican "spring" <b>honeys</b> were investigated {{with the aim}} of developing a multidisciplinary method for the qualification <b>of</b> <b>honeys</b> in which nectar resources are under-represented in the pollen spectrum. Forty-one Corsican "spring" honeys were certified by melissopalynological analysis using directory and biogeographical origin of 50 representative taxa. Two groups <b>of</b> <b>honeys</b> were distinguished according to the botanical origin <b>of</b> samples: "clementine" <b>honeys</b> characterized by the association of cultivated species from oriental plain and other "spring" honeys dominated by wild herbaceous taxa from the ruderal and/or maquis area. The main compounds <b>of</b> the "spring" <b>honey</b> volatile fraction were phenylacetaldehyde, benzaldehyde and methyl-benzene. The volatile composition <b>of</b> "clementine" <b>honeys</b> was also characterized by three lilac aldehyde isomers. Statistical analysis of melissopalynological, physicochemical and volatile data showed that the presence of Citrus pollen in "clementine" honeys was positively correlated with the amount of linalool derivatives and methyl anthranilate. Otherwise, the other "spring" honeys were characterized by complex nectariferous species associations and the content of phenylacetaldehyde and methyl syringate...|$|R
5|$|There {{are several}} {{lookalike}} species found in North American {{with which the}} Appalachian waxy cap might be confused. Hygrocybe cantharellus is a bright red mushroom that has smaller fruit bodies and a more slender stipe than H.appalachianensis. It also has smaller spores, measuring 7–12 by 4–8µm. Hygrocybe reidii, found in Europe and northeastern North America, has flesh with a sweet odor that reminiscent <b>of</b> <b>honey.</b> This smell is sometimes weak and only noticeable when the tissue is rubbed, or when it is drying.

5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers very heavily and is an excellent producer <b>of</b> <b>honey.</b> It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in hives {{since at least the}} First Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb hives are used {{in many parts of the}} world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction <b>of</b> <b>honey.</b> Quite apart from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E

Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. One scene required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple.

5|$|Contract {{pollination}} has overtaken {{the role}} <b>of</b> <b>honey</b> production for beekeepers in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined {{dramatically in the}} US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3.
