40|$|Several {{examples}} {{are used to}} illustrate how we deal cavalierly with infinities and unphysical systems in physics. Upon examining these examples in the context <b>of</b> <b>infinities</b> from Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers, the only known mathematical theory <b>of</b> <b>infinities,</b> we conclude that apparent inconsistencies in physics {{are a result of}} unfamiliar and unusual rules obeyed by mathematical infinities. We show that a re-examination of some familiar limiting results in physics leads to surprising and unfamiliar conclusions. It is not the purpose of this work to resolve the problem <b>of</b> <b>infinities</b> but the intent of this analysis is {{to point out that the}} study <b>of</b> real <b>infinities</b> in mathematics may be the first step towards delineating and understanding the problem <b>of</b> <b>infinities</b> in physics.

5|$|Other media {{based on}} the game has been published. A music album with the game's soundtrack, titled Ever 17: The Out <b>of</b> <b>Infinity</b> - Sound Collection, was {{released}} by Scitron on September 4, 2002. Scitron released another album, Ever 17: The Out <b>of</b> <b>Infinity</b> - Vocal Collection, on August 6, 2003, which collects singles previously released during a two-year period. The album includes two vocal tracks from the game, instrumental versions of them, and songs {{based on the}} events and characters of the game. A drama CD titled 2035 was released on December 18, 2002, also by Scitron. A manga adaptation of the game was drawn by Chigusa Umetani and released by Enterbrain on their Famitsu Comic Clear website from 2011 to 2012; it has since been collected in two volumes. A book, titled Ever 17 10th Anniversary Fanbook, was released at 2012's winter edition of Comiket, and included new art by Takigawa.|$|E
5|$|Peano {{arithmetic}} is equiconsistent {{with several}} weak systems of set theory. One such system is ZFC with the axiom <b>of</b> <b>infinity</b> replaced by its negation.

40|$|Abstract. This paper surveys {{applications}} of Cantor’s analysis <b>of</b> <b>infinities</b> to important {{problems in a}} wide variety of fields. Using Cantor’s diagonal method, proofs are given of the unsolvability of the Halting Problem in computer science, and of an Incompleteness Theorem in logic. Examples are given of {{applications of}} Cantor’s idea of different sizes <b>of</b> <b>infinities</b> in the fields of biology, linguistics, economics, and philosophy...|$|R

5|$|The {{greatest}} drawback of {{the classical}} Fourier transformation is a rather narrow class of functions (originals) for which it can be effectively computed. Namely, {{it is necessary that}} these functions decrease sufficiently rapidly to zero (in the neighborhood <b>of</b> <b>infinity)</b> in order to ensure the existence of the Fourier integral. For example, the Fourier transform of such simple functions as polynomials does not exist in the classical sense. The extension {{of the classical}} Fourier transformation to distributions considerably enlarged the class of functions that could be transformed and this removed many obstacles.|$|E
5|$|A novella {{by author}} Brandon Sanderson was {{released}} prior to both Infinity Blade II and III {{to serve as}} a story bridge between the games. Infinity Blade: Awakening was released as an e-book on October 4, 2011 to correspond with the announcement <b>of</b> <b>Infinity</b> Blade II. The story gives the protagonist of the first game a name, Siris, introduces the idea that the God King was one of multiple Deathless in the world, as is Siris, and has Siris and the assassin Isa journey to find the Worker of Secrets in order to kill the resurrected God King and the other Deathless. The second e-book novella, Infinity Blade: Redemption, was released on September 9, 2013 just prior to the third game. In it, Siris and the God King escape from their imprisonment by the Worker of Secrets, while extensive flashbacks show the rise of the Deathless in a future-Earth analogue. While Siris disrupts the Worker of Secret's plans, the God King confronts and is killed by the Worker.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age <b>of</b> <b>Infinity.</b> Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E

Okabe fails at first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does not go back to the time she came from, still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be able to go back far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is not the type to give up. The future Mayuri and Suzuha leave before the past Okabe and Suzuha return, with too little fuel to be able to tell where they will end up.|$|E
5|$|In {{the primary}} portion <b>of</b> <b>Infinity</b> Blade, the player {{character}} travels a largely linear path through a ruined castle and fights one-on-one battles with oversized enemies. The {{path through the}} castle {{is a series of}} discreet locations where the player can pan the camera around the stationary player character to view a fully three-dimensional area. The player taps locations highlighted onscreen to trigger either a short cutscene as the player character moves to the next location, or a sword battle with an enemy. During combat, the player controls the character's sword by swiping a finger across the screen. Players can touch icons {{at the bottom of the}} screen to dodge attacks by ducking right or left, or to block attacks with a shield, which has a limited number of uses during a single battle. Players may also parry incoming attacks with an intercepting sword move that, for example, parries an attack from the left with a swipe to the left. Each of these three counters can leave the enemy vulnerable to counterattack for a short period, but incorrect counters result in damage to the player character, as reflected in the health bar. When players fail in battle en route to the God King, the game resets to the location preceding the previous battle. Enemies can perform attacks that cannot be parried or blocked—such as a shield bash—that must be dodged. Players use two special abilities via icons atop the screen: the Super Attack temporarily stuns the opponent, and magic heals or attacks as indicated by drawing a given symbol. Both require time to recharge after use. When attacking, the player can swipe in any direction, and can do specific attack combinations to deal extra damage.|$|E

25|$|Since the 5th century BC, {{beginning}} with Greek mathematician Zeno of Elea in the West and early Indian mathematicians in the East, mathematicians had {{struggled with the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>infinity.</b> Especially notable {{is the work of}} Bernard Bolzano {{in the first half of}} the 19th century.
