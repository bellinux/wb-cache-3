Although people with disabilities are generally not "sick," they often have conditions that require greater than average use of medical and long-term care services. To address this problem, Medicaid includes several mandatory and <b>optional</b> <b>provisions,</b> including ones from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, that allow people with disabilities to work and retain coverage. This paper describes the Medicaid work incentives {{and how they are}} being implemented at the state level.

40|$|Strictly speaking, {{rent control}} refers to control by the {{government}} of the rent a landlord may charge for a housing unit. This essay will employ the informal and more general usage of the term, however, as the broader set of laws and regulations which constrain the rent or rent increase a landlord may charge. The desirability of rent control continues to be hotly debated and to generate interest quite out of proportion to its current practical importance. The reason is that [...] like the minimum wage [...] rent control has served as a case study in price regulation. For years rent control has been presented in economics textbooks as an example of regulatory folly. Recently, however, the asymmetric information revolution has caused economists to rethink the appropriate role of government, including their previous adamant opposition to rent control. The nature of rent control has changed too, evolving into a broad range of <b>optional</b> <b>provisions.</b> At least a significant minority of housing economists today would argue that rent control programmes should be evaluate...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mathematical Sciences. Applied Mathematics)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Engineers {{struggle}} {{to replicate the}} capabilities of the sophisticated human visual system. This thesis sets out to recover motion and 3 D structure of multiple rigid objects up to a similarity. The motion of these objects are either recorded in a single video sequence, or images of the objects are recorded on multiple, di erent cameras. We assume a perspective camera model with <b>optional</b> <b>provision</b> for calibration information. The Structure from Motion (SfM) problem is addressed from a matrix factorization point of view. This leads to a reconstruction correct up to a projectivity of little use in itself. Using techniques from camera autocalibration the projectivity is upgraded to a similarity. This reconstruction is also applied to multiple objects through motion segmentation. The SfM system developed in this thesis is a batch-processing algorithm, requiring few frames for a solution and readily accepts images from very di erent viewpoints. Since a solution can be obtained with just a few frames, {{it can be used to}} initialize sequential methods with slower convergence rates, such as the Kalman lter. The SfM system is critically evaluated against an extensive set of motion sequences...|$|R

40|$|The Family and Medical Leave Act (“FMLA”) recognizes an employee’s {{right to}} take leave {{to care for a}} {{qualifying}} family member. In light of the Act’s remedial nature, the intended scope of the care provision is broad, but its definitional details are sparse. As a result of the attendant interpretive discretion afforded to courts, the Seventh Circuit announced its rejection of the requirement—first articulated by the Ninth Circuit—that care provided during travel be related to continuing medical treatment. A facial analysis of the resulting circuit split fails to appreciate the fundamental difference between the Seventh and Ninth Circuits’ considerations: the distinction between physical and psychological care. Whereas physical care is readily measurable, psychological care is less defined and, consequently, ripe to facilitate FMLA abuse. Efforts to combat this potential lead courts to impose judicially devised limitations on psychological care, but judicial discretion still infuses some uncertainty into proceedings. For employers, the best remedy lies in the FMLA’s <b>optional</b> certification <b>provision,</b> which requires medical validation of an employee’s need for leave.

Customers for the Merlin IIIA included the Argentinian Air Force, the Argentine Army and the Belgian Air Force.In January 1979 production of the Merlin IIIA ended in favour of the SA226-T(B) Merlin IIIB. The IIIB differed mainly by TPE331-10U engines of increased power driving four-bladed propellers turning in the opposite direction to those of earlier models. The SA227-TT Merlin IIIC was next, introduced concurrently with the SA227-AC Metro III (the first Metro III was Fairchild c/n AC-420 and the first Merlin IIIC was c/n TT-421, Metro and Merlin aircraft at this stage being numbered consecutively with different prefixes to denote the different types), and the SA227-AT Merlin IVC version of the Metro III followed shortly after (the first Merlin IVC was c/n AT-423). The Merlin IIIC was a redesign to incorporate structural and other changes but was visually the same as the Merlin IIIB, the redesign taking place to make the aircraft compliant with Special Federal Aviation Regulation 41 (SFAR-41). The Merlin IVC version was initially certified in 1980 at up to 14,000 pounds (6,350 kg) this increasing to 14,500 pounds (6,577 kg) as engines and structures were upgraded. An option to go as high as 16,000 pounds (7,257 kg) was offered. Other improvements incorporated into the Merlin IVC were a 10 ft (3.05 m) increase in wing span (achieved by the simple expedient of removing the wingtips from the Metro II wing, bolting an extension to the end of each wing, and fitting a new wingtip, redesigned to reduce drag), TPE331-11U engines with redesigned [...] "quick-access" [...] engine cowlings and driving four-bladed propellers as on the Merlin IIIB, and other drag-reducing airframe modifications including landing gear doors that close after the gear is extended.

In terms of the latter, the Panel Report in Canada – Patent Protection of Pharmaceutical Products is pertinent in having exhibited rare reticence in stepping back from defining the principle of non-discrimination in Article 27 (1), TRIPS Agreement. While maintaining legal ambiguity, this reticence also provides space for law-making and regulatory diversity. The article reviews the three amendments to India’s Patent Act, 1970 and finds mixed use of residual flexibility and some evidence of efforts to explore legal ambiguity. Thus, despite a favourable climate to TRIPS implementation and an active transnational access to medicine campaign, legislators in India have demonstrated a degree of caution. The article concludes that this caution is best explained in terms of deepening ambivalence concerning intellectual property within the government and the changing economic interests of sections of Indian pharma...|$|R
