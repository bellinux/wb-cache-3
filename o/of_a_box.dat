However, the LDS Church broke the agreement when shortly after Arrington's death they argued that they owned part of the collection, and asked Arrington's daughter to excise portions of Arrington's diary. After legal negotiation, half <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> of the collection {{was given to the}} LDS Church Archives.|$|E

5|$|Various {{types of}} pancake {{machines}} exist, {{such as those}} that run pancake batter through a heated conveyor inside <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> unit, and those that automatically drop pancake batter onto a flattop grill. Some pancake machines, such as one developed by Crepe-Coer, cook both sides of a pancake simultaneously. Semi-automatic pancake machines also exist, which require some human interaction to function, such as the pouring of batter. Commercial pancake machines may be used in the foodservice industry, in cafeterias and by restaurants, and can serve to reduce the waste of stale pancake batter. Some hotels have pancake machines that guests are allowed to operate. They are also used in other environments in a self-service manner, such as in upscale airport lounges and hotels.|$|E

25|$|Designing {{a strong}} curved jib {{required}} Fairbairn's advanced theoretical {{understanding of the}} mechanics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> girder. The tension forces were carried by the outer, convex surface of the girder which was made of back plates being chain-riveted together. The inner surface carried a compressive load. To avoid plate crumpling, it was made as a cellular structure: an inner plate and webs formed three rectangular cells, effectively box girders in their own right. The character <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> girder is to resist torsional twisting, so a composite face built up of them is also good at resisting crumpling.|$|E

25|$|A similar {{piece of}} {{protective}} {{equipment in the}} sport of cricket {{is known as a}} box. In cricket, a box is usually worn by only a batsman, a wicket-keeper, and sometimes other close-up fielders.

25|$|A camera obscura device {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>box,</b> tent or {{room with}} a small hole in one side. Light from an external scene passes through the hole and strikes a surface inside, where the scene is reproduced, inverted (thus upside-down) and reversed (left to right), but with color and perspective preserved. The image can be projected onto paper, and can then be traced to produce a highly accurate representation.|$|E
25|$|A Brown truss {{is a type}} of bridge truss, used in covered bridges. It {{is noted}} for its {{economical}} use of materials, taking the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> truss. There may be vertical or almost vertical tension members, but there are no vertical members in compression. In practice, when used in a covered bridge, the most common application, the truss is protected with outside sheathing. The Brown Truss was invented and patented by Josiah Brown Jr. in 1857.|$|E

The latter was one of six depots belonging to different railroads which became redundant with the completion of Union Station in 1916. The depot was razed and a vast, 100,000 cubic yard excavation done with the equivalent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> car load of dynamite.|$|E

25|$|There, {{he thought}} about the case of a uniformly {{accelerated}} box not in a gravitational field, and noted that it would be indistinguishable from a box sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field. He used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks at the top <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom. He concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field, and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation.|$|E
25|$|Version 5.0, {{launched}} on March 18, 1999, and subsequently included with Windows 98 Second Edition and bundled with Microsoft Office 2000, {{was a significant}} release that supported bi-directional text, ruby characters, XML, XSLT {{and the ability to}} save web pages in MHTML format. There was enhanced support for CSS Level 1 and 2. The first release of Windows 98 in 1998 had included IE4. However, Internet Explorer5 incorrectly includes the padding and borders within a specified width or height; this results in a narrower or shorter rendering <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>box.</b> The bug was fixed in Internet Explorer 6 when running in standards-compliant mode.|$|E
25|$|Story Gathering Boxes, an ongoing, {{participatory}} artwork, {{was initiated}} in 1972.

This series democratizes access to art by allowing all viewers {{to participate in the}} creation of a collective narrative.|$|E
