According to the United Nations, the <b>overall</b> <b>availability</b> of food is not a problem, rather the problem often is the poor distribution of food {{and a lack of}} purchasing power. In the past, food security problems have been dealt with at both national and global levels. However, their impacts are limited. According to UN, the key is to tackle the problems relating to access to assets, work and assured income (related to economic security).|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates how {{variability}} in partial foraging preferences for patch types {{can be used}} as a behavioral indicator of the energetic value of that patch type, and of <b>overall</b> food <b>availability</b> in the territory. The species studied was the lesser spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos minor) and the patch types it uses are four groups of tree species (oak Quercus robur, birch Betula pendula, B. pubescens, alder Alnus glutinosa, and lime Tilia cordata), in which it feeds upon wood-living insect larvae. We partition the variation in foraging preferences into three scales. Firstly, within territories, the foraging preference for a tree species group was positively related to the prey density in that species group. That is, the preferences measure the patch types' energetic profit-abilities. This result should be general in cases like the present, where the costs of using different alternatives do not differ substantially. It may therefore be the preferred behavioral indicator in determining the relative benefits associated with different alternatives. Secondly, between the seven years of study, much of the variation in tree species group preferences was attributable to measured fluctuations in the density of one important prey species (Argyresthia goedarthella, Argyresthidae, Lepidoptera), which occurred in some years on birch, in others on alder, and in one year was virtually absent. Thus, in concordance with the previous result, the values of these tree species groups fluctuated between years according to prey density. Thirdly, between territories, we found that the preference for one tree species, lime, was higher in areas where it was more abundant. We attribute this to the fact that the density (per patch) of at least one important prey species (Stenostola dubia, Cerambycidae, Coleoptera) on lime increased with the abundance of its host tree species in the territory. That is, the <b>overall</b> food <b>availability</b> was higher in territories where lime was more common. Hence, the preference for lime estimates <b>overall</b> food <b>availability.</b> This conclusion is strengthened by two additional facts: the preference for lime correlates positively (1) with the average giving-up density of food, which has previously been shown to estimate <b>overall</b> food <b>availability</b> in the territories, and (2) with reproductive success, at least during the early stages of reproduction...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the ASR-9 installment, the system was a {{significant}} improvement over the S-band ASR radars being used by airports. The radar system was designed to meet, or exceed the need of a terminal Air Traffic Control Automation facility through the year 2005. The ASR-9 utilized a dual beam antenna, a dual channel antenna, a linear-wide range receiver and new digital processing equipment. The processor installed on the ASR-9 was far more advanced than processors that had been used on previous models. Some of the major areas that the digital processor was superior to earlier versions, the use of an optimum clutter filter bank, a fine-grained ground mapping threshold and mean level thresholding on the weather bands. Combining all of the upgraded components, the ASR-9 provided a significantly improved ability to detect aircraft in the presence of ground clutter, or weather clutter such as torrential rains. The new and improved processor on the ASR-9 also enhances the ability to detect hazardous weather conditions that could affect flight, landing and take off of various aircraft. A new solid state design and Remote Maintenance Monitoring significantly improved the <b>overall</b> <b>availabilities</b> of the ASR-9, as well as lowering the monthly operation costs.|$|R

50|$|Fisheries {{production}} in the Bay of Bengal is six million tonnes per year, more than seven percent of the world's catch. The major transboundary issues relating to shared fisheries are: {{a decline in the}} <b>overall</b> <b>availability</b> of fish resources; changes in species composition of catches; the high proportion of juvenile fish in the catch; and changes in marine biodiversity, especially through loss of vulnerable and endangered species. The transboundary nature of these issues are: that many fish stocks are shared between BOBLME countries through the transboundary migration of fish, or larvae. Fishing overlaps national jurisdictions, both legally and illegally - overcapacity and overfishing in one location forces a migration of fishers and vessels to other locations. All countries (to a greater or lesser degree) are experiencing difficulties in implementing fisheries management, especially the ecosystem approach to fisheries. Bay of Bengal countries contribute significantly to the global problem of loss of vulnerable and endangered species.The main causes of the issues are: open access to fishing grounds; Government emphasis on increasing fish catches; inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers; increasing fishing effort, especially from trawlers and purse seiners; high consumer demand for fish, including for seed and fishmeal for aquaculture; ineffective fisheries management; and illegal and destructive fishing.|$|E
