Known as Lansbury's Lido, it is partitioned <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the lake by a perimeter of buoys. There is a fee for entering the lido, and changing rooms are available. It is normally open only in the summer, typically between 10:00 and 17:30, although members of the Serpentine Swimming Club may swim all the year round from 06:00 to 09:30. The Peter Pan Christmas Day Race is only open to regular participants in the Saturday swimming competitions during the winter.|$|E

5|$|By early 1945, Germany's {{military}} {{situation was}} on the verge of total collapse. Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it was clear that the battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. Berlin was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin was cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Germany.|$|E

Powell's brigade and an infantry brigade led by Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes (future President of the United States) were among the few organized units remaining. They became the rear guard against the pursuing Confederate cavalry. At one point, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry made a charge with sabers drawn—rescuing a portion of Hayes' brigade that became cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the command.|$|E

The commandos attacked and cleared {{the village of}} Germans, capturing several prisoners, some machine-guns and four artillery pieces. Then they withdrew to their original position. The Germans reoccupied the village and formed their own defensive positions, facing the ridge line defended by the airborne division. Their positions also isolated the 9th Parachute Battalion, which was almost cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the division.|$|E

5|$|On January 14 {{the weather}} {{improved}} {{enough to allow}} air support again and the Soviet advance resumed, albeit at a slow pace. To speed up the encirclement of the strong point at Lipka, the Soviet side used the 12th Ski Brigade which crossed the ice of the Ladoga Lake and attacked the German rear lines.

5|$|The {{mission was}} {{vital to the}} success of Operation Tonga, the overall British {{airborne}} landings in Normandy. Failure to capture the bridges intact, or to prevent their demolition by the Germans, would leave the British 6th Airborne Division cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Allied armies with their backs to the two waterways.

Though aware of the British troops at the bridge, it attempted to cross by force. In the resultant two-hour battle, it was beaten back with heavy losses; half of its armored vehicles were destroyed or knocked out and its commanding officer, Viktor Gräbner, was killed in action during the assault. German attacks carried on around the British perimeter at the Arnhem bridge {{for the rest of the}} day, but the British continued to hold.|$|E

This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came to be seen as a training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|Quickly {{accelerating}} northwards, Helene made landfall on Newfoundland late on September29. Rainfall {{peaked at}} 3.05in (77.5mm) in northern {{parts of the}} island, while rainfall amounts were generally minimal across the Avalon Peninsula. A weather station in Naval Station Argentia reported maximum sustained winds of 60mph (100km/h) and a gust of 82mph (132km/h). The winds severed communications in southwestern Newfoundland and cut communications in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador from the mainland. Bell Island was cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Newfoundland due to rough seas generated by Helene, {{which resulted in the}} destruction of piers and lack of boat service.

The village also suffered water losses, electricity shortage, and landline telephones were cut off. Ports throughout the country were severely damaged. All barge access for hauling sand and stones were destroyed. The airport also sustained some damage. Seven boats ran aground during the storm. Minor damage was reported in Anguilla. Two hotels sustained roof damage, downed treed knocked down power lines causing scattered power outages, and the rough seas caused severe beach erosion. Three cargo ships and seven boats ran aground and two other boats sank.|$|E

5|$|After 649, the Tang Dynasty {{continued}} their {{war against the}} Western Turks under the reign of Emperor Gaozong, Taizong's successor. Gaozong conducted a campaign led by general Su Dingfang against the Western Turk qaghan, Ashina Helu in 657. The qaghan surrendered, the Western Turks were defeated, and the khaganate's former territories were annexed by the Tang. The Tang retreated from beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan after a Turkic revolt in 662, and lost the Tarim Basin to local revolts and Tibetan incursions in 665-670. The Tang regained the Tarim Basin in 692 and again lost it to the Tibetans in the 790s, the Four Garrisons having already been cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the Tang empire by a Tibetan conquest of the Gansu Corridor. Although the Tibetan empire collapsed {{in the middle of}} the ninth century, the Tang Dynasty lacked the means to regain dominance in the Tarim Basin and itself ended in 907 with the abdication of Emperor Ai.|$|E

In order to escape the enemy encirclement, F Company withdrew south, but G Company did not. By 08:30 the North Koreans had completely surrounded it and a supporting platoon of H Company mortarmen on Hill 303. At this point the force on the hill was cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of the American force.

5|$|By 27 April, Berlin was cut <b>off</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> of Germany. Secure radio {{communications}} with defending units had been lost; the command {{staff in the}} bunker had to depend on telephone lines for passing instructions and orders and on public radio for news and information. On 28 April, a BBC report originating from Reuters was picked up; {{a copy of the}} message was given to Hitler. The report stated that Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler had offered to surrender to the western Allies; the offer had been declined. Himmler had implied to the Allies that he had the authority to negotiate a surrender; Hitler considered this treason. During the afternoon his anger and bitterness escalated into a rage against Himmler. Hitler ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's headquarters in Berlin) shot.|$|E
