No.4 EFTS's graduates included Clive Caldwell, who became Australia's top-scoring fighter ace of World WarII.|$|E

25|$|Langston {{was twice}} {{threatened}} with destruction in the 1960s. In 1964, Washington, D.C., officials proposed closing {{the first nine}} holes of Langston Golf Course and building the Barney Circle Freeway on the land, but the National Park Service (which owned and managed the island at the time) refused {{to turn over the}} land to the city. In 1969, the city of Washington proposed closing all of Langston Golf Course and building extensive low-income public housing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course</b> and the rest of Kingman Island. The National Park Service rejected that plan as well. Perhaps the biggest threat to the course was a study by the Park Service in the mid-1960s which called for a new federally owned golf course to be built at Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm (just over the District line in Maryland). This study showed that D.C. golfers would be better served by the new course, and that Langston should be closed. But by 1977, the Oxon Cove course had yet to be built, and the plan died.|$|E

Jordan stated, [...] "Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it.

500|$|Based on {{his junior}} college {{performance}} and increased bulk, Mitchell was recruited by several major college programs, but he originally committed to John McKay at the University of Southern California. While <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course</b> with University of Alabama coach Paul [...] "Bear" [...] Bryant, McKay casually {{mentioned that he}} had received a commitment from an Alabama native. McKay assumed that Bryant wouldn't be interested in Mitchell because he was black and Alabama had no black players on their roster. Bryant swooped in and recruited Mitchell aggressively. Although Mitchell originally was a bit nervous about the reception he would receive at Alabama, {{as well as the}} amount of playing time he could garner, his family encouraged him to return home and accept Bryant's scholarship offer. Besides his family's encouragement and Bryant's assurances that his race would not be a problem, Mitchell's opinion that Alabama's School of Social Work was one of the country's best was a big factor in his decision.|$|E

500|$|Wilbur Clark was {{the first}} to build a home <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>golf</b> <b>course</b> in the 1950s. Additional homes were added to the Desert Inn Country Club Estates from the 1960s on. During his {{ownership}} of the hotel, Howard Hughes built 100 residential units on the property. After Steve Wynn purchased the resort in 2000 and announced that the real estate was too valuable to leave as a golf course, homeowners were forced to sell their properties to Wynn and his property developer Irwin Molasky. Molasky bought homes closest to the golf course for $2 million each, and homes on the perimeter of the resort for $900,000 to $1.2 million each. The Junior League of Las Vegas convinced Wynn to save one house from demolition and moved it to a lot in downtown Las Vegas to serve as its headquarters. This was the Morelli House, designed by architect Hugh Taylor for Antonio Morelli, a [...] "rare example of modernist architecture in Las Vegas". The house was subsequently listed on the City and State historic registers.|$|E
