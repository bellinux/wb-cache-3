5|$|The <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> {{was another}} {{uncertainty}} for the 1997 team. Three linemen from the 1996 team {{had been selected}} in the 1997 NFL Draft: center Rod Payne (3rd round, 76th overall), offensive guard Damon Denson (4th round, 97th overall) and defensive tackle William Carr (7th round, 217th overall). As a result, Michigan began the season with only one offensive lineman, offensive tackle Jon Jansen, who had started a game. Jansen, a junior, had 25 consecutive starts entering the season. The <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> was further weakened when left tackle, Jeff Backus, suffered a ruptured appendix. In spring practice, <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> coach Terry Malone made a plea for help during a staff meeting, searching for talent to fill in on the line. To fill the holes on the <b>offensive</b> <b>line,</b> two defensive linemen, Steve Hutchinson and Chris Ziemann were moved to the <b>offensive</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early 1970, Rymkus {{applied for}} a job as the Browns' <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> coach but {{did not get the}} position.

After just three regular-season games, however, he was replaced by George Young and transferred to the team's scouting department. Rymkus received a championship ring that year when the Colts defeated the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V.|$|E

5|$|After Trestman's hiring, {{he hired}} New Orleans Saints' <b>{{offensive}}</b> <b>line</b> coach Aaron Kromer as offensive coordinator, and the Dallas Cowboys later reported that Joe DeCamillis, {{who had been}} among the Bears' 13 head coaching candidates, would join the Bears as the team's assistant head coach/special teams coordinator. Trestman also hired Andy Bischoff and Michael Sinclair as tight ends and defensive line coaches, respectively; both coaches had worked with Trestman in Montreal.

5|$|Before the 2003 season, both Jason Whittle and Mike Rosenthal {{left the}} Giants via free agency, leaving two {{starting}} positions {{open on the}} <b>offensive</b> <b>line.</b> By {{the start of the}} Giants' pre-season minicamp, Allen was considered the favorite to start at right tackle, but he remained in competition with four other players for the two starting roles. The newly constructed right side of the <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> played poorly in the first preseason game against the New England Patriots, but Allen showed enough improvement the following week against the Carolina Panthers to be named the starter going into the regular season.|$|E

5|$|Protecting both quarterbacks was {{a strong}} <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> {{anchored}} by All-American guard Rodney Hudson, a two-time winner of the Jacobs Blocking Trophy, a four-time recipient of all-conference honors and {{a finalist for the}} Outland Trophy. Hudson and the <b>offensive</b> <b>line</b> also protected Florida State's running backs. Foremost among these was sophomore Chris Thompson, who led the team with 687rushing yards. Thompson was predicted to start the ACC Championship game because of his performance in the regular season and because fellow running backs Ty Jones and Jermaine Thomas were injured. Taken together, Florida State's offense was 52nd in total offense, accumulating 391yards per game.|$|E
