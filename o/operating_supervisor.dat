Towards a secure system at each level of design, this paper addresses the security aspects related to Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures, foreseen as the communication infrastructure of next-generation embedded devices.

We present the architecture of a Data Protection Unit (DPU) designed for implementation within the Network Interface (NI). The DPU supports the capability to check and limit the access rights (none, read, write or both) of processors requesting access to data locations in a shared memory - in particular distinguishing between the <b>operating</b> roles (<b>supervisor</b> or user) of processing elements. We explore different alternative implementations and demonstrate how the DPU unit does not affect the network latency if the memory request has the appropriate rights.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an intelligent multiple-controller {{framework for the}} integrated control of throttle, brake and steering subsystems of realistic validated nonlinear autonomous vehicles. In the developed multiple-controller framework, a fuzzy logic-based switching and tuning <b>supervisor</b> <b>operates</b> {{at the highest level}} of the system and makes a switching decision {{on the basis of the}} required performance measure, between an arbitrary number of adaptive controllers: in the current case, between a conventional Proportional-Integral- Derivative (PID) controller and a PID structure-based pole-zero placement controller. The fuzzy supervisor is also able to adaptively tune the parameters of the multiple controllers. Sample simulation results using a realistic autonomous vehicle model demonstrate the ability of the intelligent controller to both simultaneously track the desired throttle, braking force, and steering changes, whilst penalising excessive control actions - with significant potential implications for both fuel and emission economy. We conclude by demonstrating how this work has laid the foundation for ongoing neuro-biologically motivated algorithmic development of a more cognitively inspired multiple-controller framework...|$|R
40|$|In the {{counseling}} field, clinical <b>supervisors</b> <b>operate</b> between the line-level counselor and the organizational administration.

Through a survey of clinical supervisors in five western states we compared the differences among clinical supervisors who had large versus small numbers of court-referred juveniles in their programs. Data indicate that therapeutic programming and clinical supervision are different in programs with a high proportion of court ordered juvenile offenders relative to those with a high proportion of private referrals. This programming, however, may be superior to the programming and clinical supervision received in programs with fewer court-ordered juvenile offenders.

40|$|One of the {{important}} issue regarding the study {{of change in the}} organizations is "organization's environment"; the territory in which an organization form and change during its life cycle. Among other factors, environmental dimensions and features are {{the important}} indices being used to estimate and understand the environment surrounding an organization. The main {{purpose of the present study}} was to identify the effective environmental factors (dimensions and features) on the organizational entrepreneurship in the Iranian Public hospitals. The sample contained 500 <b>operating</b> managers, <b>supervisors,</b> head nurses, nurses and head officers various affairs offices in hospitals such as affirmative action office and so on. A stratified random sampling technique was utilized to select the sample. The criteria for selection of the subjects were having at least a bachelor’s degree, and three years of working experience. The data was collected via a self-report questionnaire. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to identify the environmental factors affecting organizational entrepreneurship's development in the Iranian public hospitals. The amount of KMO of environmental features was 83 %, with p -value less than 0. 05. The extracted factors explained 89 percent of the variance of environmental factors affecting organizational entrepreneurship's development in the Iranian public hospitals. The amounts of CFI, NFI, RFI and IFI for the fitted model were all above 0. 99, GFI was 0. 99, and RMSEA was 0. 05 which all verified impact of environmental factor effect on the organizational entrepreneurship. The dimensions such as dynamism, complexity, munificence, struggle and their features in were observed in the external environment of Iran public hospitals, and they had direct and significant effect on organizational entrepreneurship. Therefore, the existing circumstances in the external environment of the stated hospital are ready for persuading, and generating motivation in employees and also leading hospital toward entrepreneurial action to encounter the existing challenges.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} new {{paradigm}} to control software systems based on the Supervisory Control Theory (SCT). Our method uses the SCT to model the execution of a software application by restricting {{the actions of the}} OS with little or no modifications in the underlying OS. Our approach can be generalized to any software application as the interactions of the application with the OS are modeled at a process level as a Deterministic Finite State Automaton (DFSA) termed as a “plant. ” A “supervisor ” that controls the plant is a DFSA synthesized from a set of control specifications. The <b>supervisor</b> <b>operates</b> synchronously with the plant to restrict the language accepted by the plant to satisfy the control specifications. Using the above method of control to mitigate faults, as a proof-ofconcept, we implement two supervisors under the Redhat Linux 7. 2 OS to mitigate overflow and segmentation faults in five different programs. We quantify the performance of the unsupervised and supervised plant by using a Language Measure and give methods to compute the measure using state transition cost matrix and characteristic vector.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel intelligent multiple-controller framework incorporating a fuzzy-logic-based switching and tuning supervisor {{along with a}} generalised learning model (GLM) for an autonomous cruise control application. The proposed methodology combines {{the benefits of a}} conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, and a PID structure-based (simultaneous) zero and pole placement controller. The switching decision between the two nonlinear fixed structure controllers is {{made on the basis of}} the required performance measure using a fuzzy-logic-based <b>supervisor,</b> <b>operating</b> at the highest level of the system. The supervisor is also employed to adaptively tune the parameters of the multiple controllers in order to achieve the desired closed-loop system performance. The intelligent multiple-controller framework is applied to the autonomous cruise control problem in order to maintain a desired vehicle speed by controlling the throttle plate angle in an electronic throttle control (ETC) system. Sample simulation results using a validated nonlinear vehicle model are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the multiple-controller with respect to adaptively tracking the desired vehicle speed changes and achieving the desired speed of response, whilst penalising excessive control action.

5000|$|In November 1961, Fernando J. Corbató {{demonstrated}} at MIT {{what was}} called the [...] "Experimental Time-Sharing System". On May 3, 1962, F. J. Corbató, M. M. Daggett and R. C. Daley published a paper about that system at the Spring Joint Computer Conference. Robert C. Daley, Peter R. Bos and at least 6 other programmers implemented the operating system, partly based on the Fortran Monitor System. The system used an IBM 709, modified by Herbert M. Teager, with added 3 Flexowriters for user consoles, and maybe a timer. Each of the 3 users had two tape units, one for the user's file directory, and one for dumping the core (program in memory). There was also one tape unit for the system commands, there were no disk drives. The memory was 27 k words (36-bit words) for users, and 5 k words for the <b>supervisor</b> (<b>operating</b> system). The input from the consoles was written to the buffers in the supervisor, by interrupts, and when a return character was received, the control was given to the supervisor, which dumped the running code to the tape and decided what to run next. The console commands implemented at the time were login, logout, input, edit, fap, mad, madtrn, load, use, start, skippm, listf, printf, xdump and xundump. This became the initial version of the Compatible Time-Sharing System. This was evidently the first ever demonstration of time-sharing; there are other claims, but about special-purpose systems or with no known papers published.|$|R
40|$|This thesis proposes an {{intelligent}} multiple-controller framework for complex systems that incorporates a fuzzy logic based switching and tuning supervisor {{along with a}} neural network based generalized learning model (GLM). The framework is designed for adaptive control of both Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) complex systems. The proposed methodology provides the designer with an automated choice of using either: a conventional Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, or a PID structure based (simultaneous) Pole and Zero Placement controller. The switching decisions between the two nonlinear fixed structure controllers is {{made on the basis}} of the required performance measure using the fuzzy logic based <b>supervisor</b> <b>operating</b> at the highest level of the system. The fuzzy supervisor is also employed to tune the parameters of the multiple-controller online in order to achieve the desired system performance. The GLM for modelling complex systems assumes that the plant is represented by an equivalent model consisting of a linear time-varying sub-model plus a learning nonlinear sub-model based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network. The proposed control design brings together the dominant advantages of PID controllers (such as simplicity in structure and implementation) and the desirable attributes of Pole and Zero Placement controllers (such as stable set-point tracking and ease of parameters’ tuning). Simulation experiments using real-world nonlinear SISO and MIMO plant models, including realistic nonlinear vehicle models, demonstrate the effectiveness of the intelligent multiple-controller with respect to tracking set-point changes, achieve desired speed of response, prevent system output overshooting and maintain minimum variance input and output signals, whilst penalising excessive control actions.

40|$|Bank {{supervision}} typically receives {{little if}} any attention when banks are operating without difficulty. But when banks fail in large numbers, or large banks fail, and the system itself is threatened, supervision becomes {{a focal point for}} criticism and reform (see, for example, Conference Report, 1998, Title I, IX; Pecchioli, 1987, pp. 11 ff.; and Comptroller General of the U. S., 1977). On such occasions, institutional changes may take equal billing with the "improvement" of supervision. But as often as not, the only thing Congress can agree on is that supervision needs to be better. This usually translates into more <b>supervisors</b> <b>operating</b> with more authority. The repeated augmentation of bank supervision may give the impression that it is a solution rather that a symptom of recurring banking problems; and it {{is in the interest of}} supervisors to suggest that this is the case. Repeated disappointments about past performances never seem to undermine the promise that more and better supervisors, with more authority, will make things better in the future. The historical record suggests that this is not true. There are, however, independent reasons for questioning whether, in and of itself, more supervisors with more restrictive authority will help very much. It is argued below that the promise of supervisory enhancement is an illusion traceable to the belief that ignores the limitations of supervision in dealing with the problems that actually exist. These limitations include: (1) the existence of an intractable economic problem confronting depository institutions; (2) at least two distinct institutional failures, a fragmented regulatory system composed of multiple agencies and the growth of opportunism among banking organizations, that make it difficult to formulate and implement appropriate policies; and, finally, (3) the inability of the existing supervisory establishment to deal with these economic and structural issues. The nature of supervision is discussed. The limitations are reviewed in Section III, and the inadequacy of the current supervisory establishment to deal with the problems it must deal with to be successful is considered in Section IV. Some proposals to remedy the existing difficulties are presented in Section V. These include the consolidation of the "stand-alone" supervisory agencies with the monetary authority. ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{instrument}} {{of improving the}} social work education in the Czech Republic is the guideline The Minimum Standards of Education in Social Work issued by the Association of Educators in Social Work. According to this Standard, a student of social work, as a future social worker, shall have not only theoretical, but also practical knowledge which include professional practical training and supervision. It is also essential {{to become aware of}} the fact that a student, as a future social worker, will bear the responsibility when helping people in difficulties. Therefore, the school should ensure that any information a student receives during his/her study, is supplied to him/her in a seizable form. That is why it is important that the school provides its students with a supervision which is to improve the quality of their professional preparation, offer them insight in social worker profession and help them solve not only any divergences a student can see between theory and practice. The aim of the Dissertation is to seek higher-education supervisors´ and students´ views of the supervision implemented as a part of future social workers´ studies. Two research questions have been raised within the Dissertation. How do the students future social workers perceive the supervision which is implemented as a part of studies? What do supervisors consider as the purpose of supervision (which is realised as a part of studies) for students future social workers? The necessary information for the elaboration of the Dissertation were acquired through qualitative research. Interviewing and a semi-structured dialogue technique were chosen as the most suitable data collection method. Two research groups were chosen for the needs of the Dissertation. The first group consists of highest-class students in the field of social work at the Faculty of Health and Social Sciences and Faculty of Theology at the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice. The other research group consists of <b>supervisors</b> <b>operating</b> at the Faculty of Health and Social Sciences and Faculty of Theology at the University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice. The research showed that students perceive supervision as useful and purposeful. Students appreciate the possibility of exchanging their experience. Differences appeared regarding the duration of the supervision session. Students mostly do not know what to talk about during supervision. Greater part of the students has not a problem to confide to a supervisor, but shortcomings were also found in this respect. Regarding the supervisors of professional practical training, in their opinion, the purpose of supervision is especially to educate students, improve students' knowledge, interconnect the theory and the practice, support students in the course of their professional practical training and give students the opportunity to reflect their own practical experience. There was also raised an idea to establish supervision directly in workplaces, where students exercise their professional practical training. The Dissertation may serve as a feedback for supervisors and as an educational material for students. It can also be used to obtain a more comprehensive picture of functioning of school supervisions of professional practical training that takes place in universities...|$|R
