Following {{the model of}} contemporary self-propelled howitzers, the turret assembly is located closer to the rear than in most main battle tanks. With the engine in front, this layout is intended to grant additional protection against a frontal attack, especially for the personnel in the main hull, such as the driver. It also creates more space {{in the rear of}} the tank that allows increased storage capacity and a rear entrance to the main crew compartment allowing easy access under enemy fire. This allows the tank to be used as a platform for medical disembarkation, a forward command and control station, and an infantry fighting vehicle. The rear entrance's clamshell-style doors provide overhead protection when off- and <b>on-loading</b> cargo and personnel.|$|E

It provides good resolution both in time and frequency domains as well as wide choice of mother wavelets this makes wavelet transformation a choice when flexible approach is required. However, selecting parameters of analysis can be difficult, especially regarding mother wavelet as different mother wavelets have various properties regarding number of vanishing moments and symmetry. This paper presents studies to determine the possibility of <b>on-load</b> tap changer wear detection by applying wavelet transformation. In research, different mother wavelets were selected and their usefulness was examined. Signals to be analyzed were obtained during <b>on-load</b> tap changer operation in different mechanical conditions simulating devices wear in service.

40|$|M. Tech. Electrical Engineering. Voltage {{control is}} an {{essential}} part of the electricity transmission and distribution network system for maintaining voltage within statutory limits at the substation bus and at the consumer's point of supply. The most popular voltage control method on the transmission and distribution network system uses the <b>on-load</b> tap changer (OLTC) transformer. This study proposes the use of Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC) systems on the <b>on-load</b> tap changers when two or more mismatched transformers are connected in parallel in order to control the voltage supply to local customers. The actual voltage recordings and <b>on-load</b> tap change operations for each of the paralleled transformers have been analyzed and modelled on MATLAB/Simulink in order to develop an improved control algorithm using Fuzzy Logic Control. With the two-input, one-output FLC system with seven linguistic values giving 49 control rules, the number of tap change operations are minimized and the bus voltage is maintained within the statutory limits...|$|R
50|$|Though {{the protein}} was {{originally}} {{identified as a}} Topoisomerase I redundant factor, the TRF4 gene product was later shown to be required for sister chromatid cohesion. Wang et al. showed that Trf4 is actually a DNA polymerase, which they called Polymerase κ. This polymerase is {{also referred to as}} Polymerase σ. In the same paper in which they identified Pol σ, Wang et al. suggested a polymerase switch model for establishment of cohesion. In this model, upon reaching a CAR, the cell switches DNA polymerases in a mechanism similar to that used in Okazaki fragment synthesis. The cell off-loads the processive replication polymerase and instead uses Pol σ for synthesis of the CAR region. It has been suggested that the cohesion-specific RFC could function in off-loading or <b>on-loading</b> PNCA and polymerases in such a switch.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the behavior of vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are batteries capable of easily switching between charging and discharging modes, making them a suitable option for storing intermittent sources of alternative energies (solar, wind, etc).

These parameters, specifically the cell and tank volumes of the battery {{that are capable of}} providing consistent <b>on-load</b> voltage, were determined using data from a 13 kW solar array and a medium-sized house. Charge/discharge current values were used to run a mathematical model that provided <b>on-load</b> voltage over time graphs based on parameter input values.

40|$|The {{capabilities}} of three <b>on-load</b> and one off-load release mechanisms were investigated for normal, extreme and failure type release {{operations at the}} Institute for Ocean Technology. The failure of release mechanisms during maintenance and exercise drills is a well-documented occurrence. However, until very recently the possible causes of the failures have only been postulated but never tested in a systematic way. The current study aims for {{a better understanding of}} the operational performance of lifeboat release mechanisms with respect to normal, extreme and failure operational situations. Three twin fall davit <b>on-load</b> release mechanisms and one off-load release mechanism were tested in the experimental study. All the release mechanism design types are fully certified by the regulatory bodies. Of the three <b>on-load</b> release mechanisms, two were of older existing design types while the third was of a newer (next generation) design. Of the four release mechanisms tested, two of the mechanisms were new and never used outside of this study. Also, one of the never used new mechanisms was of an older design while the other was the next generation design. The never used mechanisms had a loading capacity of 6 tonnes, while the third <b>on-load</b> release mechanism had been in operation for some time and had a capacity of 3 tonnes. The off-load mechanism had also been in use and had a capacity of 12 tonnes. The experiments were conducted in the material testing facility of the Institute for Ocean Technology of the National Research Council of Canada and encompassed the following tests: Inline/offline <b>on-load</b> tests Inline/offline static tests Offline cyclic loading Offline damage release cable Inline off-load tests Results for the above mentioned tests will be presented in this report. Thus far all the results from in-line to offline, and from dynamic to static indicate that hook C, the next generation design, appears to have a higher degree of stability than the other two sample hooks. The off-load release mechanism was limited to inline tests and followed a different testing procedure as the <b>on-load</b> mechanisms. The off-load release mechanism worked as intended in the limited test conditions. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
