5|$|Slavery in Greek antiquity {{has long}} been an object of apologetic {{discourse}} among Christians, who are typically awarded the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial slavery had significant impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a History of Slavery in Antiquity among his works for the abolition of slavery in the French colonies.|$|E

500|$|Two other books, How the Mind Works (1997) and The Blank Slate (2002), broadly {{surveyed}} {{the mind and}} defended {{the idea of a}} complex human nature with many mental faculties that are adaptive (Pinker is an ally of Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins in many disputes surrounding adaptationism). Another major theme in Pinker's theories is that human cognition works, in part, by combinatorial symbol-manipulation, not just associations among sensory features, as in many connectionist models. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> around The Blank Slate, Pinker called Thomas Sowell's book A Conflict of Visions [...] "wonderful", and explained that [...] "The Tragic Vision" [...] and the [...] "Utopian Vision" [...] are the views of human nature behind right- and left-wing ideologies.|$|E
500|$|Burroughs {{continued}} to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, {{and a number}} of his essays dedicated to [...] "sham nature history" [...] were collected in the volume Ways of Nature, published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that [...] "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed." [...] Mabel Osgood Wright weighed in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> in a 1905 essay titled [...] "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.|$|E
