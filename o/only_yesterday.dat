25|$|Kōsuke Fujishima's manga series Ah! My Goddess {{featured}} {{a play on}} Schrödinger's Cat. During one storyline, a storage room was expanded to infinite proportions and the main characters encountered a Schrödinger's Whale, an extremely rare species {{with the ability to}} travel through space-time in a five-dimensional quantum state. The male lead in the series, Keiichi Morisato, befriends the whale and teaches it songs by real-life musical group The Carpenters (in the original English translation, it was Matthew Sweet) - but their time spent together is short, for the whale must move on or risk its safety as its wave function collapses. Because of this need to keep moving through quantum states, Schrödinger's Whales hardly ever meet, the reason they are so thin on the ground— but miraculously, Keiichi secured the future of the species by teaching it the songs. After discovering the whale had gone, he found out that it had learned <b>Only</b> <b>Yesterday</b> by itself (Missing Time in the translation) - this gave the whales a call that they could locate each other by.|$|E

[...] In his consumer guide for The Village Voice, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "choice cut" [...] rating, indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money; Some (choice cut)s are arbitrarily personal, others inescapably social."

In the second half, Simão scored his fourth and fifth league goals, unlocking the game that was tied 1–1 at half-time. They ended September with a visit to Estádio da Madeira to play Nacional. The game ended with a 0–1 loss; according to José Ribeiro writing for Record, [...] "after two warnings in the previous two games, the inevitable happened. With known defensive weaknesses, Benfica was winning because of their players intelligence (Zahovič and Petit) and talent (Simão). <b>Only</b> <b>yesterday,</b> none of that worked, given that Peseiro read the game very well and found Benfica's problems...".|$|E

[...] Influenced by The Doors, Steinman wanted to write a piece where [...] "the rhythm wasn't coming from the drums so much as the voice—the rhythm of the spoken voice and the heartbeat behind it." ...|$|E
500|$|From March to May 1989, Miyazaki's manga Hikōtei Jidai was {{published}} in the magazine [...] Miyazaki began production on a 45 minute in-flight film for Japan Airlines based on the manga; Suzuki ultimately extended the film into the feature-length film, titled Porco Rosso, as expectations grew. Due to the end of production on Takahata's <b>Only</b> <b>Yesterday</b> (1991), Miyazaki initially managed the production of Porco Rosso independently. The outbreak of the Yugoslav Wars in 1991 had an impact on Miyazaki, prompting a more sombre tone for the film; Miyazaki would later refer to the film as [...] "foolish", as its mature tones were unsuitable for children. The film featured anti-war themes, which Miyazaki would later revisit. The airline remained a major investor in the film, resulting in its initial premiere as an in-flight film, prior to its theatrical release on July 18, 1992. The film was critically and commercially successful, remaining the highest-grossing animated film in Japan for several years.|$|E

500|$|Cavallaro {{noted that}} the lyrics of the song include [...] "ryuukou no kaze", which {{translates}} to [...] "flu" [...] and is also an idiom for [...] "the flu of fashion." [...] The author further interpreted it as [...] "I always feel the urge to make a fresh start" [...] suggesting {{this could be the}} [...] "bleak acceptance of the ideological and economic codes that mold our lives in accordance with the imperative of planned obsolescence, or as a hopeful embracing of the genuine prospects of renewal and change." [...] Cavallaro suggested that despite the feminine appearance of the [...] "angel", it could be of a [...] "preternatural order", making gender or sex distinctions irrelevant. Miyazaki referred to the angelic creature as [...] "tori no hito" [...] or [...] "a bird's person" [...] which is the nickname of Nausicaä from his Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind manga and film. Cavallaro noted another visual correspondence to <b>Only</b> <b>Yesterday</b> with the oppressive urban environment and the freedom of open spaces.|$|E
500|$|The queen's party {{occupied}} {{the house in}} Réunion for just under two years. As tensions between England and France began to mount once again, this time over the conflict in Sudan, the French authorities became concerned that elements {{of the population in}} Madagascar might seize the opportunity to launch a new rebellion against French rule. The queen's proximity to Madagascar was seen as a possible source of encouragement for would-be Malagasy rebels. French authorities made an abrupt decision to remove Ranavalona and her party to Algeria, a more distant location. On February 1, 1899, with very little forewarning, Ranavalona and her family were ordered aboard the Yang-Tse accompanied by a secretary-interpreter and several maids. During the 28-day journey to the French port of Marseilles, the passengers stopped over at such ports as Mayotte, Zanzibar, Aden and Djibouti. [...] Throughout the trip, the various captains responsible for the journey were under orders to prevent Ranavalona from speaking with anyone who was not French. The party was held for several months at Marseilles before being transferred to a villa in the Mustapha Superieur area in Algiers. Ranavalona had hoped to continue on to Paris and was greatly disappointed to learn she was instead being sent to Algeria, reportedly bursting into tears and remarking, [...] "Who is certain of tomorrow? <b>Only</b> <b>yesterday</b> I was a queen; today I am simply an unhappy, broken-hearted woman." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, Sedaka was {{the opening}} act for The Carpenters on their world tour. According to The Carpenters: The Untold Story by Ray Coleman, manager Sherwin Bash [...] "deliberately" [...] fired Sedaka {{at the request}} of Richard Carpenter, {{allegedly}} because Sedaka was becoming more popular than the Carpenters. The firing resulted in a media backlash against The Carpenters after Sedaka publicly announced that he was off the tour. This was before Karen and Richard recorded Sedaka's [...] "Solitaire," [...] which became a Top 20 hit for the duo. Richard Carpenter denied that he had Sedaka fired for [...] "stealing their show," [...] according to the widely spread rumor. Richard Carpenter responded that he and Karen were proud of Sedaka's success. Bash was fired as The Carpenters' manager shortly thereafter. According to The Carpenters Story: <b>Only</b> <b>Yesterday,</b> a 2007 UK television biography, Bash claims that he was fired by Richard following a concert in Las Vegas after Sedaka, the opening act, introduced Tom Jones, who was in the audience. Bash states that it is customary for the headliner (in this case, The Carpenters) to introduce special guests. Bash stated that, after Richard fired him, Richard also fired Sedaka from the tour and Sedaka then fired Bash.|$|E

2500|$|Homosexuals were {{portrayed in}} several pre-code {{films such as}} Call Her Savage (the first film to show homosexuals), Our Betters, Footlight Parade, <b>Only</b> <b>Yesterday,</b> Sailor's Luck, and Cavalcade. Although the topic was dealt much more openly than in the decades that followed, the {{characterizations}} {{of gay and lesbian}} characters were usually derogatory. Gay male characters were portrayed as possessing a high tone voice and a flighty personality. They existed merely as buffoonish supporting characters. In films like Ladies They Talk About lesbians were portrayed as rough, burly characters, but in DeMille's The Sign of the Cross a female Christian slave is brought in front of a Roman prefect and seduced in dance by a statuesque lesbian dancer. Fox nearly became the first American studio to use the word [...] "gay" [...] in reference to homosexuality, but the SRC made the studio muffle the word in the soundtrack of all reels that reached theaters. Bisexual actress Marlene Dietrich cultivated a cross gender fan base and started a trend when she began wearing men's suits, a style which was an anachronism for the 1930s. She caused a commotion when she appeared at the premiere of the 1932 pre-code film The Sign of the Cross in a tuxedo replete with top hat and cane. The backlash against homosexual characters appearing in films was rapid. In 1933 Hays declared that all gay male characters would be removed from pictures, and Paramount took advantage of the negative publicity Dietrich generated by signing a largely meaningless agreement stating that they would not portray women in male attire.|$|E
2500|$|John's [...] "joy {{became more}} {{for him the}} more he was diminished. … This was John, {{and this is how}} the single {{individual}} is to fulfill something similar in lesser situations. If he has first of all learned to deny himself humbly and to master his mind, then joy will also be victorious. But the first must be learned first-later, that which is greater; one is first initiated into the lesser mystery, later into the mystery." [...] Kiedrkegaard says, what about the single individual who wants to be like John? Do we all know how to deny ourseves with humility? He says, Who does not know that things like these have happened and do happen in the world-that someone who once ruled over countries and kingdoms has ceased to rule and is obliged to see a more powerful ruler take his place; that someone who once was hailed with jubilation soon, yes, so soon that the whole things {{seems to have been a}} dream, hears the same jubilation shouting another name, that someone whose commanding figure was familiar to everyone regards himself in the next moment with the anxiety of uncertainty about whether he has lost his mind or the world its memory so that it confused with him someone else; that the master whole pupil <b>only</b> <b>yesterday</b> sat at his feet must bow his shoulders today under the other's advancement; that the businessman who was kind enough to set his servant on his path now sees that his path means the benefactor's downfall; that the girl who once filled her beloved's thoughts now sits and sees his bold ambition pursuing a higher goal; that the singer whose words were on everyone's lips is forgotten today and his songs have been more than replaced; that the orator whose words echoed everywhere must now seek the solitude of the desert if he wants echo; that the friend from youth who was on an equal basis with his fellows now with amazement perceives the distance; that the lowly cottage where the parents lived, where the humble cradle stood, is now collapsing like a recollection that cannot catch up with the mighty. And yet, how strange-if you let your thoughts dwell on those distinguished people whose memory the generations have preserved, you will find that the way each individual distinguished himself is different, and you will find in turn that several are distinguished by the same thing. But in that select group you still seem to lack one place, and yet the lack is indeed a contradiction; how would the one whose task it was to be reconciled-to being forgotten-find a place in recollection? But for this very reason it is important to consider it by itself, and it is especially beautiful to do this-because no earthly reward is beckoning.
