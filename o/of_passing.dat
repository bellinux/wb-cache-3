5|$|Cleveland posted an 11–1 {{record in}} 1951, losing their only game to the San Francisco 49ers {{in the season}} opener.

5|$|Despite {{playing as}} a {{deep-lying}} midfielder, Carrick does {{not rely on}} pace, physical attributes and tackling like a typical ball-winning midfielder.

5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance <b>of</b> <b>passing</b> the gene(s) {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The gene(s) may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit the gene(s) have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
