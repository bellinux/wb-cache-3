Eco 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 <b>open</b> <b>work</b> 2 ̆ 7 {{is concerned with the}} process of making of art rather than with any finished artwork. He posits two components of open work: a multiplicity of meanings, and audience participation. In <b>open</b> <b>work,</b> artists create artwork in a way that allows ihe audience to construct multiple meanings. This is a contingent process, and the degree of openness is the measure of its contingency. lnteractive Art 2 ̆ 7 s digital technology makes <b>open</b> <b>work</b> a promising methodology, but this requires two lavers of openness: contemplative (Ec:os 2 ̆ 7 s concept) and structural (a specific quality of lnteractive Art).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a work of}} practical scholarship which re-examines issues of identity {{in the context of}} the <b>open</b> dance <b>work.</b> The debate takes the form of a symbiotic philosophical and choreographic enquiry into the identity of the <b>open</b> dance <b>work.</b> The philosophical enquiry examines the adequacy to the <b>open</b> <b>work</b> of theories of identity derived from two distinctive strands of philosophical theory, the first from the analytic tradition, the second from contemporary French philosophy. The choreographic processes which led to the creation of two <b>open</b> dance <b>works</b> constituted a central strand of the debate. Each work interrogates the adequacy of these theories of identity to the artistic theories which underpin <b>open</b> dance <b>works.</b> The first work, Intimate Memories, problematised theories of identity which were developed by analytic philosophers in the 1970 s and 80 s, and subsequently adopted by dance theorists, through an examination of their applicability to the <b>open</b> dance <b>work.</b> This strand of choreographic research revealed that, although these theories allowed <b>open</b> dance <b>works</b> to be individuated, they did not fully account for the particularities of the processual character of the <b>open</b> dance <b>work.</b> This interim conclusion led to an examination of the pertinence of Deleuze and Guattari’s ontology of the event to questions concerning identity raised by the <b>open</b> dance <b>work.</b> The second dance work, Halo in Performance, which was developed in the context of a collaborative engagement between choreographic and interactive digital arts practices, is an embodiment of Deleuze and Guattari’s process-oriented ontology of the event. This work indicates that theories of identity and/or individuation which are grounded in an ontology of flux are a more appropriate model to apply to the <b>open</b> dance <b>work</b> than those grounded in an ontology of substance...|$|R

40|$|Open working environments {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular in recent history; {{it is estimated that}} about 70 % of office spaces in the United States have open floor plans. <b>Open</b> <b>work</b> environments come in a range of configurations but tend to feature a “lack of interior walls, tend to be larger and contain greater numbers of workers, with individual workstations arranged within the office in groups”. The rise in these arrangements has led to an increased body of literature seeking to understand how working in these environments impacts workers, whether in terms of employment satisfaction or job motivation. Employers believe that these new arrangements can help to foster collaboration as well as provide practical cost savings. In addition to these benefits, {{a growing body of research}} suggests that there are a number of negative consequences for employees stemming from <b>open</b> <b>work</b> environments.
