5|$|Downhill it is {{much easier}} to topple <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel because the incline moves the line of mg closer to f. To try to reduce this {{tendency}} the rider can stand back on the pedals to try to keep m as far back as possible.|$|E
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, the {{committee}} from the Discharged Prisoner’s Aid Society asked {{to use the}} building when {{it was not in}} use for discharged female convicts from the prison at Carliol Square (1828–1925) to do laundry work and the Society continued to use it for this purpose until the turn of the century. Between 1882 and 1883 City Road was built <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lawn of the Hospital.|$|E
50|$|During {{his career}} he was {{credited}} with 90 aerial victories, 4 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Front</b> and 86 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Front,</b> including at least 15 Il-2 Sturmoviks.|$|R
50|$|Werner Stumpf (15 March 1917 - 13 October 1942) was a Luftwaffe ace and {{recipient}} of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross during World War II. Stumpf claimed 48 aerial victories, 2 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Front,</b> 23 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Front</b> and 23 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>Front.</b> <b>The</b> Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership.|$|R
50|$|Walter Matoni was {{credited}} with 34 victories in over 400 missions. He recorded three victories <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Front,</b> and of 31 victories claimed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Front,</b> 14 were four-engine bombers.|$|R
5|$|Of course, {{the angle}} of the terrain can {{influence}} all of the calculations above. All else remaining equal, the risk of pitching <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> end is reduced when riding up hill and increased when riding down hill. The possibility of performing a wheelie increases when riding up hill, and is a major factor in motorcycle hillclimbing competitions.|$|E
5|$|That day, MacArthur flew to Walker's {{headquarters}} and he later wrote: MacArthur flew <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line {{himself in his}} Douglas C-54 Skymaster but saw no signs of a Chinese build up and therefore decided to wait before ordering an advance or withdrawal. Evidence of the Chinese activity was hidden to MacArthur: the Chinese Army traveled at night and dug in during the day. For his reconnaissance efforts, MacArthur was nonetheless awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and honorary combat pilot's wings.|$|E
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{had been}} far from absent <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> in December. It flew several {{thousand}} sorties over the theatre. Its {{encounters with the}} RAF and USAAF had meant heavy losses in matériel and pilots. On the eight days of operations between 17 and 27 December 1944, 644 fighters were lost and 227 damaged. This resulted in 322 pilots killed, 23 captured and 133 wounded. On the three days of operations 23–25 December, 363 fighters were destroyed. None of the Geschwaderkommodore (Wing Commanders) expected any large-scale air operations {{by the end of}} the month.|$|E
50|$|During {{his career}} he was {{credited}} with 50 aerial victories in 371 missions. 17 victories <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Front,</b> and of his 34 victories <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Front,</b> 11 were four-engine bombers and 16 were Spitfires.|$|R
50|$|Albrecht-Lemke was {{credited}} with 25 victories, with 15 victories claimed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Front</b> and 10 <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Front.</b> This total included at least six B-24 four-engine USAAF bombers. In addition he claimed 11 aircraft destroyed on the ground on <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Front.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hafner was {{credited}} with 204 victories in 795 combat missions. He claimed 184 victories <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Front.</b> Of his 20 victories claimed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Front,</b> eight were P-38 two engine fighters. Among his claims are 55 Il-2 Sturmoviks.|$|R
5|$|Vehicles {{built in}} 1940 (only) were fitted with {{removable}} loading ramps, cable rollers {{to act as}} pulleys, and a reinforced tail gate to allow a Flak 30, mounted on a Sd.Ah. 51 trailer, to be quickly dismounted. From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> fenders and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as protection from the weather. Flak 38s were mounted on 10/4s beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn't widened until later. As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} reached the summit, Romain Bardet attacked, {{and the bottom}} had gained a twenty-second {{advantage}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> group of around thirty riders, increasing it to one minute {{at the foot of}} the Pra-Loup climb. Sky again controlled the head of the chase, with Vincenzo Nibali, Alejandro Valverde and Wilco Kelderman the notable riders distanced. Chris Froome launched an attack in the final , with Tejay van Garderen and Beñat Intxausti following. Van Garderen dropped Intxausti and passed Froome to take second place, thirty-six seconds behind stage winner Bardet. The new leaders in the classifications were Van Garderen in the general, Bardet in the young riders' and Sky in the team standings.|$|E
5|$|In 1606 Adam Mort {{bought the}} manor house and land in Astley. He was {{a wealthy man}} who built the first Astley Chapel as a chapel of ease for the parish church in Leigh. The chapel was consecrated in 1631, the year that he died. He built a grammar school that stood for over 200years until 1833, when it was {{demolished}} and rebuilt. Adam Mort's grandson, also Adam, rebuilt Damhouse in 1650 and his initials are carved in the plaque <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door. The stone and timber structure was named from the stream which was dammed to supply water to a waterwheel powering a corn mill near the house. It is possible the hall was once surrounded by a moat.|$|E
50|$|Konrad Bauer (9 February 1919 - 17 June 1990) was a Luftwaffe {{fighter pilot}} during World War II and a {{recipient}} of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.

50|$|Posthumously {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} Oberstleutnant, Johannes Seifert flew some 439 combat missions. Of his 57 victories, 46 victories were <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Western <b>Front,</b> including 3 four-engine heavy bombers and 32 Spitfires, and 11 victories <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Eastern <b>Front,</b> including 6 Il-2 Sturmoviks.|$|R

5|$|The German attack caught {{large numbers}} of Soviet Air Force {{aircraft}} on the ground. Faulty tactics – sending unescorted bombers against the Germans at regular intervals in tactically unsound formations – accounted for many more. Kesselring reported {{that in the first}} week of operations Luftflotte 2 had accounted for 2,500 Soviet aircraft in the air and on the ground. Even Göring found these figures hard to believe and ordered them to be re-checked. As the ground troops advanced, the figures could be directly confirmed and were found to be too low. Within days, Kesselring was able to fly solo <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> in his Focke-Wulf Fw 189.|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wheel.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan called}} for the units to {{maintain}} strict radio silence and secrecy {{in order to maintain}} surprise. Maps were also only half complete, identified only enemy installations, and left out flight paths, lest the document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases. Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments before take-off. This created operational confusion. Commanders only managed to get across the bare essentials of the plan. When the operation got under way, many German pilots still did not understand what the operation was about, or what exactly was required of them. They were convinced it was just a reconnaissance in force <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> and were happy to follow their flight leaders on this basis.|$|E

5|$|Kurt-Werner Brändle (19 January 1912– 3 November 1943) was a German Luftwaffe {{military}} aviator during World War II, {{a fighter}} ace credited with 180 enemy aircraft {{shot down in}} over 700 combat missions.

5|$|Although the feigned flights did {{not break}} the lines, they {{probably}} thinned out the housecarls in the English shield wall. The housecarls were replaced {{with members of the}} fyrd, and the shield wall held. Archers appear to have been used again before and during an assault by the cavalry and infantry led by the duke. Although 12th-century sources state that the archers were ordered to shoot at a high angle to shoot <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the shield wall, there is no trace of such an action in the more contemporary accounts. It is not known how many assaults were launched against the English lines, but some sources record various actions by both Normans and Englishmen that took place during the afternoon's fighting. The Carmen claims that Duke William had two horses killed under him during the fighting, but William of Poitiers's account states that it was three.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks {{went a long way}} to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over the course of the 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E
5|$|Howell {{spent eight}} months flying {{operations}} over Italy, conducting attacks against ground targets {{and engaging in}} sorties against aerial forces. While in Italy, he was credited with shooting down a total of nineteen aircraft. In one particular sortie on 12 July 1918, Howell attacked, in conjunction with one other aircraft, a formation of between ten and fifteen German machines; he personally shot down five of these planes and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He had previously been awarded the Military Cross and Distinguished Flying Cross for his gallantry in operations <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> He was posted back to the United Kingdom in July 1918. In 1919, Howell was killed while {{taking part in the}} England to Australia air race. Piloting a Martinsyde A1 aircraft, he attempted to make an emergency landing on Corfu but the plane fell short, crashing into the sea just off the island's coast. Both Howell and his navigator subsequently drowned.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 22 March, German attacks {{continued}} to push back the remaining units of the 66th Division, now supported by the 1st Cavalry Division {{and a handful of}} tanks. The composite force managed a fighting retreat, with most units avoiding encirclement. Shortly after noon the remnants of the division were ordered to retreat behind the 50th (Northumbrian) Division, which were preparing fresh defences on the original Green Line {{along the edge of the}} rear zone. The 66th Division retreated through the new defensive line by 4:00 pm, with the aid of the 5th Durham Light Infantry (DLI), which had been temporarily transferred to support them and the 50th Division took <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line. Over the following days, the divisions of XIX Corps fell back towards the line of the River Somme, where the 66th Division (plus the 5th DLI) took up positions on the west bank of the river around Barleux and Foucaucourt-en-Santerre, west of Peronne. On 24 March, the German army crossed the Somme and the 2/8th Lancashire Fusiliers counter-attacked the bridgeheads without success but continued to hold a line close to the river. Expecting a follow-up attack the next day, 149th Brigade was temporarily attached to 66th Division and both units were slowly pushed back from the banks of the Somme, withdrawing to Assevillers as night fell on 25 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the British Expeditionary Force, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, already had plans in place for an attack near Amiens. When the British retreat had ended in April, {{the headquarters of the}} British Fourth Army under General Sir Henry Rawlinson had taken <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> astride the Somme. Its left hand corps was the British III Corps under Lieutenant General Richard Butler, while the Australian Corps under Lieutenant General John Monash held the right flank and linked up with French armies to the south. On 30 May, all the Australian infantry divisions were united under the corps HQ, {{for the first time on}} the Western Front. The Australians had mounted a number of local counter-attacks which both revealed the suitability of the open and firm terrain south of the Somme for a larger offensive and also established and refined the methods which were to be used.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of inarticulates swim as {{plankton}} {{for months}} and are like miniature adults, with valves, mantle lobes, a pedicle that coils in the mantle cavity, and a small lophophore, which is used for both feeding and swimming—except that Craniids have no pedicle. As the shell becomes heavier, the juvenile sinks {{to the bottom and}} becomes a sessile adult. The larvae of articulate species live only on yolk, and remain among the plankton for only a few days. This type of larva has a ciliated frontmost lobe that becomes the body and lophophore, a rear lobe that becomes the pedicle, and a mantle like a skirt, with the hem towards the rear. On metamorphosing into an adult, the pedicle attaches to a surface, the front lobe develops the lophophore and other organs, and the mantle rolls up <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lobe and starts to secrete the shell. In cold seas, brachiopod growth is seasonal and the animals often lose weight in winter. These variations in growth often form growth lines in the shells. Members of some genera have survived for a year in aquaria without food.|$|E
