5|$|Incidentally, the {{harmonic}} telegraph directly suggested to Bell the idea <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone.</b> The reeds {{can be viewed}} as transducers converting sound to and from an electrical signal. It is no great leap from this view of {{the harmonic}} telegraph to the idea that speech can be converted to and from an electrical signal.|$|E
5|$|Versions of the {{harmonic}} telegraph {{were developed by}} Elisha Gray, Alexander Graham Bell, Ernest Mercadier and others. Its ability {{to act as a}} sound transducer to and from the electrical domain was to inspire the invention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of the telegraph and the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> gave McKinley a greater control over the day-to-day management of the war than previous presidents had enjoyed, and he used the new technologies to direct the army's and navy's movements {{as far as he}} was able. McKinley found Alger inadequate as Secretary of War, and did not get along with the Army's commanding general, Nelson A. Miles. Bypassing them, he looked for strategic advice first from Miles's predecessor, General John Schofield, and later from Adjutant General Henry Clarke Corbin. The war led to a change in McKinley's cabinet, as the President accepted Sherman's resignation as Secretary of State; Day agreed to serve as Secretary until the war's end.|$|E

5|$|Digital: A Love Story is {{a visual}} novel, or {{interactive}} fiction game, where the game's {{story is told}} primarily through text. The game is presented {{as if on a}} computer from the late 1980s running the Amie operating system (the name and visual appearance a reference to 1.x versions of AmigaOS). The player logs into bulletin board systems, or BBSs, where they read and reply to messages from other people. Messages received from other characters in the game are displayed through a different program on the computer screen. Accessing a BBS requires the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> number for that board, which the player must type in manually. Boards that require a long-distance telephone number to reach require the player to use illegally obtained long-distance calling card numbers found online. Accessing boards also requires the player to either set up a user account for that board or to know the password necessary to enter the system.|$|E
5|$|E.T. is an {{adventure}} {{game in which}} players control an alien (E.T.) from a top-down perspective. The objective {{of the game is}} to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone. The pieces are found scattered randomly throughout various pits (also referred to as wells). The player is provided with an on-screen energy bar, which decreases when E.T. performs any actions (including moving, teleporting, or falling into a pit, as well as levitating back to the top). To prevent this, E.T. can collect Reese's Pieces, which are used to restore his energy or, when nine are collected, E.T. can call Elliott to obtain a piece <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone,</b> or the player can save the candy pieces for bonus points at the end. After the three phone pieces have been collected, the player must guide E.T. to an area where he can use the phone, which allows him to call his home planet. When the call is made, E.T. must reach the spaceship in a given time limit. Once E.T. gets to the forest where his ship abandoned him and stands and waits in the designated area for the ship to come, the ship will appear on screen and take him back to his home planet. Then the game starts over, with the same difficulty level, while changing the location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> pieces. The score obtained during the round is carried over to the next iteration. The game ends when the energy bar depletes. E.T. has three lives and if he dies within those three lives Elliot will come in and revive him. E.T. can get a fourth life if the player is lucky enough to find a geranium in one of the wells. It turns into a sprite from some games that Howard Scott Warshaw made, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark.|$|E
5|$|NBC ran three BOCs, in Burbank, California, Chicago, and New York City, {{with the}} last the largest. Cline was {{stationed}} at the New York BOC for the game. In the era before satellite transmission, programming was transmitted by coaxial cable line, with the cooperation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>telephone</b> company. For this game, the Burbank BOC was to receive the feed from Oakland, insert commercials and network announcements, and send the modified feed via telephone wire to a switching station west of Chicago near the Mississippi River. An engineer was stationed there to activate the Oakland feed into the entire network when the game began, to cut it on instruction and then {{to return to his}} base. He had been told to expect at 6:58:20 Eastern Time a network announcement for Heidi, after which he was to cut the feed from Burbank, and the Heidi feed from New York would begin. This placed Burbank in effective control of whether the engineer would cut the feed, since he would act upon hearing the announcement.|$|E
