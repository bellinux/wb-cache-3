40|$|Availability of {{veterinary}} services {{is very important}} for development of livestock sector in India. In many locations apart from state veterinary services <b>other</b> <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> are also available and the veterinary service users have the choice available with them regarding the service providers. The preference of service providers depend upon the location, distance, livestock holding and capacity to pay and quality of services. A study was conducted among the livestock owners of Sangli district in Maharastra to assess the preference of the livestock owners towards a particular veterinary service provider. Majority of large farmers preferred state veterinary services and cooperative veterinary services where it had strong presence. Cooperative veterinary service can be a good alternative to the state veterinary services and the private veterinary service providers are still not preferred in the rural area. [Vet.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of age of release, strain and farmers location on growth and carcass performance of the indigenous, and two exotic strains (Harco® and Goldline®) cockerels, reared on free range; in order to ascertain the best age of release into free range from brooder houses, as well as the effect of farmers location and strain on their growth and carcass characteristics, in South Eastern Nigeria. A total of 315 cockerels comprising 87 indigenous chicks, 114 Harco® chicks, and 114 Goldline® cockerels brooded and raised up to 18 weeks of age were used in this experiment. These birds were randomly released to farmers in the villages at three different ages of 4, 8 and 12 weeks to run on free range. There were significant effects of age of release and strain on the growth characteristics, but none on the carcass characteristics. However, there was also significant effect of the zone on both growth and carcass traits measured. It was concluded that the earlier the exotic birds are released from the brooder house, the better their performance on scavenging rearing. This is beneficial as the farmer will save much from the purchase of compounded feed and <b>other</b> <b>veterinary</b> <b>services...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} {{technology}} transfer (diffusion) programmes involving amongst <b>others</b> <b>veterinary</b> surgeon <b>services</b> subsidised by the government, were {{launched in the}} former homelands of South Africa between 1980 and 1993. Many of these programmes were discontinued after the general election of 1994. In order to evaluate the adoption of technology in Qwaqwa, a former Sotho speaking homeland, two Logit models were fit using the conventional definition of an adopter and an adapted definition, which included potential adopters with the adopters. Where the conventional definition of adoption was estimated, livestock income per LSU, ram technology, roads and suppliers of livestock inputs are significant variables contributing to adoption. The results of the adapted model reveal that farming efficiency (weaning percentage), type of farmer (sheep as {{percentage of the total}} small ruminant herd) and ram technology, prove to be significant variables predicting adoption. It was also found that the characteristics of potential adopters gravitate more to adopters than to non-adopters. These results indicated that the adapted definition presented a more accurate prediction than the conventional definition. The results of this study indicate the policy necessary to further accelerate the diffusion of <b>veterinary</b> surgeon <b>services</b> by means of the development of a better infrastructure, the reintroduction of subsidised <b>veterinary</b> surgeon <b>services</b> at the sheering sheds as well as a better flow of information to farmers in Qwaqwa.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence from}} the former Lebowa to evaluate the impact of liquidity, input supply and distribution infrastructure, extension and training services on the quantities of inputs purchased and used by individual small farm-households. Secondly, it assesses the impact of various inputs used on smallholder farm productivity. The {{results from this study}} reveal that the key determinants of the main inputs purchased and used by smallholder farmers in the former Lebowa namely fertilizer, seed and <b>other</b> inputs (chemicals, <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> and feeds) are credit, non-farm incomes, extension services and location. Productivity is in turn determined by the application of fertilizer, use of other inputs, training and location. It concludes that farmers with access to credit, incomes and training and located in districts with higher potential natural resources, use more inputs and produce more than their counterparts without access and located in poor agro-ecological zones.

30|$|Only a {{very small}} {{percentage}} (4 %) of the camel owners of the present study consult <b>veterinary</b> <b>services.</b> This is low, considering the important input of veterinary care in animal husbandry. Similarly, a previous study in Nigeria reported low patronage of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> with only 21.1 % of camel farmers consulting modern <b>veterinary</b> <b>services,</b> as most respondents prefer traditional methods of treatment (Chafe et al. 2008). However, the low patronage of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> was mainly attributed to lack of available <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> (Chafe et al. 2008). The importance of patronizing veterinary care cannot be over-emphasized as past studies revealed that access to <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> considerably reduced camel calves’ mortality (Simpkin 1985). Access to veterinary care have also been shown to improve sexual maturity, hence reducing age of cow at first calving (Megersa et al. 2008). However, other factors such as inadequate plane of nutrition could also delay sexual maturity (Mukasa-Mugerwa 1981).|$|R
40|$|The {{economics}} of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> delivery among commercial poultry farmers was investigated using primary {{data collected from}} 60 respondents (50 commercial poultry farmers and 10 veterinary officers) {{with the aid of}} structured questionnaire. Data collected were analyzed using a combination of descriptive statistics (i. e. mean, percentage, standard deviation, table) and inferential statistics (i. e. multiple regression model). The results of the study showed that though the <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> delivery was structured into public and private sectors majority (60. 9 %) of the commercial poultry farmers demanded and obtained <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> from the public sector. The estimated cost function of commercial poultry farm in the study area revealed that the cost of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> significantly affected the total cost of poultry output (p = 0. 01). The estimated demand function for <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> indicated that the scale of production and distance to the nearest veterinary office were the significant determinants of the demand for <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> in the study area. The finding of the study further revealed that the propensity to supply <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> was mainly influenced by demand of poultry farmers (0. 8) and effective price {{that they are willing to}} pay (0. 8). It was recommended among others that private individuals should be encouraged by policy to participate in <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> delivery.

30|$|However, the {{privatization}} of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> in Kenya in the 1990 s (Umali et al. 1992) resulted in inadequate professional <b>veterinary</b> <b>service</b> delivery in the ASALs, as most private <b>veterinary</b> <b>service</b> providers found it not economically viable to operate in these vast areas with poor infrastructure. This had {{a negative impact on}} camel/livestock health and productivity as it hampered the provision of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> and dissemination of knowledge and information on good camel health management practices to pastoralists. The result effect was mushrooming of unskilled <b>veterinary</b> <b>service</b> providers (community-based animal health workers (CBAHWs)) and self-medication of livestock, including camels. The absence of professional <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> results in uncontrolled and unauthorized sale of veterinary drugs by agro-veterinary shops, self-medication, use of wrong veterinary drugs, injection needles and route, and overdosing of chemotherapeutic veterinary drugs (Kuria et al. 2002) leading to food safety concerns like drug residues and development of drug resistance among zoonotic organisms/diseases in milk and meat. Therefore, the liberalization of <b>veterinary</b> <b>services</b> in the camel sub-sector resulted in development of diseases that lowered productivity. The urban and export markets also developed negative attitudes towards camel milk and meat due to the likely presence of zoonotic organisms/diseases and food safety concerns, hence limiting the markets for camel products only to traditional consumers.|$|R
