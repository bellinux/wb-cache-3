Method: Undergraduate students (N[*]=[*] 180, 54 males, 126 females, 60 per year of study) completed baseline measures of demographic variables, binge-drinking episodes (BDE), TPB constructs and anticipated regret. BDE were assessed one-week later. Results: The TPB accounted for 60 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> female undergraduates' intentions and 54 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> male undergraduates' intentions. The TPB accounted for 57 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> intentions in first-year undergraduates, 63 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> intentions in second-year undergraduates and 68 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>variance</b> <b>in</b> intentions in final-year undergraduates. Follow-up BDE was predicted by intentions and baseline BDE for female undergraduates as well as second- and final-year undergraduates. Baseline BDE predicted male undergraduates’ follow-up BDE and first-year undergraduates’ follow-up BDE. Conclusion: Results show that while the TPB constructs predict undergraduates’ binge-drinking intentions, intentions only predict BDE in female undergraduates, second- and final-year undergraduates.
