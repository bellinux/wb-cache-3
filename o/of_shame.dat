40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties. It establishes {{that there may}} be an inverse relation between the rate <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties and their deterrent effects - the more people are shamed the less deterring shaming penalties become. This conclusion is based on a search model in which the costs of searching for law-abiding partners increase with the rate <b>of</b> <b>shaming,</b> and may lead to lower expected sanction for offenders. The inverse relation between the rate <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties and their effectiveness is later used to show that increasing the probability of detection, increasing the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties or reducing the number of wrongful acquittals does not necessarily increase the deterrent effects <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties (and may, in fact, decrease these effects). ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{group called}} Friends <b>of</b> <b>Shames,</b> {{composed}} <b>of</b> local skiers and winter sports enthusiasts, {{also began to}} hold town hall meetings {{in the fall of}} 2009 {{in order to get a}} sense of what the surrounding communities wanted from their ski hill. They opened lines of communication with the former owners <b>of</b> <b>Shames</b> and held meetings with lawyers and consultants specializing in alternative business models. Through these consultations, the best model for Shames' future success was determined to be a non-profit co-operative. In 2010, Friends <b>of</b> <b>Shames</b> applied for and were awarded grant monies for feasibility studies and the development of a business plan. With these in hand, Friends <b>of</b> <b>Shames</b> officially launched the drive to create My Mountain Co-op in February 2011. Individuals, local businessess and corporations bought memberships and worked together to raise awareness within the region about the general benefits of running the ski area as a community service co-op (as opposed to having it close down for lack of a private buyer). Through fundraising efforts, membership shares, and corporate donations, MMC was able to enter a purchase agreement with the former owners - Shames Mountain Ski Corporation (SMSC), and began operating Shames for the first time for the 2011-2012 season. Late in 2012, tenure of the ski area was officially transferred from the provincial government to MMC, removing the last condition of the purchase agreement with SMSC. As of January 2013 MMC (and its membership) achieved the remarkable milestone <b>of</b> owning the <b>Shames</b> Mountain Ski Area.|$|R

5|$|A mermaid is {{a legendary}} aquatic {{creature}} {{with the head}} and upper body of a female human and {{the tail of a}} fish. Mermaids appear in the folklore of many cultures worldwide, including the Near East, Europe, Africa and Asia. The first stories appeared in ancient Assyria, in which the goddess Atargatis transformed herself into a mermaid out <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> for accidentally killing her human lover. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same tradition), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans.|$|E

5|$|For {{the rest}} of his life, Marmarosa alternated between living with his sister Doris' family and in a veterans' hospital, both in the Pittsburgh area. Some of his friends blamed Marmarosa's family for keeping him in their home because <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> about his mental problems, and {{suggested}} that the family blamed musicians and music for his instability. Marmarosa himself did not explain his withdrawal from performing. Irritated by telephone calls from a fan seeking an interview in 1992, Marmarosa passed on the news that he had died; this led to premature obituaries being published in two British newspapers. He sometimes played piano in the family's basement or for other residents at the hospital. His mother died in 1995, after his father. Marmarosa {{died of a heart attack}} on September 17, 2002, in a veterans' hospital in Pittsburgh. He was survived by his two sisters.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the varied}} and even {{contradictory}} {{interpretations of the}} colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In English folklore and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man. Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was often seen as representing youth's passing. In Celtic mythology, green was associated with misfortune and death, and therefore avoided in clothing. The green girdle, originally worn for protection, became a symbol <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> and cowardice; it is finally adopted {{as a symbol of}} honour by the knights of Camelot, signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.|$|E
5|$|Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, {{variously}} called Sonya and Sonechka, is {{the daughter}} of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent despite the fact that she is compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> and alienation as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime, and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to make comparisons with Mary Magdalene.|$|E

40|$|The Japanese {{juvenile}} justice system has been widely regarded as operating based on the principles <b>of</b> reintegrative <b>shaming.</b> Reintegrative shaming, {{as opposed to a}} stigmatizing form <b>of</b> <b>shaming,</b> communicates disapproval <b>of</b> wrongdoing with respect, and emphasizes rehabilitation, reintegration, and restoration.

His daguerreotype of Ulfeldts Plads is in the Copenhagen City Museum.

5|$|Abu Firas further {{reports that}} Husayn {{was offered the}} {{governorship}} of Fars, but refused, and returned to Baghdad. Ibn al-Furat, who probably still mistrusted his intentions, promptly dispatched him to the governorship of the Diyar Rabi'a, the province encompassing the eastern Jazira, including Mosul. From this post, Husayn led a raiding campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 913/4. Soon after, however, an open rift developed between Husayn and the vizier Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah. The reason is unclear, but revolved around the finances of Husayn's province. In 914/5 he rose in open rebellion, assembling a force of 30,000 Arabs and Kurds in the Jazira, a testament to his influence there. He managed to defeat a caliphal army sent against him, but when confronted by the redoubtable Mu'nis al-Khadim, recalled from Egypt, he was defeated and captured in February 916 while trying to flee north into Armenia. He was brought to Baghdad, where he was publicly paraded across the city in ritual humiliation, riding a camel and wearing a cap <b>of</b> <b>shame.</b> He was put into prison, and executed in October/November 918 on the caliph's orders.|$|E

5|$|Sun Tzu (pinyin: Sun Zi; c. 544 BC – 496 BC) was {{a native}} of the Qi state (now Huimin county in Shandong) during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history, that was characterised by warring factions and a {{fragmented}} state. He {{came to the attention of}} King He Lu of Wu, who was impressed by his 13-chapter military treatise, The Art of War. In 512 BC, He Lu made Sun Tzu his Commander-in-Chief of the Wu army. For almost 20 years, the armies of Wu were victorious over their hereditary enemies, the kingdoms of Chu and Yue. In 496 BC, after He Lu died from his wounds in battle, his son, Fu Chai succeeded him. After numerous victories in battles, Fu Chai became arrogant and began to indulge in merrymaking. In time, the king started to disregard Sun Tzu's counsel and began to distance himself from Sun Tzu. Sensing this, Sun Tzu wisely gave up his position and left Wu for Qi in retirement. Fu Chai and his generals did not follow Sun Tzu's precepts and his kingdom was subsequently conquered by Chu in 473 BC. Out <b>of</b> <b>shame,</b> Fu Chai committed suicide after he had fled with the remnants of his defeated army.|$|E
5|$|The social {{problems}} arising from alcoholism are serious, {{caused by the}} pathological changes {{in the brain and}} the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.|$|E
5|$|The tale {{has been}} often {{dismissed}} as a fable and Paul was conscious {{of the risk of}} disbelief. For this reason, he insists that he saw the skull cup personally during the 740s in the royal palace of Ticinum in the hands of king Ratchis. The use of skull cups has been noticed among nomadic peoples and, in particular, among the Lombards' neighbors, the Avars. Skull cups are believed {{to be part of a}} shamanistic ritual, where drinking from the cup was considered a way to assume the dead man's powers. In this context, Stefano Gasparri and Wilfried Menghen see in Cunimund's skull cup the sign of nomadic cultural influences on the Lombards: by drinking from his enemy's skull Alboin was taking his vital strength. As for the offering of the skull to Rosamund, that may have been a ritual request of complete submission of the queen and her people to the Lombards, and thus a cause <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> or humiliation. Alternatively, it may have been a rite to appease the dead through the offering of a libation. In the latter interpretation, the queen's answer reveals her determination not to let the wound opened by the killing of her father be healed through a ritual act, thus openly displaying her thirst for revenge.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{advances}} privacy theory through examination <b>of</b> online <b>shaming,</b> focusing {{in particular}} on persecution by internet mobs. While shaming is nothing new, the technology used for modern shaming {{is new and}} evolving, making it a revealing lens through which to analyze points of analytical friction within and between traditional conceptions of privacy. To that end, this paper first explores the narrative and structure <b>of</b> online <b>shaming,</b> identifying broad categories <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> <b>of</b> vigilantism, bullying, bigotry and gossiping, which are then used throughout the paper to evaluate different angles to the privacy problems raised. Second, this paper examines shaming through three dominant debates concerning privacy—privacy’s link with dignity, {{the right to privacy}} in public places and the social dimension of privacy. Certain themes emerged from this analysis. A common feature <b>of</b> online <b>shaming</b> is public humiliation. A challenge is to differentiate between a humbling (rightly knocking someone down a peg for a social transgression) and a humiliation that is an affront to dignity (wrongly knocking someone down a peg). In addition, the privacy concern <b>of</b> <b>shamed</b> individuals is not necessarily about intrusion on seclusion or revelation of embarrassing information, but rather about the disruption in their ability to continue to participate in online spaces free from attack. The privacy interest therefore becomes more about enabling participation in social spaces, enabling connections and relationships to form, and about enabling identity-making. Public humiliation through shaming can disrupt all of these inviting closer scrutiny concerning how law can be used as an enabling rather than secluding tool...|$|R
