500|$|Although {{the first}} season closely follows {{the events of the}} first novel, later seasons have made {{significant}} changes. According to David Benioff, the show is [...] "about adapting the series as a whole and following the map George laid <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> and hitting the major milestones, but not necessarily each of the stops along the way".|$|E
500|$|The initial premise for {{the series}} was to examine what superheroes would be like [...] "in a credible, real world". As the story became more complex, Moore said Watchmen became about [...] "power and {{about the idea of}} the superman {{manifest}} within society." [...] The title of the series refers to the question [...] "Who watches the watchmen?", famously posed by the Roman satirist Juvenal (as [...] "Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"), although Moore was not aware of the phrase's classical origins until Harlan Ellison informed him. Moore commented in 1987, [...] "In the context of Watchmen, that fits. 'They're watching <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> who's watching out for them? The writer stated in the introduction to the Graphitti hardcover of Watchmen that while writing the series he was able to purge himself of his nostalgia for superheroes, and instead he found an interest in real human beings.|$|E

500|$|Levine's {{popularity}} {{outside of}} his musical work has seen him tagged as a [...] "stand-alone star," [...] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man". He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: [...] "We talked about it {{a long time ago and}} decided I would step <b>out,</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> not for me or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman." ...|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're {{just going to have to}} go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "Kingdom Come" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, calling it [...] "a particularly superficial addition to the series". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's lack of complexity was refreshing, but ultimately the [...] "awkward" [...] performances and [...] "cheesy" [...] approach to its subject matter detracted from it. Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B, describing it as [...] "an episode {{about a man who}} finds himself trying to lose his faith but being unable to do so". VanDerWerff felt that the episode suffered from [...] "the typical Millennium problems", including [...] "an overreliance on trite philosophical dialogue"; however, he found that it contained [...] "something pure and believable at its core that keeps the episode moving along nicely". The episode's thematic concern with {{the role of religion in}} society was noted as being [...] "the tension Millennium would build its best episodes on". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated [...] "Kingdom Come" [...] 5 out of 5, describing it as being [...] "classic Millennium". Gibron felt that the episode had [...] "an exceptional script that delightfully fails to spell everything <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> up front", and noted that it served as [...] "the blueprint for all better Millennium episodes to come".|$|E

2500|$|At the 2014 Coke Zero 400, Almirola {{would earn}} his first career {{win in the}} Sprint Cup Series after {{avoiding}} two major wrecks, and leading the field when the race was called off after 112 laps due to rain. His win also marked the first victory by the Richard Petty Motorsports No. 43, the first victory for the No. 43 overall in Cup since Petty Enterprises' win at Martinsville in 1999, and 30 {{years to the day}} Richard Petty won his 200th race in a Curb Racing No. 43. On his big victory Almirola said [...] "The good lord was watching <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> today and we were meant to win. It's real special for me to win here. This is not only the 30th anniversary of this team's last win at Daytona, it is my hometown and I remember growing up watching Daytona 500s and Firecracker 400s here. To win is real special." [...] Almirola's win guaranteed him a spot in the newly reformatted Chase for the Sprint Cup. He was eliminated after the Round of 16 due to a crash at Dover.|$|E
