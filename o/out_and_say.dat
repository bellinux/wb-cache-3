500|$|In 1983, Baker {{published}} an autobiography titled Baby Doll: An Autobiography, which detailed {{her life and}} career as an actress and revealed the issues with Paramount and Warner Bros. that had led her to move to Europe in the 1970s and pursue a career in Italian films. Baker said to Regis Philbin, when he interviewed her for Lifetime Television in 1986, that she [...] "didn't want to write an autobiography... but I wanted to write, and I knew {{that would be the}} easiest thing to get published." [...] She further commented to Philbin on her writing, saying: [...] "I think I always wanted to write, but I was a little self-conscious about it. I never had a formal education, and I've always had such a respect for writing. While I could go <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> even before I started to act, 'Yes, I'm an actress,' I couldn't really say 'I'm a writer.'" [...] In spite of Baker's misgivings, Baby Doll: An Autobiography was well received. She later wrote two other books, To Africa with Love (1986), detailing her time spent in Africa, and a novel titled A Roman Tale (1987).|$|E

[...] Burke continued to explain that {{when she was in the}} recording studio with RedOne, her Aunt was experiencing problems in her relationship which related to the lyrics in [...] "The Silence," [...] and that she felt that her Aunt's partner should not [...] "let the silence do the talking?
