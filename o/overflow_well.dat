The system provides a drought warning map, drought index anomaly map, a rainfall map, land surface temperature map, etc. Once the internet available, user can specify the location to get the mentioned data free. Though the data {{are available on the}} internet, utilization the data by the user is still in limitation. The central part of the Myanmar is dry zone area and often faces water shortage for the drinking and utilization in agriculture. Existing development projects are focus on solving the water shortage in the area by making dams, pulping, weir, digging, tube well, dug well, <b>overflow</b> <b>well.</b> Though the existing projects could help immediate need for the area, the water shortage will face once the ground water table receding. Thus, the area needs proper monitoring of the ground water receding using appropriate technology. This study will find the usefulness of the remote sensing data and correlate it with an existing Hydrogeology map of the region. Finally ground water monitoring will be discussed using the relationship...|$|E

BRYANT SERVICE CLUB One Young Orchard Avenue, Providence, Rhode Island Dear Gang: Thank you for {{the very}} {{interesting}} letter on campus gossip, and Bryant news in general. I am especially pleased to note that courses have been added that will enable the enlisted man or officer candidate – elect to further himself through training received while on a civilian status. If you have a fairly good knowledge of military correspondence {{it will be a}} great help in securing an office position, and it is there that a good many of the ratings are held. With the basic fundamentals of proper Military Psychology typing, etc, you can concentrate on drilling, stripping, and assembling of weapons, gas, first aid, and camouflage courses. They are all extremely interesting. They would have to be to keep me up until two in the morning just assembling or stripping a submachine gun, blindfolded, just for the practice! In fact the other day my duties as First Sergeant got me out of bed (a very comfortable one at that) at 4 : 30 AM, and 2 : 30 the following morning found me very busily working out a camouflage problem on a clay model that I have compiled from pictures. Now a little news from the “home front”. Miss Mary B. Ronne was a graduate from Bryant. I used to go back and forth to college with her, and it looks as though another Bryant romance has blossomed, for on May 1 st we are to be married here at the post chapel. With the pack of “Indians” I have under my supervision, I rather imagine that it will be rather an elaborate affair, for my Commanding Officer has deemed that the affair calls for a “must” formation. That in itself will fill the chapel to an <b>overflow.</b> <b>Well,</b> thanks for remembering me. The address as you may gather is correct.

40|$|A {{corpus of}} 291 small Cprogram test cases was {{developed}} to evaluate static and dynamic analysis tools designed to detect buffer overflows. The corpus was designed and labeled using a new, comprehensive buffer overflow taxonomy. It provides a benchmark to measure detection, false alarm, and confusion rates of tools, and also suggests areas for tool enhancement. Experiments with five tools demonstrate that some modern static analysis tools can accurately detect overflows in simple test cases but that others have serious limitations. For example, PolySpace demonstrated a superior detection rate, missing only one detection. Its performance could be enhanced if extremely long run times were reduced, and false alarms were eliminated for some C library functions. ARCHER performed well with no false alarms whatsoever. It could be enhanced by improving interprocedural analysis and handling of C library functions. Splint detected significantly fewer overflows and exhibited the highest false alarm rate. Improvements in loop handling and reductions in false alarm rate {{would make it a}} much more useful tool. UNO had no false alarms, but missed overflows in roughly half of all test cases. It would need improvement in many areas to become a useful tool. BOON provided the worst performance.

40|$|One of the {{principal}} mechanisms {{that is responsible for}} the origin of blue stragglers is mass transfer that takes place while one of the binary companions overfills its Roche lobe. In this Chapter, we overview the theoretical understanding of mass transfer via Roche lobe overflow: classification, how both the donor and of the accretor respond to the mass transfer on different timescales (adiabatic response, equilibrium response, superadiabatic response, time-dependent response) for different types of their envelopes (convective and radiative). These responses, as well as the assumption on how liberal the process is, are discussed in terms of the stability of the ensuing mass transfer. The predictions of the theory of mass transfer via Roche lobe overflow are then briefly compared with the observed mass-transferring systems with both degenerate and non-degenerate donors. We conclude with the discussion which cases of mass transfer and which primordial binaries could be responsible for blue stragglers formation via Roche lobe <b>overflow,</b> as <b>well</b> as how this can be enhanced for blue stragglers formed in globular clusters.

40|$|Buffer {{overflows}} are {{the most}} common source of security vulnerabilities in C programs. This class of vulnerability, which is found in both legacy and modern software, costs the software industry {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} per year. The most common type of buffer overflow is the runtime stack overflow. It is common because programmers often use stack allocated arrays. This enables the attacker to change a program’s control flow by writing beyond the boundary of an array onto a return address on the run-time stack. If the arrays are repositioned to the heap at compile time, none of these attacks succeed. Furthermore, repositioning buffers to the heap should perturb the heap memory enough to prevent many heap <b>overflows</b> as <b>well.</b> We have created a tool called Gemini that repositions stack allocated arrays at compile time using TXL. The transformation preserves the semantics of the program with a small performance penalty.

A program that is amenable to a buffer overflow attack and several Linux programs are used as examples to demonstrate the effectiveness and overhead of our technique. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we have {{reviewed}} the present status of the theory of equilibrium configurations of compact binary star systems in Newtonian gravity. Evolutionary processes of compact binary star systems due to gravitational wave emission can be divided into three stages according to the time scales and configurations. The evolution is quasi-stationary until a merging process starts, since the time scale of the orbital change due to gravitational wave emission is longer than the orbital period. In this stage, equilibrium sequences can be applied to evolution of compact binary star systems. Along the equilibrium sequences, there appear several critical states where some instability sets in or configuration changes drastically. We have discussed relations among these critical points and have stressed the importance of the mass <b>overflow</b> as <b>well</b> as the dynamical instability of orbital motions. Concerning the equilibrium sequences of binary star systems, we have summarized classical results of incompressible ellipsoidal configurations.

40|$|Overflows are {{commonly}} applied in storm sewer systems to control flow and water surface level. Therefore overflows {{play a central}} role in the control of discharges of pollutants from sewer systems to the environment. The basic hydrodynamic principle of an overflow is the so-called critical flow across the edge of the overflow. To ensure critical flow across the edge, the upstream flow must be subcritical whereas the downstream flow is either supercritical or a free jet. Experimentally <b>overflows</b> are <b>well</b> studied. Based on laboratory experiments and Froude number scaling, numerous accurate and reliable formulas for the estimation of overflows have been derived. Numerical modelling of overflows is significantly more complicated than standard 1 -dimensional river or sewer modelling. The problem is usually managed by incorporating the mentioned empirical formulas in the numerical models. If there are no standard formulas for a specific geometry, physical experiments have to be carried out. The present study uses laboratory experiments to evaluate the reliability of two types of numerical models of overflows in sewers systems: 1. 1 -dimensional model based on the extended Saint-Vernant equation including the term for curvature of the water surface (the so-called Boussinesq approximation) 2. 2 - and 3 -dimensional so-called Volume of Fluid Models (VOF-models) based on the full Navier-Stokes equation...|$|R

Based on a development set of 1, 574 sentences, we compare the performance of two state-of-the-art summarization techniques as well as a pattern-based approach for insight sentence extraction. We then present SISE, a novel machine learning based approach that uses as features the sentences themselves, their formatting, their question, their answer, and their authors as well as part-of-speech tags and the similarity of a sentence to the corresponding API documentation. With SISE, we were able to achieve a precision of 0. 64 and a coverage of 0. 7 on the development set.

A new global data base of lake status has been assembled, and is used to compare two {{simulations}} for 6 ka (6000 yr ago) made with successive R 15 versions of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM). Simulated water balance was expressed as anomalies of annual precipitation minus evaporation (P-E) -observed water balance as anomalies of lake status. Comparisons were made visually, by comparing regional averages, and by a statistic that compares the signs of simulated P-E anomalies (smoothly interpolated to the lake sites) with the status anomalies. Both CCM 0 and CCM 1 showed enhanced Northern-Hemisphere monsoons at 6 ka. Both underestimated the effect, but CCM 1 fitted the spatial patterns better. In the northern mid- and high-latitudes the two versions differed more, and fitted the data less satisfactorily. CCM 1 performed better than CCM 0 in North America and central Eurasia, but not in Europe. Both models (especially CCM 0) simulated excessive aridity in interior Eurasia.

In particular, we model a gravity current evolving under an assumed shear-flow. The transport equation is deterministic, with a noise term at the inlet boundary. This was motivated by observed seasonal fluctuations in some known sources of salty, dense water in the oceans, like the Red Sea <b>overflow,</b> as <b>well</b> as observed thermal and saline anomalies in the thermohaline circulation. The noises used were: Wiener white, Wiener colored, Lévy white, and Lévy colored noise. Lévy processes form a more general class of processes which are generally non-Gaussian in distribution, and may have infinitely many jumps in finite time. They {{have been used to}} model pollutant point-sources, the flight time of particles in vortices, and linear and non-linear anomalous diffusion. The major finding was that white noises (Wiener and Lévy) and colored Wiener noise all have the effect of impeding the diffusion process, by as much as 33 %. However, colored Lévy noise (non-Gaussian, time-correlated) does not have this effect on diffusion. This would suggest that time-correlation is more important in distinguishing noises than the distribution of the process that produced the noise. This also explains why Lévy colored noise showed great sensitivity to the stability parameter α, while Lévy white noise is unaffected by its stability parameter...|$|R
