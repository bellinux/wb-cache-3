5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike the GM in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E

25|$|The show {{captured}} a key feature of Britain in the 1960s—the widening generation gap. Alf (and {{to a lesser}} degree his wife) represented the old guard, the traditional and conservative attitudes of the older generation. Alf's battles with his left-wing son-in-law were not just ideological but generational and cultural. His son-in-law and daughter represented the younger generation. They supported the aspects of the new era such as relaxed sexual mores, fashions, music, etc. The same things were anathema to Alf—and indicative <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> was wrong with the younger generation and the liberal attitudes they embraced.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, the Battle Creek team {{became the}} Muskegon Lassies, {{and by the}} end of the season, it too, folded. Faut came back for her final year in the AAGPBL. Her team was {{weakened}} considerably by the player losses at the end of the previous season, and Faut was worn down from all the dissension. South Bend would finish the season second from last, compiling a 45–65 record. In spite <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> had gone wrong, Faut still turned to post a 17–11 record and produced a league-best 1.51 ERA in 29 games, though league offensive levels were increasing. By her final season, only overhand pitching was allowed, the ball was a lively cork-centered ten inches, and the basepaths were seventy-five feet. More importantly from a pitching perspective, the pitching rubber was moved back to fifty-six feet, thirteen feet farther away than in 1946. At the same time, fences were moved in to allow for more home runs.|$|E

In the opinion of former Mojo editor Paul Trynka, the track benefited most from the Beatles' ability to channel their ideas into a recognisable song form, a discipline that ensured their psychedelic recordings were superior to those by the Grateful Dead and other contemporary San Francisco acts. Writing in his book Electronic and Experimental Music, Thom Holmes includes [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] in his list of the [...] "pioneering works" [...] in electronic music. He says that the track [...] "ushered in a new era in the use of electronic music in rock and pop music".|$|E
