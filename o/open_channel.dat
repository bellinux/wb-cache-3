25|$|A {{hydraulic}} jump {{is a phenomenon}} in the science of hydraulics which is frequently observed in <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> flow such as rivers and spillways. When liquid at high velocity discharges into a zone of lower velocity, a rather abrupt rise occurs in the liquid surface. The rapidly flowing liquid is abruptly slowed and increases in height, converting some of the flow's initial kinetic energy into an increase in potential energy, with some energy irreversibly lost through turbulence to heat. In an <b>open</b> <b>channel</b> flow, this manifests as the fast flow rapidly slowing and piling {{up on top of}} itself similar to how a shockwave forms.|$|E

30|$|Nezu and Rodi (1985) {{found that}} the {{velocity}} dip position in <b>open</b> <b>channels</b> {{is related to the}} aspect ratio Ar, which is the ratio of channel width b to water depth h. It is evident that at the central section of <b>open</b> <b>channels</b> the velocity dip phenomenon occurs when sidewall shear stresses dominate for Ar < 5. However, when Ar > 5, channels exhibit no velocity dip, i.e. the maximum water velocity appears at the top surface (Stearns 1883; Montes and Ippen 1973).|$|R
30|$|The {{velocity}} dip position model {{proposed in}} this study has been fitted by asymptotic matching technique with data obtained {{from a wide range}} of aspect ratios for <b>open</b> <b>channels</b> of both smooth and rough bed surfaces.

It is thus advocated here that the proposed model is capable of predicting velocity dip position in <b>open</b> <b>channels</b> under different conditions of aspect ratio and bed roughness. Also, the application results show that the proposed model provides better parameter estimation than the other models in terms of computing the Reynolds shear stress and mean velocity distribution over the full water depth of <b>open</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R
30|$|An {{empirical}} model is proposed {{to predict the}} velocity dip position at the central section of <b>open</b> <b>channels.</b> The model is fitted based on asymptotic matching technique and validated by using {{a wide range of}} aspect ratios (channel width/flow depth) from 0.155 to 15. The matching approach, which relies on dividing the trend into smaller segments that can be combined into an overall relation, employs regression technique and thus warrants the best-fit accuracy results. The obtained model satisfies the upper and lower bounds of dip positions equal to 0.5 and 1, respectively. A comparison with other formulas widely reported in the literature is provided. The model is also applied to predict Reynolds shear stress and velocity distribution in <b>open</b> <b>channels.</b> This model will help extending our ability for analyzing velocity field in <b>open</b> <b>channels</b> under different flow and boundary conditions.|$|R
