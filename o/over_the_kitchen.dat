5|$|Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine (1635–1708) oversaw a {{substantial}} remodelling {{of the house}} in 1684, and much of the existing south facade dates from that time. The end bays were heightened, and the central porch was rebuilt with stone quoins and pilasters, a balustraded top and a small tower and cupola. A plan from 1684 shows the hall in the house's centre, with service rooms to the west and the main parlour to the east. On the first floor, the dining room was over the hall, the main bedchamber <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and a lady's chamber over the porch.|$|E

The wound sprays blood <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> walls before Jane falls to the floor. The killer {{continues}} to hack at her until she is dead, at which point Neal is revealed to be the murderer. Upon learning the details of Berti's sadistic murder spree, Neal recovered a previously repressed memory involving his murder of a girl who had sexually humiliated {{him when he was}} a youth in Rhode Island. The memory torments Neal and inflames his previously repressed lust for blood, driving him insane.|$|E
25|$|In England, a dome with a {{pyramidal}} {{roof and}} lantern at the Abbot's kitchen of Glastonbury Abbey {{dates to the}} early 14th century. Similar vaulting was built <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> of Newenham Abbey by 1338. Timber star vaults such as those over York Minster's octagonal Chapter house (ca. 1286–1296) and the elongated octagon plan of Wells Cathedral's Lady Chapel (ca. 1320–1340) imitated much heavier stone vaulting. The wooden vaulting over the crossing of Ely Cathedral was built after the original crossing tower collapsed in 1322. It was conceived by Alan of Walsingham and designed by master carpenter William Hurley. Eight hammer vaults extend from eight piers over the 22 meter wide octagonal crossing and meet {{at the base of}} a large octagonal lantern, which is covered by a star vault.|$|E
50|$|Ducasse's first {{position}} as chef came in 1980 {{when he took}} <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> at L’amandier in Mougins. One year later, he assumed the position of head chef at La Terrasse in the Hôtel Juana in Juan-les-Pins. In 1984, he was awarded two stars in the Michelin Red Guide. In the same year Ducasse was the only survivor of a Piper Aztec aircraft crash that injured him severely.|$|R

500|$|The video {{begins with}} an opening caption that reads [...] "Womanizer". During the introduction, Spears is naked and smiling at a sauna, while {{covering}} herself with her hands. These scenes are seen throughout the video. When the first verse begins, the official version of Spears wearing a slip nightgown is making breakfast for her boyfriend (...) as he gets ready for work. When {{he is at the}} office, he sees a new secretary, which is actually Spears in disguise wearing horn-rimmed glasses and a pencil skirt. She starts dancing {{in front of him and}} sings the chorus. She makes him follow her into the photocopier, where she photocopies her buttocks. On the back, we see an awkward-looking man, the same who appears in the plane scene on [...] "Toxic". Then, Spears is disguised as a red-haired, tattooed waitress in a restaurant. She dances around him with her dancers and plays with him <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> counter. After this, her boyfriend is seen getting driven home by Spears, disguised as a chauffeur. She starts to kiss him, driving the car with her heel until both get home. Once they get into the bedroom, Spears reveals that she was the three women he was [...] "womanizing" [...] all along. She then begins attacking her boyfriend. This is shown through Spears as her three alter egos, and then as the real version of herself. Spears throws a blanket over her boyfriend and makes the bed. The video ends with Spears smiling, and a repeat of the opening caption.|$|E
2500|$|Kitchens in China {{are called}} [...] More than 3000 years ago, the ancient Chinese used the ding for cooking food. [...] The ding was {{developed}} into the wok and pot used today. Many Chinese {{people believe that}} there is a Kitchen God who watches <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> for the family. According to this belief, the god returns to heaven to give a report to the Jade Emperor annually about this family behavior. Every Chinese New Year Eve, families will gather together to pray for the kitchen god to give a good report to heaven and wish him to bring back good news on the fifth day of the New Year.|$|E
2500|$|She {{worked on}} Wall Street from 1987 to 1990 as a {{research}} director for Henry Ansbacher, Inc., a British financial firm that helped large media conglomerates acquire small, locally owned newspapers.

2500|$|Mobility is {{severely}} restricted by the hip spica cast and walking without crutches or a walker is impossible because the hips cannot bend. There {{is a serious}} danger of falling if the patient in a hip spica cast tries to get upright to walk without assistance because they lack {{the ability to control}} their balance. Patients are normally confined to a bed or reclining wheelchair, or children's stroller. Children in spica casts can sometimes learn to get mobile by scooting around on skateboards, or pulling themselves across the floor. Some children even learn to walk by holding themselves up against furniture. A child in a spica cast must always be supervised and safety must always be considered when they are at a mobile phase of their healing to prevent reinjury or damage to the cast. Many spica casts have a spreader bar between the legs to help strengthen the cast and support the legs in the proper positions. It is important when moving the casted patient to not lift them by this spreader bar, as it may break and this could cause injury to the patient. To facilitate toileting or diaper changing and hygienic cleaning, an opening is created in the cast at the groin. The opening is normally referred to as the [...] "perineal opening". It is formed either during cast application or after cast application by cutting the hole with the cast saw. The opening must then be petalled or lined to keep this area of the cast clean and dry. Because the hips cannot bend, using a toilet is difficult, if not impossible. It is therefore necessary for the patient to either use a diaper, bedpan, or catheters to manage bodily waste eliminations. Bathing must be done by sponge baths. Hair may be shampooed by using plastic wash basins under the head. To shampoo wash the hair of a child, the child can be lifted and placed on a kitchen counter top and their head held <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> sink.|$|E
