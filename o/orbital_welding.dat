50|$|<b>Orbital</b> <b>welding</b> {{has almost}} always {{exclusively}} {{been carried out}} by the Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG / GTAW) technique using non-consumable electrodes, with additional cold-wire feed where necessary. The easy control of heat input makes TIG-welding the ideal welding method for fully <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> of tubes with specialist <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> heads, that incorporate a clamping device, a TIG electrode on an orbital travel device and a shielding gas chamber. Many different types of metal can be welded; high-strength, high-temperature and corrosion-resistant steels, unalloyed and low-alloyed carbon steels, nickel alloys, titanium, copper, aluminum and associated alloys. Carried out in an inert atmosphere, this controlled technique produces results that are extremely clean, have low particle counts and are free from unwanted spatter. This enables the highest demands to be met regarding the mechanical and optical properties of a weld seam.|$|E
30|$|Four types welding {{methods are}} {{typically}} used: linear <b>welding,</b> <b>orbital</b> friction <b>welding,</b> circular welding, and rotation welding. These methods differ in velocity and force. In linear and <b>orbital</b> friction <b>welding,</b> the velocity and frictional force is a sinusoidal wave caused by linear oscillatory and elliptical movement, respectively, during welding. For circular and rotation welding, the velocity and frictional force are constant and {{caused by a}} circular and rotation movement [3]. Linear welding and rotation welding have been well studied. Linear welding occurs with high-speed linear motion between the surfaces of two wood blocks. In this method, the welding pressure, amplitude, frequency, holding pressure, and time are the main parameters affecting welding efficiency. In contrast, wood dowel welding with lignin softening and degradation {{is caused by the}} increase in temperature resulting from the friction generated by the high-speed rotation between the wood dowel and the substrate hole [4 – 7].|$|R
50|$|<b>Orbital</b> {{friction}} <b>welding</b> {{is similar}} to spin welding, but uses a more complex machine to produce an orbital motion in which the moving part rotates in a small circle, {{much smaller than the}} size of the joint as a whole.|$|R
50|$|A {{successful}} automatic <b>orbital</b> GTA <b>weld</b> is 100% repeatable {{as long as}} {{the operator}} monitors variables and performs periodic samples or coupons which are inspected for complete penetration. Noticing that a variable has changed is a primary skill and can be easily missed. Training and experience are required for an operator to be successful at consistently producing acceptable welds.|$|R

50|$|Automatic Orbital GTA welding {{has become}} the {{standard}} joining method for high integrity gas and liquid systems used in the SEMICONDUCTOR and Pharmaceuticalmanufacturing industries.

An entire specialty industry suppling valves, fittings, regulators, gauges and other components for <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> and use in high purity applications has developed since the mid 1980s. For tube welding in high purity applications only a fully enclosed weld head may be used.|$|E
50|$|Successful <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> is also {{dependent}} upon having a reasonably clean source of Argon for backing and shielding gas. Minimum purity would be 99.995% for typical industrial applications. For some applications {{it is necessary}} to use ultra high purity argon, 99.9998% purity and such applications requires the use of all high purity purge equipment (valves, regulators and flow control). Typically, no rubber components can be used for purge gas apparatus since the rubber absorbs and releases moisture and oxygen into the argon stream.

40|$|The WRIST project (Innovative Welding Processes for New Rail Infrastructure) aims {{to develop}} and present new methods for joining rails. One of the methods {{proposed}} is <b>Orbital</b> Friction <b>Welding</b> (OFW) of rails using an intermediate disk. The process is still in development and numerical simulations can provide useful insight and guidance on how to further develop this welding process. This thesis presents 3 D thermo-mechanical modeling of OFW for pearlitic rails and 2 D axisymmetric modeling of rotary friction welding of thin-walled pipes. Process parameters and sensitivity to material parameters have been studied for both welding methods. From the simulations, it is shown that correct modeling of the generated heat, during the frictional motion, is of high importance. Therefore, this report also presents a model framework {{which can be used}} for calibrating a heat generation model based on experimental data. This framework is based on the developed 2 D axisymmetric model and has been evaluated using several heat generation models. A model based on a piecewise linear variation for the coefficient of friction with respect to temperature is deemed as the most promising of the considered models. Thermal simulations of OFW for rails have been performed to evaluate the temperature field in the rail and the intermediate disk. Results shows that machine components such as rail clamps have little effect on the resulting temperature field as well as cooling rates. Furthermore, it is shown that a longer heating phase is more likely to result in a pearlitic microstructure in the heat affected zone and is, therefore, preferable. Mechanical simulations of friction welding leads to severe mesh distortions and consequently numerical issues. The results presented are therefore somewhat limited. However, two methods for overcoming this problem has been identified: remeshing during simulation and introduction of visco-plastic material behavior. Both methods are suggested for further study. Finally, models for yield strength at high temperatures are presented and discussed, a material parameter identified as crucial for accurate simulation of the <b>welding</b> process.

40|$|The {{challenge}} of fabrication and repair of structures in space {{must be met}} {{if we are to}} utilize and maintain long-duration space facilities. Welding techniques have been demonstrated to provide the most reliable means to accomplish this task. Over the past few years, methods have been developed to perform <b>orbital</b> tube <b>welding</b> employing space-based welding technology pioneered by the former Soviet Union. Welding can result in the formation of defects, which threaten the structural integrity of the welded joint. Implementation of welding on-orbit, therefore, must also include methods to evaluate the quality and integrity of the welded joints. To achieve this goal, the development of an on-orbit tube weld inspection system, utilizing alternating current field measurement (ACFM) technology, has been under taken. This paper describes the development of the ACFM on-orbit tube weld inspection tool. Topics discussed include: requirements for on-orbit NDE, basic theory of ACFM, its advantages over other NDE methods for on-orbit applications, and the ACFM NDE system design.

40|$|This paper first {{outlines}} the worldwide {{oil and gas}} pipeline laying situation by 2013 and industrial applications, the working characteristics and advantages of <b>orbital</b> pipe <b>welding</b> robots using the gas metal arc metal(GMAW). Then the classifications of commonly used welding seam tracking sensors are comprehensively introduced. The sensor working principles, advantages and disadvantages and the application situation in pipeline welding are analysed in details. The studies show that arc sensors and visual sensors have many advantages such as good real-time characteristic, informativeness and high tracking precision, and are most widely used in pipeline welding. Using single sensor in different process can limit the tracking precision easily, but a system with multiple sensors will greatly improve the tracking precision in oil and gas pipeline welding. A system using visual sensor and arc sensor {{has been used in}} the gas field pipeline welding in Japan and a good effect has been achieved.

50|$|The main {{components}} of every <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> system are the power source and controller, the welding head and, where required, a wire feed mechanism. Welding of certain sizes and material types will also {{require the use}} of a water/coolant system. There are a large number of factors that can have an influence on the welding result. These aspects include the arc length, magnitude and pulse frequency of the welding current, welding speed, inert shielding gas, parent material, filler material, weld preparation, and thermal conductivity. Ultimately, a high quality weld is achieved through detailed knowledge of how to precisely adjust all these parameters for each individual welding task.|$|E
50|$|Owing to {{its ability}} to realise high purity results, <b>orbital</b> <b>welding</b> found {{its place in the}} {{production}} of clean-room components for the semiconductor industry. Its application has now expanded to the construction of pipework and equipment for diverse industries like food processing, pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, automotive engineering, biotechnology, shipbuilding and aerospace. Automated orbital TIG welding is also used in the construction of power stations, (thermal power plants). The construction materials used must be able to withstand the enormous mechanical loads produced by the high pressures and temperatures created by the media carried in the tubes. Notches, pores and inclusions in the weld seams must be avoided at all costs, as these create weak points that can lead to subsequent formation of cracks. These in turn can have serious consequences in terms of component failure. This means that tubes are often made from nickel-based materials with walls up to 200mm thick. One manufacturer has developed an orbital narrow gap welding system with hot-wire feed specifically for this purpose, which uses running gear that moves on a guide ring fixed around the tube. This new variant has created {{a lot of interest in}} the sector, with the worldwide boom in power station construction fueling the never-ending search for increasingly productive manufacturing methods using new types of high-temperature steels.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{precision}} of <b>orbital</b> TIG <b>welding,</b> even the smallest standard tube diameters from 1.6 millimetres can be processed. On a larger scale, pipes with diameters up to 170mm and walls up to 3.5mm thick can be joined using closed chamber weld heads. These weld heads allow the torch to be positioned very precisely and ensure that the pipe is held securely. The inert gas atmosphere in the closed chamber prevents heat from tinting, even with the most sensitive of materials. For tube diameters between 8 and 275mm, {{it is possible to}} use more manageable open welding heads (except for high purity applications). A flexible hose system is used to supply the welding head with power, inert gas, cooling water and filler wire where required. The need for filler wire during the welding process depends on the type of welding task; thicker tube walls and difficult-to-control parent materials require the use of additional material, whereas thin-walled tubes can be welded without extra wire.In order to create high quality weld seams it is essential that tube ends are carefully prepared with the edges of the workpieces being free of scale and impurities. For thinner-walled tubes up to medium diameters, a simple right-angled saw cut is often sufficient. For thicker tube walls it is necessary to prepare the edges more carefully, for example using a U-groove cross-section.|$|R

A pesquisa avalia a soldabilidade do aço X- 80 para a soldagem circunferencial com eletrodo revestido e arame tubular com relação à formação de trincas induzidas por hidrogênio. O objetivo é viabilizar diferentes opções de processos de soldagem para o aço em questão. Para o Teste Tekken foram soldados dois pares de chapas pelo processo SMAW utilizando o consumível E 8010 -G e mais dois pares pelo processo FCAW-G com o consumível E 101 T 1 -GM-H 8. Para o Teste de Implante foram utilizados três chapas de suporte e dez implantes, sendo que quatro implantes foram soldados pelo processo SMAW com E 8010 -G e seis pelo processo FCAW- G com E 101 T 1 - GM-H 8. Todos os implantes apresentavam 6 mm de diâmetro. Para todos os testes a temperatura de preaquecimento foi de 100 °C. A quantidade de hidrogênio difusível nos metais de solda produzidos pelos dois consumíveis foi medida pelo processo de Cromatografia Gasosa. Após a realização dos testes, todas as amostras foram observadas sem e com ataque no MO e no MEV para que as trincas induzidas por hidrogênio na ZTA e no MS (no caso do Teste Tekken) pudessem ser analisadas e medidas. A partir desse procedimento foi possível observar que todas as amostras apresentaram trincas transgranulares com comprimentos da ordem de 17, 68 um, muito pequenas e improváveis de serem prejudiciais ao aço. Isso possibilita dizer que o aço X- 80 pode ser soldado utilizando os consumíveis avaliados, sem riscos de danos maiores para o material.

The research analises the weldability of HSLA X- 80 steel for <b>orbital</b> circunferencial <b>welding</b> with the Shielded Metal Arc Weld and the Flux Core Arc Weld processes with regard to hydrogen induced cracking formation. The aim is to make feasible different options of welding process for the steel at issue. For the Tekken Test two pairs of plates were welded by SMAW process using E 8010 -G consumable and two more pairs by FCAW- G process using E 101 -T 1 -GM-H 8. The Implant Test used three base plates and ten implants, being four implants welded by SMAW process and with E 8010 -G consumable and six by FCAW-G process with E 101 T 1 -GM-H 8 consumable. All the implants have 6 mm of diameter. For all tests the preheating temperature was 100 °C. The diffusible hydrogen content deposited by both consumables was measured by the Gas Chromatography Method. After the tests all the samples were examined without and with attack by means of optical microscope and SEM to allow hydrogen induced cracking in the HAZ and in the weld metal (for Tekken Test) to be viewed and measured. By means of this procedure it was possible to observe that all samples showed transgranular cracking with length of 17, 68 um, too small and unlikely to the be bad to the steel.
