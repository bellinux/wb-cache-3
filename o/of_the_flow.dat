5|$|Unlike the laminar {{boundary}} layer equations, the presence of two regimes governed by different sets of flow scales (i.e. {{the inner and outer}} scaling) has made finding a universal similarity solution for the turbulent {{boundary layer}} difficult and controversial. To find a similarity solution that spans both regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow,</b> it is necessary to asymptotically match the solutions from both regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow.</b> Such analysis will yield either the so-called log-law or power-law.|$|E
5|$|A notable aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> is that {{shear stress}} is {{constant}} throughout the flow domain. In particular, the first derivative of the velocity, , is constant. (This is {{implied by the}} straight-line profile in the figure.) According to Newton's Law of Viscosity (Newtonian fluid), the shear stress {{is the product of}} this expression and the (constant) fluid viscosity.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to extend the definition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> to more general inputs than curves, for instance by using rectifiable varifolds or the level set method. However, these extended definitions may allow parts of curves to vanish instantaneously or fatten into sets of nonzero area.|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost {{at the edges of}} the glacier to icebergs, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is {{desirable}} to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> lines.|$|E
5|$|Vortex {{streets are}} zigzagging {{patterns}} of whirling vortices {{created by the}} unsteady separation of flow of a fluid, most often air or water, over obstructing objects.

5|$|Although {{the rock}} {{formations}} exposed in Leonard Harrison State Park and the Pine Creek Gorge {{are at least}} 300million years old, the gorge itself formed only about 20,000years ago, in the last ice age. Pine Creek had flowed northeasterly until then, but was dammed by rocks, soil, ice, and other debris deposited by the receding Laurentide Continental Glacier. The dammed creek formed a lake near the present village of Ansonia, and the lake's glacial meltwater overflowed the debris dam, which caused a reversal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of Pine Creek. The creek flooded {{to the south and}} quickly carved a deep channel {{on its way to the}} West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, the {{watershed}} {{became part of}} a rancho. In 1966, the creek was dammed to form Laguna Niguel Lake, while the surrounding hills were leveled as residential communities were constructed in the area following the '60s and '70s. The creek's basin eventually {{became part of the}} cities of Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, and a small portion in San Juan Capistrano. Increasing urban runoff in the 1960s caused most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> in the creek to be unnatural. The creek has since been channelized along most of its length to prevent floods from inundating the roads and houses that now line much of its banks.|$|E
5|$|For {{a simple}} closed curve, using an {{extension}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> to non-smooth curves {{based on the}} level set method, {{there are only two}} possibilities. Curves with zero Lebesgue measure (including all polygons and piecewise-smooth curves) instantly evolve into smooth curves, after which they evolve as any smooth curve would. However, Osgood curves with nonzero measure instead immediately evolve into a topological annulus with nonzero area and smooth boundaries. The topologist's sine curve is an example that instantly becomes smooth, despite not even being locally connected; examples such as this show that the reverse evolution of the curve-shortening flow can take well-behaved curves to complicated singularities in a finite amount of time.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we propose a novel {{approach}} addressing {{the need for a}} spatially equitable distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flows</b> when routing multiple commodities on a capacitated network. In our model, <b>the</b> spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flows</b> is considered by partitioning the area in which the network is embedded by means of a grid of uniform size cells and then computing <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> network <b>flows</b> on each cell by a weighted linear combination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flows</b> interesting each cell. A spatially equitable distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flows</b> is therefore obtained when all the multicommodity demands are satisfied in such a way to minimize the maximum impact registered on <b>the</b> cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grid. We refer to this problem as the spatially equitable multicommodity capacitated network flow problem and propose a minimax linear programming formulation. The need to find a proper trade-off between the total routing cost and the spatial equity is treated as well by considering both the objective functions and computing pareto-optimal solutions for the bicriteria optimization problem. Computational results obtained on a real traffic network are presented and discussed in the paper. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> impact <b>of</b> {{interference}} from far sensing range on throughput <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flows</b> {{can be estimated}} by considering the received signal strength, its impact on bit error rate and packet error rate. Ideal channel conditions are assumed where the only factor affecting <b>the</b> unsuccessful reception <b>of</b> frame is <b>the</b> {{interference from}} <b>the</b> other <b>flow.</b> Although extremely simplifying, even under this assumption, throughput <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>flows</b> can be predicted accurately. This assumption allows <b>the</b> computation <b>of</b> packet error probability for RTS frame. Near sensing range analysis is used as basis while the conditional packet loss probability and busy probability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flows</b> are adjusted by the packet error probability to achieve <b>the</b> throughput <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two <b>flows</b> that interfere from within far sensing range.|$|R
5|$|Hydrocephalus (obstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid) may complicate SAH in {{both the}} short and long term. It is detected on CT scanning, on which there is enlargement of the lateral ventricles. If the level of consciousness is decreased, drainage of the excess fluid is performed by therapeutic lumbar puncture, extraventricular drain (a temporary device inserted {{into one of the}} ventricles), or occasionally a permanent shunt. Relief of hydrocephalus can lead to an enormous improvement in a person's condition. Fluctuations in blood pressure and electrolyte imbalance, as well as pneumonia and cardiac decompensation occur in about half the hospitalized persons with SAH and may worsen prognosis. Seizures occur during the hospital stay in about a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow.</b> Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E
5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts {{in the spring}} and early summer causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and some smaller tributaries dry up altogether. Up to 85% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.|$|E

5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by frictional {{losses in the}} oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|E
