5000|$|The Cicurel store {{developed}} into Egypt's {{largest and most}} fashionable department store chain: Les Grands Magasins Cicurel et Oreco. Cicurel specialized in ready-to-wear men's and women's clothes, shoes, housewares, and notions, much of which were imported from Europe. It had an excellent reputation for high quality and was a purveyor to the royal palace during the reigns of Kings Fu’ad and Faruq. The Oreco branch of the firm consisted of thrift stores serving the lower middle classes.The Cicurel stores had a foreign cultural character due to their largely non-citizen Jewish staff, their exclusive and largely imported merchandise, {{and the use of}} French by employees and customers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> <b>floors.</b> Nonetheless, <b>the</b> Cicurel family regarded themselves as Egyptians and saw their business activities as contributing to the Egyptian national economy. The products they purveyed in their department stores and the cultural ambience they promoted were widely considered by the elite and upper-middle strata to be proper accoutrements of modern culture completely compatible with nationalist ideals and aspirations as they were commonly understood until the mid-1950s.|$|R
25|$|A {{statute of}} worker’s rights that was drafted and pushed into {{enactment}} in 1970 by the Socialist labour minister Giacomo Brodolini, greatly strengthened {{the authority of}} the trade unions in the factories, outlawed dismissal without just cause, guaranteed freedom of assembly and speech <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> <b>floor,</b> forbade employers to keep records of the union or political affiliations of their workers, and prohibited hiring except through the state employment office.|$|E
25|$|Where the IWW did win strikes, {{such as in}} Lawrence, {{they often}} {{found it hard to}} hold onto their gains. The IWW of 1912 disdained {{collective}} bargaining agreements and preached instead the need for constant struggle against the boss <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> <b>floor.</b> It proved difficult, however, to maintain that sort of revolutionary enthusiasm against employers. In Lawrence, the IWW lost nearly all of its membership in the years after the strike, as the employers wore down their employees' resistance and eliminated many of the strongest union supporters. In 1938, the IWW voted to allow contracts with employers, so long as they would not undermine any strike.|$|E
25|$|Various {{measures}} {{were introduced to}} improve environmental conditions and to safeguard the environment, the Federal Emission Control Law established the basis for taking of legal action against those responsible for excessive noise and air pollution, the Works’ Constitution Act and Personnel Representation Act strengthened the position of individual employees in offices and factories, and the Works’ Safety Law required firms to employ safety specialists and doctors. An amendment to the Labour Management Act (1971) granted workers co-determination <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> <b>floor</b> while the new Factory Management Law (1972) extended co-determination at the factory level. This Act acknowledged {{for the first time}} the presence of trade unions in the workplace, expanded the means of action of the works councils, and improved their work basics as well as those of the youth councils. A law was passed in 1974 allowing for worker representation on the boards of large firms, although this change was not enacted until 1976, after alterations were made. In 1974, redundancy allowances in cases of bankruptcies were introduced. The Federal Law on Personnel Representation, which came into force in April 1974, gave increased co-management rights to those employed in factories and offices in the public sector. The staff councils were given an increased say in social and personal matters, together with a wider operational basis for their activities in connection with day release and training opportunities. The arrangements governing cooperation between the staff councils and the trade union were also improved. Young workers were given increased rights of representation, while foreign workers received voting rights and thus achieved equality in this respect with German employees.|$|E

40|$|In {{this essay}} I reexamine the posthumously edited and {{published}} text initiated by and attributed to C. L. R. James, American Civilization, {{which has been}} read by some as an appeal on James’s part for American citizenship. Given that the text was initially composed as notes that were to assume, later, an entirely different form, I argue that much is lost in putting these notes forward {{as if they were}} a completed work. I track the fragmented, informal, collaborative field within which the project took shape and show how the strange uncontained form of this experimental document—or, as I call it, undocument—offers new conceptions of intellectual work and the work or work of art, challenging normative conceptions of the coherence of both authorship and citizenship. I show that James and his collaborators gravitate toward and seek to represent the ongoing renewal of dissident, dissonant social forms, which are for them, always also aesthetic forms, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> <b>floors</b> and in <b>the</b> after hours hang-outs of Detroit and beyond. The formal openness and multiplicity of <b>the</b> “Notes <b>on</b> American Civilization” not only invokes that sociality but provokes its ongoing reinvention and reproduction...|$|R

500|$|In {{terms of}} labour process theory—the attempt to {{understand}} the relationship between management control, worker skill and wages in industrial workplaces—Filtzer emphasised the continuing absence of control by Soviet workers over their own labour process. The Soviet elite would not radically change the labour process by democratising it and introducing truly equal wages for everyone in society, but nor could they generate the culture of consumerism that in the West was used to help explain the wage and skill structure. [...] In these circumstances, attempts to coordinate production quotas, wages and expected levels of worker effort failed and continued to fail into the 1980s. [...] The wage reform of 1956–1962 was a failure, as it could neither fix nor improve the economic conflict between workers and the elite in the Soviet Union. [...] <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> <b>floor,</b> workers continued to directly bargain with low-level management over effort, wages and what [...] "skill" [...] they would exert. In particular, Filtzer notes that Soviet workers were constantly forced into a position of exerting more skill than was officially called for in plans or quotas. This was because Soviet workers often had to find their own ways of working around problems that made their efforts difficult, such as building their own tools to carry out tasks that could not be performed with the tools provided, or by devising entirely new production processes of their own when existing processes were not suitable. This was a condition only seen to such an extent in the West in industries that were insulated from market forces. Because this was common in Soviet industry, workers and managers in the Soviet Union had many reasons to work together in the setting of wages, quotas and skill expectations, even after the wage reform. Filtzer wrote that Mikhail Gorbachev attempted a very similar series of wage reforms in 1986 (Perestroika), which ultimately failed and had to be replaced with a decentralised system in 1991.|$|E

40|$|In the make-to-order (MTO) mode of manufacturing, the {{specification}} of each product is unique such that production processes vary from one product to another making the production schedule complex. In {{order to achieve}} high level productivity, the production flow is not arranged in sequence; instead, the job schedule of different production jobs is adjusted {{to fit in with}} <b>the</b> multiple-job <b>shop</b> environment. A poor scheduling of jobs leads to high production cost, long production time and tardiness in job performance. The existing of tardiness in the production schedule significantly affects the harmony among <b>the</b> multiple jobs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shops</b> <b>floor.</b> In order to provide a complete solution for solving MTO scheduling problems with job shifting and minimizing job tardiness, a hybrid scheduling decision support model (SDSM) is introduced. The model is combined by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and an optimisation module. GA is adopted to solve the complex scheduling problem taking into consideration of the wide variety of processes while the optimisation module is suggested for tackling tardiness in doing the jobs in a cost effective way. The simulation results reveal that the model shortens the generation time of production schedules and reduces the production cost in MTO-based production projects.

The first in the duo is a muscular but short and insect-like merchant, who wears dandruff, tortoiseshell combs, a lath armor which greatly hiders his movements, and a piano lid screwed to his buttocks. The descendant of Macedonian nobility, Cotadi feeds on ant eggs and excretes soda water, except when he corks himself to solve the [...] "agrarian question". For fun, he lures his clients into angry conversations—these end with him banging the piano lid, {{which is also a}} urinating wall, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop's</b> <b>floor.</b> Dragomir is long, crooked, brownish and kind-hearted; he intervenes in the disputes between Cotadi and the more stubborn customers, imposing respect with his main prop: a cardboard contraption that extends upwards from his neck. Cotadi rewards such attentions with servings of octopus, sorb-pears and paint, granting Dragomir the right to nest inside his gate wall. They plan to be buried together, [...] "in the same hole", with French oil as a daily supply.

40|$|Field {{studies of}} {{management}} control and accounting {{have tended to}} study organisational meaning through practices. We identify three strands of practice research on organisational control (viz., governmentality, actor network theory, and accountability) and propose a forth: cultural practice. The study of control as cultural practice is grounded in observation because it conceives of cultural knowledge as practical and largely extra-linguistic. It conceptualises organisational control as an effect of the actions and ideas of organisational members beyond the ranks of management, thus widening the field of empirical inquiry. It also makes studies of steady state organisations more attractive thereby opening {{the possibility that the}} assemblages of people, purposes, and technologies, which give rise to specific forms of organisational control, may be understood as less ephemeral than, particularly, studies of governmentality and actor network theory have suggested. Our ethnography of a steel mill in Sheffield is based on 11 months of participant observation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>shop</b> <b>floors</b> of <b>the</b> hot and cold departments. We argue that the subcultures of different <b>shop</b> <b>floors</b> were constituted in practices of control which enabled organisational members to pursue diverse objectives that were related to their various wider cultural aspirations. Organisational control practices relied on diverse accountings and accounts of organisational actions and purposes. Whilst we found considerable diversity between subcultures, we also found that individual subcultures, and the tensions and contradictions within them, exhibited much continuity. The ability of studies of organisational subcultures to bring out the diversity as well as continuity of practices holds considerable potential for our understanding of organisational control.
