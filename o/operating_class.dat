Most of these engines were in excellent condition and didn't need repairs. Also, in 1939, the railroad experimented with welded rail before many other railroads.|$|E

There are 14 <b>operating</b> <b>Class</b> I wells in Arkansas: 4 hazardous and 10 nonhazardous wells (Linda Hanson, Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, oral commun., 2013). Four of the wells are “shut-in,” meaning the wells are not currently injecting fluids.|$|E

5000|$|Bannan was an {{advocate}} of what historian Eric Foner has dubbed the “free labor ideology" [...] of the nineteenth century. The ideology was built upon the belief that social mobility was an inherent aspect of economic expansion. Labor, then, “embraced all producers of wealth”, an economy centered on independent farms and small shops, rather than factories. In this ideology, capitalism and labor worked in harmony and were not opposing factors. The Miners’ Journal was a play on the “free labor” ideology: the journal was for the small <b>operating</b> <b>class,</b> not the mine workers.|$|E

They are: Lone Star Park in Grand Prairie, Retama Park in Selma, and Sam Houston Race Park in Houston. Class 2 tracks can be granted {{a maximum of}} 60 racing days per year. Several class 2 tracks are under development, but none are currently <b>operating.</b> <b>Class</b> 3 licenses are issued to county or nonprofit fairs, and allow 16 racing days at most.

50|$|The most {{efficient}} valve-based RF amplifiers <b>operate</b> <b>Class</b> C. If used with no tuned circuit in the output, this would distort the input signal, producing harmonics. However, class C amplifiers normally use a high Q output network which removes the harmonics, leaving an undistorted sine wave {{identical to the}} input waveform. Class C is suitable only for amplifying signals with a constant amplitude, such as FM, FSK, and some CW (Morse code) signals. Where the amplitude of the input signal to the amplifier varies as with single sideband modulation, amplitude modulation, video and complex digital signals, the amplifier must <b>operate</b> <b>class</b> A or AB, to preserve the envelope of the driving signal in an undistorted form. Such amplifiers {{are referred to as}} linear amplifiers.|$|R
