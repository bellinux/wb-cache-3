40|$|Ballast fouling {{is created}} by the {{breakdown}} of aggregates or outside contamination by coal dust from coal trains, or from soil intrusion beneath rail track. Due to ballast <b>fouling,</b> the conditions <b>of</b> rail track can be deteriorated considerably {{depending on the type}} <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> material and the degree <b>of</b> <b>fouling.</b> So far there is no comprehensive guideline available to identify the critical degree <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> for different types <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> materials. This paper presents the identification <b>of</b> degree <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> and types <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> using non-destructive testing, namely seismic surface-wave and ground penetrating radar (GPR) survey. To understand this, a model rail track with different degree <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> has been constructed in Civil engineering laboratory, University of Wollongong, Australia. Shear wave velocity obtained from seismic survey has been employed to identify the degree <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> and types <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> material. It is found that shear wave velocity <b>of</b> <b>fouled</b> ballast increases initially, reaches optimum fouling point (OFP), and decreases when the fouling increases. The degree <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> corresponding after which the shear wave velocity <b>of</b> <b>fouled</b> ballast will be smaller than that of clean ballast is called the critical fouling point (CFP). Ground penetrating radar with four different ground coupled antennas (500 MHz, 800 MHz, 1. 6 GHz and 2. 3 GHz) was also used to identify the ballast fouling condition. It is found that the 800 MHz ground coupled antenna gives a better signal in assessing the ballast fouling condition. Seismic survey is relatively slow when compared to GPR survey however it gives quantifiable results. In contrast, GPR survey is faster and better in estimating the depth <b>of</b> <b>fouling.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Impact <b>of</b> ballast <b>fouling</b> on {{rail tracks}} Ballast fouling is {{understood}} as major cause of track deterioration in many countries over the world. It decreases the drainage and load bearing capacity of the ballast layer. A series of large scale hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted with different proportions <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> to access the drainage capacity of the track. A numerical analysis was conducted using SEEP/W to quantify the drainage capacity of ballast under different degrees <b>of</b> <b>fouling.</b> Subsequently, track drainage classification {{in relation to the}} degree <b>of</b> <b>fouling,</b> which is a very useful tool for practical engineers, is presented in this paper. The analysis showed that both the location and extent <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> played an important role when assessing the overall drainage capacity of track. In order to establish the relationship between the extent <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> and the associated strength-deformation properties, a series of large scale monotonic triaxial tests were carried out for different levels <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> for three different confining pressures. Based on the laboratory findings, a novel empirical relationship between the peak deviator stress and VCI has been proposed to assist the practitioner in their preliminary track condition assessment.

40|$|Historically, fouling organisms {{on ships}} {{have been a}} major source of {{introduced}} species (Carlton 1979 a, 1979 b, 1987, 1989). Modern anti-fouling paints and high ship speeds greatly reduce the amount <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> today. However, fouling is often common in sea chests and at certain points on the bottom. We sampled tankers during routine maintenance in dry dock, selected to estimate the potential range <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> and diversity <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> organisms. 7 B. Methods We sampled the <b>fouling</b> communities <b>of</b> two ships in dry dock: the S/R Baytown (in San Francisco Bay), which had not been cleaned in dry dock for approximately 2 years; and the S/R Benicia (in Portland), which had been cleaned in dry dock within about 6 months. The S/R Baytown had remained within San Francisco Bay for several months without making an ocean voyage prior to haul out, providing time for further accumulation <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> organisms. Representative patches <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> communities were scraped from the bottoms of the ships within 6 hours of haul out and before any cleaning had commenced. The sea chests and strainers of the ambient water intakes were also sampled.

5|$|Similarly, {{there are}} no {{regulations}} at all concerning the dimensions <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that {{is close to the}} outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can {{have a significant effect on}} how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in that regard are largely insignificant.|$|E
