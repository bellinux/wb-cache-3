5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One {{possible explanation is}} that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle,</b> proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche, where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.|$|E
5|$|Kevin {{travels with}} his mother in a car which breaks down. Gates arrives {{offering}} to help fix the car, and Kevin, who appears in two places at once, is able to distract him and help them escape. However, Kevin's mother, hurt by Gates, runs the car into a ditch, dying as a result. Scully tells Kevin she'll protect him. They bring him to a hotel where Scully notices an additional wound on Kevin's side. Scully becomes upset at Mulder for his unwillingness to accept the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle.</b> As they talk, Gates breaks into the bathroom, kidnapping Kevin by prying {{an opening in the}} barred window. Scully returns to see Kevin's father but finds him heavily drugged.|$|E

5|$|The Temple is {{surrounded}} by sites where villagers worship, generating the power needed to cast miracles. Villagers require feeding, healing or rest to worship. How many villagers worship is controlled at the Village Centre, and which miracles are available depends on those available at the player's villages. Miracles include providing food or wood, healing people, and providing shields to protect an area. Miracles can also be cast by using Miracle Dispensers, a common reward for completing Silver Reward Scrolls. These allow the casting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> without worship. Miracles can only be cast, and most other actions performed, within the player's area of influence, which can be extended by expanding the population of villages owned, or by taking over others. Miracles can be selected at the Temple or Village Centre, or by performing certain gestures with the Hand. Power can also be produced by sacrificing living beings at the altar.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{standard}} procedures {{that lead to}} sainthood, Pope Benedict XVI declared that the late pontiff had lived a life of heroic virtue and conferred the title of Venerable upon him on 20 December 2012.

His liturgical feast is celebrated on the date of his birth on 26 September.|$|E
25|$|On 19 April a {{court martial}} on board Royal Sovereign honourably acquitted Captain Le Gros, his officers, and the ship's company. The board praised Le Gros {{for his actions}} in saving so many of Hindostans crew and passengers. Nelson himself remarked that the {{preservation}} of the crew seemed little short <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle.</b> The board recommended Hindostan's acting lieutenant, Thomas Banks, to Nelson for promotion for his conduct during the wreck; his promotion to lieutenant was confirmed on 23 June 1804.|$|E
25|$|Her {{cause for}} sainthood {{commenced}} on 27 September 1975, under Pope Paul VI, {{and she became}} titled as <b>a</b> Servant <b>of</b> God; while the confirmation of her life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope John Paul II to name her as Venerable on 23 October 1987. Martillo was beatified on 25 October 1992, after the approval <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1967 <b>miracle,</b> while the confirmation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 1992 <b>miracle</b> allowed for Pope Benedict XVI to canonise her on 12 October 2008 in Saint Peter's Square.|$|R

25|$|By {{reason of}} the very purity of His being, God is {{distinguished}} from all finite beings. Hence it follows, in the first place, that the world could only have come from God by creation; secondly, that not even by way <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> can any finite nature be given creative power, which of itself directly attains the very being of any being; and finally, that no created agent can in any way influence the being of any effect unless it has itself been moved by the first Cause.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, Fuller was nailed with a 15-yard {{facemask}} penalty while tackling Vikings running back Allen Rice after he gained 19 yards {{on a screen}} pass, setting up Nelson's 46-yard field goal to put the Vikings up 33–17. Then defensive back Carl Lee intercepted a pass from Young, allowing Minnesota to run more time off the clock. Following a punt, Young led the 49ers 68 yards in eight plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end John Frank, but by then there was only 3:42 left in the game. Nelson later kicked a postseason record fifth field goal, this one from 46 yards, to completely dash any hope <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> comeback.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} quarter, Green Bay lost {{multiple}} chances {{to get back}} into the game. First, Brooks' 43-yard punt return was nullified when Jim Jeffcoat deflected Favre's pass into the arms of defensive end Charles Haley on the next play. Dallas then drove 47 yards, including a 27-yard reception by Irvin, to score on Murray's 38-yard field goal and increase their lead to 27–10. The Packers responded with a drive from their 15 to the Dallas 15, but any hope <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> comeback was dashed on the 13th play when safety Darren Woodson ended the drive with an interception. In the last two minutes of the game, Green Bay scored on Favre's 29-yard touchdown throw to Sharpe, but by then the game was well out of reach.|$|E

25|$|According to a later legend, the {{sanctuary}} was erected by Emperor Leo I the Thracian (r. 457–474) because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> that occurred {{when he was}} still a soldier. Before entering the City, Leo met a blind man who asked him to give him water. A female voice ordered the future Emperor to wet the eyes of the blind man with water from a nearby swamp. The same voice added that she had chosen that very place to be worshiped and that he would one day receive the crown to the empire. Leo followed her order and at once the blind man recovered his eyesight. After his accession to the throne, the Emperor erected a magnificent church on this place. This legend is possibly a later invention of the monks of {{the sanctuary}}. It is possible that, before the Justinian's building was erected, a small monastery had already existed there.|$|E
25|$|Laughton {{appeared}} in two comedies with Deanna Durbin, It Started with Eve (1941) and Because of Him (1946). He portrayed a bloodthirsty pirate in Captain Kidd (1945) and a malevolent judge in The Paradine Case (1948). Laughton played a megalomaniac press tycoon in The Big Clock (1948). He had supporting roles as a Nazi in pre-war Paris in Arch of Triumph (1948), as a bishop in The Girl from Manhattan (1948), as a seedy go-between in The Bribe (1949), {{and as a}} kindly widower in The Blue Veil (1951). He played a Bible-reading pastor in the multi-story A Miracle Can Happen (1947), but his piece wound up being cut and replaced with another featuring Dorothy Lamour, {{and in this form}} the film was retitled as On Our Merry Way. However, an original print <b>of</b> <b>A</b> <b>Miracle</b> Can Happen was sent abroad for dubbing before the Laughton sequence was deleted, and in this form it was shown in Spain as Una Encuesta Llamada Milagro.|$|E
25|$|Kent's {{career began}} as a sign and coach painter who was {{encouraged}} to study art, design and architecture by his employer. A group of Yorkshire gentlemen sent Kent {{for a period of}} study in Rome, and he set sail on 22 July 1709 from Deal, Kent, arriving at Livorno on 15 October. By 18 November he was in Florence, staying there until April 1710 before finally setting off for Rome. In 1713 he was awarded the second medal in the second class for painting in the annual competition run by the Accademia di San Luca for his painting <b>of</b> <b>A</b> <b>Miracle</b> of S. Andrea Avellino. He also met several important figures including Thomas Coke, later 1st Earl of Leicester, with whom he toured Northern Italy in the summer of 1714 (a tour that led Kent to an appreciation of the architectural style of Andrea Palladio's palaces in Vicenza), and Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni in Rome, for whom he apparently painted some pictures, though no records survive. During his stay in Rome, he painted the ceiling of the church of San Giuliano dei Fiamminghi (Church of St. Julian of the Flemings) with the Apotheosis of St. Julian. The most significant meeting was between Kent and Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington. Kent left Rome for the last time in the autumn of 1719, met Lord Burlington briefly at Genoa, Kent journeying on to Paris, where Lord Burlington later joined him for the final journey back to England {{before the end of the}} year. As a painter, he displaced Sir James Thornhill in decorating the new staterooms at Kensington Palace, London; for Burlington, he helped to decorate Chiswick House, especially the painted ceilings, and Burlington House.|$|E

500|$|McKinley {{was easily}} re-elected as {{governor}} in 1893.

[...] He followed the usual Ohio custom and stepped {{down at the end of}} two two-year terms, returning home to Canton in January 1896 to municipal celebrations. [...] The Canton Repository stated, [...] "It is just plain Mr. McKinley of Canton now, but wait a little while." [...] To devote full-time to McKinley's presidential campaign, Hanna in 1895 turned over management of his companies to his brother Leonard.

500|$|For the French, the {{survival}} of the Corps Mortier seemed nothing short <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle.</b> The remainder of Gazan's division crossed the river the next morning and eventually recuperated in Vienna, which the French acquired by deception later in the month. More importantly for them, the French force had performed well over difficult terrain and under terrible combat conditions. Initially there had been some panic and parts of at least one French battalion had tried to escape on the flotilla craft. They had lost control of the boats in the current and smashed into the pillars of the burned bridge at Krems, overturning their boats. Tossed into the icy river, most had drowned. Despite this initial panic, Gazan's column retained its cohesion, and responded well to various difficult demands. Dupont had demonstrated his tactical acumen: when he heard cannon fire, he directed his troops toward it to support the French division. In terms of French staffing, Mortier's failure to guard his flank, especially in the face of Napoleon's direct advice, adversely influenced his relationship with his commander. However, in the immediate weeks ahead, the flamboyant Murat did more to annoy Napoleon than Mortier had. In assessing the battle and its aftermath, historians have laid the blame and credit for its outcome not only on Mortier and Gazan: [...] "Napoleon, aware of Mortier's danger and his own culpability for it, vented his frustration on Murat, whom he unjustly accused of abandoning Mortier for the empty glory of riding through Vienna." ...|$|E
