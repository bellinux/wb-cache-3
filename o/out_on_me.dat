500|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Man Tag Team match {{originally}} planned to pit {{the team of}} Samoa Joe, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall against The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, and Tomko), who were accompanied by Karen Angle. Hall had announced that morning {{that he would not}} show up. Prior to the match, Joe delivered an unscheduled, unscripted speech to the crowd explaining his anger and distaste for Hall's failure to show up for the event. He said that Hall [...] "punked <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> and on every single fan in this building tonight", and concluded: [...] "Scott Hall, chico, kiss my ass, you punked out and you're a punk". He [...] followed this by announcing Hall's replacement in the match: Eric Young. The six men fought for a total of nine minutes and thirty-one seconds, before Joe slammed Tomko into the mat with his Muscle Buster maneuver to gain the pinfall.|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{responded to}} Cannon's {{comments}} sarcastically, clarifying that {{the song was}} really [...] "wishing the couple the best", {{and that it was}} a misunderstanding. In an interview with BBC Radio, Eminem clarified that although contained a [...] "harsh" [...] line, he meant well: [...] "There's a line on there that was a little harsh. It's a harsh line. But it's like this, the way I look at it, I had no idea he was gonna take it like he took it. I had no idea Nick Cannon was gonna start wildin' <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> No pun intended." [...] He later commented that he respected Cannon for his comment, and that he expected him to stand up for his wife: [...] "I didn't read his blog or anything. But it is what it is. He's supposed to defend his wife, and I expected him to do that. But {{at the end of the}} day, it's a line I said – it's a song. What I actually meant to say is, I wish them the best. That's what I meant to say. That's the whole message of the record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wheatfield {{backdrop}}: The {{backdrop of}} the painting is a wheat field being devoured by grasshoppers under the blazing hot sun (this derives from an incident on the Kurelek farm when William was a boy). Kurelek writes, [...] "this refers to my belief that my problems stemmed in a large part from my father taking <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> his raging impotence {{in the face of}} farming failures." ...|$|E

60|$|There was a painless {{stage of}} {{incubation}} that lasted twenty-five years, {{and then it}} broke <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> and people said I was It.|$|E
60|$|I {{liked to}} feel her hearty indignation flash <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> in that way. We {{see so much}} malice and so little indignation in my profession.|$|E
6000|$|... "Luckily she married, {{and married}} well," [...] said Henchard. [...] "So that these reproaches she poured <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> do not now cause me any twinges, {{as they might}} {{otherwise}} have done....Just listen to what an angry woman will say!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You don't know Mary. She {{would never}} forgive me. You don't know what sympathy, what angelic sympathy, she has poured <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> about Amy. I can't {{possibly}} {{tell her the}} whole thing was a fraud. It would make her feel so foolish.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. Not at first; {{but they}} come <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> by degrees. It {{is such a}} pleasure, and so kind of Mr. White to have put it there. He had it hung there, Mrs. Halfpenny told me, instead of his own picture just before I came in here.' ...|$|E
60|$|And {{there was}} Mr Crimble--an immeasurable {{distance}} away; {{yet he had}} still the strange power to arrest me, to look <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> in my path. Must the future be all of its piece? I stopped thinking again, and my eyes wandered over my silk skirt and shoes.|$|E

6000|$|... "Say, lady, how's {{the chance}} for borrowin' a couple of dollars? I was workin' for a Finnski back here a ways, and he did me dirt--holdin' <b>out</b> my wages <b>on</b> <b>me</b> {{till the end of}} the month." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} let my mother go <b>out</b> without <b>me</b> <b>on</b> such an {{occasion}} as this. But I am grateful to you, Mrs. Orme, for coming also." ...|$|R
60|$|Mother took it <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> with {{a lecture}} on disobedience. She must have known, after what I had done, that father wouldn't let her smack me; for, while she was lecturing, father winked at me across her shoulder. It {{was the first time}} he had ever winked at me.|$|E
6000|$|... "You, you!" [...] my eyes cried <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> And {{a furious}} storm--remorse, grief, horror-broke within. I knew the whole awful truth. Like a Shade {{in the bright}} light, Mr Crimble stood there beyond the table, not looking at me, its face turned away. Unspeakable misery bowed my shoulders, chilled my skin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like this}} place," [...] said she, {{breaking}} a long silence, [...] "it is so dismal —so uncanny. Do you know I wouldn’t dare {{to sit here}} alone, Jem. I should imagine that all sorts of dreadful things were hidden behind the bushes and trees, waiting to spring <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> Ugh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Business, laddie, pure business. Very well, then. We shall {{catch the}} eleven-twenty at Waterloo. Don't miss it. Look <b>out</b> for <b>me</b> <b>on</b> the platform. If I see you first, I'll shout." ...|$|R

60|$|Long I {{looked at}} her, {{dwelling}} upon that one visible bit {{of her as}} only a man would who deemed it the most precious thing in the world. So insistent was my gaze that at last she stirred under the blankets, the top fold was thrown back and she smiled <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> her eyes yet heavy with sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a wonder!" [...] said Mr. Peters. [...] "You're fresh, and {{you have}} no respect for your elders and betters; but you deliver the goods. That's the point. Why, I'm {{beginning}} to feel great! Say, do you know I felt a new muscle in the small of my back this morning? They are coming <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> like a rash." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> indeed," [...] {{said the}} cavalier; [...] "out {{on me for}} a poor tame-spirited creature, that submits to be bandied about in this manner, {{by a man who}} is neither better born nor better bred than myself. I tell thee, Mark, you make an unfair use of your {{advantages}} over me. Why will you not let me go from you, and live and die after my own fashion?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I wish,' he said, 'that {{any time}} you're feeling blue about things {{you would come}} up and pour <b>out</b> the poison <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> It's no good {{bottling}} it up. Come up and tell me about it, and you'll feel ever so much better. Or let me come down. Any time things aren't going right just knock on the ceiling.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In New Zealand, {{the album}} was {{released}} three times: firstly in 1966 (cat. no. 237632, as above), secondly in the early 1970s, titled The Beatles in Hamburg (cat. no. NZ SP 125). The track [...] "Take <b>Out</b> Some Insurance <b>on</b> <b>Me,</b> Baby" [...] was retitled [...] "If You Love Me, Baby", and in 1977 was released as a double LP (cat. no. 118) ...|$|R
6000|$|Nares {{seemed to}} take it mighty quietly. [...] "That so?" [...] said he. [...] "Now, cast your eyes on that and own you're beaten!" [...] and with a {{formidable}} clap of his open hand, he flattened <b>out</b> before <b>me,</b> <b>on</b> the deck, a pair of newspapers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Condition?" [...] he queried {{with a fine}} {{assumption}} of innocence. [...] "Why, that is why I did ship. I was in tiptop shape when I sailed. All this come <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> afterward. You remember seem' me aloft, an' up to my neck in water. And I trimmed coal below, too. A sick man couldn't do it. And remember, sir, you'll have to testify to how I did my duty at the beginning before I took down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{all of this}} I agreed, {{staying in}} my house {{and for the first}} time in my life {{attempting}} to cook. And the plague did not come <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> By means of the telephone I could talk with whomsoever I pleased and get the news. Also, there were the newspapers, and I ordered all of them to be thrown up to my door so that I could know what was happening with the rest of the world.|$|E
60|$|The {{singular}} {{manner in}} which she had chosen to assert herself, the extraordinary practical vindication of her position in the town which she had just offered, had so perplexed me that I listened to her in silent surprise. I was not the less resolved, however, to make another effort to throw her off her guard. If the woman's fierce temper once got beyond her control, and once flamed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> she might yet say the words which would put the clue in my hands.|$|E
6000|$|All {{through the}} watch {{this sort of}} thing went on. Yes, and the {{subsequent}} watches were much like it, during a stretch of months. As I have said, I soon got the habit of coming on duty with dread. The moment I was in the presence, even in the darkest night, I could feel those yellow eyes upon me, and knew their owner was watching for a pretext to spit <b>out</b> some venom <b>on</b> <b>me.</b> Preliminarily he would say-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew them}} only by sight. My friend Matteo Giustiniani had pointed them <b>out</b> to <b>me,</b> <b>on</b> one occasion, {{as being the}} daughters of Signor Polani, and {{connections}} of his. When their gondola had passed mine, a few minutes previously, I recognized their faces {{by the light of}} the torches in their boat." ...|$|R
25|$|As I {{think about}} it, it {{is none of}} these things. They are not {{the reasons for this}} incident, there's a much later point to it all. Happiness. Yes happiness. If I am out of the way, all the family can get down to their own lives. Mother will {{not have to worry about}} me making my grades, and Daddy will not have to put <b>out</b> more money <b>on</b> <b>me,</b> which would do no more good than it did in high school.|$|R
