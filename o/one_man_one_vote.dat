5|$|In 1964, the Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Reynolds v. Sims that state {{legislative}} seats must be apportioned {{on the principle}} of <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote.</b> A number of state legislatures, including Maryland, had systems based on geography rather than population, and the court rules that this violated the 14th Amendment. Disproportionate population growth across Maryland since 1838 meant that the principle of one seat per county gave the voters of some counties, such as those on the eastern shore, disproportionate representation. Other counties, especially those in suburban areas, were underrepresented.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s, {{the reforms}} of Prime Minister Terence O'Neill, {{designed}} {{to create a more}} equitable society between unionists and nationalists, resulted in a backlash led by fundamentalist Protestant minister Ian Paisley. Nationalists launched a Civil Rights movement in the mid-1960s with key demands made on matters such as <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote.</b> With attacks on Northern Ireland's infrastructure by loyalists, and the resignation of a relative from the Cabinet over the principle of <b>One</b> <b>man</b> <b>One</b> <b>Vote,</b> O'Neill resigned on 2 April 1969 to be replaced by Chichester Clark.|$|E

25|$|On August 14, 1956, Rankin was {{appointed}} U.S. Solicitor General. In response to lawsuits {{in many states}} arising out of legislative reapportionment fights, he developed the Justice Department’s position {{that led to the}} principle of <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote.</b> After serving as solicitor general from August 1956 to January 1961, Rankin represented the American Civil Liberties Union in advancing the landmark case, Gideon v.

500|$|Harlan was {{the sole}} {{dissenter}} in Reynolds v. Sims, in which the Court relied on the Equal Protection Clause to extend the <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote</b> principle to state legislative districts. He analyzed the language {{and history of the}} Fourteenth Amendment, and concluded that the Equal Protection Clause was never intended to encompass voting rights. Because the Fifteenth Amendment would have been superfluous if the Fourteenth Amendment (the basis of the reapportionment decisions) had conferred a general right to vote, he claimed that the Constitution did not require states to adhere to the <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote</b> principle, and that the Court was merely imposing its own political theories on the nation. He suggested, in addition, that the problem of malapportionment was one that should be solved by the political process, and not by litigation. He wrote: ...|$|E
40|$|A {{frequently}} voiced democratic {{catch phrase}} is 'one <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> vote; <b>one</b> <b>vote,</b> <b>one</b> value'. Equality of representation, or proportional representation, is often {{taken as a}} guarantee that the democratic criterion is met. Whereas proportional representation may ensure 'one <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> vote', however, it is dubious whether it will also ensure 'one <b>vote,</b> <b>one</b> value'. The latter component is defined here as voting power, and an analytical procedure is outlined which investigates the distribution of power. Application of the procedure to three EEC institutions [...] the Council of Ministers, the European Assembly, and the European Parliament [...] indicates clear disparities between the distributions of votes and of power, which have implications for national sovereignty. ...|$|R

500|$|The Constitutional {{restraint}} on {{the size}} of rural Parliamentary constituencies was later removed, providing what one commentator called [...] "an indirect buttress" [...] to Malay special rights; as Malays were concentrated in rural areas, this indirectly enhanced Malay political power.

The change was denounced as [...] "giving <b>one</b> <b>man</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote,</b> another a number of votes: not on the basis of, say, intellectual ability or geographical accident, but in order to ensure the dominance of a particular group." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{constitution}} {{agreed upon}} was {{based largely on}} the one Rhodesia had just adopted, but would eventually bring about a black majority in parliament. Black representation in the House would be immediately increased, {{and a majority of}} both black and white MPs would have to approve retrogressive legislation; blacks would thus wield an effective veto [...] "as long as they voted solidly together", Robert Blake comments. [...] "The principle of majority rule was enshrined with safeguards ensuring that there could be no legislation which could impede this," [...] Smith wrote in his memoirs.

More than one Commonwealth member state hosted training facilities for black communist guerrillas, he said, which threatened all [...] "civilised states in Africa". He dismissed <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote</b> as false [...] "trash democracy", and said that in the present geopolitical climate countries run by black Africans inevitably destroyed themselves.

500|$|Derry City, officially called Londonderry, lies {{near the}} border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It has a {{majority}} nationalist population, and nationalists won a majority of seats in the 1920 local elections. Despite this, the Ulster Unionist Party controlled the local council, Londonderry Corporation, from 1923 onwards. The Unionists maintained their majority, firstly, by manipulating the constituency boundaries (gerrymandering) so that the South Ward, with a nationalist majority, returned eight councillors while the much smaller North Ward and Waterside Ward, with unionist majorities, returned twelve councillors between them; secondly, by allowing only ratepayers to vote in local elections, rather than <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote,</b> so that a higher number of nationalists, who did not own homes, were disenfranchised; and thirdly, by denying houses to nationalists outside the South Ward constituency. The result {{was that there were}} about 2,000 nationalist families, and practically no unionists, on the housing waiting list, and that housing in the nationalist area was crowded and of a very poor condition. [...] The South Ward comprised the Bogside, Brandywell, Creggan, Bishop Street and Foyle Road, and it was this area that would become Free Derry.|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesian {{government}} was ardently anti-communist, and opposed immediate black rule, which Smith said would cause [...] "the destruction of our country", pointing to ongoing {{events such as}} the Congo Crisis as evidence. Parliament remained mostly white, but Salisbury contended it had close to unanimous support from all races in pursuing independence under the 1961 constitution, citing various tests of opinion it conducted in late 1964. The Prime Minister stood obdurately against any constitutional change he believed was too radical, regarding this as a matter of national and regional security. According to his memoirs, he worked to prevent a [...] "mad rush into <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote</b> with all the resultant corruption, nepotism, chaos and economic disaster which we had witnessed in all the countries around us." [...] The Labour Cabinet of British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, which replaced the previous Conservative administration in October 1964, did not give credence to the Rhodesian tests of opinion, and insisted on majority rule as a condition for independence. [...] The Commonwealth repeatedly urged Britain to intervene directly should Rhodesian defiance continue, while British liberals worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid.|$|E
500|$|The conference {{started on}} the morning of 26 August as planned. The six Rhodesian delegates took their places first, then around 40 nationalists entered and crowded around Muzorewa on the {{opposite}} side of the cramped railway carriage. Vorster and Kaunda arrived and sat on the Rhodesian side, where there was more space, and each spoke in turn, giving their blessing to the negotiations. Muzorewa then opened the proceedings at Smith's invitation. Speaking assertively, the bishop gave three concessions which would have to be given by the Rhodesian side for talks to begin: first, <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote</b> was established by Muzorewa to be [...] "a basic necessity"; second, an amnesty would have to be given for all guerrilla fighters, including those convicted of murder by the High Court in Salisbury; and finally, all of the nationalists would have to be given permission to return to Rhodesia as soon as possible to begin political campaigning. Smith replied calmly that Kaunda, Nyerere and Vorster had all assured him that the UANC had agreed not to demand preconditions for talks, and that Kaunda and Vorster had in fact confirmed this to him that same morning; his delegation was therefore surprised by Muzorewa's confrontational opening speech.|$|E

This settlement, boycotted by the PF and rejected internationally, led to multiracial elections and Rhodesia's reconstitution under majority rule as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979. Muzorewa, the electoral victor, took office as the country's first black Prime Minister {{at the head of}} a coalition Cabinet comprising 12 blacks and five whites, including Smith as minister without portfolio. Dismissing Muzorewa as a [...] "neocolonial puppet", ZANLA and ZIPRA continued their armed struggle until December 1979, when Whitehall, Salisbury and the Patriotic Front settled at Lancaster House. Muzorewa's government revoked UDI, thereby ending the country's claim to be independent after 14 years, and dissolved itself. The UK suspended the constitution and vested full executive and legislative powers in a new Governor, Lord Soames, who oversaw a ceasefire and fresh elections during February and March 1980. These were won by ZANU, whose leader Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister when the UK granted independence to Zimbabwe as a republic within the Commonwealth in April 1980.|$|E
500|$|Until the 1960s, the New Jersey Senate had 21 representatives, {{one from}} each county {{regardless}} of population. In {{the wake of}} the 1964 decision by the Supreme Court of the United States in Reynolds v. Sims, establishing the <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote</b> principle that state legislative districts must be approximately equal in size, David Friedland filed suit in New Jersey Supreme Court on behalf of two union leaders, challenging a system under which each county was represented by a single member in the New Jersey Senate. The senate enacted a proposal whereby each senator's vote would be weighted based on the population of the county represented, [...] under which Cape May County's senator would receive one vote while the senator from Essex County would receive 19.1, in direct relation to the ratio of residents between counties. In a decision issued on December 15, 1964, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the weighted voting system as adopted was unconstitutional. The court ordered that interim measures be established for the 1965 legislative elections, in which weighted voting {{could be used as a}} temporary measure, and that the needed constitutional changes to restructure the New Jersey Legislature to be in compliance with [...] "one man, one vote" [...] requirements be in place before elections took place in 1967. The legislature's final decision was to establish 40 districts statewide, each represented by one senator and two assemblymembers, without relation to county boundaries.|$|E
500|$|Henry Kissinger, the US Secretary of State, {{announced}} a formal {{interest in the}} Rhodesian situation in February 1976, {{and over the next}} half-year held discussions with Britain, South Africa and the Frontline States in what became the [...] "Anglo-American initiative". Meeting Smith in Pretoria on 18 September 1976, Kissinger proposed majority rule after a transition period of two years. According to Smith, Kissinger told him he considered his participation in the [...] "demise of Rhodesia" [...] to be [...] "one of the great tragedies of my life". He strongly encouraged Smith to accept his deal, though he knew it was unpalatable to him, as any future offer could only be worse from Smith's standpoint—especially if, as expected, US President Gerald Ford lost the upcoming election to Jimmy Carter. Smith expressed great reluctance, but agreed on 24 September after Vorster intimated that South Africa might cut off financial and military aid if he refused. It was the first time Smith had publicly accepted the principles of unconditional majority rule and <b>one</b> <b>man,</b> <b>one</b> <b>vote.</b> However, the Frontline States then abruptly revised their stance and turned the Kissinger terms down, saying that any transition period was unacceptable. Britain quickly arranged an all-party conference in Geneva, Switzerland to try to salvage a solution. ZANU and ZAPU announced that they would attend this and any summit thereafter as a joint [...] "Patriotic Front" [...] (PF), including members of both parties under a combined leadership. The Geneva Conference, held between October and December 1976 under British mediation, also failed.|$|E

It later emerged that some of the assailants were in fact off-duty policemen. Many marchers were injured, 13 requiring hospital treatment.
