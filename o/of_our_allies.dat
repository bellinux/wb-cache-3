500|$|After the war the Australian Signal Officer-in-Chief, Major General Colin Simpson, {{paid tribute}} to the {{spotters}}, writing that they were [...] "infantrymen without a typical battlefield, artillerymen without field pieces and tank crews without tanks. Apart from a hard core of very talented personnel, all that most spotters had in common was an abysmal ignorance of {{anything to do with}} signals. Yet they won the respect <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Allies</b> and every branch of the Australian forces". He continued, stating that [...] "they were dedicated to their duty and they never failed. The New Guinea Air Warning Wireless Company is a Signal unit of which very little has been heard as their duties were top secret at all times. It can be stated that the successful course of the war could have been seriously delayed, if not greatly prolonged, if this signal unit had not operated so efficiently." ...|$|E

Thanks to a carefully planned time-table, the effects of wear and tear had been kept to a minimum. Captain Parker described the march discipline – [...] "As we marched through the country <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Allies,</b> commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse ... the soldiers {{had nothing to do}} but pitch their tents, boil kettles and lie down to rest." [...] In response to Marlborough's manoeuvres, the Elector and Marsin, conscious of their numerical disadvantage with only 40,000 men, moved their forces to the entrenched camp at Dillingen on the north bank of the Danube. Marlborough could not attack Dillingen {{because of a lack of}} siege guns – he was unable to bring any from the Low Countries, and Baden had failed to supply any despite assurances to the contrary.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} the USA PATRIOT Act is the immigration provisions that allow for the indefinite detention of any alien who the Attorney General believes may cause a terrorist act.

She warned that [...] "Indefinite detention upon secret evidence—which the USA PATRIOT Act allows—sounds more like Taliban justice than ours. Our claim that we are attempting to build an international coalition against terrorism will be severely undermined if we pass legislation allowing even citizens <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>allies</b> to be incarcerated without basic U.S. guarantees of fairness and justice." ...|$|E

Israel did not raise objections to the sale, {{except to say that}} it was [...] "not thrilled about it."

2500|$|Some {{transgender}} {{people have}} criticized the HRC for its stance on the 2007 version of ENDA, {{which at the time}} included sexual orientation as a protected category but not gender identity and expression. Once the legislation was submitted by Rep. Barney Frank, HRC officially neither opposed nor supported it. This followed a speech by former HRC President Joe Solmonese at the transgender Southern Comfort Conference the previous month, where he said that HRC [...] "oppose any legislation that is not absolutely inclusive". HRC later explained that it could not actively support a non-inclusive bill, but did not oppose it because the legislation would strategically advance long-term efforts to pass a trans-inclusive ENDA. However, in a letter to U.S. Representatives, HRC did express support for the bill, stating that while HRC is [...] "greatly disappointed that the current version of ENDA is not inclusive... we appreciate the steadfast efforts <b>of</b> <b>our...</b> <b>allies...</b> even when they are forced... to make progress that is measured by inches rather than yards." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Spanish {{forces and}} their allies {{advanced}} into the city. Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the Aztecs could not halt the Spanish advance. While the fighting in the city raged, the Aztecs cut out and ate the hearts of 70 Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli. By August, many of the native inhabitants had fled Tlatelolco. Cortés sent emissaries {{to negotiate with the}} Tlatelolcas to join his side, but the Tlatelolcas remained loyal to the Aztecs. Throughout the siege, the Tlaxcalans waged a merciless campaign against the Aztecs who had long oppressed them as for hundreds of years the Tlaxcalans had been forced to hand over an annual quota of young men and women to be sacrificed and eaten at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, and now the Tlaxcalans saw their chance for revenge. The American historian Charles Robinson wrote: [...] "Centuries of hate and the basic viciousness of Mesoamerican warfare combined in violence that appalled Cortés himself". In letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, [...] Cortés wrote: [...] "We had more trouble in preventing our allies from killing with such cruelty than we had in fighting the enemy. For no race, however savage, has ever practiced such fierce and unnatural cruelty as the natives of these parts. Our allies also took many spoils that day, which we were unable to prevent, as they numbered more than 150,000 and we Spaniards only some nine hundred. Neither our precautions nor our warnings could stop their looting, though we did all we could...I had posted Spaniards in every street, so that when the people began to come out [...] they might prevent our allies from killing those wretched people, whose numbers was uncountable.

2500|$|With {{the death}} in December {{of his friend}} and close {{political}} ally, Count Wratislaw, Eugene became undisputed 'first minister' in Vienna. His position was built on his military successes, but his actual power was expressed through his role {{as president of the}} war council, and as de facto president of the conference which dealt with foreign policy. In this position of influence Eugene took the lead in pressing Charles VI towards peace. The government had come to accept that further war in the Netherlands or Spain was impossible without the aid of the Maritime Powers; yet the Emperor, still hoping that somehow he could place himself on the throne in Spain, refused to make peace at the Utrecht conference along with the other Allies. Reluctantly, Eugene prepared for another campaign, but lacking troops, finance, and supplies his prospects in 1713 were poor. Villars, with superior numbers, was able to keep Eugene guessing as to his true intent. Through successful feints and stratagems Landau fell to the French commander in August, followed in November by Freiburg. Eugene was reluctant to carry on the war, and wrote to the Emperor in June that a bad peace would be better than being 'ruined equally by friend and foe'. With Austrian finances exhausted and the German states reluctant to continue the war, Charles VI was compelled to enter into negotiations. Eugene and Villars (who had been old friends since the Turkish campaigns of the 1680s) initiated talks on 26 November. Eugene proved an astute and determined negotiator, and gained favourable terms by the Treaty of Rastatt signed on 7 March 1714 and the Treaty of Baden signed on 7 September 1714. Despite the failed campaign in 1713 the [...] Prince was able to declare that, [...] "in spite of the military superiority of our enemies and the defection <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>Allies,</b> the conditions of peace will be more advantageous and more glorious than those we would have obtained at Utrecht." ...|$|E
