25|$|Common {{procedure}} {{was that the}} secondary helicopter escorted a heavily damaged primary helicopter back to base, but Kennedy was asked to return to continue the pickup attempts of the F-4 backseater, Tempest 03B, Kennedy's first actual attempt at combat rescue. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>try,</b> his aircraft was hit and both enlisted men slightly wounded. The HH-3E was driven off by fire four times, taking more battle damage on each pass. Despite deteriorating weather conditions, a rupture in their forward fuel tank, and smoke in the aircraft, Kennedy's three crewmen joined him in wanting to try again. In the poor weather, Williamson noted that better reference points were {{on the left side}} of the aircraft and urged that Lt. Harris conduct the hover.|$|E

Daly ended up scoring a septuple-bogey 10, dropping to +8. He finished the round with an 82 and missing the cut.|$|R
500|$|As was Davis's penchant, {{he called}} for almost no {{rehearsal}} and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only [...] "Flamenco Sketches" [...] yielded a complete take <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>try.</b> That take, not the master, was issued in 1997 as a bonus alternate take. The five master takes issued, however, were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to [...] "Freddie Freeloader" [...] was recorded, but was not used for release or {{on the issues of}} Kind of Blue prior to the 1997 reissue. Pianist Wynton Kelly may not have been happy to see the man he replaced, Bill Evans, back in his old seat. Perhaps to assuage the pianist's feelings, Davis had Kelly play instead of Evans on the album's most blues-oriented number, [...] "Freddie Freeloader". The live album Miles Davis at Newport 1958 documents this band. However, the Newport Jazz Festival recording on July 3, 1958, reflects the band in its hard bop conception, the presence of Bill Evans only six weeks into his brief tenure in the Davis band notwithstanding, rather than the modal approach of Kind of Blue.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, 19 {{soldiers}} {{participated in}} a two-week assessment of the LSAT light machine gun at Fort Benning, Georgia to demonstrate its capabilities against the M249 SAW. [...] In one test the soldiers, half armed with SAWs and half with LSATs, marched six miles in full combat gear then fired at targets to measure stress and muscle fatigue. [...] Another test had the soldiers sprint 200 yards wearing body armor and a basic load of ammunition, then rapidly engage close-range targets. [...] A third week involved soldiers of the 75th Ranger Regiment performing a squad maneuver live-fire exercise in an urban setting. [...] Feedback from participants favored the LSAT for its lighter weight and decreased recoil. [...] Soldiers remarked the LSAT had better accuracy than the M249. [...] The semi-automatic option made it more viable for room clearing. [...] One Ranger even said the LSAT performed better than the Mk 46 machine gun used by special operations forces. 15 out of 19 soldiers that participated in the assessment said they would prefer using the LSAT in combat rather than the SAW. [...] The LSAT LMG is 41 percent lighter than the [...] SAW and its ammunition volume is 12 percent less, enabling all the soldiers that maneuvered the woodland obstacle course to complete it faster when carrying it. [...] Participants also took less time to zero their machine guns when using the LSAT; one soldier failed repeatedly to accurately zero the SAW but successfully zeroed the LSAT <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>try.</b> [...] The LMG users completed the course, on average, one minute and 11 seconds faster than SAW users due to increased mobility given by its shorter length, adjustable stock, and lighter ammo. [...] When firing, gunners felt virtually no recoil from the LSAT LMG. The eight prototype weapons fired a combined 25,000 rounds, moving its cased telescoped ammunition to technology readiness level 7.|$|E
2500|$|Tomb of the Unknowns marble was quarried {{in seven}} pieces for four layers; cap, die, base and {{sub-base}} (plinth) from Quarry 3 at [...] below the opening from early in 1930 to January 1931. The cap was quarried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>try</b> while the base required three attempts. [...] (No data available as to quarrying the plinth). The die was worked by 75 men for one year and three attempts until a 56-ton (55.86 metric) block {{came out of the}} quarry in late January 1931. [...] When the block was cut from the mountain it weighed 124 tons (123.69 metric). [...] A wire saw was then brought in to cut the block down to 56 tons (55.68 metric). [...] Because of the weight, Vermont Marble Company sent to the quarry a special derrick that was reinforced and heavily rigged. The initial lift was just enough to clear the quarry floor so the block could hang for 15 minutes while the hoist was inspected for stress. [...] Once out of the quarry, the trip to down to Marble took four days with the die block arriving {{on the grounds of the}} mill site on 3 February 1931. [...] On 8 February, the block was shipped to Vermont for cutting to final dimensions and carving the pilasters and bas-relief. [...] The work was completed in September and arrived at Arlington National Cemetery the same month. [...] Assembly started in September but after the base piece was put in place, imperfections were discovered halting the work until a replacement was received. [...] Three attempts were made before an acceptable piece was quarried. [...] In December, the replacement base arrived and the assembly was completed 31 December 1931. [...] This was followed by the carving work on the die block by the Piccirilli Brothers (who also carved the statue of Lincoln for the Lincoln Memorial) under the supervision of Tomb sculptor William Hudson Jones. When the Tomb assembly was completed 9 April 1932, the structure had the following dimensions.|$|E
50|$|For {{long-range}} weapons, the iwisa throwing {{club was}} paired against {{the ball and}} chain. After missing <b>the</b> target <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two <b>tries,</b> <b>the</b> ball and chain successfully shattered an ice dummy with enough force to kill a human. It would have crushed the windpipe and broken the sternum, possibly contusing the heart.

40|$|In {{the past}} several years, there have been {{important}} advances in the clinical epidemiology of antiepileptic drug resistance, as reviewed by Mohanraj and Brodie.
