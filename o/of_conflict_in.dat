40|$|At present {{there is}} limited {{research}} on the prevalence <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> the workplace.

One hundred and twenty three employees from a public and a private organisation responded to a questionnaire, which included the Rahim Organisational Conflict Inventory. The results of this study identified that the prevalence <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> the workplace is very high and that this prevalence decreased as the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>conflict</b> increased. Furthermore, the findings suggested that peoples' use <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution strategies vary as the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>conflict</b> increases. Lastly, the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> resolution styles <b>in</b> this study did not match previous research findings on cultural differences in dealing with interpersonal <b>conflict.</b> The implications <b>of</b> this study are that extensive research should be conducted on the escalation model <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>conflict</b> <b>in</b> the workplace.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the significance of}} Commission for Human Rights and Goodgovernance (CHRAGG) mandatory role in promoting peaceful management of onflicts in public secondary schools. The research problem was that despite several national and international efforts {{and the presence of}} CHRAGG, there was an escalation <b>of</b> violent <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> secondary schools. The study was carried out in four public secondary schools in Lindi district, Lindi region. The specific objectives were to explore students’ and teachers’ perceptions on the causes <b>of</b> violent <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> secondary schools; to examine CHRAGG’s legal and resources capacities in promoting peaceful management <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> secondary schools and to inquire into the roles of CHRAGG in promoting peaceful management <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> secondary schools. Research questions were framed to respond to the three specific objectives. The study used a descriptive design and applied qualitative and quantitative research approaches. The instruments used to collect data were questionnaire, interview, focus group discussion (FGD) and documentary review. The findings showed, students and teachers perceived causes <b>of</b> violent <b>conflicts</b> as; inadequate social services, poor education, inadequate infrastructure, students’ and teachers’ moral misconducts, maladministration and violation of hunman rights, poor communication and corporal punishments. Findings showed that CHRAGG had legal capacity, but limited financial and human resources capacities to perform its mandates. It was also found that CHRAGG has significant role in promoting paceful management <b>of</b> <b>conflicts</b> <b>in</b> secondary schools. The study recommends review of legal, administrative and instructional policies. It also recommends adequate funding for the CHRGG and the education sector...|$|R
