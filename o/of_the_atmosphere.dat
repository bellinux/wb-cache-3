5|$|Climate {{change is}} the {{variation}} in global or regional climates over time. It reflects changes in the variability or average state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years.

All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E

5|$|High-pressure systems, {{also known}} as anticyclones, rotate outward at the surface and {{clockwise}} in the northern hemisphere as opposed to outward and counterclockwise in the southern hemisphere. Under surface highs, sinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmosphere</b> slightly warms the air by compression, leading to clearer skies, winds that are lighter, and a reduced chance of precipitation. The descending air is dry, hence less energy is required to raise its temperature. If high pressure persists, air pollution will build up due to pollutants trapped near the surface caused by the subsiding motion associated with the high.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson {{published}} {{the first attempt}} at forecasting the weather numerically.

His forecast calculated that the change in surface pressure would be , an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude.
