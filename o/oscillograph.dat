25|$|An oscilloscope, {{previously}} {{called an}} <b>oscillograph,</b> and informally {{known as a}} scope or o-scope, CRO (for cathode-ray oscilloscope), or DSO (for the more modern digital storage oscilloscope), {{is a type of}} electronic test instrument that allows observation of constantly varying signal voltages, usually as a two-dimensional plot of one or more signals as a function of time. Other signals (such as sound or vibration) can be converted to voltages and displayed.|$|E

A staff competition was conducted in 1963 to create a new logo for use on television, stationery, publications, microphone badges and ABC vehicles. Graphic designer, Bill Kennard, who had been experimenting with telerecording of the Cathode Ray <b>Oscillograph</b> displays, submitted a design in 1965 which was part of the waveform of an oscilloscope.

50|$|The first {{automated}} <b>oscillographs</b> used a galvanometer {{to move a}} pen {{across a}} scroll or drum of paper, capturing wave patterns onto a continuously moving scroll. Due to the relatively high-frequency speed of the waveforms compared to the slow reaction time of the mechanical components, the waveform image was not drawn directly but instead built up {{over a period of}} time by combining small pieces of many different waveforms, to create an averaged shape.|$|R

50|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the history and}} development of oscilloscope technology. The modern day digital oscilloscope grew out of multiple developments of analog oscilloscopes, which in turn {{grew out of the}} older <b>oscillograph.</b> The <b>oscillograph</b> started as a hand drawn chart which was later slightly automated. This then grew into galvanometer driven recorders and photographic recorders. Eventually, the cathode ray tube came along and displaced the <b>oscillograph,</b> eventually taking over the majority of the market when advancements such as triggers were added to them. With the lowering costs of digital circuitry, the digital oscilloscope has taken over the majority of the modern oscilloscope sales, with almost no makers offering analog cathode ray tube oscilloscopes. However, the <b>oscillograph</b> lives on to a degree in pen chart recorders for electrical signals.|$|E
50|$|This led him {{to invent}} the bifilar and soft iron <b>oscillographs.</b> These {{instruments}} won the grand prize at the St. Louis Exposition in 1904. They were {{more powerful than the}} classical stroboscope, invented in 1891 then in use. They remained the best way to record high-speed electrical phenomena for more than 40 years when they were replaced by the cathode ray oscilloscope. They paved the way for a greater understanding of the behavior of alternating current.|$|R

It is determined that elasticity effects can rarely be ignored, and that improvement in missile and control system performance will probably require more rather than less consideration of elastic deformation of the aircraft structure...|$|R

50|$|The German aural {{method was}} used by the Central Powers. This used an early warning {{listening}} post (LP) and a main LP in the centre with two secondary LPs 500-1000 metres slightly to the rear on either side. Stop watches were switched on when the sound reached the main LP, the secondary LP times were converted to a distance (via speed of sound) and circles plotted, another circle was then derived that touched these two circles and the main LP, the centre of this circle was the source of the sound. Corrections were made for conditions affecting the speed of sound. However, late in the war Germany introduced 'objective devices' - directional galvanometers, <b>oscillographs</b> and modified seismographs, with results directly transferred onto paper or photographic film.|$|R
5000|$|However, it was {{possible}} to accurately measure the difference between two signals. Much of the development of suitable equipment had been carried out between 1935 and 1938 as part of the efforts to deploy radar systems. The UK, in particular, had invested considerable effort in the development of their Chain Home system. The radar display systems for Chain Home were based on oscilloscopes (or <b>oscillographs</b> as they were known at time) triggered to start their sweep when the broadcast signal was sent. Return signals were amplified and sent into the 'scope display, producing a [...] "blip". By measuring the distance along the face of the oscilloscope of any blips, the time between broadcast and reception could be measured, thus revealing the range to the target.|$|R

50|$|Founder Alfred L. Williams began Brush Labs in 1919 {{to develop}} {{products}} that utilized piezoelectric crystals. Associates reorganized {{the company as}} Brush Development Company in 1930 with piezoelectric phonograph pickups as the company's main product. Later they began manufacturing wire recorders, microphones, and speakers. Research for improvements to wire recorders resulted in a contract from the US National Defense Research Council during World War II. Brush manufactured a dictation recorder in 1946. In 1950, Brush built the Model BL-206 and BL-216 Multichannel <b>Oscillographs,</b> and associate Model BL-932 DC Amplifiers. Brush Development Co. merged with the original Brush Labs and the Cleveland Graphite Bronze company in 1952. The new company was named Clevite. Audio products under the Brush trademark were sold until 1960. The Clevite company was absorbed by Gould-National Batteries in 1969.|$|R
40|$|Postoperative wound infections {{remain a}} major source of upper limb morbidity. The {{effectiveness}} of peri-operative human upper limb preparation was determined using a clear fluid antiseptic and an iodine-based solution over 60 and 90 seconds. Less area was missed using iodine over both times and increasing clear solution preparation time from 60 to 90 seconds improved coverage. Surgical experience had little outcome relevance and a 90 -second preparation time with either solution was insufficient, with fingers being the sites most commonly missed. We report a new configuration that enables the double-mode-locked cw dye laser to be independently tunable. In addition, the output coupling at each of the two wavelengths can be independently specified.

40|$|In {{determining}} {{cause and}} effect of physiological events during experimental procedures, time relationships are of primary importance. At the present time, the effect of drugs on such functions as respiration, blood pressure, and organ motility are measured by using the smoked drum kymograph, while the electrocardiogram, electrocephalogram, and nerve or muscle action potentials are measured with separate instruments. Frequently additional animals must be used to complete these several recordings. When the mechanical and electrical recordings are combined in the same system, duplication of an experiment to obtain the additional data is unnecessary. Moreover, since the recordings may be simultaneous, any interrelation of one functional event with another can be determined. Multichannel electroencephalographs are now available in most laboratories.
