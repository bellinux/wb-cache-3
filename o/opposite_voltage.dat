Integer quantum Hall plateaus with quantized conductivity σ_xy=ν e^ 2 /h (where ν is any integer) are observed around the band center due to the split of the valley degeneracy by an <b>opposite</b> <b>voltage</b> bias added to the two layers. The central (n= 0) Dirac Landau level is also split, which leads to a pronounced ν= 0 plateau. This is consistent with the opening of a sizable gap between the valence and conduction bands.

Consequently, the resistivity should diverge at Dirac point. Interestingly, the ν= 0 insulating state can be destroyed by disorder scattering with intermediate strength, where a metallic region is observed near zero energy. In the strong disorder regime, the Hall plateaus with nonzero ν are destroyed due to the float-up of extended levels toward the band center and higher plateaus disappear first.

40|$|ABSTRACT Recordings of {{the sodium}} current in tissue-cultured GH s cells {{show that the}} rate of {{inactivation}} in whole cell and averaged single channel records is voltage dependent: Th varied e-fold/^- 26 mV. The source of this voltage dependence was investigated by examining the voltage dependence of individual rate constants, estimated by maximum likelihood analysis of single channel records, in a five-state kinetic model. The rate constant for inactivating from the open state, rather than closing, increased with depolarization, as did the probability that an open channel inactivates. The rate constant for closing from the open state had the <b>opposite</b> <b>voltage</b> dependence. Both rate constants contributed to the mean open time, which was not very voltage dependent. Both open time and burst duration were less than Th for voltages up to- 20 mV. The slowest time constant of activation, Tm, was measured from whole cell records, by fitting a single exponential either to tail currents or to activating currents in trypsin-treated cells, in which the inactivation was abolished.

Despite significant characterization efforts, the complex nanoscale redox processes that drive anomalous resistive switching and their implications for current transport remain poorly understood. Here, lateral and vertical mapping of O vacancy concentrations is used during the operation of such devices in situ in an aberration corrected transmission electron microscope to explain the anomalous switching mechanism. It is found that an increase (decrease) in the overall O vacancy concentration within the device after positive (negative) biasing of the Schottky-type electrode is associated with the electrocatalytic release and reincorporation of oxygen at the electrode/oxide interface and is responsible for the resistance change. This fundamental insight presents a novel perspective on resistive switching processes and opens up new technological opportunities for the implementation of memristive devices, as anomalous switching can now be suppressed selectively or used deliberately to achieve the desirable so-called deep Reset...|$|E

Relying on a non-perturbative Green function formalism, our calculations allow us to provide analytical expressions for the currents and their correlations at subgap voltages, while also giving exact numerical results valid for arbitrary external bias. We show that when the normal leads are biased at voltages V 1 and V 2 smaller than the gap, {{the sign of the}} current cross-correlations is given by −sgn(V 1 V 2).

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a simplified advanced Pulse width Modulation algorithms for reduced {{common mode voltage}} variations. These algorithms have been developed by using the concept of imaginary switching times and hence did not use angle and sector information. Thus, the proposed algorithms reduce the complexity involved in the existing PWM algorithms. In the conventional SVPWM method, two adjacent states with two zero voltage vectors are utilized to program the output voltage. Every 600 degrees the active voltage vectors change, but the zero state locations are retained. In the AZSPWM methods, the choice and the sequence of active voltage vectors {{are the same as}} in conventional SVPWM. However, instead of the real zero voltage vectors (V 0 and V 7), two active <b>opposite</b> <b>voltage</b> vectors with equal duration are utilized. In the NSPWM algorithm, in each sector any one of the phases is clamped to either positive or negative DC bus for a total of 120 o over a fundamental cycle.

Based on the exact non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism of calculating the transient current in Ref.

30|$|Since {{the unique}} {{structure}} of sample, current conduction is separated along each nanowire branch after flowing across the CoFe 2 O 4 film, which eventually realizes RS behavior on nanoscale. On {{the basis of}} the aforementioned experimental results, the conductive filament models are applicative in our samples. The sketches of formation and rupture of oxygen vacancies (OVs) in Au/CoFe 2 O 4 /CoFe 2 memory devices can be depicted in Figure  4 b. When applied a positive voltage, the ionized OVs migrate towards the cathode and accumulate at CoFe 2 O 4 /CoFe 2 interface, these OVs capture the electrons injected from the cathode, and cause the Fe 3 + in the oxygen-deficient region reduced to Fe 2 +. The Fe 2 + and the OVs can form a nonstoichiometric and highly conducting phase[21]. This highly conducting phase starts to create at the cathode and extends to the anode. Then, with the increase of voltage, a metallically conductive path is built, and the memory cell is switched to LRS, as displayed in Figure  4 b II. The state is kept until a sufficient <b>opposite</b> <b>voltage</b> is applied. The negative bias can release the electrons from the neutral OVs, then the conductive filaments are dissolved, and the memory cell is switched to HRS as shown in Figure  4 b III.|$|E
50|$|Both the {{vertical}} and dipole antennas are simple in construction and relatively inexpensive. The dipole antenna, {{which is the}} basis for most antenna designs, is a balanced component, with equal but <b>opposite</b> <b>voltages</b> and currents applied at its two terminals through a balanced transmission line (or to a coaxial transmission line through a so-called balun). The vertical antenna, on the other hand, is a monopole antenna. It is typically connected to the inner conductor of a coaxial transmission line (or a matching network); the shield of the transmission line is connected to ground. In this way, the ground (or any large conductive surface) plays the role of the second conductor of a dipole, thereby forming a complete circuit. Since monopole antennas rely on a conductive ground, a so-called grounding structure may be employed to provide a better ground contact to the earth or which itself acts as a ground plane to perform that function regardless of (or in absence of) an actual contact with the earth.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We have {{proposed}} that the gap junctions between amphibian blastomeres are comprised of voltage-sensitive channels. The kinetic properties of the junctional conductance are here studied under voltage damp. When the transjunctional voltage is stepped to a new voltage of the same polarity, the junctional conductance changes as a single exponential to a steady-state level. The time constant of the conductance change {{is determined by the}} existing transjunctional voltage and is independent of the previous voltage. For each voltage polarity, the relations between voltage, time constant, and steady-state conductance are well modeled by a reversible two-state reaction scheme in which the calculated rate constants for the transitions between the states are exponential functions of voltage. The calculated rate constant for the transition to the low-conductance state is approximately twice as voltage dependent as that for the transition to the high-conductance state. When the transjunctional voltage polarity is reversed, the junctional conductance undergoes a transient recovery. The polarity reversal data are well modeled by a reaction scheme in which the junctional channel has two gates, each with <b>opposite</b> <b>voltage</b> sensitivity, and in which an open gate may close only if the gate in series with it is open.

30|$|Another {{device that}} is used {{is known as a}} {{quadrupole}} mass spectrometer (cf. [2, 4, 5]) which works as a bandpass filter separating masses. The design has four conductors which have a base DC voltage plus an AC voltage such that diametrically opposite electrodes have the same potential and adjacent electrodes have <b>opposite</b> <b>voltages.</b> The AC voltage is such that heavy masses do not react to the changing polarity fast enough, effectively only feeling the base DC and hence slowly drifting to the conductor that was originally negatively charged and eventually annihilating. This is the low-pass component of the filter. Conversely, the lighter positive charges feel the effect of the modulating AC and do not notice the DC. Very light charged particles are impacted by the AC very quickly, being excited due to resonance effects [5] and thereby collide with the electrodes near entry. This is the high-pass filter component of the device. With these effects combined, parameters can be chosen to isolate a band of a single mass to pass through the detector. In order to detect several masses, industrialists need to inject repeated copies of the sample and adjust parameters to change the isolated mass. While the industrial partner was generally happy with this device, they were concerned about the time taken to process individual masses as well as the potentially limited amount of initial sample available. In this paper, we explore the task of finding a device that could detect multiple masses at once keeping these stipulations in mind.|$|R

Both cardiac and skeletal RyRs have two voltage-dependent inactivation processes (τ≈ 1 – 3 s at + 40 mV) that operate at <b>opposite</b> <b>voltage</b> extremes. Approximately one-half to two-thirds of RyRs inactivated when the bilayer voltage was stepped either way between {{positive and negative}} values. Inactivation was not detected (within 30 s) in RyRs with Po less than 0. 2. Inactivation rates increased with intraburst open probability (Po) and {{in proportion to the}} probability of a long-lived, RyR open state (POL). RyR inactivation depended on POL and not on the particular activator (Ca 2 + (μM), ATP, caffeine, and ryanodine), inhibitor (mM Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +), or gating mode. The activity of one-half to two-thirds of RyRs declined (i. e., the RyRs inactivated) after [Ca 2 +] steps from subactivating (0. 1 μM) to activating (1 – 100 μM) levels. This was due to the same inactivation mechanism responsible for inactivation after voltage steps. Both forms of inactivation had the same kinetics and similar dependencies on Po and voltage. Moreover, RyRs that failed to inactivate after voltage steps also did not inactivate after [Ca 2 +] steps. The inactivating response to [Ca 2 +] steps (0. 1 – 1 μM) was not RyRs “adapting” to steady [Ca 2 +] after the step, because a subsequent step from 1 to 100 μM failed to reactivate RyRs...|$|E

Therefore, the conductance values vary according to the history of the height and the width of the applied pulse voltage.

A quantum dot with a level at energy ϵ_ 0 is connected to three superconductors S_a, S_b and S_c with gap Δ, biased at V_a=V, V_b=-V and V_c= 0, and with intermediate contact transparencies. At zero temperature, nonlocal quartets (in the sense of four-fermion correlations) are noiseless at subgap voltage in the nonresonant dot regime ϵ_ 0 /Δ≫ 1, which is demonstrated with a semi-analytical perturbative expansion of the cross-correlations. Noise reveals the absence of granularity of the superflow splitting from S_c towards (S_a,S_b) in the nonresonant dot regime, in spite of finite voltage. In the resonant dot regime ϵ_ 0 /Δ< 1, cross-correlations measured in the (V_a,V_b) plane should reveal an "anomaly" {{in the vicinity of the}} quartet line V_a+V_b= 0, related to an additional contribution to the noise, manifesting the phase sensitivity of cross-correlations under the appearance of a three-body phase variable.
