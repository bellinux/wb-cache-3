5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental <b>operating</b> <b>reserve,</b> and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The Ontario {{electricity}} market, {{which opened}} on May 1, 2002, consists of physical markets for energy and <b>operating</b> <b>reserves</b> {{as well as}} a financial market for transmission rights, administered by the Independent Electricity Market Operator (IMO). Bids for energy and <b>operating</b> <b>reserves</b> from inside Ontario are settled based on a uniform pricing mechanism; however, import/export of electricity and applicable <b>operating</b> <b>reserves</b> through 12 intertie zones from/to New York, Michigan, Minnesota, Manitoba and Quebec control areas are priced differently. Energy and <b>operating</b> <b>reserves</b> markets are designed based on two time-frames, pre-dispatch and real-time, as well as two optimization procedures, unconstrained and constrained. Financial transmission rights are auctioned for short-term (one month) and long-term (one year), and provide a limited riskhedging mechanism for holders. In this paper an overview of the market structure, basic features and the operational aspects of the Ontario market is discussed.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the above steps, Israel and Cyprus are considering implementing the proposed EuroAsia Interconnector project. This consists of laying a 2000MW HVDC undersea power cable between them and between Cyprus and Greece, thus connecting Israel to the greater European power grid. If carried out, this will allow to further increase the country's <b>operating</b> <b>reserve</b> as well as sell surplus electricity abroad.|$|E
25|$|PHEVs {{and fully}} {{electric}} cars may allow for more {{efficient use of}} existing electric production capacity, much of which sits idle as <b>operating</b> <b>reserve</b> most of the time. This assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods (i.e., at night), or equipped with technology known as charge control to shut off charging during periods of peak demand. Another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak loads. This is accomplished with vehicle-to-grid technology. By using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power, such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities {{as well as their}} owners. Even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of nighttime electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the daytime, and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructure.|$|E
40|$|<b>Operating</b> <b>reserves</b> are {{the front}} lines {{in the defense of}} bulk-power systems against major {{generation}} and transmission outages. <b>Operating</b> <b>reserves</b> are provided by generating units that can increase their output rapidly to restore the system to generation/load balance after a major disturbance occurs. Dramatic changes are under way in the U. S. electricity sector, in particular the unbundling of generation from transmission and the increasingly competitive nature of bulk-power markets. Therefore, it is important to revisit the industry`s definitions of, procurement of, and payment for <b>operating</b> <b>reserves.</b> The procedures traditionally used by vertically integrated utilities may not serve the needs of an increasingly fragmented and competitive electricity industry. This report examines the past and current functions of, as well as the national and regional requirements for, <b>operating</b> <b>reserves.</b> We examine the data and analysis that support minimum-operating-reserve requirements. We obtained data on the number and severity of generator outages for three large U. S. electrical systems, including a power pool, a regional reliability council, and a utility. These limited data sets show a range of 15 to 40 major (> 500 MW) outages a year for systems ranging in size from 20, 000 MW to 48, 000 MW of peak demand. Finally, we discuss several emerging issues related to the underlying technical support for minimum operating-reserve requirements, alternative ways to pay for these reserves, the data needed to support the analysis of these requirements, and the mix of functions that are currently included within <b>operating</b> <b>reserves...</b>|$|R

The PDA considers conventional generation outages; load and wind forecast uncertainty on an hourly basis as well as load and wind variability in a 10 min time frame.

25|$|Facing {{increasing}} demand for electricity {{and concerned about}} the low reserve situation, the government of Israel began taking steps to increase the supply of electricity and <b>operating</b> <b>reserve,</b> as well to reduce the monopoly position of the IEC and increase competition in the electricity market starting in {{second half of the}} 2000s decade. It instructed the IEC to construct several new power stations and encouraged private investment in the generation sector. By 2015, the IEC's share of total nationwide installed electric generation capacity had fallen to about 75%, with the company then possessing an installed generation capacity of about 13.6 gigawatts (GW). Since 2010, Independent Power Producers have constructed three new gas-fired combined cycle power stations with a total generation capacity of about 2.2 GW, while various industrial concerns constructed on-premises cogeneration facilities with a total electricity output of about 1 GW, and which are licensed by the electric authority to sell surplus electricity to the national grid at competitive rates. Also under construction is a 300 MW pumped storage facility, with two more in planning, plus several solar-powered plants.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{electricity}} sector liberalisation in Europe {{has contributed}} significantly towards {{the creation of}} competitive markets. The wholesale trading of electricity consists of a market-based segment often complemented by markets for ancillary services, including the provision of <b>operating</b> <b>reserves.</b> In this paper, the authors examine and classify <b>operating</b> <b>reserves</b> that are currently traded in the Netherlands. The principles, under which the provision of these reserves is verified by the Dutch Transmission System Operator (TSO), are illustrated, and inefficiencies of the current verification approach are identified. The verification process of the TSO takes into account specific conditions, but the criteria for assessing {{the quality of the}} service provision are not explicitly defined. Furthermore, {{only a limited number of}} cases can be assessed due to the non-automated nature of the process. Finally, a proposal is made for the development of an automated analysis tool for assessing the service provision of market parties. This proposal emphasises the need for more robust verification processes in line with the increasing integration of electricity markets in Europe.

40|$|Storage devices {{can provide}} several grid services, {{however it is}} {{challenging}} to quantify the value of providing several services and to optimally allocate storage resources to maximize value. We develop a co-optimized Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) dispatch model to characterize the value of providing <b>operating</b> <b>reserves</b> in addition to energy arbitrage in several U. S. markets. We use the model to: (1) quantify the added value of providing <b>operating</b> <b>reserves</b> in addition to energy arbitrage; (2) evaluate the dynamic nature of optimally allocating storage resources into energy and reserve markets; and (3) quantify the sensitivity of CAES net revenues to several design and performance parameters. We find that conventional CAES systems could earn an additional $ 23 ± 10 /kW-yr by providing <b>operating</b> <b>reserves,</b> and adiabatic CAES systems could earn an additional $ 28 ± 13 /kW-yr. We find that arbitrage-only revenues are unlikely to support a CAES investment in most market locations, but the addition of reserve revenues could support a conventional CAES investment in several markets. Adiabatic CAES revenues are not likely to support an investment in most regions studied. Modifying CAES design and performance parameters primarily impacts arbitrage revenues, and optimizing CAES design will be nearly independent of dispatch strategy. 1...|$|R
2500|$|Estimates of {{the cost}} of wind energy may include {{estimates}} of the [...] "external" [...] costs of wind variability, or be limited to the cost of production. All electrical plant has costs that are separate from the cost of production, including, for example, the cost of any necessary transmission capacity or reserve capacity in case of loss of generating capacity. Many types of generation, particularly fossil fuel derived, will also have cost externalities such as pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and habitat destruction which are generally not directly accounted for. The magnitude of the economic impacts is debated and will vary by location, but is expected to rise with higher penetration levels. At low penetration levels, costs such as <b>operating</b> <b>reserve</b> and balancing costs are believed to be insignificant.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{founding}} of the state through the mid-2010s decade, the state-owned utility, Israel Electric Corporation (IEC) had an effective monopoly on power generation in the country. In 2010 the company sold 52,037GWh of electricity. Until the mid-2010s the country also faced a persistently low <b>operating</b> <b>reserve,</b> which is mostly the result of Israel being an [...] "electricity island". Most countries have the capability of relying on power drawn from producers in adjacent countries {{in the event of a}} power shortage. Israel's grid however, is unconnected to those of neighboring countries. This is mostly due to political reasons but also to the considerably less-developed nature of the power systems of Jordan and Egypt, whose systems constantly struggle to meet domestic demand and whose per-capita electric generation is less than one fifth that of Israel's. Nevertheless, while operating reserves in Israel were low, the country possessed sufficient generation and transmission capacity to meet domestic electricity needs and unlike in the countries surrounding it, rolling blackouts have historically been quite rare, even at periods of extreme demand.|$|E
