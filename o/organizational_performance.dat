40|$|The basic {{goal of the}} {{research}} in this paper was to explore the differences between private organizations in Europe regarding their <b>organizational</b> <b>performances</b> {{in the context of}} the existence and development of communication practices. The subject of {{the research}} was the analysis of communication practice and <b>organizational</b> <b>performances</b> in private organizations in 25 European countries. The methodology of the research included the exploration of the sample from the CRANET, an international human resource management (HRM) project in the period 2008 - 2010. The authors used statistical techniques to prove established hypotheses: descriptive statistics, chi square and t-test. The findings of the research pointed to the statistically significant differences between private companies that inform their employees about business strategy, financial results and organization of work regarding <b>organizational</b> <b>performances.</b> Also, there were presented trends of the usage of different communication techniques in countries of Europe. Private firms in Europe usually perform direct 'upward' and verbal communication between managers and employees. Regarding the internalization of the business, authors found that companies operating mainly on international market usually inform their employees about strategy, finances and organization of work more than companies operating on local market...|$|R
25|$|I/O {{psychologists are}} {{involved}} in the research and the practice of occupational stress and design of individual and organizational interventions to manage and reduce the stress levels and increase productivity, performance, health and wellbeing. Occupational stress can have implications for <b>organizational</b> <b>performance</b> because of the emotions job stress evokes. For example, a job stressor such as conflict with a supervisor can precipitate anger that in turn motivates counterproductive workplace behaviors. I/O research has examined the association between work stressors and aggression, theft, substance abuse, and depressive symptoms. A number of models have been developed to explain the job stress process, including the person-environment fit model and the demand-control model. Those models became a cornerstone of the emergence, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, of a new discipline relevant to research on occupational stress; the discipline, occupational health psychology, is an offshoot of i/o psychology, health psychology, and occupational medicine.|$|E
25|$|The Owen School’s MBA {{degree program}} takes {{two years to}} {{complete}} and requires a minimum of 62 credit hours. The program is set up in eight modules (equal to four semesters) of full-time study. Students must take core courses in the fundamentals of management and complete them within their first year. MBA students may choose from the following career paths: finance, real estate, marketing, health care, human and <b>organizational</b> <b>performance,</b> operations, consulting, general management, entrepreneurship, or a custom career path. Then students must take courses in one concentration, one course in international business, and courses outside their primary concentration. In addition to earning an acceptable letter grade, students must complete a project before graduation. The approach to learning (ranked in order of percentage) includes lecture, case study, team project, simulations, and experiential learning. The Leadership Development Program begins at orientation when students join teams, and executive coaches work with students {{on an individual basis}} to explore their leadership abilities. Throughout the four modules, this program challenges students with exercises, projects, and workshops.|$|E

First, a lack of theory that supports the Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM) tends to disguise the underlying causal mechanisms between high performance work systems (HPWSs) and <b>organizational</b> <b>performances.</b> Second, the complexity relating {{to the existence of}} complementarities in the new forms of work organization poses some methodological issues, with particular regard to find support for the configurational approach in SHRM. Finally, the effects of HPWS are not unequivocal on workers–related outcomes, contributing to make enough unclear those underlying causal mechanisms. Through a systematic review of the existing literature, this study aims to identify the most relevant deficiencies in HPWS research. By analyzing the current debates, we reveal an interesting key to interpret them as highly interrelated challenges and we propose the use of set-theoretic methods to fill them. Overall, this article suggests some future paths of research to be devoted, both empirically and theoretically, to configurations and complementarities in the new work organizations...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} dissertation was to conduct a case study on how the outcomes {{of the interaction between}} ethical organizational culture and national culture effect <b>organizational</b> level <b>performance.</b> The case study was conducted on a single multinational nonprofit health care facility in Ghana. The study sought to answer the following research questions: 1. How is the ethical culture of this nonprofit organization defined? 2. How relevant is the ethical culture of this nonprofit organization to the <b>organizational</b> level <b>performance?</b> 3. How does the interaction between the ethical culture of this nonprofit organization and the Ghana national culture impact <b>organizational</b> level <b>performance?</b> Overall twenty-five people participated in the study. Participants included supervisors, managers, and other senior executive officers with FOCOS Orthopaedic Hospital, a nonprofit multinational health care institution in Ghana. Also, included in this study was a professor of African Studies at the University of Ghana. The main methods of data collection were direct interviews, document review, and direct observations. Four major themes, the extent to which participants know and understand the ethical organizational culture of FOCOS Orthopaedic Hospital; the dimensions that define the Ghana national culture; {{the extent to which the}} ethical organizational culture affects <b>organizational</b> level <b>performance</b> of FOCOS Orthopaedic Hospital; how the outcomes of the interaction between the Ghana national culture and ethical organizational culture impact <b>organizational</b> level <b>performance</b> of FOCOS Orthopaedic Hospital. Qualitative methods were used to analyze the data. Techniques used include, content analyses and flowcharts and graphics to reduce synonymous mix-ups. The results suggested a significant effect of the interaction between ethical organizational culture and country culture on <b>organizational</b> level <b>performance.</b> Thus, evidence gathered from the case study confirmed the importance of sub-cultures and citizen-centered ethical organizational culture in ensuring equilibrium in the ethical organizational culture-national culture interactions. The findings were compared with the predicted outcome to ascertain internal validity of the study. Similarities were identified between the findings and the predicted outcome of the study, indicating the study had internal validity. Based on the findings from this study a recommendation was made for research attention to national cultures as mediators between the ethical organizational cultures and <b>organizational</b> level <b>performance</b> relationships...|$|R

In order {{to react to the}} demand of environmentally conscious society, organizations must incorporate environmental agenda in their corporate strategy. The adoption of environmental management accounting practices would help organizations to realize significant costs saving, enhance organizational competitiveness and improve organizations’ performances. Besides that, practicing environmental management accounting would also stimulate innovation in an organization. However, some previous studies revealed those organizations which implemented environmental management accounting practices were unable to realize those benefits. Due to the inconsistency of the previous studies’ results, the present study tries to shed light on the relationship between environmental management accounting practices and innovation and, organizations’ competitive advantage and performances. An online survey had been deployed to ISO 14001 certified Malaysian organizations’ chief executive officer, managing directors, financemanager or key personnel involved in environmental management. 36 usable responses were received and analyzed using SPSS version 21.
