5|$|Scully {{performs}} {{an autopsy}} on McRoberts' body and discovers signs of phobia including {{high levels of}} adrenaline and the same substance found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> killer. She hypothesizes that the substance, when combined with other neurochemicals, produces an LSD-like reaction. While Mulder and Scully build a case, Funsch becomes more psychotic, continuing to see violent messages on electronic gadgets. Blood is associated in some way with each incident; a volunteer asks Ed to donate blood at a department store and seconds later he sees violent images, including a video of the 1993 Waco siege burning, flash across a sales display of TV sets, followed by a message to get a gun from the sporting goods department.|$|E
25|$|American's {{engineers}} reworked {{the wing}} to a non-folding design, easing FAR Part 23 certification. Other changes included adding extended wing tips to improve rate-of-climb, an anti-servo tab <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{along with a}} centering spring system to increase longitudinal stability and stall strips to improve handling during a stall. The company designated the redesigned aircraft the AA-1 Yankee Clipper.|$|E
25|$|The Renegade {{fuselage}} {{is constructed}} of aluminium square tubing extrusions and fittings, fastened with Avex rivets. The turtle deck and engine cowling {{are made from}} fibreglass. The fin, rudder, horizontal stabilizer and elevators are built from aluminum tubing and channel sections. The tail is wire-braced. A manual trim tab mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> is an option. The landing gear is of conventional configuration and incorporates bungee suspension. The welded engine mount is 4130 steel.|$|E
50|$|A set of rails led aft {{from the}} catapults to <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> and into <b>the</b> hangars. For catapult-assisted launches, {{aircraft}} would be hoisted in the hangar onto a portable collapsible catapult carriage, raised <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> to flight deck level and then trundled forward <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rails to the catapult starting positions, {{the same system}} as employed on Graf Zeppelin.|$|R
50|$|Except {{for very}} light aircraft, trim tabs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> {{are unable to}} provide the force and range of motion desired. To provide the {{appropriate}} trim force the entire horizontal tail plane is made adjustable in pitch. This allows the pilot to select exactly {{the right amount of}} positive or negative lift from the tail plane while reducing drag from <b>the</b> <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
50|$|Depression-era {{interior}} modifications {{were mostly}} cosmetic in nature. These included replacement of open metal grillwork doors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> with polished metal doors, and installation of dark green marble-faced walls at elevator entrances. Modern translucent panels replaced the original stained-glass skylights in the second-floor courtrooms.|$|R
25|$|The {{matrices}} have {{a pattern}} of teeth at the top, by which they hang from the distributor bar. Some of the teeth are cut away; which pattern of teeth is cut away depends on the character on the matrix; i.e.,which channel in the magazine it belongs in. Similarly, teeth are cut away along portions of the distributor bar. The bar <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> has all teeth, so it will hold any matrix (but not the space bands, which have no teeth at all).|$|E
25|$|Linklater {{assembled}} the cast {{for two weeks}} of rehearsals in Austin, Texas before principal photography began in order to fine-tune the script. The result was a fusion of Linklater's writing, the novel and the actors' input. To prepare for their respective roles, Cochrane came up with his character five minutes before he got <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> to work; Downey Jr. memorized his dialogue by writing it all out in run-on sentences, studying them and then converting them to acronyms; and Reeves relied on the book, marking down each scene in the screenplay to the corresponding page.|$|E
25|$|Very {{nearly as}} {{visually}} evocative are the scenes involving Astor, {{almost all of}} which suggest prison. In one scene she wears striped pajamas, the furniture {{in the room is}} striped, and the slivers of light coming through the Venetian blinds suggest cell bars, as do the bars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> cage {{at the end of the}} film when she takes her slow ride downward with the police, apparently on her way to prison and possible execution. Huston and Edeson crafted each scene to make sure the images, action and dialog blended effectively, sometimes shooting closeups of characters with other cast members acting with them off camera.|$|E
50|$|This {{complete}} {{hay elevator}} lifting, transport, and dropping system reduced bale storage labor {{to a single}} person, who simply pulls up with a wagon, turns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> and starts placing bales on it, occasionally checking {{to make sure that}} bales are falling in the right locations in the loft.|$|R

25|$|Emma {{wakes up}} from a nightmare. In the dream, Hook, Snow White and herself are in the Underworld Graveyard {{attempting}} to use Emma's light magic to erase their names from the tombstones Hades had created. Hook sense something is wrong and a tornado appears. The three seek shelter behind a large crypt and Hook senses {{there is a large}} creature nearby. Snow attempts to face the creature and is taken away and presumably killed which wakes Emma. Emma tells Hook about the dream wondering if they are visions of the future. In the library, Regina has spent all night preparing a spell to break Hades' protection spell <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> by drawing runes all over the elevator door. Emma and Regina use their magic to open the door as they break the code and the door opens revealing a brick wall, their efforts proving futile. Emma outlines some of the details of the dream believing that she can erase their names from the tombstones to all everyone to leave the underworld. Hades is standing there to see Zelena when he notices a daisy growing in the broken road. Regina decides to talk to Zelena, who knows more about Hades rather than the others. When Regina visits Zelena, she realizes that her and Hades are in love. Zelena tells her that she (Zelena) is Hades' only weakness. At the underworld cemetery, Emma attempts to cast the spell from her dream, but suddenly starts believing the nightmare is coming true when the same storm appears. She, Hook and Snow ahead to Regina's vault, where Hook, Snow, and even Regina tell Emma not to give up. Emma failed everyone but she saved Hook's life. Snow White tells Emma that love is worth it.|$|E
500|$|Pilot illness – The {{investigation}} panel {{considered the}} pilot may have collapsed suddenly. The panel used a DC-3 aircraft {{to carry out}} tests in {{which one of the}} pilots simulated falling forward onto the aircraft controls. [...] They found it difficult to fall forward sufficiently to exert a significant force <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> control, and the other pilot had no difficulty keeping the aircraft in a climbing attitude.|$|E
500|$|Lindow Man's {{official}} name is LindowII, {{as there are}} other finds from the area: LindowI (Lindow Woman) refers to a human skull, LindowIII to a [...] "fragmented headless body", and LindowIV to the upper thigh of an adult male, possibly that of Lindow Man. After the discovery of Lindow Man, there were no further archaeological excavations at Lindow Moss until 1987. A large piece of skin was found by workmen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> on 6 February 1987. On this occasion, the police left the investigation to the archaeologists. Over 70pieces were found, constituting LindowIII. Although the bone was not as well preserved as that of Lindow Man, the other tissues survived in better condition. The final discovery was that of LindowIV on 14 June 1988. Part of a left leg and buttocks were found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> from a site just [...] west of where Lindow Man was found. Nearly three months later, on 12 September, a right thigh was discovered in the peat on the bucket of a digger. The proximity of the discovery sites, coupled {{with the fact that}} the remains were shown to come from an adult male, means that LindowIV is probably part of Lindow Man.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> scenes, {{some of the}} film's {{most infamous}} shots, were {{severely}} altered from their original scenes. Originally, the occupants ended up pressed to the ceiling of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and {{dropped to the floor}} when <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> crashed to <b>the</b> bottom of the shaft. This scene - shown in all test screening prints - was considered too graphic for a film intended to have a PG rating. Universal decided to cut this portion of the sequence {{and replace it with a}} frame of <b>the</b> people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator's</b> floor, with <b>the</b> notorious 'cartoon blood' rushing into the camera.|$|R

500|$|Complementing Kaufmann and True's work, the Norwegian-born, {{naturalized}} American sculptor Oskar J.W. Hansen designed many of {{the sculptures}} on and around the dam. His works include the monument of dedication plaza, a plaque to memorialize the workers killed and the bas-reliefs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> towers. In his words, Hansen wanted his work to express [...] "the immutable calm of intellectual resolution, and the enormous power of trained physical strength, equally enthroned in placid triumph of scientific accomplishment", because [...] "he building of Hoover Dam belongs to the sagas of the daring." [...] Hansen's dedication plaza, on the Nevada abutment, contains a sculpture of two winged figures flanking a flagpole.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{think she}} has been very rude {{to a lot of}} people in the past, on her way up – very terse," [...] a friend told the Observer. [...] "She doesn't do small talk. She is never going to be friends with her {{assistant}}." [...] A former assistant said, [...] "You definitely did not ride the elevator with her." [...] Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the Vogue offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> was reprimanded by one of Wintour's assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she [...] "did absolutely the right thing." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{initially}} constructed, {{the interior}} was relatively open with two-rail handrails, {{but a couple of}} suicides and an accidental fall prompted the addition of tall wire screening ( [...] high with a large diamond mesh) on the inside edge of the stairs and landings in 1929. The original steam powered elevator, which took 10 to 12 minutes to ascend to the observation floor, was replaced by an electric elevator powered by an on-site dynamo in 1901 which took five minutes to ascend. The monument was connected to the electrical grid in 1923, allowing the installation of a modern electric elevator in 1925–26 which took 70 seconds. The latter was replaced in 1958 and again in 1998 by 70-second elevators. During 1997–2000, the wire screening at three platforms was replaced by large glass panels to allow visitors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> to view three clusters of memorial stones that were synchronously lit as the elevator automatically slowed as it passed them during its descent.|$|E

A flirty former lover, Andrea Rhodes, {{walks into}} the elevator and starts to home in on Don before Don introduces Megan as his wife. Don tries to assuage a slightly perturbed Megan, who is upset over how many of Don's old flames they run into in Manhattan. Don works with new hire Michael Ginsberg and Ken Cosgrove on the pitch to Butler Footwear. Ginsberg goes rogue during the presentation and ends up pitching a commercial based on Cinderella, which the group had earlier rejected as being too cliche - although {{that was what the}} executives were expecting, and they reject the pitch they had earlier approved in favor of a Cinderella campaign. Don is enraged and admonishes Ginsberg for the act; Ginsberg doesn't seem to realize the seriousness of his transgression until Ken points out he {{was on the verge of}} being fired. Afterwards, Don returns home early to an empty house and collapses on his bed in a weakened state.|$|E
500|$|Gates {{maintained}} a {{suite at the}} Waldorf-Astoria of New City from 1894 onwards. Though he paid US$30,000 yearly for it, his visits pained the hotel's manager, George Boldt, at times. [...] Gates and his guests were often loud and boisterous. [...] He had a private entrance and elevator, but Gates {{had a habit of}} banging <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> doors and shouting for service. Boldt instructed his elevator operators to take their time when serving his floor, as it allowed Gates to make as much noise as he wished for a few minutes. Gates' suite was often home to high-stakes poker parties and Baccarat games. Many poker games began on the train from Chicago to New York and were continued at the Waldorf. One poker game lasted for five days and nights; when it was done at least US$2 million had changed hands. Dellora Gates had long since resigned herself to her husband's all-night poker games, but many times became upset about them. [...] Gates made it a practice to keep some unset diamonds in his vest pocket for the times when Dellora became angry about the late hours at cards. He would then present a gem to his wife, who would suddenly forget her anger with him. [...] Dellora would take the diamond to Tiffany & Co. to be set in a piece of jewelry of her choice.|$|E
500|$|Jon Hamm {{was cast}} as Don Draper, the central {{character}} of the series. Hamm, who was relatively unknown at the time, competed with 80 other actors in the auditioning process. Weiner proclaimed that Hamm accurately portrayed the character, {{saying that he was}} [...] "the only person who really had this great mix of empathy and masculinity and intelligence. Both Don and Jon have an inner life. So long as you have that kind of depth in a human being, people will root for him [...] Jon {{walked out of the room}} and I said, 'That guy has lived.'" [...] Hamm admitted that he felt that he had a considerable disadvantage compared to his peers and initially believed Thomas Jane would acquire the role. [...] "I started, literally, on the very, very bottom," [...] he iterated. [...] "I couldn't have had less heat on me. Nobody knew who I was. The casting directors didn't know who I was. I wasn't on anybody's lists. The funny thing was, I think they went to Thomas Jane for it, and they were told that Thomas Jane does not do television." [...] Hamm went through seven auditions; his last one took place at the Hotel Gansevoort in the Meatpacking District of New York City. [...] "When we were riding down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> the woman in charge of whatever the decision-making process was told me, 'You got the job.'" ...|$|E

50|$|Rice was {{suspended}} by the NFL {{for the first}} two games of the 2014 NFL season on July 25. On September 8, TMZ released footage from a camera inside <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> in which <b>the</b> assault took place. The video appears to show Rice punching Palmer in the face causing Palmer to immediately fall to the ground, perhaps striking her head <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator's</b> handrail <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way to the floor, and leaving her motionless. Within hours of the video's release, the Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's contract. Shortly thereafter, Goodell announced that Rice had been suspended from the league indefinitely.|$|R
50|$|The J-1 is a {{low wing}} {{aircraft}} with conventional landing gear and a large bubble canopy. The wings are configured without dihedral. The fuselage uses a wooden geodesic airframe construction with steel secondary wing spars. The wing panels are covered with single seamless flat fiberglass panels that are bonded to the wooden wing ribs and spars. The leading edge is formed with fiberglass layered up in place. The same process is used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators.</b>|$|R
500|$|The episode {{received}} highly positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called [...] "Broke" [...] a [...] "great, great" [...] episode, {{although he}} said he wished the Michael Scott Paper Company arc could have lasted longer. Sepinwall praised touches such as the Korean women who were constantly getting into the sales van, and Michael's moment of nervousness <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> and said the ending when Michael came through was particularly satisfying. Will Leitch of New York magazine described [...] "Broke" [...] as [...] "a rousing, exuberant episode that continues one of The Offices best runs in history". Leitch said the negotiations during {{the latter half of}} the episode had genuine tension, and that all the storylines of the Michael Scott Paper Company arc were wrapped up perfectly. Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode was strong enough that it could have served as the season finale. He said the episode had lots of good throw-away moments, like Charles brown-nosing to David and realizing Dwight is eccentric, as well as several clever twists, like Jim's actions in tricking Dwight and helping the Michael Scott Paper Company get bought out. Eric Rezsnyak of the City Newspaper said the episode was a strong finale to the Michael Scott Paper Company arc, which was [...] "probably the best thing to happen to the show in the last two seasons". Rezsnyak praised Michael's impressive actions in the episode and said he was curious to see how Michael's relationship with several of the supporting characters would be recast as a result of this episode.|$|E

25|$|The {{design of}} the Lockheed Constellation L-049 {{aircraft}} allowed the pilots to disable <b>the</b> hydraulic <b>elevator</b> boost and control <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> manually via direct mechanical linkage. The pilots of the accident flight apparently attempted to revert to manual control as the aircraft began to pitch up, but the design was such that a continuous nose down pressure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> made <b>the</b> shift to manual elevator control mechanically impossible. Thus, according to the CAB's reconstruction of events, as the pilots were desperately applying nose down pressure to avoid a stall, they were also hampering themselves from shifting to manual mode and regaining elevator control.|$|R
40|$|The {{data for}} the {{calculation}} of the air forces acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> obtained from previous model experiments are not immediately applicable in practice, as the angle at which the control surfaces meet the air stream is, in general, still unknown. The air stream, when it reaches <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> has already been deflected by the wings and although the velocity imparted to the air current by the wings is of negligible amount compared {{with the speed of}} flight, the air behind the wings has been deflected downwards, so that <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> work in an airstream which is inclined in a downward direction. The angle at which the air stream meets <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> surface is, therefore, different from, and, with the usual arrangement of <b>elevators,</b> less than <b>the</b> angle made by <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> surfaces with <b>the</b> line of flight...|$|R
500|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Chicago skyscrapers buildings were relatively plain, the entrance ways and lobbies were fitted out in a grand style.
