5|$|A {{prospectus}} {{was issued}} which contained a detailed {{breakdown of the}} likely costs, revenue and profits of such a scheme, and the promotors prepared to obtain an Act of Parliament. During this time, someone challenged the <b>original</b> <b>survey</b> and another local surveyor was asked to review it. John Beauchamp suggested that no locks would be required on the upper section, but that costs {{were likely to be}} £15,234. This was later raised to £18,000, and the Act of Parliament, which authorised the construction of a canal that followed Hammett's plans, was obtained on 28 May 1827. The proprietors were empowered to raise £18,000 by the issue of 360 shares of £50 each, with powers to raise another £5,000 by mortgage, or to borrow any part of the £18,000 from the Exchequer Bills Commissioners.|$|E
5|$|Under a 1909 law, the State Highway Board {{surveyed}} a {{connected network}} of proposed state roads. Included was a westerly extension of SR 5 via Chehalis to South Bend and Aberdeen and an easterly extension to Pullman. A route from Yakima southeast and east via the Tri-Cities to Idaho was also surveyed, mostly {{as an extension}} of State Road 8 (Columbia River Road). The legislature added most of these routes to the state highway system in 1913, when they formed a two-tiered system of primary and secondary roads. Primary roads were completely controlled by the state, including maintenance, and received only names, while secondary roads kept their numbers and county maintenance. The National Park Highway replaced State Road 5 west of Riffe, and extended as surveyed to and beyond South Bend, and the McClellan Pass Highway replaced State Road 1 and continued via State Road 5 to Yakima. The majority of the route from Yakima via Connell to Pullman was not added at that time; it was finally taken over in 1937 as Secondary State Highways 11A and 11B. Only the route via the Tri-Cities, forming part of the Inland Empire Highway, continued from Yakima to Idaho. East of Pomeroy, the <b>original</b> <b>survey</b> had curved south, using State Road 16 to near the Oregon state line; this was bypassed by the 1913 designation, which instead continued directly east to Clarkston. Unlike the earlier state roads, these primary roads mostly followed existing passable county roads. The incomplete roadway between Riffe and the American River remained as part of secondary State Road 5, and the legislature designated the surveyed route from the National Park Highway near Raymond north to Aberdeen as secondary State Road 20 in 1915.|$|E

25|$|The border {{then takes}} {{a sharp turn}} around the tip of Rabun County, at {{latitude}} 35°N, though from this point it diverges slightly south (due to inaccuracies in the <b>original</b> <b>survey).</b> This northern border was originally the Georgia and North Carolina border {{all the way to}} the Mississippi River, until Tennessee was divided from North Carolina, and the Yazoo companies induced the legislature of Georgia to pass an act, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell the greater part of Georgia's territory presently comprising Alabama and Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|The {{city centre}} {{is laid out}} in a grid pattern, {{interrupted}} only by the curvilinear alignment of the Avon River, and the two diagonals High Street and Victoria Street. Christchurch has four pairs of one-way streets. The grid pattern within the outermost one-way streets is very regular, as this is the area that was laid out in the <b>original</b> <b>survey.</b> The surrounding area, i.e. the belt between the outer one-way streets and the avenues, was developed later in a progressive fashion and does not have the regularity of the core area.|$|E
25|$|From 1853 {{until the}} {{abolition}} of provinces in 1876, Greymouth was first part of Canterbury Province (the West Coast part of the Province was known as West Canterbury) and then part of an independent Westland Province. However Cobden, on the north (or right) bank of the Grey River {{was a part of}} Nelson Province from 1853 to 1876. At one point in this period Greymouth tried to join Nelson Province but this movement was ultimately unsuccessful. John Rochfort undertook the <b>original</b> <b>survey</b> of the site of the township in 1865.|$|E

25|$|Te Rauparaha {{ordered the}} Ngāti Toa warriors {{to cross the}} stream in pursuit. Those British who had not escaped were quickly overtaken. Wakefield called for a ceasefire and surrendered, along with Thompson, Richardson and ten others. The Maori killed two of the British immediately. Te Rangihaeata demanded utu (revenge) {{for the death of}} his wife Rongo, who was also Te Rauparaha's daughter. The Maori killed all the {{remaining}} captives, including Thompson, Samuel Cottrell, a member of the <b>original</b> <b>survey</b> team; interpreter John Brooks, and Captain Wakefield. Four Māori died and three were wounded in the incident. The British lost 22 dead and five wounded.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 the United States, United Kingdom and Canada {{signed and}} {{ratified}} a treaty confirming the <b>original</b> <b>survey</b> lines {{as the official}} and permanent international border. Nevertheless, in 2002 the difference of the survey from the geographical 49th parallel was argued {{in front of the}} Washington Supreme Court in the case of State of Washington v. Norman, under the premise that Washington did not properly incorporate the portions of land north of the geographical 49th parallel, as laid out by detailed GPS surveying. The court decided against the premise, ruling that the internationally surveyed boundary also served as the state boundary, regardless of its actual position.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} {{significant}} bridges was the Beaumont road {{bridge over the}} Clutha River, which {{is also known as}} the Dunkeld Bridge, as this was the <b>original</b> <b>survey</b> name for the township that soon took the name of Beaumont. The bridge was opened by John Anderson on 4 March 1887 with a champagne lunch. A champagne lunch of such proportions that the location for the presentation is still called Champagne Flat was held {{at the opening of the}} Waiau Ferry Bridge, these days a Category I heritage item registered with Heritage New Zealand. Another early and outstanding bridge was the Waiteti Viaduct, the northernmost viaduct on the North Island Main Trunk railway a few kilometres south of Te Kuiti. This structure was also completed in 1887. Probably the most significant structure on the North Island Main Trunk Railway is the Makatote Viaduct 12km south of National Park. At 79m, it is the highest on this line. It took three years to build and Andrew Anderson moved his family to the construction village, so that he could oversee the work. The viaduct was commissioned in 1908.|$|E

500|$|Even {{after the}} {{mistakes}} in the reports were discovered, {{a spokesperson for the}} U.S. National Geodetic Survey admitted the monument is placed [...] east of where modern surveyors would mark the point. However, he defended the accuracy of the <b>original</b> <b>survey,</b> stating surveyors [...] "nailed it" [...] considering the primitive tools of the day. Pointing out the achievement given the conditions, he further stated, [...] "Their ability to replicate that exact point — what they did was phenomenal, what they did was spot on." [...] He concluded by stating that any claims of errors in the location of the monument are irrelevant. Once a survey commissioned to establish a boundary has been accepted by the involved parties, the survey markers are legally binding, regardless of any error that is later discovered. Similar statements were issued by the Navajo Nation, defending their work in maintaining and promoting the monument. In addition, general U.S. land principles, law, and the Supreme Court have established that the location of the monument is the legal corner of the four states.|$|E
