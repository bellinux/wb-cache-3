5|$|Naughty Dog began {{developing}} The Last of Us: Left Behind {{following the}} release of The Last of Us in June 2013, with a team about half the size. Following the decision to create single-player downloadable content for the game, the development team immediately decided that the story would focus {{on the character of}} Ellie; they found that players of The Last <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> <b>were</b> interested to learn about events in Ellie's life prior to the events of the main game, particularly the events involving Riley Abel, whom Ellie mentioned in The Last of Us. In addition, they found that some players were interested in the events that occurred between the Fall and Winter segments of the main game, in which Ellie cares for an injured Joel. This led to the team deciding to contrast these two events against each other, feeling it would help the story's pacing. Game director Bruce Straley said that the team felt the story justified the development of Left Behind.|$|E

Unfortunately they directed most of it towards avoidance of defeat during a seven-act performance which most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> naive enough to believe was staged primarily for public entertainment and which was financed by the public.|$|E
25|$|The {{countdown}} to a perhaps decisive four-day blitz of confrontation began, {{with the first}} inspection—Ba'ath party headquarters—due to take place on July 20. On short notice I was able to reconstitute my intelligence support. The first two inspection teams were dispatched to Bahrain. I was set to arrive there on the 18th. I would be joined by my deputy chief inspector {{as well as several}} operations staff. All <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> veteran inspectors, requiring no additional training. Instead, the clock was stopped.|$|E

500|$|While Juskalian {{was held}} in Nuremberg, the Americans began their {{bombardment}} of the city. He describes the moment in his own words: [...] "We were cheering, and our guards were getting irritated, but the bombs came down on us, too, and I was sure {{we were going to}} get it. About 30 <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> killed. I was thinking of my mother and how ironic it would be to be killed at the end of the war—and by your own aircraft." ...|$|E
500|$|Dworsky was a {{four-year}} starter under Michigan's legendary coach, Fritz Crisler. Dworsky later said that Crisler's [...] "real genius" [...] was in blending all the elements. The 1947 championship team included several older veteran players who {{had returned from}} military service. Dworsky recalled: [...] "About half <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> 18-year old kids, and half were veterans. We had guys who were serious guys and guys who were excitable. Fritz struck a balance, so we never had to be pushed, but we never lost our focus either." ...|$|E

They had become fair game because of their belief in the indivisibility of Western Europe. Remember these martyrs".|$|E

500|$|Later {{she drew}} a {{distinction}} between their methods, arguing that Quimby's involved one mind healing another, while hers depended on a connection with Divine Mind. In February 1883 Julius Dresser, a former patient of Quimby's, accused Eddy in letters to the Boston Post of teaching Quimby's work as her own. In response Eddy disparaged Quimby as a mesmerist and said she had experimented with mental healing in or around 1853, nine years before she met him. She wrote later: [...] "We caught some of his thoughts, and he caught some of ours; and both <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> pleased to say this to each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} Monsters of Rock appearance, Mustaine fired Behler and Young and {{canceled}} Megadeth's scheduled Australian tour. [...] "On the road, things escalated {{from a small}} border skirmish into a full-on raging war", Mustaine later recalled. [...] "I think a lot <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> inconsistent [...] because of the guy {{we were waiting for}} after the show." [...] During the tour, Mustaine noticed problems developing with Behler and brought in drummer Nick Menza as Behler's drum technician. As with Samuelson, Menza was expected to take over if Behler could not continue the tour. Menza replaced Behler in 1989. Young's dismissal resulted from Mustaine's suspicions that he {{was having an affair with}} Mustaine's girlfriend, an allegation Young denied.|$|E
500|$|Jones, {{who played}} Les, {{revealed}} that the runaway storyline was tough on him and he began crying when he read the script. He continued [...] "The four {{of us in the}} Battersby family read our scripts together to work out how we are going to play our parts. On this occasion, all four <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> sobbing. It is not like a normal Coronation Street story, it's more like a Taggart or a Cracker." [...] Jones thought the [...] "scrapes" [...] that Toyah found herself in were frightening and hoped that if the storyline could stop one teenager from running away from home, then it would be worthwhile. The storyline attracted the attention of the Independent Television Commission, who believed that the episode featuring Toyah's abduction should have carried a warning before it was broadcast.|$|E

500|$|Mascherino and Rubano (who both {{attended}} jazz college) were, {{according to}} Lazzara, [...] "really schooled {{in music and}} they know their instruments really well." [...] When they joined the band, they [...] "cleaned up and tightened our sound." [...] The new lineup's first song was [...] "Bonus Mosh Pt. II." [...] They began writing new material, {{and in a few}} months the group had enough songs for a second album. The band initially dismissed a number of songs, since the material wasn't [...] "taking us anyplace new. We really wanted to grow musically with this [...]" [...] They pushed themselves, trying to write the best songs they could. According to Mascherino, the group [...] "didn’t spend as much time playing together in order to do exactly what we wanted to because some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> new." ...|$|E
500|$|Brand New's second studio {{album was}} written in [...] "the year and-a-half or two years" [...] that they were touring the {{material}} off Your Favorite Weapon. According to drummer Brian Lane, [...] "Jesse [...] wrote {{a lot of the}} lyrics about different things than 'I just broke up with my girlfriend' for the new record," [...] as Lacey had written the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, [...] "All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> listening to. For the first [...] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think that {{has a lot to do}} with it." [...] Unlike their first album, it was said that a lot of time and concentration went into making the album.|$|E
500|$|Leng {{has named}} Living in the Material World as his {{personal}} favourite {{of all of}} Harrison's solo albums. According to Leng, with its combination of a defiant [...] "protest" [...] song in [...] "The Day the World Gets 'Round", the anti-stardom [...] "The Lord Loves the One", and [...] "perfect pop confections" [...] in [...] "Give Me Love" [...] and [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long", Living in the Material World was the last album to capture the same clear-sighted, utopian spirit that characterised the 1960s. Eder likewise welcomes Material Worlds bold idealism, saying: [...] "Even {{in the summer of}} 1973, after years of war and strife and disillusionment, some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> still sort of looking – to borrow a phrase from a Lennon–McCartney song – or hoping to get from them something like 'the word' that would make us free. And George, God love him, had the temerity to actually oblige..." ...|$|E

500|$|While he commended {{the album}} for its [...] "variable quality", Alexis Petridis for The Guardian felt the record {{would not be}} able to transcend its target market, a core {{audience}} aged approximately 8 to 12 and female: [...] "To anyone else, the mystery of One Direction's success – or at least the sheer scale of it – remains as opaque as ever." [...] The latter view was shared by Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star: [...] "Unless you’re in the target demographic or are, perhaps, a mom who lived through the same thing in her youth, there's no point in even going near this record, of course, but the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> never meant to in the first place." [...] Writing for HitFix, Melinda Newman maintained that the album [...] "masterfully hits its target", and concluded as follows: [...] "I’m so far out of the One Dimension demographic, I practically need a GPS to find it." ...|$|E
500|$|He starred as {{psychiatrist}} Craig [...] "Huff" [...] Huffstodt in the Showtime {{drama series}} Huff, which ran for two seasons between 2004 and 2006, airing 24 episodes. Azaria {{served as an}} executive producer {{on the show and}} directed an episode of its second season. After reading the pilot script, he sent it to Platt, who took the role of Huff's friend Russell Tupper. Azaria enjoyed working on the show, but struggled with the bleak subject matter and was often in dispute with its creator Bob Lowry, noting that it [...] "was tough to marry our visions all the time, [...] we both cared so much about it that neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> willing to let go." [...] Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly called Azaria [...] "impressively subtle" [...] in the role, while John Leonard of New York magazine said he was a [...] "shrewd bit of casting." [...] The show garnered seven Emmy nominations in 2005, including a nomination for Azaria for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Despite the awards, the show continually received low ratings, and Showtime chose not to commission it for a third season.|$|E

Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to." [...] Rolling Stone Jancee Dunn wrote, [...] "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us." [...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage." ...|$|E
