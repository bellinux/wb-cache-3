5|$|With their complex {{reproductive}} {{needs and}} permeable skins, amphibians are often {{considered to be}} ecological indicators. In many terrestrial ecosystems, they constitute {{one of the largest}} parts of the vertebrate biomass. Any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation. The loss of carnivorous species {{near the top of the}} food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in <b>opportunistic</b> <b>species.</b> In the Middle East, a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in mosquitoes. Predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline. The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) in California is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers, the Yosemite toad (Bufo canorus) and the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa), putting the snake's future at risk. If the snake were to become scarce, this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it. Meanwhile, in the ponds and lakes, fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles. These normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom. A reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae, resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose. Aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences.|$|E

50|$|Trends in {{ecosystem}} {{and community}} properties in succession have been suggested, but few {{appear to be}} general. For example, species diversity almost necessarily increases during early succession as new species arrive, but may decline in later succession as competition eliminates <b>opportunistic</b> <b>species</b> and leads to dominance by locally superior competitors.

50|$|The eastern American red fox has a {{primarily}} carnivorous diet {{dominated by}} small mammals (Frey, 2013). However, as an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>species</b> they will adopt an omnivorous diet that includes insects, fruits, berries, birds, plants, {{and other small}} animals (Tesky, 1995). Food sources can vary depending on region, but cottontails rabbits (Sylvilagus) {{are the most important}} prey for eastern American red foxes (Frey, 2013). The eastern American red fox will consume larger animals as carrion, and their diet changes depending on seasonal variability (Tesky, 1995).|$|E
50|$|Human {{influences}} {{have contributed}} to the decline of the sugar maple in many regions. Its role as a species of mature forests has led it to be replaced by more <b>opportunistic</b> <b>species</b> in areas where forests are cut over. The sugar maple also exhibits a greater susceptibility to pollution than other species of maple. Acid rain and soil acidification are some of the primary contributing factors to maple decline. Also, the increased use of salt over the last several decades on streets and roads for deicing purposes has decimated the sugar maple's role as a street tree.|$|E

During the summer months, this fish will mostly feed on plankton and other surface organisms. The Sacramento perch is an <b>opportunistic</b> <b>species</b> and will generally prey upon whatever is in abundance and have even been shown to eat mosquito larvae. Smaller perches mostly feed on small crustaceans and as they grow larger move on to aquatic insects and even other fish.

5000|$|In general, the Tippecanoe darter is an <b>opportunistic</b> darter <b>species</b> {{that feeds}} on {{immature}} insects. Studies show prey were consumed proportionally to their occurrence in the habitat. This darter {{is a general}} ambush-type feeder. The darter will lie in wait and [...] "dart" [...] up to grab passing insects from overhead. Juveniles consume proportionally smaller prey items and more chironomids than do adults. This {{could be related to}} ease of capture or possibly because of availability. Juvenile Tippecanoe darters are displaced into shallower riffles, chironomids may be more prevalent in these areas. Adult darters rarely consumed prey longer than 6 mm.|$|R
50|$|Bartonella is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria. It is {{the only}} genus in the family Bartonellaceae. Facultative {{intracellular}} parasites, Bartonella species can infect healthy people, but are considered especially important as <b>opportunistic</b> pathogens.

50|$|Fusarium sporotrichioides {{are found}} in many {{tropical}} and temperate regions, usually in the soil or on wheat. Several members of the Fusarium genus are often found colonising the same area, with {{the proportion of the}} total Fusarium population each species constitutes fluctuating depending on extant weather conditions, as for example, colder weather hinders the growth of dominant species such as F. avenaceum, allowing others such as F. culmorum to dominate. In contrast to other taxonomically-related fusaria that are mainly found on cereal crops, F. sporotrichioides is often soil-dwelling. Furthermore, other non-pathogenic or <b>opportunistic</b> Fusarium <b>species</b> are frequently found alongside F. sporotrichioides as part of a phylogenetically similar species complex.|$|R
50|$|Over 180 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} within the Gorge, from the tiny weebill (Smicrornis brevirostris) to the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax). Some of the Gorge's birds have become habituated to humans, due to hand-feeding which is against Park regulations. This situation is of concern to Park rangers as it allows <b>opportunistic</b> <b>species,</b> such as the laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae) and the pied currawong (Strepera graculina), to develop population sizes that are abnormally large. When visitation (and therefore hand-feeding) tapers off over the summer low tourism season the abnormal populations place abnormal pressure on the species' natural food sources which can include the young of other bird species.|$|E
50|$|The {{patterns}} of speciation in the Cucurbitales are diversified {{in a high}} number of species. They have a pantropical distribution with centers of diversity in Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. They most likely originated in West Gondwana 67-107 million years ago, so the oldest split could relate to the break-up of Gondwana in the middle Eocene to late Oligocene, 45-24 million years ago. The group reached their current distribution by multiple intercontinental dispersal events. One factor was product of aridification, other groups responded to favorable climatic periods and expanded across the available habitat, occurring as <b>opportunistic</b> <b>species</b> across wide distribution; other groups diverged over long periods within isolated areas.|$|E
5000|$|As one of {{the deepest}} hadal trenches, the sediments of the Horizon Deep {{harbours}} a community of roundworms. A 2016 {{study found that the}} abundance of individuals in this community is six times greater than it is at a site on the trench edge ( [...] 6250 m) near the deep and that the difference in biomass between these locations is even bigger. Species diversity, on the other hand, is twice as big on the trench slope, probably because of a small number of <b>opportunistic</b> <b>species</b> in the trench. [...] Figures for abundance and biomass are similar for the deeps of the Mariana Trench but considerably lower in the Peru-Chile Trench.|$|E
40|$|The {{intertidal}} invertebrate macrofauna of five creeks in the Fal estuarine system, Cornwall, UK, {{is compared}} {{with data from}} 40 locations in six other estuaries in south-west Britain. Multivariate analysis shows that the community composition in the Fal is distinct {{from all the other}} estuaries. The differences are principally due to the absence of two crustacean species, Corophium volutator and Cyathura carinata, and the high abundance of small <b>opportunistic</b> annelid <b>species.</b> The Fal Estuary is heavily contaminated with heavy metals as a result of mining in the catchment, and the faunistic features are commensurate with what is known of the relative sensitivities of marine invertebrate taxa to pollution...|$|R
40|$|Mediterranean macroalgal assemblages {{in areas}} invaded and non-invaded by Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea were {{compared}} and trapped sediments were characterised. Results showed that assemblages invaded by C. racemosa var. cylindracea differed greatly from non-invaded ones: encrusting and erect algae, both articulated and foliose, decreased in invaded areas, while <b>opportunistic</b> filamentous <b>species</b> increased their abundance The percentage of sediment was 7 times higher in areas invaded by C. racemosa var. cylindracea than in non-invaded areas.
