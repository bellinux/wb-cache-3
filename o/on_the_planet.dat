5|$|Elizabeth Henstridge portrays Simmons, and {{is joined}} by guest star Dillon Casey as another {{survivor}} stranded <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b> Series regulars Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, and Iain De Caestecker also briefly appear. The episode was {{a departure from the}} norm for the series, focusing on a single character rather than the usual ensemble, and taking place on an alien planet. The episode was filmed in the Californian desert, with a filtering effect used to make it appear to be night <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>planet,</b> as its sun rarely rises. The episode took inspiration from multiple science fiction films, and bears similarity to The Martian, which was released close to the episode's airing.|$|E
