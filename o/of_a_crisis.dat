5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> for Lutosławski, {{during which he}} still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced by the sound or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine was that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis,</b> {{a point in}} the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Vashyron and his comrades learn the full tale from Juris, Rowen {{is in the}} midst <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> of faith due to his control over the Zenith System through his ring. During the party's {{confrontation}} with Sullivan where he threatens to destroy Leanne's quartz, Rowen shoots Sullivan to try and prove the existence of a higher power through Leanne's survival. The three then confront Rowen directly and fatally wound him, but Rowen's control of the Zenith System preserves his life. Vashyron calls Zephyr and Leanne off, seeing further fighting is pointless. During the game's credits, Rowen uses his power to resurrect the Cardinals, then leaves the control ring on Frieda's grave, and Sullivan is seen reuniting with Rebecca. In a post-credit scene, Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron explore the now-clean world beyond Basel, and Leanne's quartz is revealed to have been safely embedded in her hand.|$|E
40|$|By {{introducing}} {{the concept of}} conditional probability of joint failure (CPJF), and by proposing a new measure for the systemic impact of currency crises, we provide {{new insights into the}} different sources of currency crises.

5|$|The Z-4 Plan was a {{proposed}} basis for negotiations {{to end the}} Croatian War of Independence with a political settlement. It was drafted by Peter W. Galbraith, Leonid Kerestedjiants and Geert-Hinrich Ahrens {{on behalf of a}} mini-Contact Group comprising United Nations envoys and diplomats from the United States, Russia and the European Union. The co-chairs of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, were closely involved in the political process surrounding the plan. The document was prepared in the final months of 1994 and early 1995 before being presented to Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and the leaders of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) on 30 January 1995. Although Tuđman was displeased with the proposal, the RSK authorities—influenced by Serbian President Slobodan Milošević—refused to receive the document, let alone discuss it. Milošević was concerned that the plan might be used to force the settlement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> in Serbia's Kosovo province.|$|E
5|$|The {{birth control}} {{movement}} received an unexpected boost during World War I, {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> the U.S. military experienced when many of its soldiers were diagnosed with syphilis or gonorrhea. The military undertook an extensive education campaign, focusing on abstinence, but also offering some contraceptive guidance.Tone, pp. 91–115 contains a history of contraception in the U.S. military in World War I. Navy secretary Josephus Daniels led the efforts to enforce abstinence. The military, under pressure from purity advocates, did not distribute condoms, or even endorse their use, making the U.S. the only military force in World War I that did not supply condoms to its troops. When U.S. soldiers were in Europe, they found rubber condoms readily available, and {{when they returned to}} America, they continued to use condoms as their preferred method of birth control.|$|E

25|$|On 6 September 2007, a {{months after}} the incident, a closed-door OSCE Council session was held.

A party plenum resulted in a victory for the right wing: it approved a highly self-critical report, published in the party newspaper Ittihad ash-Sha'ab. Al-Radi remained the nominal party leader, but his position as secretary was changed to that of first secretary, with three assistant secretaries appointed who were all close to Abdallah.|$|E
25|$|The United States Department of Defense in a 2011 report {{stated that}} the primary mission of the PRC {{military}} is a possible military conflict with Taiwan, including also possible US military assistance.

However, also other priorities are becoming increasingly prominent and possible due to increasing military resources.

The rapid military modernization is continually changing the military balance of power towards mainland China.|$|E
25|$|The {{sulphur dioxide}} {{additive}} {{commonly used in}} wine is not harmful in the amounts used but its effects are feared among asthmatics: it can cause the onset <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> (Difficulty breathing).

A reaction caused by a deficiency of sulphite oxidase (the enzyme that breaks down Sulphur Dioxide) is very rare.

50|$|Another {{topic of}} {{study is the}} impact of sudden stops on output.

Lower asset prices are a persistent fact after <b>a</b> banking <b>crisis,</b> which indicate <b>a</b> low value <b>of</b> collaterals to loans, and therefore, negatively impact the banking sector and the supply of loans.|$|R

25|$|In May–June 1993, when, as {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> in the government, the country {{was on the verge}} of a civil war and faced the peril of losing independence, the people of Azerbaijan demanded to bring Heydar Aliyev to power, and the then leaders of Azerbaijan were obliged to officially invite Heydar Aliyev to Baku. On 24 June 1993, amidst the {{advancement}} of insurgent forces under Huseynov's control towards Baku, Elchibey fled from the city to his native village of Keleki in Nakhchivan. Earlier, on 15 June 1993, Aliyev had been elected Chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, and after Elchibey's flight he also assumed temporary presidential powers. In August 1993, Elchibey was stripped of his presidency by the nationwide referendum, and in October 1993, Aliyev was elected President of Azerbaijan. In May 1994, Aliyev entered into a ceasefire agreement that still remains in force to this very day. However, the conflict remained unresolved, with Armenian control over Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E
25|$|Convinced <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> devastating the Roman Catholic Church {{and coming}} under the {{increasing}} influence of sedevacantist activists, Thục consecrated several bishops without a mandate from the Holy See. In December 1975 {{he went to}} Palmar de Troya, where he ordained Clemente Domínguez y Gómez—who claimed to have witnessed an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary—and others, and the following month he consecrated Dominguez and four followers as bishops. In May 1981 Thục consecrated a French priest, Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers, as bishop. Des Lauriers was a Dominican, {{an expert on the}} dogma of the Assumption and advisor to Pope Pius XII, and former professor at the Pontifical Lateran University. In October 1981, he consecrated two Mexican priests and former seminary professors, Moisés Carmona (of Acapulco) and Adolfo Zamora (of Mexico City). Both of these priests were convinced that the Papal See of Rome was vacant and the successors of Pope Pius XII were heretical usurpers of papal office and power. In February 1982, in Munich's Sankt Michael church, Thục issued a declaration that the Holy See in Rome was vacant, intimating that he desired a restoration of the hierarchy to end the vacancy. However, his newly consecrated bishops became a fragmented group. Many limited themselves essentially to sacramental ministry and only consecrated a few other bishops.|$|E

Bohemians were then the {{champions of the}} Eircom League, having won the Double the previous season. However, the club was in something <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis,</b> having parted ways with their league-winning manager, Roddy Collins, in the summer, his successor Pete Mahon struggling after an excellent start to the season. Kenny's impact at Bohemians was immediate, as the side steadily {{moved away from the}} lower end of the league table and reached that year's FAI Cup final. However, the season was to end in bitter disappointment, as Bohemians were beaten 2–1 by Dundalk FC, a club which had been relegated from the top flight the previous week. This was Kenny's second FAI Cup final defeat in as many seasons. In the close season Kenny made some changes to the first team squad, and the 2002/2003 season saw Bohemians win the Premier Division title, leading from start to finish. The following season they finished runners-up to Shelbourne FC. In the 2004 season Bohemians began poorly and after 3 months found themselves in 3rd place. Kenny's job was insecure and he was sacked on 27 July 2004, following Bohemians' 3–1 home defeat in the UEFA Cup to Estonian side FC Levadia Tallinn. His league record at Bohemians was 49 wins in 96 games.|$|E
