40|$|Abstract: The loss of bone {{integrity}} {{can significantly}} compromise the aesthetics and mobility {{of patients and}} can be treated using <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants.</b> Over the past decades; various orthopaedic implants; such as allografts; xenografts and synthetic materials; have been developed and widely used in clinical practice. However; most of these materials lack intrinsic osteoinductivity and thus cannot induce bone formation. Consequently; osteoinductive functionalisation of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> is needed to promote local osteogenesis and implant osteointegration. For this purpose; bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) -functionalised coatings {{have proven to be}} a simple and effective strategy. In this review; we summarise the current knowledge and recent advances regarding BMP-functionalised coatings for <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants...</b>|$|R

50|$|Dynamic hip screw (DHS) or Sliding Screw Fixation {{is a type}} of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implant</b> {{designed}} for fixation of certain types of hip fractures which allows controlled dynamic sliding of the femoral head component along the construct. One common use is internal fixation of intertrochanteric fractures of the femur, which are common in older osteoporotic patients. There are 3 components of a dynamic hip screw, including a lag screw (inserted into the neck of the femur), a sideplate and four cortical screws (fixated into the proximal femoral shaft). The idea behind the dynamic compression is that the femoral head component is allowed to move along one plane; since bone responds to dynamic stresses, the native femur may undergo primary healing: cells join along boundaries, resulting in a robust joint requiring no remodeling.|$|E

40|$|Typically, The Journal Of Bone and Joint Surgery publishes {{papers that}} report {{the results of}} {{clinical}} or basic-science inquiry and has dealt only fleetingly with government policy, malpractice, hospital administration, new technology, and the like. The Journal does consider and publish so-called non-conventional articles when these reports deal with issues of major importance. One could argue that such non-traditional articles lack scientific validity as the important variables that they discuss, such as quality, service, and satisfaction, are not quantified. However, these issues have a major effect on our specialty, and The Journal {{has an obligation to}} deal with such issues. The Journal has done this by including two articIes 4 dealing with the cost of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> in the present issue. The cost of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> is staggering.

40|$|Magnesium (Mg) -based {{biodegradable}} {{materials are}} promising {{candidates for the}} new generation of implantable medical devices, particularly cardiovascular stents and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants.</b> Mg-based cardiovascular stents represent the most innovative stent technology to date. However, these products still do not fully meet clinical requirements with regards to fast degradation rates, late restenosis, and thrombosis. Thus various surface coatings have been introduced to protect Mg-based stents from rapid corrosion and to improve biocompatibility. Similarly, different coatings have been used for <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants,</b> e. g., plates and pins for bone fracture fixation or as an interference screw for tendon-bone or ligament-bone insertion, to improve biocompatibility and corrosion resistance. Metal coatings, nanoporous inorganic coatings and permanent polymers have been proved to enhance corrosion resistance; however, inflammation and foreign body reactions have also been reported. By contrast, biodegradable polymers are more biocompatible in general and are favoured over permanent materials. Drugs are also loaded with biodegradable polymers to improve their performance. The key similarities and differences in coatings for Mg-based stents and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> are summarized...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{infection}} is a severe complication of total joint arthroplasty. Microbiological diagnosis {{is not very}} sensitive, because microorganisms are typically present in a biofilm {{on the surface of}} the prosthesis in which they are incorporated. Sonication of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> has been proposed to improve the microbiologic diagnosis of prosthetic-joint infection. In this study, we evaluated the correspondence between intra-operative cultures and cultures on sonication fluid of explanted prosthetic implants. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the feasibility and usefulness of sonication fluid cultures of explanted <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> to improve the microbiological diagnosis of postoperative infection. METHODS From November 2010 to June 2011, we removed and sonicated 25 implants (12 total knee arthroplasties, 6 total hip arthroplasties, 2 intramidollary nails, and 5 antibiotic cement spacers). The sonication fluid was cultured and underwent multiplex PCR. We compared intra-operative conventional cultures with examinations carried out on the sonicated fluid, calculating sensitivity and specificity of both diagnostic methods. CONCLUSION In this preliminary study the culture of samples obtained from sonication of explanted <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> was proven to be more sensitive than the conventional intraoperative culture. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies demonstrated growth of bacteria on a cement joint spacer...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in non-invasive optical, radiographic and μCT imaging {{provide an opportunity}} to monitor biological processes longitudinally in an anatomical context. One particularly relevant application for combining these modalities is to study <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implant</b> infections. These infections are characterized by the formation of persistent bacterial biofilms on the implanted materials, causing inflammation, periprosthetic osteolysis, osteomyelitis, and bone damage, resulting in implant loosening and failure. An <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implant</b> infection model was used in which a titanium Kirshner-wire was surgically placed in femurs of LysEGFP mice, which possess EGFP-fluorescent neutrophils, and a bioluminescent S. aureus strain (Xen 29; 1 × 10 (3) CFUs) was inoculated in the knee joint before closure. In vivo bioluminescent, fluorescent, X-ray and μCT imaging were performed on various postoperative days. The bacterial bioluminescent signals of the S. aureus-infected mice peaked on day 19, before decreasing to a basal level of light, which remained measurable for the entire 48 day experiment. Neutrophil EGFP-fluorescent signals of the S. aureus-infected mice were statistically greater than uninfected mice on days 2 and 5, but afterwards the signals for both groups approached background levels of detection. To visualize the three-dimensional location of the bacterial infection and neutrophil infiltration, a diffuse optical tomography reconstruction algorithm was used to co-register the bioluminescent and fluorescent signals with μCT images. To quantify the anatomical bone changes on the μCT images, the outer bone volume of the distal femurs were measured using a semi-automated contour based segmentation process. The outer bone volume increased through day 48, indicating that bone damage continued during the implant infection. Bioluminescent and fluorescent optical imaging was combined with X-ray and μCT imaging to provide noninvasive and longitudinal measurements of the dynamic changes in bacterial burden, neutrophil recruitment and bone damage in a mouse <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implant</b> infection model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Malignant {{degeneration}} {{in association}} with <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>implants</b> is a known but rare complication.

X-ray and MR imaging showed a large destructive tumor in the medial femoral condyle. Biopsy determined a malignant fibrous histiocytoma. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, wide tumor resection and distal femur reconstruction with a silver-coated non-cemented tumor knee joint prosthesis was performed.
