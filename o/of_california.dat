It also features several facts that challenge stereotypes about these families. For example, a large and growing majority of poor children live in working families, and as many <b>of</b> <b>California's</b> poor children live in two-parent as in single-parent families. This report illustrates the rapidly changing demographic picture <b>of</b> <b>California's</b> poor and low-income families.
