40|$|Valid and {{reliable}} {{statistics on the}} <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death is an essential input for setting of priorities in the health sector (Mahapatra, 1999). As is generally known, most developed <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death reporting systems rely on medical certification <b>of</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death using a well defined system of classification. The International classification <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death (ICD) released by WHO {{from time to time}} is usually followed as such or with suitable adaptations to specific country settings. The 10 th revision of the ICD (ICD 10) is the latest instance of this kind (WHO, 1993). Most developed <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death reporting systems have invariably achieved near total coverage. In other words a <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death report is invariable filed by the medical attendant for all deaths in such countries. Developing countries like India have to depend on lay reporting <b>of</b> the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death for rural areas, where adequate medical facilities are not available. However, usability <b>of</b> the <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death statistics is questioned in view of poor coverage, and poor compliance with <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death reporting, coding and classification.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was (1) to compare levels of {{accuracy}} regarding the categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death between non-contrast post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) and the final forensic report as well as between autopsy and the final forensic report, and (2) to assess levels of confidence regarding the categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death after non-contrast PMCT and after autopsy. This prospective study was conducted over a 5 month period during which 221 cases were admitted to our institute for forensic investigations. Whole-body PMCT and forensic autopsy were performed in every case. Of these, 101 cases were included in the final study population. Inclusion criteria were: (1) age > 18 years, (2) presence of {{at least one of the}} two principal investigators at the time of admission. One radiologist and one forensic pathologist independently read all PMCT datasets using a report template. <b>Cause</b> <b>of</b> death category and confidence levels were determined by consensus. Forensic autopsy was performed by two forensic pathologists; both unblinded to imaging results. Both post-imaging and post-autopsy <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death categorization were compared against the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death, as stated in the forensic expert report, which included findings from histology and/or toxicology. Accuracy <b>of</b> post-imaging <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death categorization in reference to the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death category was substantial (82 %, 83 / 101 cases, Kappa 0. 752). Accuracy <b>of</b> post-autopsy <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death categorization in reference to the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death category was near perfect (89 %, 90 / 101 cases, Kappa 0. 852). Post-imaging sensitivity and specificity regarding the categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were 82 % and 97 %, respectively. Post-autopsy sensitivity and specificity regarding the categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death were 89 % and 98 %, respectively. There was a high consistency between the accuracy <b>of</b> post-imaging <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death categorization and post-imaging levels of confidence. There was less consistency between accuracy <b>of</b> post-autopsy <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death categorization and post-autopsy levels of confidence. In this study categorization <b>of</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death based on non-contrast enhanced PMCT alone, and on PMCT and macroscopic autopsy together, proved to be consistent with the final <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death-category as determined based on all available information including PMCT, autopsy, and (if available) histology and/or toxicology in more than 82 % and 89 % of all cases, respectively.

5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect <b>of</b> <b>causing</b> the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E

This study examines relationships <b>of</b> multiple <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death {{as a function of}} factors available on the death certificate (demographics of decedent, place of death, type of certifier, disposal method, whether an autopsy was performed, and year of death). Methods Data from 326, 332 Minnesota death certificates from 1990 – 1998 are examined. Underlying and non-underlying <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death are examined (based on record axis codes) as well as demographic and death-related covariates. Associations between covariates and prevalence <b>of</b> multiple <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death and conditional probability of underlying compared to non-underlying <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> death are examined. The occurrence of ischemic heart disease or diabetes as underlying causes are specifically examined.
