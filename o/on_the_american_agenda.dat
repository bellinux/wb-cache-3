40|$|Personal {{health and}} {{well-being}} are gaining priority <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>agenda.</b> A renewed interest in health promotion has been facilitated {{by the need to}} contain health care costs, realization of the limits of medicine in preventing illness, and a deeply rooted societal ethic of personal responsibility for individual health. Although the health status of Americans has changed significantly for the better during this century, further improvements are necessary, especially among high risk subgroups within the population who have not been effectively reached by traditional health promotion strategies. Past efforts, aimed at individuals modifying their risk factors, have neglected to address environmental factors that contribute to disease risk. This points to the need for an integrated approach where problems are addressed as properties of the systems in which individuals behave. This paper reviews selected health trends in the United States, discusses limitations of the current approach to health promotion, presents a comprehensive definition of prevention, and provides principles for planning that may facilitate improved health status in this country. health promotion risk factors environmental public policy...|$|E

The US adopted an extensive number of major environmental and resource policies which imposed increasingly stringent standards on industry. New institutions, like the US Environmental Protection Agency, were created to manage environmental programs and spending was greatly increased for these programs. However, under the Reagan administration in the 1980 s, a conservative policy agenda was implemented which accelerated devolution and resulted in large cuts in the budgets of the EPA and other agencies...|$|R

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this thesis {{is to examine the}} key factors and events within the immediate political foreground which led to the acceptance of private prisons as a viable policy option <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> correctional <b>agenda</b> in <b>the</b> early to mid- 1980 s. There has been an evident failure in criminology to provide a proper historical account of the recent origins of private prisons, as <b>the</b> concentration <b>on</b> questions of pragmatism and philosophy left other important issues unexamined. The history of prison privatization is approached from a position that embraces multiplicity and complexity, where it is contextualized within the dynamics of the policy process and the cumulative pressures faced by individual policy-makers. To this end, the work is essentially a literature review, which analyzes the multitude of factors which interacted to produce the necessary conditions favourable to considering the privatization of prisons as a viable policy option, an approach which is critical to assessing the past, present and future developments in their proliferation.

40|$|Access {{to health}} care is a major item <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> {{political}} <b>agenda.</b> For rural <b>Americans,</b> <b>the</b> relative scarcity of health services is viewed as an issue of social justice. Three groups of professionals, collectively called midlevel practitioners (MLPs), have been credited with providing health care services to rural <b>Americans,</b> but <b>the</b> presence of regulatory barriers has limited their availability and utilization. The purpose of the research was to study the affects of such regulations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> availability of nurse practitioners, certified nurse midwives, and physician assistants. State boards of nursing and medicine were surveyed. In the first hypothesis, selected board characteristics were analyzed to determine their affect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> regulations of direct third-party reimbursement, authority to prescribe, and physician supervision requirements. In the second hypothesis, the regulations and other independent variables were analyzed to determine the affect such regulations have <b>on</b> <b>the</b> availability of MLPs.

[...] As President, Grant would atone for 1862's expulsion of the Jews. Historian Jonathan Sarna argues that Grant became one of the greatest friends of Jews in American history, meeting with them often and appointing them to high office.

Estonia's foreign policy priority is gaining admission into the EU and NATO. The debate over Estonian admission into NATO has several implications for U. S. policy. First, there is a large Baltic constituency within the U.

40|$|A {{worldwide}} awakening to {{the high}} incidence of preventable harm resulting from medical care, combined with pressure on hospitals and physicians from liability litigation, has turned international attention to the need for better structures to resolve medical disputes in a way that promotes medical safety and honesty toward patients. The civil justice system in the United States, in particular, is criticized as inefficient, arbitrary, and sometimes punitive. It is charged with undermining sound medical care by encouraging wasteful expenditures through defensive medicine; by driving information about medical mistakes underground where it escapes analysis, undercutting quality improvement efforts; and by forcing physicians in liability-prone specialties such as obstetrics out of practice. Similar charges are leveled against medical injury compensation systems in the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere. While these criticisms have been strongly countered, they have gained a foothold in the public imagination sufficient to place structural reform of medical litigation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> political <b>agenda.</b> One enlightened response to mounting concerns over medical error and liability has been a partial shift in focus, in the United States and other Western nations, from the blameworthiness of individual physicians to the correction of system-related deficiencies in the quality of care, and from confrontational litigation between patients and health care providers to a more integrative approach emphasizing disclosure to patients and families of the underlying facts and apology for harm done. Drawing in considerable measure on Wagatsuma and Rosett 2 ̆ 7 s pioneering 1986 article explaining the importance of apology (in non-medical settings) in Japan, the scholarship in this area portrays honest disclosure as more than an ethical and professional duty, and sincere apology as more than a way of fulfilling the emotional needs of patients, families, and medical personnel. These scholars, and the 2 ̆ 2 Sorry Works! 2 ̆ 2 movement that their writing has spurred, also assert that contrary to long-standing assumptions of liability insurers and hospital defense lawyers, disclosure and apology have in fact the practical benefit of diffusing some of the dissatisfaction that leads to compensation claims, thereby potentially shrinking liability burdens. While its likely effects on lawsuit filings are contested, the disclosure-and-apology philosophy is gaining considerable traction in medical practice. Compared with the United States, Japan (like most countries) enjoys a comparatively low rate of civil litigation over medical injury. What accounts for this relative paucity of medical lawsuits? The stereotype of a nation populated by long-suffering victims with a cultural aversion to the assertion of rights has long been punctured. Are there simply fewer medical injuries in Japan, due to the prevalence in hospitals of the strict quality control for which the nation 2 ̆ 7 s manufacturing enterprises are justly famed? When injury claims do arise, are they quickly resolved through non-punitive, harmony-promoting informal dispute resolution processes employing the traditional social lubricant of apology, as <b>the</b> scholarship drawing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Wagatsuma-Rosett thesis would presume?
