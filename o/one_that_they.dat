On that occasion, the Minister of Communication, Senator Vittorio Cini, {{one of the most}} {{powerful}} Italian industrialists, frontally attacked Mussolini, telling him that it was time for him to seek a way to exit the war. After the meeting, Cini resigned. This was one among the many signs that the Duce's charisma was crumbling even among his entourage. Each day, people devoted to him, agents of the OVRA and the Germans told him that several plots were going on, but he never reacted, telling each <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were reading too many crime novels or were affected by persecution mania.|$|E

25|$|In the {{cardinal}} directions of Midwestern Native Americans, the wolf represented the west, but it represented the southeast for the Pawnee tribe. According to the Pawnee creation myth, the wolf {{was the first}} creature to experience death. The Wolf Star, enraged at not having been invited to attend a council on how the Earth should be made, sent a wolf to steal the whirlwind bag of The Storm that Comes out of the West, which contained the first humans. Upon being freed from the bag, the humans killed the wolf, thus bringing death into the world. Native Americans have long seen the wolf as an animal of power. Many tribes credit the actual creator of the earth to be a wolf. The Arikara and Ojibwe believed a wolfman spirit made the Great Plains for them and for other animals. Many tribes consider wolves to be closely related to humans. The reason for this belief {{is because of the}} wolf’s dedication to its pack, a trait the tribes attributed with themselves. The Navajo tribe was known for performing healing ceremonies where they would call upon wolves to restore health to their ill. Wolves were admired for their superb hunting skills.Prayers were offered in honor of wolves before they went out of hunting excursions. The Pawnee’s connection with wolves was so great that their hand signal for Pawnee was actually the same <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had for wolf. Before battles, Apache warriors would pray, sing, and dance to gain the teamwork, strength, and bravery of wolves.|$|E

500|$|The crew {{spent a long}} {{amount of}} time {{plotting}} out the episode in a room, using sticky notes, {{in order to make}} sure it played out sensibly and was clearly understandable to viewers. The production staff based a lot of the usage of time travel in [...] "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo" [...] on those from the Back to the Future trilogy (1985-1990) and H. G. Wells' The Time Machine (1960). The goal of the crew was to make sure everything stayed strong to a certain logical standpoint, which led to several surreal conversations, including several paradoxes involving time travel. The crew members sought to venture into elements that seemed complicated, as their children viewers were deemed intelligent enough to understand such elements. The hopes of the production staff was to make the episode <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could watch multiple times and notice something new with each viewing.|$|E
500|$|Tension {{developed}} between Roosevelt and Barkley during the war, however. In 1943, Roosevelt refused to appoint Barkley to a vacancy on the Supreme Court, and Barkley criticized the War Production Board for awarding contracts {{for the production}} of war-related materials to large companies rather than small businesses. Their most notable clash occurred in February 1944 when Roosevelt requested that Congress approve tax increases to generate over $10billion in revenue for the war. Barkley and the Senate Finance Committee negotiated a bill containing only $2.3billion in tax increases. Feeling the measure was insufficient, Roosevelt convened the [...] "Big Four" [...] on February 21 and told them he would veto it. They urged him not to do so, assuring him that the bill they had drafted was the best <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could pass. Roosevelt vetoed the bill the next day, marking the first time a U.S. president vetoed a revenue bill.|$|E

[...] Gleason then ordered several other tribal police officers to arrest Bad Elk and to take him to the Pine Ridge Agency, about 25 miles away. [...] Three officers contacted Bad Elk, who refused to go with them, telling them that he would go in the morning. [...] The officers then tried to arrest Bad Elk, who shot and killed John Kills Back. [...] Bad Elk claimed that Kills Back had reached for his pistol and that Bad Elk fired in self-defense.

[...] With the Inhumans film being removed from Marvel Studios' release schedule, the series had [...] "a little more freedom" [...] and were [...] "able to do a little bit more" [...] with the species, including the potential of introducing some of the [...] "classic" [...] Inhumans, though the series would focus less on Inhumans than the third season which saw [...] "a real significant Inhuman agenda story". It was not intended to be a spin-off of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. On the evolution of S.H.I.E.L.D. to featuring so many powered characters, Whedon said [...] "the dynamic in the world has changed.

500|$|Bowdoin {{ran against}} Hancock in {{subsequent}} elections, but {{was never able}} to overcome Hancock's enormous popularity. [...] The contest between the two men was just one element of a long-running rivalry that encompassed business, politics, and religion, and was apparently deeply personal. [...] The two men were both involved in the administration of Harvard, where their feud sometimes became ugly. [...] For example, in 1776, while Hancock was simultaneously treasurer of Harvard and president of the Second Continental Congress, a committee headed by Bowdoin decided that securities physically held by Hancock were at risk because of the war, and a delegation was sent to Philadelphia to receive an accounting of them and physical custody of the papers. [...] Hancock's dilatory responses and refusal to produce an accounting of the college books dragged on for several years, as a result of which Bowdoin orchestrated his censure by the Harvard board of overseers. [...] The matter reached a peak of sorts in 1783 when the college's issues with Hancock were read and discussed in an open meeting at which Hancock was the presiding officer. [...] Both Bowdoin and Hancock attended the Brattle Street Church, where they competed with each other over the size and quality of the improvements to the building (and even the location of a new <b>one)</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> funded. [...] James Warren captured {{the differences between the two}} men: [...] "I don't envy either of them their feelings. the Vanity of one will Sting like an Adder if it is disappointed, and the Advancements made by the other if they dont succeed will hurt his Modest pride." [...] The rivalry between the men was so bitter that the founding of Bowdoin College, named in his honor, had to be delayed until after Hancock died.|$|E
