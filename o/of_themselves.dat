5|$|Christianity {{led to the}} {{development}} of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives.

These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> and others.|$|E

5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to the fear of being discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E
