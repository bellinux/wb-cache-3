5|$|Jews also {{spread across}} Europe during the period. Communities were {{established}} in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries, but Spanish Jews, long settled in Spain under the Muslims, came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity. Most Jews were confined to the cities, as they {{were not allowed to}} own land or be peasants. Besides the Jews, there were other non-Christians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of Europe—pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe.|$|E

5|$|For any graph G = (V,E), we may {{define a}} matroid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of G, {{in which a}} set of edges is {{independent}} {{if and only if}} it forms a pseudoforest; this matroid is known as the bicircular matroid (or bicycle matroid) of G. The smallest dependent sets for this matroid are the minimal connected subgraphs of G that have more than one cycle, and these subgraphs are sometimes called bicycles. There are three possible types of bicycle: a theta graph has two vertices that are connected by three internally disjoint paths, a figure 8 graph consists of two cycles sharing a single vertex, and a handcuff graph is formed by two disjoint cycles connected by a path.|$|E

5|$|In The Political Demands of Isolated Indian Bands in British Columbia, Thomson {{points out}} the {{benefits}} in some level (albeit small) of separatist policies. He argues the benefits of allowing ethnic groups, like the Amish and the Hutterites in the United States and Canada or the Sami in Norway, to live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of governance. These are ethnic groups that would prefer to retain their ethnic identity and thus prefer separatist policies for themselves, as they do not require them to conform to policies for all ethnicities of the nation.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Europe, Romania built {{what were}} termed heroes' war grave cemeteries, either in {{existing}} heroes' cemeteries, on {{the sites of}} the World War I battles, or in new cemeteries symbolically placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of towns. The situation was somewhat different in Russia, however, where the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was used {{not just for the}} war dead of World War I, but also for the casualties of the Civil War, and then the victims of the secret police. It was finally closed by the Bolsheviks in 1925 and turned into a park; subsequently, possibly on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the Eastern Orthodox church and the headstones were systematically destroyed until almost no trace of the cemetery remained.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-backed fairywren is {{predominantly}} insectivorous; they eat {{a wide variety}} of insects, including beetles such as weevils, leaf-, jewel-, flea- and ground-beetles, bugs, grasshoppers, moths, wasps and cicadas. Insect larvae and eggs are eaten as well as spiders. Seeds and other plant material make up only a very small proportion of its diet. It can be found hunting for insects in leaf litter, shrubbery and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of bodies of water, mostly in the morning and late afternoon. Adults of both sexes as well as helper birds feed the young.|$|E

5|$|Parts of Juniata County {{are fairly}} flat, {{but there are}} areas in the county with slopes of 25% or greater. However, most {{development}} in the county is confined to areas with slopes of 15% or less. Many of the county's steepest slopes, with grades of 25% of more, are located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the county. These slopes are generally found on mountainous ridges. However, there are some similarly steep slopes {{in the middle of}} the county. All four boroughs in the county have slopes with a grade of 25% or more near them. Slopes of 15% to 25% can be found throughout the county.|$|E
5|$|Pulveroboletus ravenelii {{produces}} an olive-grey to olive-brown spore print. Spores are elliptical to oval, smooth, and measure 8–10 by 4–5μm. The hyphal {{tissue in the}} hymenophore is inamyloid and bilateral, meaning it diverges downward from the flesh {{toward the edge of}} the hymenophore, away from a central strand. The tubes have scattered cystidia on the walls (pleurocystidia) and abundant cystidia <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> (cheilocystidia). The hyphae in the cap cuticle are arranged as an ixotrichodermium–long and typically multi-celled, with erect hyphae embedded in a gelatinous matrix. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to {{the underside of}} the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended first, and then reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity.|$|E

5|$|Russula emetica {{produces}} a white to yellowish-white spore print. Spores are roughly elliptical to egg-shaped, with a strongly warted and partially reticulate (web-like) surface. They have dimensions of 8.8–11.0 by 6.6–8μm, and are amyloid, {{meaning that they}} will stain blue, bluish-grey, to blackish in Melzer's reagent. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 32.9–50 by 9.0–11.6μm. Cystidia located on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are somewhat cylindrical to club-shaped or somewhat spindle-shaped, and measure 35–88 by 7.3–12.4μm. They are yellowish, and contain granular contents. Cheilocystidia (found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the gills), which are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, are thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 14–24 by 4.4–7.3μm. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The spore dust is olive to {{brownish}} olive. The spores are oval to somewhat -shaped, measuring 11–15μm long by 4.5–6.5μm wide. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped and four-spored, {{and measure}} 29.2–36.5 by 11.0–12.4μm. Cystidia {{on the sides}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with swollen middles and long necks, measuring 33–48 by 7.3–13.5μm; cheilocystidia (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the pores) have a similar morphology. The cap cuticle is made of cylindrical hyphae 3.7–5.8μm wide that are interwoven compactly, and the hyphal tips are erect and arranged in bundles. In contrast, the hyphae of the cap flesh is loosely interwoven with hyphae that are cylindrical and branched, measuring 3.7–8.8μm. Hyphae do not contain clamp connections. The mycelium is an unusual yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is purplish brown. Under the microscope, the spores appear dull purple-brown. They are {{ellipsoid}} to somewhat egg-shaped, and, according to Singer's original description, measure 8–10 by 4–5μm. A later study of specimens collected from British Columbia, Canada, instead reported a larger spore size range of 10–13 by 6–7μm. The spores have an apical germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 22–35 by 7–10μm. There are abundant cystidia that form a sterile band <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> of the gills (cheilocystidia); these cystidia are smooth, inflated, and fusoid-ventricose (enlarged {{in the middle}} and tapered toward both ends) with an sharp tip, and measure 25–30 by 6–9μm. The cap cuticle (an ixocutis) is made of a layer of roughly horizontal, gelatinized, wavy, hyaline hyphae that are 0.8–5.5μm in diameter.|$|E
