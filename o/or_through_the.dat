5|$|Citing {{the trust}} {{relationship}} between {{the federal government and}} the tribes, the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government, not private parties (whether through self-help <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> courts). In other words, the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties. At the same time, the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid, and refused to consider the plaintiffs claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838) was fraudulent.|$|E

Tropical Storm Doria passed about 160miles (260km) east of Charleston, South Carolina, though its large wind field produced 22mph (35km/h) winds in the town. The storm also dropped light rainfall {{of up to}} 1.75inches (44mm), and resulted in a storm tide of 5.7feet (1.7m) above the mean low water level.|$|E

5|$|The upshot is that {{scholars}} cannot assert with any confidence how much material Shakespeare took from the Ur-Hamlet (if it even existed), how much from Belleforest or Saxo, {{and how much}} from other contemporary sources (such as Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy). No clear evidence exists that Shakespeare made any direct references to Saxo's version. However, elements of Belleforest's version which are not in Saxo's story do appear in Shakespeare's play. Whether Shakespeare took these from Belleforest directly <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Ur-Hamlet remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{initiating}} advisories on Hattie, the Miami Weather Bureau {{noted the}} potential for heavy rainfall and flash flooding in the southwestern Caribbean. The advisories recommended for small ships to remain at harbor across the region. Initially, the hurricane was predicted to move near <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Cayman Islands, Jamaica, and Cuba. As a result, Cuban officials advised residents in low-lying areas to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|After the United States officially {{entered the}} war, Hispanic Americans {{were among the}} many American {{citizens}} who {{joined the ranks of}} the United States Marine Corps as volunteers <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> draft. Hispanic Americans in the Marines fought in every major battle in the Pacific Theater of Operations. The battles of Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa saw fierce fighting between U.S. Marines and the Imperial Japanese Army. Among them PFC Guy Gabaldon who single-handed captured over 1,000 prisoners. It was during this conflict that four Hispanics would also participate as military commanders in the Marine Corps. The two highest-ranking Hispanics in the Marines were Lieutenant General Pedro Augusto del Valle, the first Hispanic to reach the grade of general in the Marines, and Colonel Jaime Sabater, Sr..|$|E

5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} {{the decisions of}} the Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively based on the Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change the outcome of the case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn decisions of the Oregon Supreme Court, decisions of the court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E
5|$|At Altoona, {{the route}} again {{overlaps}} I-80 until Newton, where it splits away from I-80. The highway passes near <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cities of Kellogg, Grinnell, Victor, Marengo, the Amana Colonies, and Tiffin {{before entering the}} Coralville / Iowa City area. Through Coralville and Iowa City, US6 has no direct access to I-80, I-380, or US218; other routes like Iowa Highway 1 (Iowa1) and Iowa965 provide direct access. From Iowa City, the highway heads to the east-southeast through West Liberty and Atalissa. Near Wilton, the route heads north to I-80 where it again overlaps to Davenport. At Davenport, US6 then follows I-280 and US61 before entering the city. On {{the eastern side of}} Davenport, it joins I-74 and enters Bettendorf before leaving Iowa for Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the player's actions, {{the newly}} {{reformed}} Etrurian Army then continues through either the snowy tundras of Ilia and its many mercenary groups on Bern's contract, <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Sacae plains where nomad tribes have allied with Bern. Both paths ultimately take the Etrurian Army to Bern's borders, where Roy discovers a shrine housing the Binding Blade, a powerful weapon that rules {{over the other}} eight Divine Weapons. Combined with the Fire Emblem, Roy is granted its incredible power and wields the Binding Blade in the final assault on Bern's capital. Zephiel is eventually killed by the Etrurian Army and his Divine Weapon is taken from him, but the war does not end with his death. Before his last battle, Zephiel had sent his remaining forces to gather somewhere in Elibe. The eight Divine Weapons suddenly emit a light that leads the Lycian Army to this location: an ancient temple that had long ago been built by the dragons.|$|E

5|$|Diseases {{which can}} be {{transmitted}} from one organism to another are known as infectious diseases, and the causative biological agent involved {{is known as a}} pathogen. The process by which the pathogen is introduced into the body is known as inoculation, and the organism it affects is known as a biological host. When the pathogen establishes itself in a step known as colonization, it can result in an infection, consequently harming the host directly <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> harmful substances called toxins it can produce. This results in the various symptoms and signs characteristic of an infectious disease like pneumonia or diphtheria.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.|$|E
5|$|During {{an action}} on 1 March 1968, {{in the early}} morning several Squadron One cutters were {{involved}} in the interdiction and destruction of four North Vietnamese trawlers attempting to smuggle arms and ammunition into South Vietnam at different locations. This co-ordinated attempt by the North Vietnamese was met by various elements of TF115; including U.S. Navy aircraft and vessels, RVN junks, U.S. Air Force aircraft, and U.S. Army helicopters. In addition, there were several Owasco-class cutter cutters from Coast Guard Squadron Three– , , and – as well as Point Grey, Point Hudson, and Point Welcome from Squadron One. As a result of this action, three North Vietnamese trawlers were destroyed and a fourth was turned back before it could reach the coast. After this action the incidence of smuggling by trawler was decreased and Communist forces had to resort to shipments along the Ho Chi Minh trail <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> port of Sihanoukville in Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) {{established}} ten {{camps in}} Moshannon State Forest, and ten in Elk State Forest. The {{young men of}} the CCC planted trees, blazed new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which {{continued to be a}} problem. In 1938 a fast-moving fire in the Elk State Forest, north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters. The CCC also built structures and established or improved many of the state parks, including Parker Dam and S. B. Elliott State Parks on the western Quehanna plateau. The United States' entry into World War II ended the CCC, and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942.

5|$|From its {{formation}} in 1936, Coastal Command {{did not receive}} the support it required {{to be an effective}} naval air service. In September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland beginning the war in Europe. The Command's position was comfortable {{for the first nine months}} of the war, the period known as the Phoney War. German submarines were not able to reach the Atlantic unless they undertook a dangerous transit journey through the North Sea and around Britain's northern waters <b>or</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> English Channel, which was guarded by the Royal and French Navies. The powerful French Navy was responsible for covering half of the Atlantic shipping routes and thus contributed half of the Allied forces available.|$|E

Other changes come {{as a direct result of}} human activities; deforestation, the ploughing of ancient grasslands, the diversion and damming of rivers, the draining of marshland and the dredging of the seabed.
