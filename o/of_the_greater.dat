5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar greater yellow-headed vulture in several ways. It is smaller and is less heavily built than the greater yellow-headed vulture {{and has a}} shorter, thinner tail. The plumage is browner than the greater yellow-headed vulture's dark, glossy black plumage. Its legs are lighter in color, and its head is more orange-tinged than the more yellow head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> yellow-headed vulture. Its flight is also less steady than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> yellow-headed vulture. The lesser yellow-headed vulture also prefers to live in savannas, {{as opposed to the}} preferred forest habitat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> yellow-headed vulture.|$|E

5|$|Bee-eater nests may be raided by {{rats and}} snakes, and the adults are hunted by {{birds of prey}} such as the Levant sparrowhawk.

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} was to evaluate long-term trends in morbidity and mortality in a national cohort of adult patients with a systemic right ventricle due to the atrial switch for transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries or congenitally corrected transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries. MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study from a baseline of 18 years, including life table and Kaplan–Meier analysis for probability of death/transplant, arrhythmia, surgical or percutaneous intervention, and permanent pacemaker insertion. ResultsA total of 97 adults with transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries–atrial switch (Mustard procedure in 80 /Senning procedure in 17) and 32 adults with congenitally corrected transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries survived. <b>The</b> median ages at latest follow-up were 29 and 34 years, respectively. At 40 years of follow-up, freedom from death or transplant was 0. 90 for those with transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries–atrial switch and 0. 84 for those with congenitally corrected transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries (P = . 833). Freedom from arrhythmia at 40 years of follow-up was 0. 51 for those with transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries–atrial switch and 0. 93 for those with congenitally corrected transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries (P = . 007). Freedom from intervention at 40 years of follow-up was 0. 33 for those with transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries–atrial switch after initial repair and 0. 53 for those with congenitally corrected transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries (P = . 938). Freedom from pacemaker insertion at 40 years of follow-up was 0. 77 for those with transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries–atrial switch and 0. 62 for those with congenitally corrected transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries (P = . 161). ConclusionsThose patients who survive to adulthood with a systemic right ventricle experience low mortality and good functional status up to 40 years of age. However, {{there is a substantial}} burden of atrial tachyarrhythmia, and this occurs significantly earlier in those with transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> arteries–atrial switch. Management of atrial tachyarrhythmia, along with systemic right ventricular dysfunction and systemic atrioventricular valve regurgitation, {{is likely to be the}} major challenge for this group <b>of</b> patients over <b>the</b> next decade...|$|R
