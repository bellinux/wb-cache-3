5|$|A {{version of}} deep-fried butter <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> debuted at the Iowa State Fair 2011, which was {{prepared}} using frozen butter that is dipped in a honey- and cinnamon- flavored batter, deep-fried until browned, and then {{topped with a}} confectioner's sugar glaze. This concoction <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> was invented by Larry Fyfe, an entrepreneur and concessionaire at the fair. Versions at the Iowa State Fair have also been prepared and served formed as balls. Deep-fried butter has also been served <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> at the State Fair of Texas.|$|E

50|$|The sticks are bundled {{and taken}} {{in one hand}} that touches the table/ground. The release creates a {{circular}} jumble. Now one stick after another should be taken up without moving/touching others. The take away could be by hand, possibly through pressing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick's</b> tip or if one has already picked up <b>a</b> special <b>stick</b> (Mikado/Mandarin), {{it could be used}} as a helper, possibly to throw up another stick.|$|R

5|$|Better Off Ted is an American satirical sitcom series, {{created by}} Victor Fresco (known for his other {{television}} series Andy Richter Controls the Universe and the short-lived shows Life <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>Stick</b> and The Trouble with Normal) who {{also served as}} the show's executive producer. The series ran on the ABC network from March 18, 2009, to January 26, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The pied butcherbird often perches on a fencepost, stump or branch while {{foraging}} for prey. It generally pounces on victims on {{the ground}} and eats them there. At times, it may hop or run along hunting ground-based food, and occasionally seize flying insects. It generally forages alone, or occasionally in pairs. The pied butcherbird has been observed hunting collaboratively with the Australian hobby, either picking off common starlings or rufous-throated honeyeaters disturbed by the larger hobby, or flushing out small birds from bushes, which the larger bird then hunts. The pied butcherbird sometimes stores food items by impaling them <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> or on barbed wire, or shoving them in a nook or crevice.|$|E

5|$|The {{attempts}} {{to relieve the}} citadel ended in farce. Badly-drilled reinforcements sent by the Habsburgs fled in fear of the Ottomans, and their {{attempts to}} re-board their boats at Solin Bay caused many vessels to sink. Niccolo dalla Torre and the papal commissioner managed to escape. Kružić himself– who had left the fortress {{to make contact with}} the reinforcements- was captured and executed; the sight of his head <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> overwhelmed the remaining defenders of Klis, who were now willing to give up the fortress in return for safe passage north. After Kružić's death, and with a lack of water supplies, the Klis defenders finally surrendered to the Ottomans in exchange for their freedom, on 12 March 1537. Many of the citizens fled the town, while the Uskoci retreated to the city of Senj, where they continued fighting the Ottoman army.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E

50|$|In Puerto Rico, a barbecued type of pincho {{is served}} by street vendors.

The meats and the bread are {{skewered}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wooden <b>stick,</b> rather than served <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plate; the <b>stick</b> is grabbed from the bottom and the contents are eaten.|$|R
25|$|Fentanyl {{lozenges}} (Actiq) are a solid {{formulation of}} fentanyl citrate <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> {{in the form}} of a lollipop that dissolves slowly in the mouth for transmucosal absorption. These lozenges are intended for opioid-tolerant individuals and are effective in treating breakthrough cancer pain. It has also been used for breakthrough pain for patients with nonmalignant (not cancer related) pain, but this application is controversial. The unit is a berry-flavoured lozenge <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> swabbed on the mucosal surfaces inside the mouth—inside of the cheeks, under and on the tongue and gums—to release the fentanyl quickly into the system. It is most effective when the lozenge is consumed within 15 minutes. About 25 % of the drug is absorbed through the oral mucosa, resulting in a fast onset of action, and the rest is swallowed and absorbed in the small intestine, acting more slowly. The lozenge is less effective and acts more slowly if swallowed as a whole, as despite good absorbance from the small intestine there is extensive first-pass metabolism, leading to an oral bioavailability of about 33 % as opposed to 50 % when used correctly, (25 % via the mouth mucosa and 25 % via the gut).|$|E
25|$|During this period, Frank Epperston started {{marketing}} frozen ice <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> {{and formed}} the Popsicle Corporation. Six months after Popsicle received its patent in August 1924, Good Humor sued Popsicle Corporation, and by October 1925 the parties {{settled out of}} court. Popsicle agreed to pay Good Humor a licence fee to manufacture what was called frozen suckers from ice and sherbet products. Good Humor reserved the right to manufacture these products from ice cream, frozen custard, and the like.|$|E
25|$|A {{second opinion}} was sought and {{provided}} a month later by a commission under Professor Dr. Janez Milčinski.

The Yugoslav secret police and military intelligence reportedly concluded from this that Martinović's injuries had indeed most likely been self-inflicted.|$|E

25|$|Century eggs can {{be eaten}} without further preparation, {{on their own}} or as a side dish. As an hors d'œuvre, the Cantonese wrap chunks of this egg with slices of pickled ginger root (sometimes sold <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>stick</b> as street food). A Shanghainese recipe mixes chopped century eggs with chilled tofu. In Taiwan, it is popular to eat century eggs by slicing them, and placed on top of cold tofu with katsuobushi, soy sauce, and sesame oil in a style similar to Japanese hiyayakko. A {{variation}} of this recipe common in northern China is to slice century eggs over chilled silken (soft) tofu, adding liberal quantities of shredded young ginger and chopped spring onions as a topping, and then drizzling light soy sauce and sesame oil over the dish, to taste. They are also used in a dish called old-and-fresh eggs, where chopped century eggs are combined with (or used to top) an omelet made with fresh eggs. The century eggs may also be cut into chunks and stir fried with vegetables, which is most commonly found in Taiwanese cuisine.|$|E
