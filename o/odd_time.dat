Jazz fusion often uses mixed meters, <b>odd</b> <b>time</b> signatures, syncopation, complex chords, and harmonies.|$|E

500|$|Soundgarden {{utilized}} alternative tunings and <b>odd</b> <b>time</b> signatures {{on several}} of the album's songs. [...] "Spoonman", [...] "Black Hole Sun", [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] and [...] "Kickstand" [...] were performed in drop D tuning while [...] "Mailman" [...] and [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] employed CGDGBE tuning. Some songs used more unorthodox tunings: [...] "My Wave" [...] and [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] are both in an EEBBBB tuning. [...] "Head Down" [...] and [...] "Half" [...] used CGCGGE tuning and [...] "Like Suicide" [...] is performed in DGDGBC tuning. Soundgarden's use of <b>odd</b> <b>time</b> signatures was varied as well; [...] "My Wave" [...] uses 5/4, [...] "Fell On Black Days" [...] is in 6/4, [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is played in 15/8, [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] and [...] "Spoonman" [...] both alternate between 7/4 and 4/4 sections, and [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is in 4/4 with instrumental sections in 9/4. Thayil has said that Soundgarden usually did not consider the time signature of a song until after the band had written it, {{and said that the}} use of odd meters was [...] "a total accident".|$|E
500|$|The band stated at {{the time}} that it wanted to {{experiment}} with other sounds, which included Shepherd and Cornell playing mandolin and mandola in the song [...] "Ty Cobb". This experimentation can be heard to a lesser degree on Superunknown. Soundgarden used alternative tunings and <b>odd</b> <b>time</b> signatures on several of the album's songs. For example, [...] "Never the Machine Forever" [...] uses a time signature of 9/8. [...] "Pretty Noose" [...] and [...] "Burden in My Hand" [...] were written in C-G-C-G-G-E tuning.|$|E
500|$|On {{the opening}} song, [...] "Rusty Cage", Thayil uses a wah pedal as an audio filter, {{producing}} an unusual guitar sound. In describing the song's guitar riff {{he said that}} it [...] "almost sounds backward". Soundgarden utilized alternative tunings and <b>odd</b> <b>time</b> signatures on several of the album's songs. On [...] "Rusty Cage", [...] "Holy Water", and [...] "Searching with My Good Eye Closed", the bottom E string is tuned down to B. On [...] "Mind Riot" [...] every string is tuned to one of several E's. Soundgarden's use of odd-meter time signatures was varied as well. Thayil said that he didn't [...] "push for weird time signatures", but rather [...] "push to get the quirkiness out of things".|$|E

500|$|Peart {{is noted}} for his {{distinctive}} in-concert drum solos, characterized by exotic percussion instruments and long, intricate passages in <b>odd</b> <b>time</b> signatures. His complex arrangements sometimes result in complete separation of upper- and lower-limb patterns; an ostinato dubbed [...] "The Waltz" [...] {{is a typical}} example. [...] His solos have been featured on every live album released by the band. On the early live albums (All the World's a Stage & Exit...Stage Left), the drum solo was included {{as part of a}} song. On all subsequent live albums through , the drum solo has been included as a separate track. The Clockwork Angels Tour album includes three short solos instead of a single long one: two interludes played during other songs and one standalone. Similarly, the R40 Live album includes two short solos performed as interludes.|$|E
500|$|The team {{began searching}} for a genre {{on which to base}} the soundtrack. They {{initially}} sought inspiration from the music of Richard Wagner, who was admired by Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler. After studying Wagner's work, however, the team discovered that it didn't necessarily fit with the game's tone. They then searched for a style of music that would suit the Nazis, ultimately selecting distortion. [...] "There's lots of analogue distortion types, there's all sorts of different pedals and valves and things that are really breaking up," [...] said Gordon. They also took inspiration from 1960s music, using analogue equipment such as tape machines and reel-to-reel machines. Gordon has said that the soundtrack is [...] "a tribute to all things guitar". In collaboration with each other, the team of musicians composed over six hours of music which scores the game. Matthies said, [...] "A lot of the score features <b>odd</b> <b>time</b> signatures yet it's all very groovy." ...|$|E
500|$|In polymeters {{typically}} used by Meshuggah, the guitars might play in odd meters such as 5/16 or 17/16, while drums play in 4/4. One particular example of Haake's use of polymeter is 4/4 against 23/16 bimeter, {{in which he}} keeps the hi-hat and ride cymbal in 4/4 time but uses the snare and double bass drums in 23/16 time. On [...] "Rational Gaze" [...] (from Nothing), Haake plays simple 4/4 time, hitting the snare on each third beat, for 16 bars. At the same time, the guitars and bass are playing same quarter notes, albeit in a different time signature; eventually both sides meet up again at the 64th beat. Hagström notes about the polymeters, [...] "We've never really been into the <b>odd</b> <b>time</b> signatures we get accused of using. Everything we do is based around a 4/4 core. It's just that we arrange parts differently around that center {{to make it seem}} like something else is going on." ...|$|E

500|$|Much {{like the}} band's {{previous}} work Astraea is considered primarily as mathcore. This is {{displayed in the}} theoretical complexity of their music, such as <b>odd</b> <b>time</b> signatures like 9/13, polyrhythmic drumming and use of dynamics, akin to bands such as Converge, Radiohead and Sigur Rós. Their sound {{is seen as a}} [...] "stylistic schism" [...] between [...] "Dillinger Escape Plan-esque tech-metalcore, grandstanding prog rock and modish synthesised pop" [...] and fusing aesthetics from shoegaze, space rock, ambient, black metal, hardcore punk, jazz, pop, progressive rock and techno. The band is noted for their two vocalists who utilise both screaming and singing vocals, and the album is described as featuring more 'clean vocals' than previous albums. The band's vocal diversity is said to: [...] "immediately creates a rich and textured sonic world". Eva has been seen as pushing her vocals [...] "further than ever before, displaying extremity, contrasted with canorous beauty", with her singing voice being compared to the dream pop stylings of Grimes and Cocteau Twins. When Eva Spence has been asked about the album's musical approach, is much more 'hard-hitting' and 'more direct' than previous albums. She was quoted saying that the album is much more accessible than their previous albums: [...] "You can get your teeth into it much quicker, people who didn't have patience before with our music before will be into this record. It's still technical, but we're using the mathy bits more sparingly." ...|$|E

They were: With Children at the Seaside (1972), Exams at Any <b>Odd</b> <b>Time</b> (1974), Problem with Many Unknown Quantities (1977) and The Porcupines' War (1979). The first three films in this series used a formula of two separate plotlines in a film. All these films found an enormous audience.|$|E
