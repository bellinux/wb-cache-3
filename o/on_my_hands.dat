500|$|The single's lyrics cover {{a variety}} of issues, ranging from [...] "body image, class division, an unhappy {{marriage}} and alcoholism". [...] "Ugly" [...] opens with Fantasia narrating a tragic story about {{a woman with a}} “picket fence, two-car garage and a man that she don’t love”. The narrative's rural setting is established through the lyrics, “Gimme that rusty old grain silo”. Fantasia advocates for female empowerment and explores expectations regarding beauty with lyrics like: [...] "With dirt <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> and scrapes on my knees/Feeling like nothing can wash it off clean/Tell your girls it’s a beautiful thing/Just trust me/It’s far from ugly.” The lyrics also feature the importance of love, with Fantasia singing, “Thank you for that good good man who loves me.” Alex Mcpherson interpreted Fantasia's delivery of the lyric “Give me good food that sticks to my bones” as incorporating gospel elements into the song. [...] "Ugly" [...] ends with Fantasia discussing her life immediately after winning the third season of American Idol.|$|E
500|$|Thomas O'Leary, the {{wireless}} operator for ML 446, recalled {{the ferocity of}} incoming German fire, stating"One commando was remarking how pretty the tracer fire, red and green, was. A moment later one blew {{the back of his}} head out. I was down below with my tin hat because by now the bullets were going through (the boat) and out the other side. If I wanted to get about I had to crawl <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> and knees and I was lucky nothing came through at my level. We couldn't get in (to the objective) and all over a sudden the wounded started coming down. By then all our guns had jammed and most of the other ships were on fire."ML 177, the launch that had successfully taken off some of the crew from Campbeltown, was sunk on her way out of the estuary. [...] ML 269, another torpedo-armed boat, had the unenviable task of moving up and down the river at high speed to draw German fire away from the landings. Soon after passing Campbeltown it was hit and its steering damaged. It took ten minutes to repair the steering. They turned and started in the other direction, opening fire on an armed trawler in passing. Return fire from the trawler set their engine on fire.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was open}} {{speculation}} that Story of My Life was a roman à clef novel {{when it first}} appeared; to New York Magazines questions [...] "Is it real? Did it happen?" [...] McInerney replied, [...] "I'm anticipating some {{of that kind of}} speculation, but I'm utterly confident of not having any lawsuits <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands.</b> The book is a fully imagined work of fiction. On the other hand, it's not to say that I didn't make use of … That's why I live in New York. Mine is not an autonomous imagination." ...|$|E

2500|$|We'd {{decided to}} write a Christmas song and I {{wanted to make it}} reflect a British family Christmas. Economically, the country was up the creek. The miners had been on strike, along with the grave-diggers, the bakers and almost {{everybody}} else. I think people wanted something to cheer them up – and so did I. That's why I came up with the line [...] "Look to the future now, it's only just begun". Once I got the line, [...] "Does your Granny always tell you that the old ones are the best", I knew I'd got a right cracker <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2012, Tyler {{announced}} that he would be leaving American Idol after two seasons, with a statement saying, [...] "After some long... hard... thoughts... I've decided it's time for me to let go of my mistress 'American Idol' before she boils my rabbit. I strayed from my first love, AEROSMITH, and I’m back— but instead of begging <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands</b> and knees, I got two fists in the air and I’m kicking the door open with my band. The next few years are going to be dedicated to kicking some serious ass— the ultimate in auditory takeover..." [...] However, the reports suggest that Tyler was dumped by the American Idol bosses. Tyler has since indicated that his troubles with his bandmates were the primary reason he signed up to do American Idol. He was replaced by Keith Urban.|$|E
2500|$|Kamal Hasan {{was close}} friend of Khanna and Kamal quoted in an {{interview}} [...] "He probably hadn’t been to a public theatre since he became a star. When we reached, things were okay. He enjoyed the mediocre film (The Swarm) thoroughly and refused to leave until the end titles. That’s when I panicked. This was Rajesh Khanna, {{the star of the}} millennium. If audiences got to know he was present there would be a stampede and blood <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>hands.</b> But Mr Khanna refused to listen. He stayed on till the end. The inevitable happened after the show. All hell broke loose as audiences realised he was there. I became Rajesh Khanna’s bodyguard and security officer as I took him through the crowd. His shirt was torn, but he was enjoying himself thoroughly. He giggled and chuckled like a child." [...] Khanna starred in remakes of 3 films of Kamal and in return Kamal acted in 2 remakes of Khanna's films.|$|E
