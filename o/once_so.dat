5|$|Hoping to {{establish}} his credentials {{once and for all}} as an expert field naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton spent several years of the controversy working diligently on his two-volume work Life-Histories of Northern Animals, which was published in 1909. After an enlarged edition of the book was published as Lives of Game Animals, Seton was ironically awarded the Burroughs Medal in 1927, a prize named after the venerable naturalist who had <b>once</b> <b>so</b> criticized Seton's work.|$|E
5|$|Fifty-six {{individuals}} {{have served as}} governor, four of whom served non-consecutive terms, totaling 60 distinct terms; the official numbering only lists each governor <b>once,</b> <b>so</b> there have officially been fifty-six governors. This numbering includes one acting governor: the lieutenant governor who filled the vacancy after {{the resignation of the}} governor, under the 1777 State Constitution. The list does not include people who have acted as governor when the governor was out of state, such as Lt. Gov. Timothy L. Woodruff during Theodore Roosevelt's vice presidential campaign in 1900, or Acting Speaker of the New York State Assembly Moses M. Weinstein, who acted as governor for ten days in 1968 while the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the senate majority leader were out of the state, attending the Republican National Convention in Miami, Florida.|$|E
5|$|The bromide anion is {{not very}} toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8milligrams. However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the {{membrane}} of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as bromism. Bromide has an elimination half-life of 9 to 12 days, {{which can lead to}} excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was <b>once</b> <b>so</b> common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare. Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in somnolence, psychosis, seizures and delirium.|$|E

5|$|Último Guerrero is {{the current}} NWA World Historic Middleweight Champion, having {{defeated}} the previous champion, La Sombra, on August 31, 2015 in Puebla, Puebla, Mexico. Último Guerrero is the seventh overall champion, with no wrestler holding the championship more than <b>once</b> <b>so</b> far. The championship has not been declared vacant since its creation in 2010 and has been defended in both Mexico and in Japan. Volador Jr. was the shortest reigning champion, holding the title for 45 days in early 2012, while La Sombra currently holds {{the record for the}} longest reign, 953 days or over two-and-a-half years. When La Sombra defeated Dragón Rojo Jr. to win the championship during the Fantastica Mania 2013 show in Bunkyo, Tokyo, it marked the first time the championship changed hands outside of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to find answers, Vincent goes to the town of Nibelheim where Lucrecia studied Omega and Chaos. Whilst at Lucrecia's {{research}} lab, Vincent is ambushed by Rosso the Crimson, who steals the Protomateria but is prevented from killing Vincent by the arrival of Yuffie. As they return to the WRO headquarters, they find that Deepground has launched an assault on the base. However, Deepground member Shelke the Transparent has been captured by the WRO, and reveals that she is synaptically interconnected to Lucrecia's memories, thus allowing the WRO to complete Lucrecia's research on Omega. Shelke's sister, Shalua Rui, a high ranking scientist in the WRO, soon discovers that Omega is a WEAPON, which activates when the Planet senses that it is in mortal danger (like the WEAPONs it activated in the original Final Fantasy VII). Omega's function is to absorb the Lifestream from the Planet and then move to another planet, leaving the inhabitants behind to die. Deepground plans to slaughter a huge number of people at <b>once</b> <b>so</b> as to 'trick' the planet into activating Omega prematurely.|$|E
5|$|The first {{winner of}} the award was Willie Mays, {{and the most recent}} winner is Anthony Rizzo. None of the winners has {{received}} the award more than <b>once,</b> <b>so</b> far. The first pitcher to win the award was Phil Niekro in 1980, and the first catcher to win the award was Gary Carter in 1989. To date, Clemente's former teammate Willie Stargell and Andrew McCutchen are the only members of the Pittsburgh Pirates to win the award. Stargell won his award in 1974, and McCutchen won in 2015. The Pirates themselves have been wearing Clemente-era throwback uniforms in recent years on Roberto Clemente Day, which is the day they play the game that they present their nominee to MLB. In 2014, for the first time, the award was awarded to two players instead of one. The award was awarded to Paul Konerko and Jimmy Rollins.|$|E

25|$|Budu is a salted (fermented) anchovy sauce eaten {{mainly as}} {{flavouring}} with rice, grilled fish and vegetables/salads (ulam). A bit of lime juice, hot chilis and shallots are added on for taste. Also, tempoyak (fermented durian) or fresh durian is added for good measure. <b>Once</b> <b>so</b> combined, the purple-brownish condiment has {{a blend of}} salty and sour taste. Sometimes, Budu is used in cookings {{as part of the}} ingredient.|$|E

25|$|The {{relatively}} short, stiff, {{coarse hairs}} of the pig are called bristles, and were <b>once</b> <b>so</b> {{commonly used in}} paintbrushes that in 1946 the Australian Government launched Operation Pig Bristle. In May 1946, {{in response to a}} shortage of pig bristles for paintbrushes to paint houses in the post-World War II construction boom, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flew in 28 short tons of pig bristles from China, their only commercially available source at the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} and {{symmetric}} plane drawing of the Petersen graph, as a pentagram within a pentagon, has five crossings. However, {{this is not the}} best drawing for minimizing crossings; there exists another drawing (shown in the figure) with only two crossings. Thus, the Petersen graph has crossing number 2. Each edge in this drawing is crossed at most <b>once,</b> <b>so</b> the Petersen graph is 1-planar. On a torus the Petersen graph can be drawn without edge crossings; it therefore has orientable genus 1.|$|E
25|$|The {{ultimatum}} {{game is a}} game {{in economic}} experiments. The first player (the proposer) conditionally receives a sum of money and proposes how to divide the sum between the proposer and the other player. The second player (the responder) chooses to either accept or reject this proposal. If the second player accepts, the money is split according to the proposal. If the second player rejects, neither player receives any money. The game is typically played only <b>once</b> <b>so</b> that reciprocation is not an issue.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{formulation}} of the cycle double cover conjecture asks whether every bridgeless undirected graph has a collection of cycles such that each edge of the graph is contained in exactly two of the cycles. The requirement that the graph be bridgeless is an obvious necessary condition for such a set of cycles to exist, because a bridge cannot belong to any cycle. A collection of cycles satisfying {{the condition of the}} cycle double cover conjecture is called a cycle double cover. Some graphs such as cycle graphs and bridgeless cactus graphs can only be covered by using the same cycle more than <b>once,</b> <b>so</b> this sort of duplication is allowed in a cycle double cover.|$|E

25|$|Test {{audience}} reactions led {{to several}} minor changes before {{the film was}} released. Originally, {{it was clear that}} Carmen was torn between Rico and Zander. Test audiences, regardless of gender, strongly felt that a woman could not love two men at <b>once,</b> <b>so</b> scenes which portrayed this were cut. These audiences also felt it was immoral for Carmen to choose a career ahead of being loyal to Rico, to the extent that many commented that, in so doing, Carmen should have been the one to die instead of Dizzy. While admitting {{it may have been a}} bad commercial decision not to change the film to accommodate this, the directors did cut a scene from after Zander's death where Carmen and Rico kiss, which the audience believed made the previous betrayal even more immoral.|$|E
