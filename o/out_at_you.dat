500|$|Although the {{graphics}} were widely praised for their details, the game's inconsistent frame rate and intense distance fog were generally criticized. Peer Schneider of IGN said that, unlike its predecessor, Seeds of Evil [...] "forgoes framerate for detail so often [...] some gamers will definitely {{be put off}} by the choppiness." [...] The music and sound effects were highlighted positively. GameSpot said that the soundtrack is [...] "well suited to the game and never intrusive", while Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground described it as [...] "suspenseful, dynamic and always adrenaline charged." [...] Similarly, Tim Weaver of N64 Magazine credited the music for being [...] "dramatically scored, with strings, tom toms, bass lines and nerve-juddering screeches as enemies spring <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> from all angles." [...] He also remarked that the soundtrack's loop was well disguised.|$|E
500|$|Sylvester detects the {{influence}} of late works by Titian in other aspects, especially in the deep and rich colouring, and Velázquez's portrayals of Philip IV, such as Portrait of Philip IV in Fraga, and agrees with identification of pastels of Degas as a source. He believes Bacon borrowed from Degas the use of parallel heavy folds {{to create the illusion}} of what Degas described as [...] "shuttering", as seen in the earlier artist's After the Bath, Woman drying herself. Sylvester makes a further direct link between the folds and the transparent veil in Titian's Portrait of Cardinal Filippo Archinto. He believes the folds serve to [...] "push the viewer back", creating a distance from the subject, an effect he sees as similar to the separation between an orchestra and setting; others view the folds as more closely resembling the bars of a prison. Sylvester describes them as an accentuation of background verticals into stripes that are made to appear as if they pass through the sitter. In his series of books [...] "Interviews with Francis Bacon", he asked Bacon why he found the effect so poignant. The artist replied, [...] "Well, it means that the sensation doesn't come straight <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> but slides slowly and gently through the gaps." ...|$|E
2500|$|Don Gulbrandsen, {{the author}} of Edward Sheriff Curtis: Visions of the First Americans, {{put it this way}} in his {{introductory}} essay on Curtis’s life: “The faces stare <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> images seemingly from an ancient time and from a place far, far away…Yet as you gaze at the faces the humanity becomes apparent, lives filled with dignity but also sadness and loss, representatives of a world that has all but disappeared from our planet.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Girls Aloud {{worked closely}} with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and {{production}} team Xenomania throughout their career. Xenomania produced all of Girls Aloud's albums and singles, excluding nine songs from their debut album Sound of the Underground, the charity single [...] "Walk This Way" [...] and two songs from Ten. Of Higgins and Xenomania, Girls Aloud's former manager Louis Walsh says, [...] "He just makes great songs for radio. They just jump <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> and stay in your brain." [...] In {{a review of the}} group's debut single [...] "Sound of the Underground", The Guardians Alexis Petridis exclaimed it [...] "proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn't make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture." [...] In response to Girls Aloud's debut album, Jacqueline Hodges of BBC Music said that [...] "Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band {{would play}} [...] "Spoonman" [...] while on its 1993 tour with Neil Young. With hype {{building}} around the band's upcoming album Superunknown, Soundgarden released the single {{a month before}} the album's release. The song was released as a single in 1994 with a previously unreleased B-side titled [...] "Exit Stonehenge". On the choice of [...] "Spoonman" [...] as the album's first single, Shepherd called it a [...] "great first choice," [...] adding that [...] "it just jumps <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> instantly." [...] Shepherd said, [...] "You know how you listen to a record and there is one song that literally seems to leap out of the speakers—well, [...] "Spoonman" [...] did that to me." [...] Shortly after the single's release, the song became widely popular, reaching high positions on rock charts. The song peaked at number three on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number nine on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. At the 1995 Grammy Awards, [...] "Spoonman" [...] received the award for Best Metal Performance.|$|E
2500|$|On January 3, 2006, Bruce Watzman of the National Mining Association, {{interviewed by}} Tom Foreman for Anderson Cooper 360, {{was asked whether}} any of the {{violations}} [...] "leaps <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> as endangering miners' lives?" [...] Watzman explained {{that they could be}} [...] "paperwork errors [...] reporting errors. A lot of violations, but many of which were not significant to really impact miner safety." [...] By contrast, a report in Christian Science Monitor on January 6, 2006, quotes McAteer as saying [...] "Sago raises red flags for mine oversight ... If you have a widespread practice of S violations {{over an extended period of}} time like we have here, it suggests that you've got much more serious problems than just paperwork violations". Relying on MSHA records, Ellen Smith, the editor of Mine Safety and Health News, comments on her publication's website in an article, Sago Mine Facts that [...] "Sago's accident rate was 17.04 for 2005, with 16 miners and contractors injured on the job. Sago’s accident rate was 15.90 in 2004 when the national average was 5.66. [...] "Compare this accident rate to another small mine in West Virginia, Kingston Mining No. 1 Mine, which had an accident rate of 1.21 in 2005." ...|$|E

60|$|Murray's fall {{had been}} more Luciferian, if less spectacular. All the pretty, tiny little kickshaws of Gotham had once been his.

But {{there had been an}} awful row about something, and the prince had been escorted to the door by the butler, which, in said avenue, is equivalent to the impact of the avuncular shoe. A weak Prince Hal, without inheritance or sword, he drifted downward to meet his humorless Falstaff, and to pick the crusts of the streets with him.|$|E

We saw upward {{of a million}} cats in Bermuda, but the people are very abstemious {{in the matter of}} dogs. Two or three nights we prowled the country far and wide, and never once were accosted by a dog. It is a great privilege to visit such a land. The cats were no offense when properly distributed, but when piled they obstructed travel.|$|E
60|$|We {{went very}} slowly. The wood got thicker and thicker the farther {{we got into}} it. There were bushes that were {{difficult}} to push through, and long branches, covered with thorns, that reached <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> and tore at you when you tried to get away. And soon it was quite dark, so dark that I could see nothing, not even Peter, though he was so close. We went slower and slower, and the darkness was full of queer noises. From time to time Peter would stop, and I would run to him and put my nose in his hand. At first he patted me, {{but after a while}} he did not pat me any more, but just gave me his hand to lick, as if it was too much for him to lift it. I think he was getting very tired. He was quite a small boy and not strong, and we had walked a long way.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is {{the object}} of supper?" [...] cried Buck, furiously. [...] "Isn't it obvious? This {{military}} science is mere common sense. The object of a street is to lead from one place to another; therefore all streets join; therefore street fighting is quite a peculiar thing. You advanced into that hive of streets as if you were advancing into an open plain where you could see everything. Instead of that, you were advancing into the bowels of a fortress, with streets pointing at you, streets turning on you, streets jumping <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> and all {{in the hands of the}} enemy. Do you know what Portobello Road is? It is the only point on your journey where two side streets run up opposite each other. Wayne massed his men on the two sides, and when he had let enough of your line go past, cut it in two like a worm. Don't you see what would have saved you?" ...|$|E

60|$|If the lynx {{is a big}} one, {{and very}} hungry, as he {{generally}} is in winter, you may get some unpleasant impressions of him in another way when you venture far from your fire. His eyes blaze <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> from the darkness, just two big glowing spots, which are all you see, and which disappear at your first motion. Then as you strain your eyes, and watch and listen, you feel the coals upon you again from another place; and there they are, under a bush on your left, creeping closer and blazing deep red. They disappear suddenly as the lynx turns his head, only to reappear and fascinate you from another point. So he plays with you {{as if you were}} a great mouse, creeping closer all the time, swishing his stub tail fiercely to lash himself up to the courage point of springing. But his movements are so still and shadowy that unless he follows you as you back away to the fire, and so comes within the circle of light, the chances are that you will never see him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, then, you see,' said Herbert over a hasty mouthful, {{and turning}} again to his victim--'then you see, {{when you were}} just in the pink of {{condition}} to credit any idle tale you heard, then I came in. What, with the least impetus, can one NOT see by moonlight? The howl of a dog turns the midnight into a Brocken; the branch of a tree stoops <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> like a Beelzebub crusted with gadflies. I'd, mind you, sipped of the deadly old Huguenot too. I'd listened to your innocent prattle about the child kicking his toes out on death's cupboard door; what more likely thing in the world, then, than that with that moon, in that packed air, I should have swallowed the bait whole, and seen Sabathier in every crevice of your skin? I don't say there wasn't any resemblance; {{it was for the}} moment extraordinary; it was even when you were here the other night distinctly arresting. But now (poor old Grisel, I'm nearly done) all I want to say is this: that if we had the [...] "foxy old roue" [...] here now, and Grisel played Paris between the three of us, she'd hand over the apple not to you but to me.' ...|$|E
60|$|His {{tremendous}} {{legs are}} his only weapons, and his kick is almost, if not quite, {{equal to that}} of a horse. Possessing enormous feet, with two toes on each, the horny points of which can cut and rip like cold chisels, he rushes at an adversary and kicks, or hits out, straightforward, like a prize-fighter. No unarmed man on earth could stand long before a furious male ostrich without being killed. But there are one or two weak points about him, which abate somewhat the danger of his attack. In the first place his power lies only in his mighty legs, the thighs of which--blue-grey and destitute of feathers-- are like two shoulders of mutton. With his beak he can do nothing, and his long neck is so weak that if you can only lay hold of it and pull his head to the ground you are comparatively safe, for he cannot kick effectively in that position, and devotes all his energies, when thus caught, to useless attempts to pull his head out of your grasp. But, then, how are you to get hold of that neck--the root of which stands nearly as high as your own head--in the face of two claws that go like battering-rams wrought by lightning? As well might you attempt to lay hold of a prize-fighter's nose while his active fists are darting <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Have {{you been}} {{down the river}} before? That's Gravesend. I see the captain {{is getting ready to}} anchor. So, I suppose the tide has nearly run out. If this wind holds, we shall be fairly <b>out</b> <b>at</b> sea when <b>you</b> get up tomorrow.|$|R

60|$|Then, {{when the}} path appears again--a winding path, that descends rapidly--you {{gradually}} enter {{on a new}} scene. Old horses startle you, scrambling into perilous situations, to pick dainty bits by the hillside; sheep, fettered by the fore and hind leg, hobble away desperately as you advance. Suddenly, you discern a small strip of beach shut in snugly between protecting rocks. A spring bubbles down from an inland valley; while not far off, an old stone well collects the water into a calm, clear pool. Sturdy little cottages, built of rough granite, and thickly thatched, stand near you, with gulls' and cormorants' eggs set in their loop-holed windows for ornament; great white sections of fish hang thickly together on their walls to dry, looking more like many legs of many dirty duck trousers, than anything else; pigsties are hard-by the cottages, either formed by the Cromlech stones of the Druids, or excavated like caves {{in the side of}} the hill. Down on the beach, where the rough old fishing-boats lie, the sand is entirely formed by countless multitudes of the tiniest, fairy-like shells, often as small as a pin's head, and all exquisitely tender in colour and wonderfully varied in form. Up the lower and flatter parts of the hills above, fishing nets are stretched to dry. While you stop to look forth over the quiet, simple scene, wild little children peep <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> in astonishment; and hard-working men and women greet you with a hearty Cornish salutation, as you pass near their cottage doors.|$|E
60|$|Yet all {{the same}} there is an {{excellent}} reason why one should shun beauty in a prospective wife, at anyrate obvious beauty--the kind of beauty people talk about, and which gets into the photographers' windows. The common beautiful woman has a style of her own, a favourite aspect. After all, she cannot be perfect. She comes upon you, dazzles you, marries you; {{there is a time}} of ecstasy. People envy you, continue to envy you. After a time you envy yourself--yourself of the day before yesterday. For the imperfection, the inevitable imperfection--in one case I remember it was a smile--becomes visible to you, becomes your especial privilege. That is the real reason. No beauty is a beauty to her husband. But with the plain woman--the thoroughly plain woman--it is different. At first--I will not mince matters--her ugliness is an impenetrable repulse. Face it. After a time little things begin to appear through the violent discords: little scraps of melody--a shy tenderness in her smile that peeps <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you</b> and vanishes, a something that is winning, looking out of her eyes. You find a waviness of her hair that you never saw at the beginning, a certain surprising, pleasing, enduring want of clumsiness in part of her ear. And it is yours. You can see she strikes the beholder with something of a shock; and while the beauty of the beauty is common for all the world to rejoice in, you will find in your dear, plain wife beauty enough and to spare; exquisite--for it is all your own, your treasure-trove, your safely-hidden treasure....|$|E
60|$|The door opened, {{and there}} entered to us, quietly, the most remarkable-looking man that I had ever seen. Judging {{him by his}} figure and his movements, he was still young. Judging him by his face, and {{comparing}} him with Betteredge, he looked the elder of the two. His complexion was of a gipsy darkness; his fleshless cheeks had fallen into deep hollows, over which the bone projected like a pent-house. His nose presented the fine shape and modelling so often found among the ancient people of the East, so seldom visible among the newer races of the West. His forehead rose high and straight from the brow. His marks and wrinkles were innumerable. From this strange face, eyes, stranger still, of the softest brown--eyes dreamy and mournful, and deeply sunk in their orbits--looked <b>out</b> <b>at</b> <b>you,</b> and (in my case, at least) took your attention captive at their will. Add to this a quantity of thick closely-curling hair, which, by some freak of Nature, had lost its colour in the most startlingly partial and capricious manner. Over {{the top of his}} head it was still of the deep black which was its natural colour. Round the sides of his head--without the slightest gradation of grey to break the force of the extraordinary contrast--it had turned completely white. The line between the two colours preserved no sort of regularity. At one place, the white hair ran up into the black; at another, the black hair ran down into the white. I looked at the man with a curiosity which, I am ashamed to say, I found it quite impossible to control. His soft brown eyes looked back at me gently; and he met my involuntary rudeness in staring at him, with an apology which I was conscious that I had not deserved.|$|E
