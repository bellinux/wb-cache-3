5|$|At the Red Electoral Alliance's city {{convention}} Folkvord {{was elected}} their lead candidate in Oslo for the 2005 election. Folkvord, along with Torstein Dahle, were the <b>only</b> <b>representatives</b> {{from the party}} who had a chance of gaining a seat in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards {{the idea of having}} any representatives from the Red Electoral Alliance in parliament, saying that the voters should do anything in their power to stop them from earning a seat in parliament. When the votes were counted Folkvord did not gain a seat in parliament.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by this, and by {{accusations of}} fraudulently passing off foreign moths as British, Cribb gave up {{collecting}} {{and left the}} rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt. Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum, Victoria differ as to whether it was Cribb's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings, but either way the result was the same. The debt was not paid on time and when Cribb went back for the moths, which he had already sold to another collector, his landlady had burnt them. Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the moths were unsuccessful, and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the <b>only</b> <b>representatives</b> of an extinct species.|$|E

5|$|The Russell Family is {{a fictional}} family who {{appeared}} on American soap opera Passions, which aired on NBC (1999–2007) {{and later on}} DirecTV (2007–08). The family {{was created by the}} soap's founder and head writer James E. Reilly; it originally consisted of four characters—the married couple Eve Russell and T. C. Russell, and their children, Whitney and Simone Russell. The Russells are one of the four core families in the fictional town of Harmony, and are characterized by their friendship with the Bennetts and Lopez-Fitzgeralds and their feud with the Cranes. As the series progressed, four more characters were added to the family: Eve's vengeful, adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne; Eve's child with Julian Crane, Vincent Clarkson; Whitney's husband and Liz's son, Chad Harris-Crane; and Eve's aunt Irma Johnson. Most of the characters left during the show's transition from NBC to DirecTV, leaving Eve and Vincent as the <b>only</b> <b>representatives</b> of the Russell family in the series finale.|$|E
5|$|Viceroy Cisneros {{tried to}} {{maintain}} the political status quo, but a group of criollo lawyers and military officials organized an open cabildo (a special meeting of notables of the city) on May22 to decide {{the future of the}} Viceroyalty. Delegates denied recognition to the Council of Regency in Spain and established a junta to govern in place of Cisneros, since the government that had appointed him Viceroy no longer existed. To maintain a sense of continuity, Cisneros was initially appointed president of the Junta. However, this caused much popular unrest, so he resigned under pressure on May25. The newly formed government, the Primera Junta, included <b>only</b> <b>representatives</b> from Buenos Aires and invited other cities of the Viceroyalty to send delegates to join them. This resulted in the outbreak of war between the regions that accepted the outcome of the events at Buenos Aires and those that did not.|$|E
25|$|Nazarbayev has {{put forward}} the {{initiative}} of holding a forum of world and traditional religions in Astana.

Among other similar events aimed at establishing interdenominational dialogue were the meetings of representatives of world religions and denominations held in Assisi, Italy in October 1986 and January 2002. The first Congress of World and Traditional Religions which gathered in 2003 allowed the leaders of all major religions to develop prospects for mutual cooperation.|$|E

500|$|During {{the soap}} opera's final years, Johnson {{expressed}} disappointment {{when the show}} began [...] "taking out the people of color", such as Amelia Marshall, Brook Kerr (who played Whitney Russell), and himself; he also {{said it was an}} obvious sign that [...] "this thing is going down." [...] Johnson identified racial diversity as one of the show's biggest draws, but added that the African-American actors were not used to their full potential. Following the departures of Johnson, Kerr, and Cathy Jenéen Doe, the actress playing Simone Russell, in 2007, the <b>only</b> <b>representatives</b> of the Russells in the series finale were Tracey Ross and Phillip Jeanmarie (who portrayed Vincent Clarkson).|$|E

2500|$|In 1765 Otis Jr. {{attended}} the Continental Congress, {{otherwise known as}} the Stamp Act Congress, along with other colonial delegates. The resolutions of the Congress stated that the Stamp Act had [...] "a manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists" [...] and that [...] "the <b>only</b> <b>Representatives</b> of the People of these Colonies, are Persons chosen therein by themselves, and that no Taxes ever have been, or can be Constitutionally imposed on them, but by their respective Legislature."

2500|$|Peter was crowned in St. Michael's Cathedral in Belgrade, on [...] The {{coronation}} ceremony, {{the first}} in Serbia's modern history, was intended to demonstrate that a new era had begun. The year-long interval between Peter's return to Serbia and his coronation was done deliberately, so that the ceremony would coincide with the 100th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising and to give European statesmen time {{to come to terms}} with the palace coup. Nevertheless, <b>only</b> <b>representatives</b> of Montenegro and Bulgaria were in attendance. New regalia, consisting of a crown, sceptre, orb and royal mantle, was commissioned specially for the occasion and made by the Parisian jewelers Falize Frères. King Peter's procession and a parade following the coronation were filmed by Arnold Muir Wilson, the honorary Serbian consul in Sheffield, and his cameraman, Frank Mottershaw. This is believed to the oldest surviving film recorded in Serbia. According to film historian Paul Smith, it is also likely the first newsreel in history.|$|E

2500|$|Though it {{has been}} argued that the term head of state is a republican one {{inapplicable}} in a constitutional monarchy such as Canada, where the monarch is the embodiment of the state and thus cannot be head of it, the sovereign is regarded by official government sources, judges, constitutional scholars, and pollsters as the head of state, [...] while the governor general and lieutenant governors are all <b>only</b> <b>representatives</b> of, and thus equally subordinate to, that figure. Some governors general, their staff, government publications, and constitutional scholars like Edward McWhinney and C. E. S. Franks have, however, referred to the position of governor general as that of Canada's head of state, though sometimes qualifying the assertion with de facto or effective; Franks has hence recommended that the governor general be named officially as the head of state. Still others view the role of head of state as being shared by both the sovereign and her viceroys. Since 1927, governors general have been received on state visits abroad as though they were heads of state.|$|E
2500|$|The SBTA {{was formed}} in Chicago during a conference of {{building}} trades unions held from October 7 to October 10, 1903. The new organization firmly declared its allegiance to the AFL (but did not seek to join the federation), and refused to admit unions which {{did not belong to}} the federation. The SBTA admitted only large, amalgamated unions as members in an attempt to lessen jurisdictional struggles, and permitted <b>only</b> <b>representatives</b> of national and international unions to have a voice in organization affairs. George P. Gubbins, president of the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers, was elected the SBTA's first president. [...] William J. Spencer, head of organizing for the Plumbers, was elected secretary-treasurer. Seven vice presidents representing the Carpenters, Electrical Workers, Iron Workers, Laborers, Operating Engineers, Painters and Plasterers were also elected. Election for an eighth vice-presidential slot would be held later. Jurisdictional disputes were to be resolved by a majority vote of the SBTA's Board of Governors (the two officers and eight vice-presidents), with voting based on a one union-one vote scheme.|$|E
