50|$|<b>The</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>singles</b> from <b>the</b> album did not chart well, possibly due to {{only three}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>singles</b> from <b>the</b> album having music videos, and also possibly due to <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> marketing.|$|R

5|$|A {{course of}} antiretrovirals {{administered}} within 48 to 72hours after exposure to HIV-positive blood or genital secretions {{is referred to}} as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

5|$|A single {{version of}} the song was {{recorded}} by American singer Christina Aguilera and became her debut single. She was 17 {{at the time it}} was released. The single's commercial success funded Aguilera's debut album from RCA, in addition to gaining her credibility amongst established writers and producers.

5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to form into early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E

5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either directly or indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
5|$|Herrmann {{used the}} lowered music budget to his {{advantage}} by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's request for a jazz score. He thought <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>single</b> tone color of the all-string soundtrack {{as a way of}} reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play con sordini (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to Psycho, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.|$|E

Market research showed that women did not want girdles advertised on television—girdles were seen as armor against sex, while bras provided a means of attraction.|$|E
