5|$|About 10% of Lord Howe Island's forests {{have been}} cleared for agriculture, and another 20% has been disturbed, mostly by {{domestic}} cattle and feral sheep, goats and pigs. As a result, 70% {{of the island}} remains relatively untouched with a variety <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> and animals, {{many of which are}} endemic, some of which are rare or threatened. Two species <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> nine terrestrial birds, one bat and at least four invertebrates have become extinct since 1778. Endemism at the generic level includes the palms Howea, Hedyscepe and Lepidorrhachis, a woody daisy Lordhowea, the tree Negria, the leech Quantenobdella howensis, three annelid worm genera (Paraplutellus, Pericryptodrilus and Eastoniella), an isopod shrimp Stigmops, a hemipteran bug Howeria and a cricket Howeta.|$|E

40|$|The {{profession}} <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathology {{strives to}} improve {{the health and safety}} of the public through improved plant health systems. This includes the benefits afforded by well-managed urban landscapes and abundant food and fiber. However, the proud glow of the profession <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathology has dimmed over the past 20 years to the point that some members of the American Phytopathological Society (APS), the principal professional society <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathologists in the United States, are not sure what a plant pathologist should know or what a plant pathologist is responsible for (Phytopathology News 30 : 162). Without a unified, positive direction for the profession <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathology, we will see continued dissolution <b>of</b> academic <b>plant</b> pathology departments to departments such as microbiology, ecology, and plant science. We lament that the public doesn’t understand who we are, and we seek ways to change that public perception. Plant pathology can be divided into two major components: (i) the science <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathology, and (ii) the profession <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathology. The basic research discoveries that lead to the development of the scientific principles <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathology provide the foundation for the profession. The profession <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> pathology is the application of those scientific principles in production agriculture, forestry, and urban settings to benefit the public by safely reducing the negative impact <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> diseases...|$|R
5|$|Botany {{originated}} as herbalism, {{the study}} and use <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> for their medicinal properties. Many records of the Holocene period date early botanical knowledge {{as far back as}} 10,000 years ago. This early unrecorded knowledge <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within Tennessee, which make up much of the Cherokee land today. The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.|$|E

50|$|In philosophy, {{there are}} few studies of the {{implications}} <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> perception.

5|$|Cultivated plant {{taxonomy}} {{is the study}} of the theory and practice of the science that identifies, describes, classifies, and names cultigensthose plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity.

He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of animal horns and mollusc shells.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E

5|$|It is {{also from}} the Neolithic, in about 3000 BC, that we glimpse the first known {{illustrations}} <b>of</b> <b>plants</b> and read descriptions of impressive gardens in Egypt. However protobotany, the first pre-scientific written record <b>of</b> <b>plants,</b> did not begin with food; it {{was born out of}} the medicinal literature of Egypt, China, Mesopotamia and India. Botanical historian Alan Morton notes that agriculture was the occupation of the poor and uneducated, while medicine was the realm of socially influential shamans, priests, apothecaries, magicians and physicians, who were more likely to record their knowledge for posterity.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{southern}} Blue Ridge Mountains, Vogel State Park and the surrounding area consists of many valleys, ridges and mountains formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions, starting with the Grenville Orogeny nearly 1.5 billion years ago.
