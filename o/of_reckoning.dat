5|$|The legal Underbelly DVD was {{released}} 8 May 2008 by Roadshow Entertainment, {{a day after}} the final episode was aired on television. In accordance with the legal suppression, the release was not distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet. Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays will carry a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series is not for sale, distribution or exhibition in Victoria. Legal experts said Victorians who bought the box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, but anyone who showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia. In September 2008, a Limited Edition DVD {{was released}}, containing a numbered steel case and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams– A Day <b>of</b> <b>Reckoning.</b> The Underbelly soundtrack was released on 29 March 2008, both as a CD and online.

25|$|Despite their name, Arabic numerals {{actually}} started in India. The {{reason for this}} misnomer is Europeans saw the numerals used in an Arabic book, Concerning the Hindu Art <b>of</b> <b>Reckoning,</b> by Mohommed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi. Al-Khwārizmī wrote several important books on the Hindu–Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals, written about 825, along {{with the work of}} Al-Kindi, were instrumental in spreading Indian mathematics and Indian numerals to the West. Al-Khwarizmi did not claim the numerals as Arabic, but over several Latin translations, the fact that the numerals were Indian in origin was lost. The word algorithm is derived from the Latinization of Al-Khwārizmī's name, Algoritmi, and the word algebra from the title of one of his works, Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī hīsāb al-ğabr wa’l-muqābala (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing).|$|E
25|$|Devices {{have been}} used to aid {{computation}} for thousands of years, mostly using one-to-one correspondence with fingers. The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick. Later record keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers. The use of counting rods is one example. The abacus was early used for arithmetic tasks. What we now call the Roman abacus was used in Babylonia as early as c. 2700–2300 BC. Since then, many other forms <b>of</b> <b>reckoning</b> boards or tables have been invented. In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money.|$|E

25|$|The Dome of the Rock {{with its}} {{inscriptions}} are interesting in the dating of the text. These inscriptions {{have been known}} to scholars {{for more than a century}} and have repeatedly been the subject of interpretation, yet little attention has been paid to the elements from which they were composed. On the inner face of the octagon the declaration of faith is followed by conflated verses describing the powers of God. Next Muhammad is introduced, with a blessing that, though not directly quoted from the Quran, was clearly already in use in 694 AD. Then comes an exhortation to Christians that Jesus was also a prophet and mortal, followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself. Finally comes a command to bend to His will and the threat <b>of</b> <b>reckoning</b> for those who do not.|$|E

500|$|Boniface had {{specific}} {{concerns about}} {{the wording of the}} Libellus. At least three versions of the Libellus were circulating on the Continent during Boniface's lifetime, all of these within collections of canonical and penitential documents. Boniface is known to have encountered (perhaps even helped produce) at least one canon law collection — the Collectio canonum vetus Gallica — that included the [...] "Q/A" [...] version of the Libellus, and {{it is also possible that}} he knew of the Collectio Bobiensis, with its appended [...] "Capitula" [...] version of the Libellus. A third version of the Libellus known as the [...] "Letter" [...] version may also have been known to Boniface. There are slight differences in wording and chapter order between the three versions, but for the most part they are the same, with one important exception: the [...] "Q/A" [...] and [...] "Capitula" [...] versions contain a passage that discusses how closely a man and a woman can be related before they are prohibited from being married; the [...] "Letter" [...] version omits this passage. According to Karl Ubl and Michael D. Elliot, the passage in the [...] "Q/A" [...] and [...] "Capitula" [...] versions is authentic, and its absence from the [...] "Letter" [...] version represents a later modification of the text probably made in the mid-seventh century. The passage in the [...] "Q/A" [...] and [...] "Capitula" [...] versions has Gregory saying that those related within the second degree of kinship (including siblings, parents and their children, first cousins, and nephews/nieces and their aunts/uncles) are prohibited from marrying each other, but that church tradition sets no prohibition against marrying a more distant relation. However, Gregory used a method <b>of</b> <b>reckoning</b> degrees of kinship (or consanguinity) that was unfamiliar to many living in the mid-eighth century. Ubl has shown that Gregory's method <b>of</b> <b>reckoning</b> degrees of kinship was one that would come to be known as the [...] "scriptural" [...] or [...] "canonical" [...] method. Boniface, the papacy, and apparently most of Western Europe ca. 750 followed a different method <b>of</b> <b>reckoning,</b> known as the [...] "Roman" [...] method, whereby a restriction within the second degree merely precluded siblings from marrying each other and parents from marrying their children, and implicitly allowed all unions beyond these. Thus, Boniface (misinterpreting Gregory's [...] "canonical" [...] method of measuring kinship for a [...] "Roman" [...] one) took this passage in the Libellus to mean that Gregory permitted first cousins to marry each other and nephews/nieces to marry their aunts/uncles — an opinion that Boniface (rightly) believed Gregory would not have held.|$|E
