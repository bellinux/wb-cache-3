40|$|Adapting {{the model}} {{employed}} by stochastic filters for state estimation {{of a specific}} battery type or during aging of the battery in the application is time consuming or never done leading to decreased accuracy of both state of charge and state of health estimation. The most important characteristic of a battery for state estimation is the open-circuit voltage since this voltage is correlated {{to the state of}} charge. This paper introduces a procedure for identifying online a function describing the open circuit voltage while running the battery in any application avoiding thereby laboratory testing of the battery. The future aim is a plug-and-play state estimation by stochastic filters for lithium-ion batteries. The procedure first uses a recursive least square method with adaptive forgetting factor which employs an impedance model for identifying the current open circuit voltage of the battery, then correlates this value to the current state of charge and finally uses a least square method without forgetting factor to estimate the function for the <b>open-circuit</b> voltage <b>characteristic</b> based on the Nernst equation.

40|$|Abstract: Following {{results of}} an {{investigation}} the author comes to the conclusion: that the Potier reactance values depend almost solely on the turbogenerator(s) reactive currents (iaQ = ian∙sinφ) for a given voltage value. This new rule is after being proven by a general qualitative analysis, and his thesis is then checked for rated values of the active and reactive power, {{for an example of}} a GTHW 360 (360 MW) turbogenerator. Potier reactance xp is determined by the <b>open-circuit</b> saturation <b>characteristics</b> and data from the zero-power factor at the rated voltage (ia ═ ia, 90 ·cosφ═ 0, U═Un). The procedures used to determine the Potier reactance (xP or xP,n) are performed by a computer with the open-circuit saturation curves if 0 (e 0) expressed analytically. The author proposes the IEC 34 - 4 standard in the part on the determination of the Potier reactance. It is proposed that it is determined for the excitation current corresponding to the rated voltage and armature current value ia, 90 = ian∙sinφn, at the zero-power factor (overexcitation), and for some characteristic values is needed for the construction of the turbogenerator capability curve (P-Q curve) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} meet {{emerging}} requirements for better utilization of electrical energy, some novel modeling and control approaches for battery systems and electric grids are proposed and validated in this dissertation. To better utilize a single battery system, the energy delivery capability and available energy stored in the battery needs to be understood first. A battery modeling approach is proposed to characterize power delivery dynamics, given charge and discharge demand as an input, and also estimate the state-of-charge of a battery, not only in normal operating range, but also in extreme cases, such as battery over-charging. The model is composed of separated voltage and current models. Several non-linear models, including Hammerstein model, <b>open-circuit</b> voltage <b>characteristics,</b> and Takacs hysteresis model, are combined in the voltage and the current model, respectively. The state-of-charge of the battery is estimated in a recursive optimization fashion. The parameterization and estimation methods of the model are described and validated on experimental data from a lithium iron phosphate cell. Several individual battery systems are usually connected in parallel to expand the total capacity of a network. To coordinate the output of each battery system, three current scheduling strategies are proposed. Besides simultaneous and sequential discharge scheduling algorithms, a hybrid algorithm is formulated by solving a Quadratic Programming problem. The simulation results indicate the feasibility of the proposed scheduling algorithms and motivate the use of parallel connected battery modules despite changes in battery operating parameters. The simultaneous and sequential discharge scheduling algorithms are extended to power scheduling. A complete modular battery system for an experimental Electric Vehicle with the same topology is developed for future experimental validation and research. Integrating inverters in battery systems or other DC sources is required when connecting to electric girds. To maintain {{the stability of the}} grid, disturbance rejection control aiming to mitigate fluctuations in AC power flow is studied based on an experimental setup created to mimic a local electric grid. Through demodulating real power oscillations, modeling of actuator and disturbance, and implementing controller designed by combining the internal model principle and optimal control, the feasibility of proposed control method is validated...|$|R

40|$|The {{photovoltaic}} {{properties of}} nanostructured ZnO films sensitized with the indoline derivative dye D 149 were studied. The performance of {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} built from ZnO building blocks with different morphology, (a) randomly oriented nanoparticle network and (b) nanowire arrays, was compared. The nanoparticle networks were prepared by the standard doctor blade technique from commercial ZnO powders and the nanowire arrays were electrodeposited in aqueous media. Two different lengths for the nanowire arrays (2. 5 and 5 m) were considered. The characterization included electron microscopy, adsorption measurements, optical spectroscopy, current-voltage <b>characteristics,</b> <b>open-circuit</b> voltage versus light intensity, incident-photon-to-current efficiency, open circuit voltage decay and impedance spectroscopy under illumination. In spite of the smaller dye loadings of the nanowires {{with respect to the}} nanoparticles, the former showed a remarkably effective integrated optical absorption (in the range from 370 to 700 nm, 57 % versus 69 % for the latter). However the photocurrents for nanowires were lower than expected from this good absorption, which suggests that recombination rather than solar light harvesting can be the limiting factor in these nanowire-based solar cells. The impedance analysis and the open-circuit voltage decays showed smaller recombination resistances and shorter lifetimes for the nanowire-based solar cells. However, the interpretation of the recombination resistances, capacitances and lifetimes {{in the case of the}} nanowires is likely affected by space-charge effects and back-reaction through the substrate. An understanding of the effects discovered in this study is very valuable for the development of strategies to enhance the energy conversion efficiency for the ZnO nanowire array based solar cells...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{tried to}} improve on the {{efficiency}} of organic solar cells based on small molecules. Therefore, new materials, growth conditions and the bulk heterojunction architecture have been investigated. VI. 1 Summary chapter 2 Chloroboron (III) subnaphthalocyanine (SubNc) was introduced as a donor material for organic solar cells. The absorption spectrum of SubNc extends to the near infrared portion of the solar spectrum, with an optical gap of 1. 7 eV. The SubNc/C 60 -based solar cells maintain a high Voc of 790 mV, producing a power conversion efficiency of 2. 5 %. This combination of a strong and narrow red absorption with a high Voc make SubNc/C 60 solar cells an excellent candidate for the use in tandem cells. VI. 2 Summary chapter 3 Fluorinated fused subphthalocyanine dimer (FSubPcDimer) {{proved to be an}} exceptional novel acceptor material with complementary absorption to the donor material subphthalocyanine (SubPc). Compared to an optimized solar cell with C 60 as an acceptor, this leads to an enhanced photocurrent while preserving the high <b>open-circuit</b> voltage <b>characteristic</b> of SubPc-based devices. In order to integrate this new material in a solar cell, we compare multiple solar cell architectures and find that it is crucial to optimize the electron-extracting contact. The best FFs are achieved by introducing a C 60 interlayer in between FSubPcDimer and BCP, leading to a 4 % efficient cell, which is very efficient high for cells with another acceptor than fullerene. The spectral response and reflection data show that the SubPc/FSubPcDimer interface is the photoactive one, whereas C 60 functions as a transport and optical spacer layer which enhances electron extraction, and positions the active layers near the peak of the incident light intensity. VI. 3 Summary chapter 4 Here, the physics of CuPc:C 60 bulk heterojunction devices is studied. The hole mobility of CuPc:C 60 is determined from space charge limited currents, and set at &# 956; 0,p= 1. 2 10 - 4 cm 2 /Vs, with field activation parameter &# 947;p= 1. 3 10 - 3 (cm/V) 1 / 2. Comparison of external quantum efficiency measurements of normal and inverted cells reveals that only holes generated near the anode are collected. The voltage and light dependence of the photocurrent are consistent with the behaviour of space-charge limited solar cells. Numerical simulations (ATLAS, Silvaco) involving optical simulation, Onsager-Braun dissociation, Langevin recombination and electrical transport equations could reproduce the Jsc, FF and &# 951;p dependence of the devices versus cell thickness. VI. 4 Summary chapter 5 Chloro-aluminum phthalocyanine films are grown on either FDTS or MoO 3. At RT, the ClAlPc films grow amorphous, independent of the surface. When heated to 105 &# 176;C, ClAlPc grows face-on on MoO 3, with a phase I-like absorption profile. On FDTS, the film is characterized as edge-on, phase II. The different growth modes had a clear impact on planar HJ cells fabricated on top of the ClAlPc films. On FDTS, the induced phase is accompanied by a lower Voc, but also by a higher current, leading to 3 % efficient planar HJ cells. Next, ClAlPc and C 60 are co-evaporated on FDTS and MoO 3 substrates. In order to achieve an enhanced crystallinity, a thin pure templating layer of ClAlPc proved advantageous. When the films were used in bulk HJ cells, the more crystalline films grown on top of a templating layer showed higher FF than devices without templating layers. The use of the co-evaporated bulk HJs ensured high photocurrents, independent of the growth surface. Here, the higher Voc of devices on MoO 3 was beneficial, with devices showing efficiencies greater than 4 % as a result. nrpages: 146 status: publishe...|$|R
