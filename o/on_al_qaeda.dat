[...] Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of Lahore, where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as [...] "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information <b>on</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed. Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife. Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in 2001, after Al Qaeda's {{attack on}} 9/11, the 332d Air Expeditionary Group participated in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The Group's F-15Es, F-16s, and later A-10s played a {{critical}} role in the defeat of Al Qaeda and the Taliban and later provided key air support for the provisional government in Afghanistan. [...] Significantly, the F-15Es and F-16s saved a team of US Army soldiers, US Navy SEALS and US Air Force Combat Controllers and PJ pinned down after the helicopter in which they were flying was disabled by a rocket propelled grenade (RPG) in the mountains of Afghanistan at Takur Ghar on what is now known as [...] "Roberts' Ridge". [...] The fighters employed both 20mm cannon and GBU-12 laser guided bombs <b>on</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> militants as they proceeded up the mountain in an effort to capture or kill the crashed Americans, saving over 2 dozen American lives.|$|E
2500|$|On September 26, 2002, {{during a}} {{stopover}} in New York City {{en route from}} a family vacation in Tunisia to Montreal, Arar was detained by the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). [...] The INS was acting upon information supplied by the RCMP. When it became clear {{he was going to}} be deported, Arar requested he be deported to Canada; though he had not visited Syria since his move to Canada, he retained Syrian citizenship as Syria does not permit the renunciation of citizenship. Canadian (initially) and United States officials have labelled his transfer to Syria as a deportation, but critics have called the removal an example of rendition for torture by proxy, as the Syrian government is infamous for its torture of detainees. Despite the recent public rhetoric, at the time of Arar's deportation, Syria was working closely with the United States government in their [...] "War on Terror." [...] In November 2003, Cofer Black, then counterterrorism coordinator at the US State Department and former director of counterterrorism at the CIA, was quoted as saying [...] "The Syrian government has provided some very useful assistance <b>on</b> <b>al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> in the past."}} In September 2002, the George W. Bush administration opposed the enactment of the [...] "Syria Accountability Act" [...] citing effectiveness of current sanctions and the ongoing diplomacy in the region. In addition, the administration noted the cooperation and support by Syria in fighting al-Qaida as a reason for its opposition to the [...] "Syria Accountability Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There is no {{imminent}} {{threat of the}} government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum," [...] Obama said {{with respect to the}} 2009 situation in Afghanistan. [...] "Al Qaeda has not reemerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border. And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan Security Forces and better secure the population." [...] On 1 December 2009, Obama therefore announced at The United States Military Academy in West Point that the U.S. will be sending 30,000 more troops to Afghanistan and set July 2011 as the date to begin pulling U.S. forces out of the country. Promising that he could [...] "bring this war to a successful conclusion," [...] Obama set out a strategy that would seek to reverse Taliban gains in large parts of Afghanistan, better protect the Afghan people, increase the pressure on Afghanistan to build its own military capacity and a more effective government and step up attacks <b>on</b> <b>Al</b> <b>Qaeda</b> in Pakistan. The president said the three core elements to the new strategy are [...] "a military effort to create the conditions for a transition; a civilian surge that reinforces positive action; and an effective partnership with Pakistan." [...] The overarching goal was to [...] "disrupt, dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and to prevent its capacity to threaten America and our allies in the future." [...] The West Point Speech concluded a three-month review of war strategy. [...] During the review, Obama asked for province-by-province assessments of the Taliban's strength, the effectiveness of provincial Afghan leaders and the overall security outlook to determine how quickly U.S. forces could leave certain regions. In {{the months leading up to}} his West Point speech, more precisely at a meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 30 Oct. 2009 to discuss his troops surge plan, Obama stated that the Afghanistan War is an American war, but he doesn’t want to it make an open-ended commitment. Obama also was livid that details of the 3 month Afghanistan War Review discussions were leaking out according to the New York Times. [...] "What I’m not going to tolerate is you talking to the press outside of this room," [...] he scolded his advisers. [...] "It’s a disservice to the process, to the country and to the men and women of the military." [...] In addition to the 30,000 additional U.S. troops that Obama announced to deploy to Afghanistan Obama sent an additional 22,000 forces (which were earlier announced in 2009 (compare section above)) along with 11,000 troops that were authorized by his predecessor to Afghanistan.|$|E
