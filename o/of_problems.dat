5|$|Breech-loading guns {{seemed to}} offer {{important}} advantages. A breech-loader could be reloaded without moving the gun, a lengthy process {{particularly if the}} gun then needed to be re-aimed. The Warriors Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and, because of their rifling, more accurate. Nonetheless, the design was rejected because <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> which plagued breech-loaders for decades.|$|E
5|$|The M-class cruisers were a {{class of}} light cruisers planned, but never built, by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine before World War II.

30|$|It {{is clear}} that the {{positive}} solution <b>of</b> <b>Problem</b> (3.1) is a sub-solution <b>of</b> <b>Problem</b> (1.1).

Therefore, we only need to consider Problem (3.1).|$|R

5|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{potential for}} sand whiting was first investigated {{in the late}} 1980s, {{with a number of}} reports detailing both successful trials and also a number <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand whiting were more likely to grow in captivity than other whiting species, but the mortality rate of over 50% was unacceptable for use in an economic setting. A number <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> with diseases such as ulcerative dermatitis and the failure of the swim-bladder to inflate properly were also documented, however many of these initial problems have been overcome, and some facilities are breeding around 2000 larvae with a 95% survival rate. Some of these fingerlings are used to restock depleted estuaries, while others form the basis of commercial fish crops.|$|E

5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, and when it did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E
5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went into orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen fuel, the behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E

5|$|Critics cite {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> with the conviction. Local {{newspaper}} coverage, even before Frank was officially charged, was {{deemed to be}} inaccurate and prejudicial. Some claimed that the prosecutor Hugh Dorsey was under pressure for a quick conviction because of recent unsolved murders and made a premature decision that Frank was guilty, a decision that his personal ambition would not allow him to reconsider. Later analysis of evidence, primarily by Governor Slaton and Conley's attorney William Smith, seemed to exculpate Frank while implicating Conley.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the California Supreme Court ordered reciprocal discovery rules, without an initial law requiring it. However, a series <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> surfaced with this judicially imposed system. Not only did both sides refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an unworkable position for both sides. In 1974, the California Supreme Court ordered the legislature to create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.|$|E
5|$|During its {{development}} the ZNG experienced a number <b>of</b> <b>problems,</b> including shortages {{of weapons and}} ammunition, lack of uniforms, inadequate training and an overall deficiency in trained officers, and poor staff work and command structures (preventing the effective coordination of multiple units). These problems were offset by good morale, clear objectives {{and high levels of}} mobilisation. After the Battle of the Barracks, the ZNG expanded significantly with arms captured from the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija). By the end of October 60 new brigades and independent battalions were established, and on 3 November the ZNG was renamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska).|$|E
