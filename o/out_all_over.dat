5|$|The {{peaceful}} lull {{following the}} Cisplatine conflict {{did not last}} long. On 20 September 1835, a civil war erupted in Rio Grande do Sul. The revolt, known as the Ragamuffin War, began after the provincial president (governor) was removed from office in a coup d'état. Despite the nickname, the Ragamuffin rebels were landlords, like Marques de Sousa, who after losing elections tried to take power by force. Marques de Sousa was among the army officers in the province who remained loyal to the deposed president. He fought in the Battle of Arroio Grande on 14 October 1835, in which rebel troops were defeated. But the forces loyal to the legitimate government were heavily outnumbered. Marques de Sousa and the deposed president departed for Rio de Janeiro to request aid, but the central government was unable to render much assistance, as rebellions and riots had broken <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the country. With the infantry's 1st Battalion of Caçadores (Sharpshooters) placed under his command, Marques de Sousa embarked on 8 March 1836 for Pelotas, in southeastern Rio Grande do Sul, after being named its military commander.|$|E

In 2007, General Ehsan-ul-Haq admitted publicly that keeping the navy and the air force out of the conflict was a mistake.|$|E

25|$|The upheavals {{caused by}} the Black Death left certain {{minority}} groups particularly vulnerable, especially the Jews, who were often blamed for the calamities. Anti-Jewish pogroms were carried <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Europe; in February 1349, 2,000 Jews were murdered in Strasbourg. States were also guilty of discrimination against the Jews. Monarchs gave in {{to the demands of}} the people, and the Jews were expelled from England in 1290, from France in 1306, from Spain in 1492, and from Portugal in 1497.|$|E
25|$|Indian attacks {{increased}} significantly after 1860, {{when most of}} the army troops were withdrawn, and miners and ranchers began fanning <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the country, often encroaching on Indian territory. Increased attacks along the Humboldt led to most travelers' taking the Central Nevada Route. The Goodall cutoff, developed in Idaho in 1862, kept Oregon bound travelers away from much of the Indian trouble nearer the Snake River. Other trails were developed that traveled further along the South Platte to avoid local Indian hot spots.|$|E
25|$|After Averoff's decisive intervention, Gizikis {{decided to}} invite Karamanlis {{to assume the}} premiership. Throughout his stay in France, Karamanlis was a vocal {{opponent}} of the Regime of the Colonels, the military junta that seized power in Greece in April 1967. He was now called to end his self-imposed exile and restore democracy to the place that originally created it: Greece. Upon news of his impending arrival cheering Athenian crowds {{took to the streets}} chanting: Έρχεται! Έρχεται! He is coming! He is coming! Similar celebrations broke <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> Greece. Athenians in their thousands also went to the airport to greet him. Karamanlis was sworn-in as Prime Minister under President pro tempore Phaedon Gizikis who remained in power in the interim, till December 1974, for legal continuity reasons until a new constitution could be enacted during metapolitefsi and was subsequently replaced by duly elected President Michail Stasinopoulos.|$|E

25|$|The {{occupation}} of Western Russia ultimately proved a costly blunder for Berlin as {{over one million}} German troops lay sprawled out from Poland nearly to the Caspian Sea, all idle and depriving Germany of badly needed manpower in France. The hopes of utilizing Ukraine's grain and coal proved abortive and in addition, the local population became increasingly upset at the occupying army. Revolts and guerrilla warfare began breaking <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the occupied zone, many of them inspired by Bolshevik agents. German troops had to intervene in Finland to put down an attempted Bolshevik coup, and Ludendorff became increasingly paranoid about his troops being affected by propaganda emanating from Moscow; {{this was one of}} the reasons he was reluctant to transfer divisions to the Western Front. The attempt at establishing an independent Ukrainian state under German guidance was unsuccessful as well. Despite all this, Ludendorff completely ruled out the idea of marching on Moscow and Petrograd to remove the Bolshevik government from power.|$|E
25|$|Measurements of {{the energy}} and arrival {{directions}} of the ultra-high energy primary cosmic rays by the techniques of density sampling and fast timing of extensive air showers were first carried out in 1954 {{by members of the}} Rossi Cosmic Ray Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The experiment employed eleven scintillation detectors arranged within a circle 460 meters in diameter {{on the grounds of the}} Agassiz Station of the Harvard College Observatory. From that work, and from many other experiments carried <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the world, the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays is now known to extend beyond 1020eV. A huge air shower experiment called the Auger Project is currently operated at a site on the pampas of Argentina by an international consortium of physicists, led by James Cronin, winner of the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics from the University of Chicago, and Alan Watson of the University of Leeds. Their aim is to explore the properties and arrival directions of the very highest-energy primary cosmic rays. The results are expected to have important implications for particle physics and cosmology, due to a theoretical Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit to the energies of cosmic rays from long distances (about 160 million light years) which occurs above 1020eV because of interactions with the remnant photons from the Big Bang origin of the universe.|$|E

[...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. I am looking {{at a picture of}} you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over.</b> Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E

Buffy, Willow, Xander, and Giles get {{themselves into a}} room adjacent to 314 as Willow starts to cast the spell to join them all temporarily. Riley distracts Adam's demonoid minions while Buffy confronts Adam. However, Adam, after modulating his arm to dispense a minigun, is able to overpower her. Suddenly, the spell begins to work: to function as one unit, Willow becomes the spirit, Giles the mind, Xander the heart, and Buffy the hand, or strength of their ensemble. They work through Buffy to neutralize Adam, telling him [...] "You could never hope to grasp {{the source of our}} power". Adam, alone but intrigued, shoots at them to no avail. Adam then shoots a missile, which is changed into doves, and his gun is reverted into his arm. They are able, through Buffy, to punch inside Adam's chest, remove his uranium core, destroying him.|$|E
500|$|Along {{the southwestern}} coast of Louisiana, tides between [...] were reported. On land, Chris {{produced}} tropical storm force winds {{in a few}} areas and light to moderate rainfall. Throughout the state, precipitation was generally between , though peaking at more than [...] in Delhi. Elsewhere in Louisiana, about [...] of rainfall was reported in Lake Charles. Street flooding in Lake Charles was severe, though only a few houses suffered flood damage. To the south of Lake Charles, minor damage was reported in Cameron Parish, totaling to about $500,000 (1982USD). However, due to high tides, damage along the coastal areas of that parish was considerable. A Cameron Parish official noted [...] "There's power <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> the place, and we understand {{there was quite a}} bit of damage at Holly Beach". In Evangeline Parish, an F2 tornado on the Fujita Scale destroyed four buildings and damaged seven other structures. In northeastern Louisiana, wind damage was [...] "spotty" [...] and limited to downed trees and powerlines. As a result of heavy rainfall in that portion of the state, low-lying areas flooded, and bayous overflowed. A tornado, rated at F3, destroyed eleven houses and one church in Clayton. In addition, the tornado knocked down trees and powerlines in the area. Overall, damage in Louisiana was near $1million (1982USD).|$|E
500|$|Endtroducing..... {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics when it {{was first}} released. Alternative Press called it [...] "an undeniable hip-hop masterpiece" [...] showing [...] "DJ Shadow remembers that sampling is an art form", while David Bennun from The Guardian said the record was [...] "not only one of the most daring and original albums of recent times, but also one of the loveliest." [...] In Playboy, Robert Christgau claimed that while listeners unfamiliar with its style of music would not find the tracks as powerful, [...] "they are so rich and eclectic, and spun out with such a sense of flow, that this album establishes the kind of convincing aural reality other British techno experimenters only fantasize about." [...] Tom Wilkes of Melody Maker wrote: [...] "The album flips hip hop inside <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> again like a reversible glove, and again, and again, and each time it's sudden and new. I am, I confess, totally confounded by it. I hear a lot of good records, but very few impossible ones... You need this record. You are incomplete without it." [...] Author and rock critic Greil Marcus published a glowing review of the album in his [...] "Real Life Rock Top Ten" [...] column for Interview, where he called it [...] "absolutely modern – which is to say ambient-dreamy and techno-abstract" [...] and [...] "quite brilliant throughout".|$|E

Other cultural references include how after going back in time, Peter becomes excited about his new prospects in life, and states to Cleveland {{that he is going to}} [...] "raise more hell than Hellraiser" [...] from the 1987 horror film Hellraiser. It also depicts Pinhead as weak and ridiculous, stating that the worst he can do is unscrew a salt shaker and trick someone into using it, causing salt to come <b>out</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> their food. The first scene where Lois appears at the swimming pool is a reference to a scene from the 1980 film Caddyshack, featuring the song [...] "Mr. Night" [...] by Kenny Loggins. Once Lois appears, she asks Peter if he would like to see the 1982 film Zapped!. Rejecting her offer, Peter decides to go partying with Cleveland instead and play the video game Menstrual Ms. Pac-Man, in addition to making out with actress Molly Ringwald. While there, Brian gets into a fight, and instructs the bar patron to meet him on top of the World Trade Center to fight him at eight A.M. on September 11, 2001. While downstairs in the alternate universe, Peter makes a reference to the Twilight Zone episode, [...] "The Eye of the Beholder." [...] The joke about the World Trade Center has been edited from current versions of the show accessible on Netflix as of January 2012. Returning to the present, Peter and Brian decide to watch television, and are shocked to discover that actor Chevy Chase is now the host of The Tonight Show. They also discover that former Vice President Al Gore is now President of the United States, and flying cars running on vegetable oil exist. A parody of the 1962 ABC animated series, Hanna-Barbera's The Jetsons, is then shown. In the alternate reality, Death refers to the Dick Cheney hunting accident, explaining that the [...] "Chairman of Halliburton" [...] accidentally shot and killed Karl Rove, Antonin Scalia, and Tucker Carlson (Brian groans that Peter and he can't change this wonderful future, but Peter flatly says [...] "I don't know who any of those people are"). The main plot of the episode, complete with the scene in which Peter and Brian are in the living room, with Brian explaining to Peter what happened using a chalk board, is a reference to the alternate universe scene in Back to the Future Part II.|$|E
