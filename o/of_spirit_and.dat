5|$|In 1869 Dunford House was let. Catherine and {{her four}} younger daughters {{moved to a}} house in South Kensington—the eldest, Kate, had married in 1866. The ménage proved unsatisfactory; Ellen, Jane and Anne were now {{displaying}} considerable independence <b>of</b> <b>spirit,</b> <b>and</b> differences of opinion arose between mother and daughters. Catherine moved out, taking the youngest daughter Lucy, and went to Wales where she lived until her death in 1877. In South Kensington, Ellen, Jane and Anne, often joined by Kate, established a sisterhood determined both to preserve Richard Cobden's memory and works and to uphold his principles and radical causes by actions of their own. Together they stopped publication of a memoir of their father, sponsored by his former colleagues and compiled by a family friend, Julie Salis Schwabe. This caused some offence; Schwabe had given the family financial and emotional support after Richard's death. However, Jane in particular wanted a more substantial memorial, and secured the services of John Morley, whose biography of Richard Cobden was published in 1881.|$|E

500|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of Ernest's childhood. When he was fourteen months old, a servant commented that Ernest [...] "runs {{around like a}} weasel. He is teething and as cross as a little badger from impatience and liveliness. He is not pretty now, except his beautiful black eyes". In May 1820, his mother described Ernest as [...] "very big for his age, as well as intelligent. His big black eyes are full <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> vivacity". Biographer Richard Hough writes that [...] "even from their infancy, it was plainly evident that the elder son took after his father, in character and appearance, while Albert strongly resembled his mother in most respects". Ernest and his brother often lived with their grandmother the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld until her death in 1831.|$|E
500|$|Sarah-Louise James of Daily Star {{commented that}} it {{contains}} some Westlife elements, {{and it would}} be perfect for a chick flick soundtrack. A reviewer for South African news site iafrica.com described the song as a [...] "show-stopping [...] lush Mariah-style ballad [...] that utilises Lewis' full vocal range and sounds uncannily like Carey at her best. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it [...] "", and added that with [...] "Footprints" [...] Lewis would receive comparisons to Carey. Digital Spy's reviewers gave similar opinions about [...] "Footprints in the Sand". Nick Levine in his review of the album called the song an [...] "histrionic finale" [...] <b>of</b> <b>Spirit,</b> <b>and</b> added that it [...] "seems hellbent on revisiting Mariah Carey's schlock-pop masterwork 'Anytime You Need a Friend'". After it was released as a single Alex Fletcher claimed it has [...] "the sort of ludicrous outro even Mariah Carey might consider over-the-top" [...] and that its lyrics [...] "will have your granny in tears".|$|E
500|$|Ernest had {{suffered}} from a venereal disease in his late teens and early twenties, most likely as the consequence of living a wild, promiscuous lifestyle. These qualities he had inherited {{under the tutelage of}} his father, who took his sons to [...] "sample the pleasures" [...] of Paris and Berlin, to Albert's [...] "horror and shame". Ernest had been so visibly deteriorating in appearance as a result that Sarah Lyttelton, a lady-in-waiting of Queen Victoria, observed at Windsor in 1839 that he was [...] "very thin and hollow-cheeked and pale, and no likeness to his brother, nor much beauty. But he has fine dark eyes and black hair, and light figure, and a great look <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> eagerness". Later that year, Albert counseled his brother against finding a wife until his 'condition' was fully recovered. He further warned that continued promiscuity could leave Ernest incapable of fathering children. Some historians believe that while he himself was able to father other children, the disease rendered his young wife infertile.|$|E

500|$|The {{libretto}} {{was written}} by the court poet, Salomon Franck, and published in [...] in 1715. The opening refers to Jesus' words in John 3:5: [...] "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." [...] (...) The second movement, a recitative, reflects upon birth in the Spirit as baptism through God's grace: [...] "" [...] (In the bath <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> water he becomes a child of blessedness and grace). Movement 3, an aria for alto, considers that the bond has to be renewed throughout life, {{because it will be}} broken by man, reflected in movement 4. The last aria is a prayer for the insight that the death of Jesus brought salvation, termed [...] "" [...] (death's death). The cantata concludes with the fifth stanza of Ludwig Helmbold's hymn of 1575, [...] "", mentioning scripture, baptism and the Eucharist. Bach used the eighth and final stanza, [...] "Erhalt uns in der Wahrheit" [...] (Keep us in the truth), to conclude his cantata Gott der Herr ist Sonn und Schild, BWV 79.|$|E

2500|$|Especially {{since the}} 1970s, the various congregations of the Assumption Family [...] have {{highlighted}} {{in a more}} visible way their common origins and their similarities <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> life.

2500|$|A {{closely related}} concept is Kaulika, the binding {{force of the}} Kula. The term {{literally}} means [...] "sprung in Kula". Kaulika is another name for Shakti, the spiritual energy. Shakti, as described in Kashmir Shaivism, does a paradoxical thing– she creates the universe, with all its diversity {{and at the same}} time remains identical to Shiva, the absolute transcendent. Thus, Kaulika is an energy both <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> matter. Bridging the two, Kaulika creates the path of evolution for consciousness from ego to spirit.|$|E

2500|$|Ludwig Feuerbach {{defined the}} paganism of {{classical}} antiquity, which he termed [...] ('heathenry') as [...] "the unity {{of religion and}} politics, <b>of</b> <b>spirit</b> <b>and</b> nature, of god and man", qualified by the observation that man in the pagan view is always defined by ethnicity, i.e. Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Jew, etc., so that each pagan tradition is also a national tradition.
