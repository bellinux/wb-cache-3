5|$|This view {{remains the}} subject <b>of</b> <b>dispute.</b> Writing in 2001, legal scholar Richard Posner {{described}} Uncle Tom's Cabin {{as part of}} the mediocre list of canonical works that emerges when political criteria are imposed on literature.|$|E
5000|$|Another way is for an {{existing}} court {{to be given}} the role of the court <b>of</b> <b>disputed</b> returns. Commonly, the phrase [...] "the x court shall be the court <b>of</b> <b>disputed</b> returns". In this case, a separate court is not created, but the existing court is made into and given the jurisdiction of the court <b>of</b> <b>disputed</b> returns. The High Court of Australia, the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Supreme Court of Victoria are each invested as courts <b>of</b> <b>disputed</b> returns in this manner.|$|R
40|$|Religion is alive, {{especially}} - {{and increasingly}} - {{in the global}} South. What impact does religion have in everyday life as provider of normative orientations? This research investigates the role <b>of</b> religion in <b>disputing</b> processes in Gorongosa, Mozambique, where both traditional religion and Christianity are tremendously popular. The author compares the religiously-oriented modes <b>of</b> <b>disputing</b> with the secular and formal modes <b>of</b> <b>disputing</b> advocated by government actors. The study reveals that different religions provide different normative orientations to people that strongly impact modes <b>of</b> <b>disputing,</b> not only within the religious realm but also within secular realms <b>of</b> <b>disputing...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1788, the Tây Sơn moved {{north to}} attack the Trịnh and unite Vietnam. Nguyễn Ánh took {{advantage}} of the situation to return to southern Vietnam. After rebuilding his army, he recaptured Saigon on September 7, 1788. His grip on the south was enhanced by a group of Frenchmen and equipment that Pigneau had recruited, although the magnitude of the aid has been the source <b>of</b> <b>dispute.</b>|$|E
5|$|Taking {{these two}} points <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> into consideration, the direct death toll {{could be as}} low as fifty-five or as high as sixty. When {{combined}} with the four indirect victims mentioned earlier, those numbers range from fifty-nine to sixty-four.|$|E

5|$|Already before this, in 1430, FitzAlan had {{departed}} for France, where {{he held a}} series of important command positions. He served under John, Duke of Bedford, the uncle of the eight-year-old King Henry VI. FitzAlan was involved in recovering fortresses in the Île-de-France region, and in suppressing local rebellions. His military career ended, however, at the Battle of Gerbevoy in 1435. Refusing to retreat in the face of superior forces, Arundel was shot in the foot and captured. His leg was later amputated, and he died shortly afterwards from the injury. His final resting place was a matter <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> until the mid-nineteenth century, when his tomb at Arundel Castle was revealed to contain a skeleton missing one leg.|$|E
5|$|Faulty {{intelligence}} was the component that was mostly {{responsible for the}} failure of Adlertag. While the gap between the British and Germans was not yet wide in this regard, the British were starting to gain a decisive lead in intelligence. The breaking of the Enigma machine and poor Luftwaffe signals discipline allowed the British easy access to German communications traffic. The impact of Ultra on the Battle of Britain is a matter <b>of</b> <b>dispute,</b> with Official Histories claiming there was no direct impact. Whatever the truth, Ultra, and the Y service in particular, gave the British an increasingly accurate picture of German order of battle deployments.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{new manager}} Jürgen Klinsmann, who {{replaced}} Rudi Völler, adopted {{the strategy of}} rotating the number one spot between Kahn and his longtime competitor, Jens Lehmann of Arsenal, to stimulate competition between the two. On 7 April 2006, after two years <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> for the position Klinsmann announced Lehmann was his first-choice goalkeeper for the 2006 World Cup. Kahn decided to stay on as a backup for the competition; despite their acrimonious pre-tournament battle for Germany’s starting role, Kahn openly accepted Klinsmann’s decision. Kahn and Lehmann embraced and shook hands as the former offered words of encouragement before the quarter-final penalty shoot-out against Argentina. In the postgame conference, Kahn publicly praised Lehmann for his two decisive penalty saves.|$|E

5|$|Laurence (died 2 February 619) was {{the second}} Archbishop of Canterbury from about 604 to 619. He {{was a member of}} the Gregorian mission sent from Italy to England to Christianise the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism, {{although}} the date of his arrival is disputed. He was consecrated archbishop by his predecessor, Augustine of Canterbury, during Augustine's lifetime, to ensure continuity in the office. While archbishop, he attempted unsuccessfully to resolve differences with the native British bishops by corresponding with them about points <b>of</b> <b>dispute.</b> Laurence faced a crisis following the death of King Æthelberht of Kent, when the king's successor abandoned Christianity; he eventually reconverted. Laurence was revered as a saint after his death in 619.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{cast and}} credits were {{unbilled}} {{and very few}} details emerged, but the film has been claimed to have featured Lon Chaney by two scholars. Jon Mirsalis states that Lon Chaney has an unbilled part as a pawnbroker. Michael Blake also notes that Lon Chaney {{had a role in}} the film, but Blake also states that the film had only one reel and lists the production code as 0119. Blake's claim that it was a single reel is the subject <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> because the release was originally as a two reel production in publications and many advertisements for the film.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{role and}} {{contribution}} of war chariots in battlefield {{is a matter}} <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> {{due to the lack}} of sufficient evidence. In general, it appears that during the first centuries (16th–14th century BC) chariots were used as a fighting vehicle while later in the 13th century BC their role was limited to a battlefield transport. Horse-mounted warriors were also part of the Mycenaean armies, however their precise role isn't clear due to lack of archaeological data.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{dissertation}} thesis is dispute resolution in the international sports law. A crucial is to focus primarily on resolution <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> through international arbitration and its preceding internal dispute resolution mechanisms within sports organizations. First of all {{it is necessary to}} provide a definition <b>of</b> sports <b>disputes</b> with an international element. After {{that it is necessary to}} deal with internal mechanisms for resolving sports disputes, which are closely linked to the issue of law on associations. With regard to the location of the seat of most major international sports organizations in Switzerland and with regard to the country of origin of this dissertation thesis the subject matter is viewed especially through the lens of the Swiss and the Czech law. Crucial role in resolving <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> in international sport plays a Swiss Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, which corresponds to an extent of this part of thesis. Finally, it also should not be omitted judicial and alternative resolution <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> in sport, although in practice it does not reach significance of internal and arbitrational resolution <b>of</b> <b>disputes.</b> To enliven the thesis, the final chapter is devoted to resolving <b>of</b> <b>disputes</b> during the last two Olympics...|$|R
5|$|There is {{no mention}} of NATO {{enlargement}} in the September–October 1990 agreements on German reunification, so there was no formal commitment not to expand. Whether or not the West informally committed to not enlarge NATO to the East is a matter <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> among historians and international relations scholars. Harvard University historian Mark Kramer rejects that an informal agreement existed. Texas A University political scientist Joshua R. Itzkowitz Shifrinson argues that an informal agreement existed.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid {{appears to}} have lived at Ripon, {{and for a time}} he acted as {{administrator}} of the see of Lindisfarne after Cuthbert's death in 687. In 691, the subdivision issue arose once more, along with quarrels with King Aldfrith over lands, and attempts were made to make Wilfrid either give up all his lands or to stay confined to Ripon. A proposal to turn Ripon into a bishopric was also a source <b>of</b> <b>dispute.</b> When no compromise was possible Wilfrid left Northumbria for Mercia, and Bosa was returned to York.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{founding}} of Sandakan, Sulu Archipelago was the source <b>of</b> <b>dispute</b> between Spain and the Sultanate of Sulu for economic dominance in the region. By 1864, Spain had blockaded the Sultanate possessions in the Sulu Archipelago. The Sultanate of Sulu awarded a German consular service ex-member {{a piece of land}} in the Sandakan Bay to seek protection from Germany. In 1878, the Sultanate sold north-eastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who later left the territory to a British colonial merchant. The German presence over the area raised concern among the British. As a result, a protocol was signed between the British, German and the Spanish to recognise Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu Archipelago, in return for the Spanish not intervening in British affairs in northern Borneo.|$|E
