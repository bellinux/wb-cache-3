40|$|The {{behaviour}} of oil-water mixtures/emulsions is {{of great}} importance {{for a variety of}} industries and sciences. Specially in oil and gas industry, it can be encountered at different stages while drilling, production, storage, transportation and processing of crude oil. The purpose of this thesis is to improve the understanding of oil-water mixtures/emulsions through laboratory experiments. Two mineral oils Bayol 35 and Exxsol D 60 and tap water were used as the test materials. Oil - water samples were prepared with varying proportion of oil and water ranging from 5 % to 95 %. The mixing experiments were conducted in two modes; Hand shaking and mechanical mixing. Under the mechanical mixing mode, the <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures</b> were prepared at different mixing speeds (400 rpm, 1000 rpm, and 1600 rpm) and mixing times (1 minute and 5 minutes). The separation phenomena was studied {{as a function of the}} type of oil, mixing duration, mixing speed and adding of colouring agent (Sudan blue and Uranine). The rheology, surface/interfacial tension and density of the oil water mixtures were examined for better understanding of the influence of physical properties on oil-water mixing and separation phenomena. Microscopic pictures were taken to study the separation phenomena, droplet sizes and their distribution. The results showed that Exxsol D 60 <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures</b> produce smaller water droplets in oil than Bayol 35 <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures,</b> but still Exxsol D 60 separates faster explaining that the less viscosity of Exxsol D 60 oil phase has a major influence over the droplet size in separation process. Longer mixing time and higher mixing speed lead to higher stability of the emulsions. This is due to the increased energy transferred for the break-up process which eventually lead to small droplets and more stable emulsions. Adding colouring agents modified the interfacial tension so that Sudan blue increased it and Uranine decreased the interfacial tension. This resulted that Sudan blue added <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures</b> gave bigger droplets and achieved faster separation in comparison to the Uranine added <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures.</b> Pure mineral oil showed Newtonian behaviour while it behaved non-Newtonian for <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures.</b> It was a significant observation to see that always the water droplets were bigger than the oil droplets in all the <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures</b> regardless of the type of oil, composition or method of preparation.

30|$|In summary, {{existing}} oil–water separation {{porous metal filter}} membranes can utilise {{the special}} wettability of the membrane surface to separate an <b>oil–water</b> <b>mixture</b> and has advantages such as high efficiency, portability, high plasticity, high thermal stability, good mechanical property and low cost. However, there are some aspects where these filter membranes need improvement for effective treatments of industrial wastewater and offshore crude oil spills. First, the environmental adaptability of the filter membranes needs to be enhanced and its working stability in extreme conditions, such as strong acid and alkali, high-concentration salt solution and corrosive liquid, needs to be strengthened, and its mechanical strength should be improved {{to adapt to the}} real environment. In addition, the material and modification reagents for fabricating the filter membrane need to be eco-friendly during fabrication and application processes. Furthermore, the fabricating process should be simple, and the manufacturing cost should be reasonable {{to meet the needs of}} large-scale production. 3 D printing technology has shown outstanding advantages, such as waste minimization, freedom of design, mass customization and the ability to manufacture complex structures [85]. Biomimetic super-hydrophobic structure [86] and superhydrophobic PLA membrane [87] have been printed for oil-water separation. Those results show that 3 D printing technology made fabrication process of complex micro-nano structure become easier. Based on this technology, oil-water separation membrane with higher efficient can be gotten in the future. Finally, when the <b>oil–water</b> <b>mixture</b> is in an emulsion state, the filter membrane needs to maintain the oil–water separation capability. An oil–water mixed emulsion is generally defined as oil–water dispersion [88] with a droplet diameter of less than 20  μm, and existing studies of oil–water separation by porous metal filter membranes rarely report the separating conditions for a mixed liquid in an emulsion state. Jiang et al. [52] prepared a superhydrophilic–underwater superoleophobic stainless steel mesh that can preliminarily separate oil–water mixed emulsions using a one-step solution coating method with methyltrimethoxysilane, but this filter membrane cannot completely separate <b>oil–water</b> <b>mixture</b> emulsions, since the apertures of many existing oil–water separation porous metal filter membranes are too large. This remains an urgent challenge in the field of oil–water separation by porous metal filter membranes that need to be solved.|$|R

For particle-stabilized (“Pickering”) emulsions we find that even extremely hydrophobic, nonwetting particles can be strongly bound to (like-charged) oil–water interfaces because of image charge effects.

40|$|Herein {{we report}} a {{self-cleaning}} coating derived from zwitterionic poly(2 -methacryloyloxylethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) brushes grafted on a solid substrate. The PMPC surface not only exhibits complete oil repellency in a water-wetted state (i. e., underwater superoleophobicity), but also allows effective cleaning of oil fouled on dry surfaces by water alone. The PMPC surface was compared with typical underwater superoleophobic surfaces realized {{with the aid}} of surface roughening by applying hydrophilic nanostructures and those realized by applying smooth hydrophilic polyelectrolyte multilayers. We show that underwater superoleophobicity of a surface is not sufficient to enable water to clean up oil fouling on a dry surface, because the latter circumstance demands the surface to be able to strongly bond water not only in its pristine state but also in an oil-wetted state. The PMPC surface is unique with its described self-cleaning performance because the zwitterionic phosphorylcholine groups exhibit exceptional binding affinity to water even when they are already wetted by oil. Further, we show that applying this PMPC coating onto steel meshes produces oil-water separation membranes that are resilient to oil contamination with simply water rinsing. Consequently, we provide an effective solution to the oil contamination issue on the oil-water separation membranes, which is an imperative challenge in this field. Thanks to the self-cleaning effect of the PMPC surface, PMPC-coated steel meshes can not only separate oil from <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures</b> in a water-wetted state, but also can lift oil out from <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures</b> even in a dry state, which is a very promising technology for practical oil-spill remediation.

40|$|The present work {{reports the}} study of {{oil-water}} dispersed flows experimentally. Small scale experiments using small diameter pipe flow loops or rheometers are commonly used for the characterization of oil-water flows in the industry. These small scale techniques offer a relatively simple and low cost alternative. However, the applicability of these small scale results in large scale real systems remains uncertain. The objective of the present work {{is to have a}} better understanding on the scale up of oil-water dispersed pipe flow. To this aim a combination of dispersed oil-water flow experiments with unstable and stable mineral oil mixtures as well as with real crude oils was carried out. The experiments were performed in different pipe diameters using different experimental setups depending of the stability of the <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures.</b> An existing flow loop at the Statoil Research Centre was used for the crude oil experiments. Unstable dispersions were tested in the Multiphase Flow loop at NTNU. Major modifications had to be made to this facility for the experiments with stable <b>oil-water</b> <b>mixtures</b> in different pipe diameters. Mineral oils with special additives that resemble real crudes, available as part of the FACE consortium, were used here. The qualification of small scale characterization methods was also part of the initial plan. Nevertheless, the pipe diameter effect results with stable dispersions required additional experiments which took additional time. Therefore, the small scale characterization techniques were not properly qualified. Appropriate instrumentation is of key importance when studying complex flow structures as in dispersed oil-water two phase flow. A feasibility study {{for the development of a}} multiple beam two energy gamma densitometer was also performed as part of the present work.
