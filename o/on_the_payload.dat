2500|$|Until {{its last}} refit, Columbia {{was the only}} {{operational}} orbiter with wing markings consisting of an American flag on the port (left) wing and the letters [...] "USA" [...] on the starboard (right) wing. [...] Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis and Endeavour all, until 1998, bore markings consisting of the letters [...] "USA" [...] below an American flag on the left wing, and the pre-1998 NASA [...] "worm" [...] logo afore the respective orbiter's name on the right wing. (Enterprise, the test vehicle which was the prototype for Columbia, originally had the same wing markings as Columbia but with the letters [...] "USA" [...] on the right wing spaced closer together; Enterprises markings were modified to match Challenger in 1983.) The name of the orbiter was originally placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payload</b> bay doors much like Enterprise but {{was placed on the}} crew cabin after the Challenger disaster so that the orbiter could be easily identified while in orbit. From its last refit to its destruction, Columbia bore markings identical to those of its operational sister orbiters – the NASA [...] "meatball" [...] logo on the left wing and the American flag afore the orbiter's name on the right; only Columbia's distinctive wing [...] "chines" [...] remained. [...] These black areas on the upper surfaces of the shuttle's forward wing were added because, at first, shuttle designers did not know how reentry heating would affect the craft's upper wing surfaces. The [...] "chines" [...] allowed Columbia to be easily recognized at a distance, as opposed to the subsequent orbiters. The [...] "chines" [...] were added after Columbia arrived at KSC in 1979.|$|E

50|$|To launch, {{vehicles}} are raised {{up on an}} 'elevator' cable that hangs down from the West station loading dock at 80 km, and placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> track. <b>The</b> <b>payload</b> applies a magnetic field which generates eddy currents in the fast-moving rotor. This both lifts <b>the</b> <b>payload</b> away from <b>the</b> cable, as well as pulls <b>the</b> <b>payload</b> along with 3g (30 m/s²) acceleration. <b>The</b> <b>payload</b> then rides <b>the</b> rotor until it reaches the required orbital velocity, and leaves the track.|$|R

5000|$|Launch and {{transport}} system differ not only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payload</b> {{that can be}} carried {{but also in the}} stresses and other factors placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payload.</b> The payload must not only be lifted to its target, it must also arrive safely, whether elsewhere {{on the surface of the}} Earth or a specific orbit. To ensure this the payload, such as a warhead or satellite, is designed to withstand certain amounts of various types of [...] "punishment" [...] on the way to its destination. Most rocket payloads are fitted within a payload fairing to protect them against dynamic pressure of high-velocity travel through the atmosphere, and to improve the overall aerodynamics of the launch vehicle. Most aircraft payloads are carried within the fuselage for similar reasons. Outsize cargo may require a fuselage with unusual proportions, such as the Super Guppy.|$|E

40|$|A {{test flight}} {{for a series}} of middle {{atmosphere}} electrodynamics rockets was launched from Wallops Island, Virginia, at 7 : 18 EST on July 31, 1980. The mother-daughter configuration contained a three axis symmetric double probe electric field instrument and a blunt probe <b>on</b> <b>the</b> daughter <b>payload,</b> and a Gerdien condenser and a single axis (vertical) asymmetric double probe electric field instrument <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mother <b>payload.</b> <b>The</b> <b>payloads</b> reached an apogee of 111 km, and data were gathered from all instruments <b>on</b> <b>the</b> downleg. A downward vertical electric field with a maximum amplitude of about 4 V/m was observed in a layer between about 57 and 67 km. The integrated potential across this layer was approximately 20 kV. Conductivity measurements indicated that free electrons were absent from the region of large electric fields; however, the decrease in conductivity was insufficient to maintain vertical current continuity through the layer. These results establish the existence of large mesospheric electric fields, supporting previous results from single axis measurements...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{no obvious}} {{reason for the}} {{malfunction}} {{could be found in}} the cameras themselves, investigation next shifted to the electrical umbilical <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payload</b> fairing. This umbilical connector would normally be attached on the ground to permit testing of the Ranger's subsystems and only a thin hinged door covered it during launch. One of the pins on the connector was [...] "hot" [...] and could easily be bridged, transferring a voltage to the adjacent pins and activating the TV camera system during launch. As for the cause of it, one possibility was electrostatic discharge, the other was a shock wave of some sort.|$|E

50|$|Only one {{emergency}} {{use of an}} LES has occurred during a manned mission. This occurred during the attempt to launch Soyuz T-10-1 on September 26, 1983. The rocket caught fire, just before launch, and the LES carried the crew capsule clear, seconds before the rocket exploded. The crew were subjected to an acceleration of 14 to 17 g (140 to 170 m/s2) for five seconds and were badly bruised. Reportedly, the capsule reached an altitude of 2000 m and landed 4 km from the launch pad.

40|$|The POLAR 5 rocket {{experiment}} {{carried an}} electron accelerator on a 'daughter' payload which injected a 0. 1 A beam of 10 keV electrons in a pulsed mode every 410 ms.

Measurements from a double probe electric field instrument and from particle detectors <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 'mother' <b>payload</b> and from a crude RPA <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 'daughter' <b>payload</b> are interpreted to indicate that the 'daughter' charges to a potential between several hundred volts and 1 kV. The neutralizing return current to the 'daughter' is shown to be asymmetrically distributed with the majority being collected {{from the direction of the}} beam. The additional electrons necessary to neutralize the daughter are thought to be produced and heated through beam-plasma interactions postulated by Maehlum et al. (1980) and Grandal et al.

50|$|Bratenahl persisted {{and studied}} more film of Atlas {{launches}} with the frames enlarged, which revealed light flashes in the post-staging plume. Another {{phone call to}} Convair revealed that 67 lb of RP-1 were also dumped during staging and that the Atlas's sustainer engine exhaust ignited the propellant cloud, producing these flashes. Since the umbilical door <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payload</b> shroud was only held in place with a thin latching mechanism, hot gases from igniting propellant could have contacted the electrical connector and caused a short. The inadvertent activation of the telemetry system during launch had occurred almost simultaneous with booster jettison at T+140 seconds. With that, the book could be closed on the cause of Ranger 6's failure.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of GFP frames: a GFP client frame and a GFP control frame. A GFP client frame can be further {{classified}} as either a client data frame or a client management frame. The former is used to transport client data, while the latter is used to transport point-to-point management information like loss of signal, etc. Client management frames can be differentiated from the client data frames based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>payload</b> type indicator. The GFP control frame currently consists only of a core header field with no payload area. This frame is used to compensate for the gaps between the client signal where the transport medium has a higher capacity than the client signal, and is better known as an idle frame.|$|E

40|$|Sine burst {{tests are}} often used for {{structural}} qualification of space flight hardware. In most instances, the driving frequency of the shaker is specified far below the structure's first resonant mode, such that the entire test article sees uniform acceleration. For large structures, this limits qualification testing to lower parts of the structure, or else it over-tests the lower structure to achieve qualification of the upper structure. <b>The</b> WindSat <b>payload,</b> a 10. 5 foot tall graphite/epoxy, titanium, and aluminum radiometer, experiences accelerations at the six foot diameter reflector nearly four times that at the spacecraft interface. Due to size of <b>the</b> <b>payload,</b> <b>the</b> number of bonded joints, and the lightweight reflector support structure design and construction, using static pull testing to qualify all of the bonded joints in the upper structure would result in large, expensive, and extensive test fixturing. Sine burst testing near the first two structural resonant modes was performed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> WindSat <b>payload</b> to achieve <b>the</b> correct load factor distribution up the stack for structural qualification. In this presentation, how finite element method (FEM) sine burst predictions were {{used in conjunction with}} low level random and sine burst tests to achieve correct qualification test load factor distribution <b>on</b> <b>the</b> WindSat <b>payload</b> is discussed. Also presented is the risk mitigation approach for using the uncorrelated FEM in this procedure...|$|R
