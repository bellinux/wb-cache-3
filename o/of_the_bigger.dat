5|$|The artery is only {{present in}} {{approximately}} 3–10% of the population. Thyroid ima artery is of surgical importance; {{due to its}} relatively small size and infrequent presence it can cause complications such as severe bleeding in surgery of the thorax, trachea, thyroid or parathyroid glands. Knowledge of occurrence of the artery is especially important during tracheostomy and thyroidectomy. Because the artery is smaller than the other thyroid vessels, and having an origin from one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> vessels, a brisk cut while performing the surgery may cause complications such as severe hemorrhage and significant blood loss. The artery, if dissected, may draw back into the mediastinum and further complicate the condition by causing hemorrhage and clots in the thoracic cavity.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Multitrait-multimethod {{analyses}} {{were used to}} examine <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> convergent and discriminant validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Five. Phase 1 examined self-reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Five across three measurement occa-sions. Self-reports <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Five traits were stable, but were moderately intercorrelated. Phase 2 examined assessments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Five across dif-ferent types of informants (self, peer, and parent). Assessments converged across types of informants and, importantly, {{there was no evidence}} <b>of</b> correlation between <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Five traits across <b>the</b> perspectives <b>of</b> different types <b>of</b> informants. <b>The</b> present results suggest that <b>the</b> degree <b>of</b> or-thogonality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Five traits depends on <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data. A single informant produces Big Five traits that are intercorrelated, whereas diverse informants tend to produce a much more orthogonal structure. Discussion focuses on methodological considerations in examining levels of convergent and discriminant validity and the theoretical implication...|$|R

The houses have backup generators, because the electrical grid in Haiti is unreliable. Some even have rooftop reservoirs for water, as the water supply is also unreliable.|$|E

25|$|When Roman force {{ended the}} {{independence}} of their naval force in 33 BC, the Liburnians lost their freedom and Liburnia {{became a part of}} the Roman province of Dalmatia, but marginal in a military sense. Burnum on the Krka river became a Roman military camp, while the frequently settled and already urbanized plains of Classical Liburnia, in the inland of Iader (Zadar), became easily accessible and controlled by the Roman rulers. However Liburnian seamanship tradition was never wiped out, but became primarily trade-oriented under the new circumstances, a shift which contributed to the economic and cultural flourishing of its ports and cities, as well as to those of the province in general. Despite the process of Romanization that especially affected some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> cities, the Liburnians saved their traditions, cults, typical funeral monuments (Liburnian cipus), names etc., as attested by the archaeological material from those ages.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 20th century, William Nelson Page, a civil {{engineer}} and coal mining manager, joined forces with a silent partner, industrialist financier Henry Huttleston Rogers (a principal of Standard Oil {{and one of the}} wealthiest men in the world), to develop the Deepwater Railway, a modest 85-mile long short line railroad to access untapped bituminous coal reserves {{in some of the most}} rugged sections of southern West Virginia. When Page was blocked by collusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> railroads, who refused to grant reasonable rates to interchange the coal traffic, he did not quit. As he continued building the original project, to provide their own link, using Rogers' resources and attorneys they quietly incorporated another intrastate railroad in Virginia, the Tidewater Railway. In this name, they secured the right-of-way needed all the way across Virginia to reach Hampton Roads, where a new coal pier was erected at Sewell's Point.|$|E

25|$|Searle {{offers a}} variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of {{answering}} questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has no understanding of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to {{the manner in which}} a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Portugal {{had been}} the main European power {{interested}} in pursuing trade routes overseas. Their next-door neighbors, Castile (predecessor of Spain) had been somewhat slower to begin exploring the Atlantic because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> land area it had to re-conquer (the Reconquista) from the Moors. It {{was not until the}} late 15th century, following the dynastic union of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the Reconquista, that the unified crowns of what would become Spain (although countries still legally existing) emerged and became fully committed to looking for new trade routes and colonies overseas. In 1492 the joint rulers conquered the Moorish kingdom of Granada, which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute. Columbus had previously failed to convince King John II of Portugal to fund his exploration of a western route, but the new king and queen of the re-conquered Spain decided to fund Columbus's expedition in hopes of bypassing Portugal's lock on Africa and the Indian Ocean, reaching Asia by traveling west.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1885 season, Newton was {{a member}} of an amateur side raised by the Devon cricketer Edward Sanders that played matches in North America, with two of the games later being {{designated}} as first-class.

Vernon's team was a strong one. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bigger</b> matches of the tour was at Melbourne Cricket Ground against an Australian XI which contained 10 Test players: Vernon's XI won by an innings and Newton, one of only three non-Test players in his team, made 77, starting a revival in his team's single innings after the first six wickets had fallen for 51 runs to a final total of 292.
