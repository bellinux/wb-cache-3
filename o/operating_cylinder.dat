50|$|The gas {{precharge}} in an accumulator is set so {{that the}} separating bladder, diaphragm or piston does not reach or strike {{either end of the}} <b>operating</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The design precharge normally ensures that the moving parts do not foul the ends or block fluid passages. Poor maintenance of precharge can destroy an operating accumulator. A properly designed and maintained accumulator should operate trouble-free for years.|$|E
50|$|Twin- or multi-cylinder engines {{may improve}} {{low-speed}} scavenging to one cylinder by {{shutting down the}} other cylinder at low speeds. This may be done simply by cutting the ignition spark to one, thus increasing the load on the other cylinder and thus the power and gas-flow required. This has the drawback of wasting fuel in the un-ignited cylinder, potentially also risking oiling-up its spark plug, More sophisticatedly, as was done for some Johnson outboard motors, the transfer passage for one cylinder may be closed by an additional throttle butterfly, shutting that cylinder off completely and routing all gas-flow through the other. This avoids the risk of plug-oiling and again increases gas-flow through the <b>operating</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cylinder {{deactivation}} is used {{to reduce}} the fuel consumption and emissions of an internal combustion engine during light-load operation. In typical light-load driving the driver uses only around 30 percent of an engine’s maximum power. In these conditions, the throttle valve is nearly closed, and the engine needs to work to draw air. This causes an inefficiency known as pumping loss. Some large capacity engines need to be throttled so much at light load that the cylinder pressure at top dead centre is approximately half that of a small 4-cylinder engine. Low cylinder pressure results in lower fuel efficiency. The use of cylinder deactivation at light load means there are fewer cylinders drawing air from the intake manifold, which works to increase its fluid (air) pressure. Operation without variable displacement is wasteful because fuel is continuously pumped into each cylinder and combusted even though maximum performance is not required. By shutting down half of an engine's cylinders, the amount of fuel being consumed is much less. Between reducing the pumping losses, which increases pressure in each <b>operating</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and decreasing the amount of fuel being pumped into the cylinders, fuel consumption can be reduced by 8 to 25 percent in highway conditions.|$|E

2500|$|A {{compound}} engine is a steam engine which <b>operates</b> <b>cylinders</b> {{through more than}} one stage, i.e., at different pressure levels. Compound engines were a method of improving efficiency. Up until the development of {{compound engine}}s, steam engines used the steam only once before being recycled back to the boiler, but a compound engine recycles the steam into one or more larger, lower-pressure second cylinders first, in order to utilize more of its heat energy. Compound engines could be configured to either increase a ship's economy or its speed. Although broadly speaking a compound engine can refer to a steam engine with any number of different-pressure cylinders, the term usually refers to engines which expand steam through only two stages, i.e. those which <b>operate</b> <b>cylinders</b> at only two different pressures (or [...] "double-expansion" [...] engines).|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Alternative fuels {{for both}} spark {{ignition}} and {{compression ignition engines}} have become very important owing to increased environmental protection concern, the need to reduce dependency on petroleum and even socioeconomic aspects. The investigations have been concentrated on decreasing fuel consumption by using alternative fuels and on lowering the concentration of toxic components in combustion products. As a gaseous fuel, gains from LPG have already been established in terms of low emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon. Ethanol {{is one of the}} fuel additive has some advantages such as better antiknock characteristics and the reduction of CO and HC emissions. It can be considered as renewable energy under the environmental consideration. In this study, a review of research paper on air-fuel ratio, <b>operating</b> <b>cylinder</b> pressure, ignition timing and compression ratio are some of the parameters that need to be analyzed and optimally exploited for better engine performance and reduced emissions. In the present paper a comprehensive review of various operating parameters and concerns have been prepared for better understanding of operating conditions and constraints for a LPG-Ethanol fuelled Spark Ignition engine at various compression ratios...|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a pneumatic/hydraulic <b>operated</b> <b>cylinder</b> composed of several cylinder modules arranged in succession in the axial direction, {{each of which}} guidess a piston which {{has at least one}} piston rod set {{to one side of the}} piston, whereby the front cylinder module has an opening at its front end face permitting the piston rod to pass through, and in said opening the piston rod extendable out of the cylinder at said face side and connected to the piston of the front cylinder module is guided, each cylinder module, with the exception of the rear, end-side closed cylinder module, having a piston rod passage opening for the piston rod and its rear end face, said piston rod being connected to the piston guided in the next cylinder module, and whereby each cylinder module is provided with an inlet and outlet for the hydraulic/pneumatic medium at least in the area of its rear end face and in the area of the front end face. The task of specifying a cylinder which permits more tha n two defined positions of the piston rod such as the known multiposition cylinder, but in comparison having a simple and compact design, is characterized by the fact that, according to the solution provided by the invention, the cylinder modules (1, 2, 3, 4) in the cylinders of the type described above are designed so that the maximum possible piston stroke length in the rearmost [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{business}} {{began as}} the Bonnick Cycle Company of Coventry, England. In 1890 during the pedal cycle craze that swept Britain {{at the end}} of the 19th century William Riley Jr. who had interests in the textile industry purchased the business and in 1896 incorporated a company to own it named The Riley Cycle Company Limited. Later, cycle gear maker Sturmey Archer was added to the portfolio. Riley's middle son, Percy, left school in the same year and soon began to dabble in automobiles. He built his first car at 16, in 1898, secretly, because his father did not approve. It featured the first mechanically operated inlet valve. By 1899, Percy Riley moved from producing motorcycles to his first prototype four-wheeled quadricycle. Little is known about Percy Riley's first [...] "motor-car". It is, however, well attested that the engine featured mechanically <b>operated</b> <b>cylinder</b> valves at a time when other engines depended on the vacuum effect of the descending piston to suck the inlet valve(s) open. That was demonstrated some years later when Benz developed and patented a mechanically operated inlet valve process of their own but were unable to collect royalties on their system from British companies; the courts were persuaded that the system used by British auto-makers was based on the one pioneered by Percy, which had comfortably anticipated equivalent developments in Germany. [...] In 1900, Riley sold a single three-wheeled automobile. Meanwhile, the elder of the Riley brothers, Victor Riley, although supportive of his brother's embryonic motor-car enterprise, devoted his energies to the core bicycle business.|$|R
