5|$|Another common {{condition}} is <b>otitis</b> <b>externa</b> (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than dogs with more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|Cocker Spaniels {{and other}} dogs that have long, {{pendulous}} ears are more predisposed to ear problems {{than some other}} breeds. The fold of the ear can prevent air from entering, and it also creates a warm, moist environment where organisms can grow. <b>Otitis</b> <b>externa</b> is an inflammation of the ear canal which {{can be caused by}} a variety of factors including parasites, microorganisms, foreign bodies, tumors, and underlying dermatological disease. Ear mites can cause otitis externa; ticks and fleas can also live in dogs' ear canals.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of canine <b>externa</b> <b>otitis</b> in Fortaleza-Ceará is reported. About 91. 5 % {{of the animals}} with clinical signs were positive to bacterial culture. Among all infections, 49. 5 % were mixed infections and the most common pathogens were Staphylococcus spp coagulase negative or positive and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The most effective antimicrobials for Staphylococcus coagulase negative were: the quinolones, the aminoglicoside netilmycin and the beta-lactams, excepted ampicillin, penicillin and oxacilin; for Staphylococcus coagulase positive were: cefotoxin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, imipenem, netilmycin and cephatoxin; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa were: ciprofloxacin, tobramycin and imipenem...|$|R
40|$|A 7 -year-old male entire West Highland white terrier was {{referred}} to the Small Animal Hospital at the University of Glasgow for bilateral, chronic, medically unresponsive <b>otitis</b> media and <b>externa.</b> A history of cranio-mandibular osteopathy was also reported. Bilateral total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy was performed {{with the aid of}} a pneumatic burr. Extensive bone proliferation was present bilaterally originating from the caudal mandibular ramus and tympanic bulla which incorporated the horizontal canal on each side. The right facial nerve was identified leaving the stylomastoid foramen and running in a cranial direction through a 1. 5 cm diameter cuff of bone surrounding the horizontal canal and external acoustic meatus. Despite careful dissection, a facial nerve neurotmesis ensued which required microsurgical epineurial repair. Neurologic examination performed 12 h post-operatively revealed abnormalities consistent with right facial nerve paralysis. At 3 months, the facial nerve function was found to have improved significantly and was assessed to be normal four months after surgery. To the authors’ knowledge, this clinical communication described the first reported clinical case where unilateral facial nerve paralysis resulting from iatrogenic facial nerve neurotmesis was successfully treated by microsurgical epineurial repair...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} ceftriaxone in 50 adults with serious infections, usually giving 1 g every 12 h. Of the 35 patients who could be evaluated for clinical efficacy, 15 had failed on previous therapy, 15 had nosocomial infections, and all but 1 had underlying diseases. One patient had three sites of infection. Favorable responses were seen in 34 of 37 infections, including 11 of 13 respiratory tract infections, all 7 urinary tract infections, all 12 skin and soft tissue infections, 1 of 2 bone and joint infections, a catheter-related septicemia, a liver abscess, and an <b>otitis</b> media and <b>externa.</b> Favorable bacteriological responses were seen for 48 of 58 organisms. This included 6 of 7 Staphylococcus aureus strains, 14 of 16 other aerobic gram-positive cocci, 18 of 20 Enterobacteriaceae, 6 of 9 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1 of 2 anaerobes. Peak plasma ceftriaxone levels on day 1 were 152 micrograms/ml by bioassay and 78 micrograms/ml by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Four of the 31 initial isolates of aerobic gram-negative rods developed resistance to ceftriaxone on disk diffusion testing. Diarrhea occurred in 3 of 50 patients. All three had received a higher than usual dose. Drug administration was stopped twice, once for a thrombocytopenia and once for a thrombocytopenia with leukopenia. Neither problem could be attributed exclusively to ceftriaxone. Other adverse reactions were eosinophilia, abdominal pain, inguinal candidiasis, and nonsuppurative phlebitis. Even among debilitated adults, ceftriaxone was safe and effective in a twice daily regimen...|$|R
5|$|The Welsh Springer is {{generally}} a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like other dogs with pendulous ears, they {{are prone to}} ear infections such as <b>otitis</b> <b>externa.</b> In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of canine ear infections {{are caused by}} microorganisms, {{including}} yeast and bacterial infections. The most common variety of this is Malassezia pachydermatitis. Symptoms can include the dog shaking its head or scratching at its ears more frequently. The ear canal will appear inflamed, a pus-like substance will be discharged in some cases, and the ear will smell quite pungent in most cases. Treatment for the more common causes of <b>otitis</b> <b>externa</b> in dogs often includes oral antibiotics and flushing the ears with an antibacterial solution. In some cases, anti-inflammatory medication is prescribed. Some conditions can increase the chance of ear infections, including living in a humid environment and frequent swimming or bathing without adequate drying of the ear afterwards. Keeping {{the hair on the}} ears short {{can be used as a}} preventative method to ear problems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Otitis</b> <b>externa</b> {{responds}} well to treatment, but complications {{may occur}} {{if it is}} not treated. Individuals with underlying diabetes, disorders of the immune system, or history of radiation therapy {{to the base of the}} skull are more likely to develop complications, including malignant <b>otitis</b> <b>externa.</b> In these individuals, rapid examination by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat physician) is very important.|$|E
25|$|Avoid {{inserting}} anything {{into the}} ear canal: use of cotton buds or swabs {{is the most}} common event leading to acute <b>otitis</b> <b>externa.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Otitis</b> <b>externa</b> may be acute (lasting {{less than}} six weeks) or chronic (lasting more than three months). Acute cases are {{typically}} due to bacterial infection, and chronic cases are often due to allergies and autoimmune disorders. Risk factors for acute cases include swimming, minor trauma from cleaning, using hearing aids and ear plugs, and other skin problems, such as psoriasis and dermatitis. People with diabetes {{are at risk of}} a severe form of malignant <b>otitis</b> <b>externa.</b> Diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms. Culturing the ear canal may be useful in chronic or severe cases.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{solutions}} for the ear canal include acidifying and drying agents, used either singly or in combination. When the ear canal skin is inflamed from the acute <b>otitis</b> <b>externa,</b> the use of dilute acetic acid may be painful.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>otitis</b> <b>externa</b> is high. In the Netherlands, {{it has been}} estimated at 12–14 per 1000 population per year, and has been shown to affect more than 1% of a sample of the population in the United Kingdom over a 12-month period.|$|E
25|$|<b>Otitis</b> <b>externa,</b> {{also called}} swimmer's ear, is {{inflammation}} of the ear canal. It often presents with ear pain, swelling of the ear canal, and occasionally decreased hearing. Typically there is pain with movement of the outer ear. A high fever is typically not present except in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|Antifungal {{medications}} such as imidazole, nystatin and natamycin {{may be used}} {{to treat}} infections. The former functions by weakening the fungal cell wall, while the latter two disrupt permeability of the plasma membrane. In canine infection causing <b>otitis</b> <b>externa</b> the ear canal may be cleaned using an ear cleansing solution often paired with the removal of surrounding hair.|$|E
25|$|Swimming in {{polluted}} {{water is a}} common way to contract swimmer's ear, {{but it is also}} possible to contract swimmer's ear from water trapped in the ear canal after a shower, especially in a humid climate. Constriction of the ear canal from bone growth (Surfer's ear) can trap debris leading to infection. Saturation divers have reported <b>Otitis</b> <b>externa</b> during occupational exposure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Otitis</b> <b>externa</b> affects 1–3% {{of people}} a year; more than 95% of cases are acute. About 10% {{of people are}} {{affected}} {{at some point in}} their lives. It occurs most commonly among children between the ages of seven and twelve and among the elderly. It occurs with near equal frequency in males and females. Those who live in warm and wet climates are more often affected.|$|E
25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis forms {{cutaneous}} and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis, {{which most}} commonly affect {{the face and}} neck. Indeed, the fungus was originally isolated from {{the skin of a}} patient with lesions on their cheek, neck, and ear. Cells isolated from cutaneous infections are often spherical, and may form toruloid or moniliform chains. Exophiala dermatitidis has been implicated various superficial infections including onychomycosis, <b>otitis</b> <b>externa,</b> and eye infections causing keratitis.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics by mouth {{should not}} be used to treat {{uncomplicated}} acute <b>otitis</b> <b>externa.</b> Antibiotics by mouth are not a sufficient response to bacteria which cause this condition and have significant side effects including increased risk of opportunistic infection. In contrast, topical products can treat this condition. Oral anti-pseudomonal antibiotics can be used in case of severe soft tissue swelling extending into the face and neck and may hasten recovery.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>externa,</b> acute <b>otitis</b> <b>externa</b> (AOE) is predominantly a bacterial infection, occurs suddenly, rapidly worsens, and becomes painful. [...] The ear canal has an abundant nerve supply, so the pain is often severe enough to interfere with sleep. [...] Wax in the ear can combine with the swelling of the canal skin and the associated pus to block the canal and dampen hearing, creating a temporary conductive hearing loss. In more severe or untreated cases, the infection can spread to the soft tissues of the face that surround the adjacent parotid gland and the jaw joint, making chewing painful. In its mildest forms, <b>otitis</b> <b>externa</b> is so common that some {{ear nose and throat}} physicians have suggested that most people will have at least a brief episode at some point in life. While a small percentage of people seem to have an innate tendency toward chronic <b>otitis</b> <b>externa,</b> most people can avoid <b>otitis</b> <b>externa</b> altogether once they understand the intricate mechanisms of the disease.|$|E

2500|$|MOE {{follows a}} much more chronic and {{indolent}} course than ordinary acute <b>otitis</b> <b>externa.</b> There may be granulation involving {{the floor of the}} external ear canal, most often at the bony-cartilaginous junction. [...] Paradoxically, the physical findings of MOE, at least in its early stages, are often much less dramatic than those of ordinary acute <b>otitis</b> <b>externa.</b> In later stages, there can be soft tissue swelling around the ear, {{even in the absence of}} significant canal swelling. While fever and leukocytosis might be expected in response to bacterial infection invading the skull region, MOE does not cause fever or elevation of white blood count.|$|E
2500|$|Necrotizing {{external}} otitis (malignant <b>otitis</b> <b>externa)</b> is {{an uncommon}} form of external otitis that occurs mainly in elderly diabetics, being somewhat more likely and more severe when the diabetes is poorly controlled. Even less commonly, it can develop {{due to a}} severely compromised immune system. Beginning as infection of the external ear canal, there {{is an extension of}} the infection into the bony ear canal and the soft tissues deep to the bony canal. Unrecognized and untreated, it may result in death. The hallmark of malignant <b>otitis</b> <b>externa</b> (MOE) is unrelenting pain that interferes with sleep and persists even after swelling of the external ear canal may have resolved with topical antibiotic treatment. [...] It can also cause skull base osteomyelitis (SBO), manifested by multiple cranial nerve palsies, described below under the [...] "Treatment" [...] heading.|$|E
2500|$|During the Tektite Project in 1969 {{there was}} a great deal of <b>otitis</b> <b>externa.</b> [...] The Diving Medical Officer devised a {{prophylaxis}} that came to be known as, [...] "Tektite Solution", equal parts of 15% tannic acid, 15% acetic acid and 50% isopropanol or ethanol. During Tektite ethanol was used because it was available in the lab for pickling specimens.|$|E
2500|$|Rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, and {{disinfecting}} pads typically {{contain a}} 60–70% solution of isopropyl alcohol in water. Water {{is required to}} open up membrane pores of bacteria, which acts as a gateway inside for isopropyl. [...] A 75% v/v solution in water {{may be used as}} a hand sanitizer. Isopropyl alcohol is used as a water-drying aid for the prevention of <b>otitis</b> <b>externa,</b> better known as swimmer’s ear.|$|E
2500|$|Ear drops are the mainstays of {{treatment}} for external otitis. [...] Some contain antibiotics, either antibacterial or antifungal, and others are simply designed to mildly acidify the ear canal environment to discourage bacterial growth. Some prescription drops also contain anti-inflammatory steroids, which help to resolve swelling and itching. [...] Although {{there is evidence that}} steroids are effective at reducing the length {{of treatment}} time required, fungal <b>otitis</b> <b>externa</b> (also called otomycosis) may be caused or aggravated by overly prolonged use of steroid-containing drops.|$|E
2500|$|Malessezia pachydermatis is an {{important}} pathogen in veterinary medicine. It {{has been known to}} become pathogenic to its host causing otitis and seborrhoeic dermatitis. First associated with canine <b>otitis</b> <b>externa</b> in 1955 by Benght A. Gustafson, this yeast has since become {{an important}} pathogen especially in the study of small animal medicine. Symptoms include excessive scratching, head shaking, odour, and reddish-brown waxy deposits within the ear canal. Malassezia pachydermatis caused canine seborrhoeic dermatitis was first discovered by Dufait in 1975 and may be characterized by symptoms ranging from dandruff to scaly lesions. At infection sites sebaceous secretions are increased. Differences to susceptibility can be seen across breeds for example, increased infection among the West Highland White Terrier has been attributed to [...] a genetic abnormality.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{ordinary}} <b>otitis</b> <b>externa,</b> MOE requires oral or intravenous antibiotics for cure. Pseudomonas is {{the most}} common offending pathogen. [...] Diabetes control is also an essential part of treatment. [...] When MOE goes unrecognized and untreated, the infection continues to smolder and over weeks or months can spread deeper into the head and involve the bones of the skull base, constituting skull base osteomyelitis (SBO). Multiple cranial nerve palsies can result, including the facial nerve (causing facial palsy), the recurrent laryngeal nerve (causing vocal cord paralysis) , and the cochlear nerve (causing deafness). The infecting organism is almost always pseudomonas aeruginosa, but it can instead be fungal (aspergillus or mucor). MOE and SBO are not amenable to surgery, but exploratory surgery may facilitate the culture of unusual organism(s) that are not responding to empirically used anti-pseudomonal antibiotics (ciprofloxacin being the drug of choice). [...] The usual surgical finding is diffuse cellulitis without localized abscess formation. [...] SBO can extend into the petrous apex of the temporal bone or more inferiorly into {{the opposite side of the}} skull base.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{the most}} common cause of infections of burn {{injuries}} and of the outer ear (<b>otitis</b> <b>externa),</b> and {{is the most}} frequent colonizer of medical devices (e.g., catheters). Pseudomonas can be spread by equipment that gets contaminated and is not properly cleaned or on the hands of healthcare workers. [...] Pseudomonas can, in rare circumstances, cause community-acquired pneumonias, as well as ventilator-associated pneumonias, being one of the most common agents isolated in several studies. Pyocyanin is a virulence factor of the bacteria and has been known to cause death in C. elegans by oxidative stress. However, [...] salicylic acid can inhibit pyocyanin production. One in ten hospital-acquired infections is from Pseudomonas. Cystic fibrosis patients are also predisposed to P. aeruginosa infection of the lungs. P. aeruginosa may also be a common cause of [...] "hot-tub rash" [...] (dermatitis), caused by lack of proper, periodic attention to water quality. Since these bacteria like moist environments, such as hot tubs and swimming pools, they can cause skin rash or swimmer's ear. [...] Pseudomonas is also a common cause of postoperative infection in radial keratotomy surgery patients. The organism is also associated with the skin lesion ecthyma gangrenosum. P. aeruginosa is frequently associated with osteomyelitis involving puncture wounds of the foot, believed to result from direct inoculation with P. aeruginosa via the foam padding found in tennis shoes, with diabetic patients at a higher risk.|$|E
