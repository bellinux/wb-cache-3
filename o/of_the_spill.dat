5|$|As waterbirds {{that feed}} on fish, {{pelicans}} are highly susceptible to oil spills, both directly by being oiled {{and by the}} impact on their food resources. A 2007 report to the California Fish and Game Commission estimated that, during the previous 20 years, some 500–1000 brown pelicans had been affected by oil spills in California. A 2011 report by the Center for Biological Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b>|$|E
25|$|The massive {{environmental}} and financial costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> {{have resulted in}} an ongoing inquiry into how a structurally deficient ship was able to travel out to sea, much less approach Spain.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill,</b> Abbott told The 7.30 Report that Hewson should be remembered for his first three years as leader when he united the party following divisions with the Peacock-Howard rivalry and not for his last twelve months.|$|E
25|$|VECO was {{responsible}} for large parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill's</b> clean up, hiring 2,500 workers {{to clean up the}} environmental disaster.|$|R
30|$|When the leakage hole {{diameter}} was 0.01  m, <b>the</b> vertical displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil {{was small and}} remained almost constant during diffusion.|$|R
30|$|The {{higher the}} water-surface wind velocity, {{the greater the}} maximum {{vertical}} displacement. The water-surface wind velocity had no significant influence on <b>the</b> horizontal displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil.|$|R
25|$|Ten {{species that}} are at risk as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> have been listed by The National Geographic Traveler. These species are the Irrawady dolphins, Bengal tigers, leopards, great egrets, rhesus macaques, {{northern}} river terrapins, black-capped kingfishers, chitals, saltwater crocodiles, and horseshoe crabs.|$|E
25|$|By {{observing the}} {{thickness}} of the film of oil and its appearance {{on the surface of the}} water, it is possible to estimate the quantity of oil spilled. If the surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> is also known, the total volume of the oil can be calculated.|$|E
25|$|A study {{into the}} {{long-term}} {{effect of the}} oil spill on bird numbers found that certain species, in particular the American coot, had shown a significant decline. However, {{this could have been}} due to external factors, such as that year's occurrence of El Niño, so the overall impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> was deemed impossible to determine.|$|E
30|$|Under {{different}} {{water flow}} velocities, <b>the</b> maximum value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizontal displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil increased linearly. The faster the water flow, the more significant the horizontal displacement variation.|$|R
30|$|When {{the initial}} leakage {{velocity}} was different, the maximum horizontal displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil increased linearly. The greater the initial leakage velocity, {{the larger the}} horizontal displacement increase rate.|$|R
30|$|With various leakage hole diameters, {{both the}} maximum {{horizontal}} and vertical displacements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil followed linearly increasing tendencies. The greater the leakage hole diameter, the greater the diffusion displacement increase rate.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to independent attempts at {{sampling of the}} water quality and the taking of photos, the TVA illegally detained, for approximately one hour, {{two members of the}} Knoxville, Tennessee-based environmental organization United Mountain Defense who were traversing public land in the area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill,</b> and cited three other individuals, warning them that any attempt to enter the public waterway again would lead to prosecution.|$|E
25|$|The Economic Relations Division of the Bangladesh {{government}} sent {{a letter}} to the United Nation's Bangladesh office on 15 December 2014, asking for help in the oil collection efforts. The United Nations accepted the request, and a team from the UNEP and OCHA went to the site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b> A team from the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination arrived in the Dhaka to support the cleanup efforts.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days after}} the initial blast, there were five {{successive}} explosions in a ten-minute window. These explosions greatly increased the rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> from the tanker into the water. By {{the end of that}} day (June 11) the tanker stern had dropped 58 feet and had stabilized five feet above the water line. This was either due to shifting cargo or the tanker taking on water, which would be an indication of the vessel’s imminent sinking.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{increase}} <b>of</b> {{vertical displacement}} {{was divided into}} two parts. Within 1  s <b>of</b> leakage, <b>the</b> vertical displacement increased quickly and then slowed. When the initial leakage velocity was relatively low (under 10  m/s), <b>the</b> vertical displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil remained almost constant after 1  s.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} the images above, <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil mostly {{diffused}} along the river-bottom water flow direction in a horizontal manner under <b>the</b> combined action <b>of</b> wind and water, and the frontier oil droplets were dispersed quickly by the water flow. The smaller the wind speed, the smaller <b>the</b> horizontal displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil. In <b>the</b> vertical direction, oil columns formed around the leakage hole under <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> buoyancy.|$|R
30|$|As {{displayed}} in the above images, the faster the water flow, the more difficult <b>the</b> formation <b>of</b> a continuous jet-flow, the lower the oil column, and the greater <b>the</b> horizontal displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil. With a decrease of water flow velocity, the oil column height increased, and the frontier oil droplets presented an obvious increasing tendency under <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> buoyancy, i.e. <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> water buoyancy force on <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil became more obvious.|$|R
25|$|On December 26, 2008 the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation {{stated that}} it was {{satisfied}} with the water quality in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> but that {{it will continue to}} examine and deal with the potential for chronic health effects. Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen toured the spill site on December 31, 2008. The U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the TVA, held a hearing on January 8 to examine the disaster. The environmental activist Erin Brockovich was invited to Tennessee to survey the disaster site, and announced plans to visit during the second week of January 2009.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimated}} 620 tonnes of {{ammonium nitrate}} and 250 tonnes of fuel spilled {{out of the}} ship. The spilled fuel initially covered an area about 5.5km (3.4mi) long and 500m (1,600ft) wide. Although ammonium nitrate is not harmful to the environment, the high concentration was proposed to have the capability of suffocating marine life in the area. The oil spill continued to expand in coverage, affecting five beaches and forcing several other beach areas to shut down. By 13 March, the oil covered an estimated 40km (25mi) of coastline and was several centimetres thick in places. The coverage and depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> led Anna Bligh to state that the crew members of the ship were likely understating the amount of fuel that leaked out.|$|E
25|$|The spill had {{a severe}} {{impact on the}} coastal area {{surrounding}} Madinat 'al-Jubayl as Sinaiyah, the major industrial and population center newly planned and built by the Saudi government. The spill threatened industrial facilities in 'Al Jubayl because of the seawater cooling system for primary industries and threatened the supply of potable water produced by seawater-fed desalination plants. The 'Al Jubayl community harbor and Abu Ali Island, which juts into the gulf immediately north of 'Al Jubayl, experienced the greatest pollution, with the main effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> concentrated in mangrove areas and shrimp grounds. Large numbers of marine birds, such as cormorants, grebes, and auks, were killed when their plumage was coated with oil. In addition, beaches along the entire 'Al Jubayl coastline were covered with oil and tar balls.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{vertical}} displacement could {{be divided into}} two parts. Within 1  s <b>of</b> diffusion, <b>the</b> {{vertical displacement}} increased sharply, but slowed after 1  s of diffusion. During a water flow velocity <b>of</b> 2  m/s, <b>the</b> vertical displacement increase was the fastest. The faster the water flow, the smaller <b>the</b> vertical displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil.|$|R
2500|$|According to {{official}} reports, {{the ship was}} carrying [...] of oil, of which about [...] were <b>spilled</b> into <b>the</b> Prince William Sound. An approximate figure of [...] was a commonly accepted estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill's</b> volume and {{has been used by}} <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> Alaska's Exxon Valdez Oil <b>Spill</b> Trustee Council, <b>the</b> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and environmental groups such as Greenpeace and the Sierra Club.|$|R
40|$|In {{the thesis}} we discuss changes in {{viscosity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oil <b>spills</b> in <b>the</b> marine environment. After <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> <b>the</b> following processes occur: evaporation, emulsification, mechanical spreading, dissolution, dispersion, oxidation, sedimentation and biological degradation. Evaporation, emulsification {{and the environmental}} factors, the change in temperature and the wind, have the greatest influence in Mackay's methods for calculating <b>the</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil. With <b>the</b> three Mackay's empirical equations we can determine the oil viscosity {{at a given time}} after <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> from different input data. Evaporation is calculated according to the Fingas method, based on laboratory experiments and empirical equations wherein dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evaporation from temperature and the time is given. With the newly developed model VISKOZNOST we can simply and quickly calculate <b>the</b> viscosity <b>of</b> several different oil types in given environmental conditions. <b>The</b> application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model is presented on two types of oil: Brent Blend and Maui. The oil viscosity is an important parameter in oil <b>spill</b> studies and <b>the</b> developed model {{can be used as a}} useful tool in <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teaching process...|$|R
25|$|The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{initially}} {{estimated that}} the spill released 1.7 million cubic yards (1.3 million m³) of sludge, which is gray in color. After an aerial survey, the official estimate was more than tripled to 5.4 million cubic yards (4 millionm³) on December 25, 2008. The spill covered surrounding land with up to six feet (1.8 m) of sludge. The EPA first {{estimated that the}} spill would take {{four to six weeks}} to clean up; however, Chandra Taylor, the staff attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the cleanup could take months and possibly years. As of June 2009, six months following the spill, only 3% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill</b> had been cleaned and is now estimated to cost between $675 and $975 million to clean, according to the TVA.|$|E
25|$|A 183m (600ft) {{cargo ship}} called the MV Pacific Adventurer was {{carrying}} 60 containers of ammonium nitrate when it encountered rough seas produced by Hamish, while located about 13km (8mi) east of Cape Moreton. The incident occurred near to a marine animal park, which {{is home to}} endangered species. Around 3:15a.m. EST on 11 March, 31 of the containers spilled into the sea along with {{a large amount of}} heavy fuel, causing {{the surface of the water}} to become slick. Officials attempted to contain the oil spill, but the rough seas prevented easy containment. Environmentalist warned that the oil could have a significant impact on the local wildlife. One of the containers damaged the hull as it fell off the ship. After divers inspected the ship for the source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill,</b> two holes were found. One, located just above the waterline, was 10mm (0.4in) long 15mm (0.6in) wide. The second and larger hole was located underneath the ship. The length of it was about 1m (1.3ft) and the width was 300mm (11.8in).|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} environmental {{repercussions of}} oil production became {{clear in the}} Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989. On March 24, the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound, releasing 11 million gallons of crude oil into the water, spreading along 1,100miles (1,800km) of shoreline. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, at least 300,000 sea birds, 2,000 otters, and other marine animals died because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b> Exxon spent US$2 billion on cleaning {{up in the first}} year alone. Exxon, working with state and federal agencies, continued its cleanup into the early 1990s. Government studies show that the oil and the cleaning process itself did long-term harm to the ecology of the Sound, interfering with the reproduction of birds and animals in ways that still aren't fully understood. Prince William Sound seems to have recuperated, but scientists still dispute the extent of the recovery. In a civil settlement, Exxon agreed to pay $900 million in ten annual payments, plus an additional $100 million for newly discovered damages. In a class action suit against Exxon, a jury awarded punitive damages of US$5 billion, but as of 2008 no money has been disbursed and appellate litigation continues.|$|E
500|$|Many {{officials}} and scientists said {{at first the}} tar balls appearance might be a coincidence unrelated to <b>the</b> <b>spill.</b> Coal Oil Point is very close and well known for <b>the</b> offshore seepage <b>of</b> oil at about [...] a day. Tar balls continued {{to show up on}} beaches farther down the coast in Los Angeles County including Malibu and the South Bay beaches on Santa Monica Bay. [...] When tested, a tar ball recovered in the South Bay at Manhattan Beach matched <b>the</b> chemical signature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil. Cleanup crews responded even farther south to beaches in Orange County.|$|R
30|$|The maximum {{diffusion}} displacements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilled</b> oil in {{both the}} horizontal and vertical directions increased linearly under all wind velocity conditions. The reason for this phenomenon is that <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> a wind field on the water’s surface can accelerated <b>the</b> leeward diffusion <b>of</b> oil films and the faster the wind speed is, the faster the oil film expands. Therefore, <b>the</b> vertical displacement <b>of</b> leakage oil will be reduced {{in the same time}} period.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} methods are used to avert <b>the</b> evil omen <b>of</b> <b>spilt</b> salt. <b>The</b> most common {{contemporary}} belief requires you to toss a pinch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilt</b> salt over your left shoulder, into <b>the</b> face <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Devil who lurks there. A 17th-century report discusses the folk belief that spilling wine is a lucky sign, and mentions a diner who spilt salt and became quite agitated until a waiter had poured wine into his lap.|$|R
25|$|Bears {{were not}} {{directly}} harmed by the Exxon Valdez {{oil spill in}} 1989, although some were displaced from traditional feeding and traveling areas by cleanup crews. No one was injured by a bear, and no Kodiak bears were killed. To mitigate the adverse impacts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spill,</b> Exxon reached a settlement with {{the state and federal}} governments. Paradoxically, the impacts of the oil spill and the subsequent cleanup and settlement proved to be beneficial to bears on Kodiak. Bear-safety training exposed thousands of workers to factual information about bears, and money from the settlement fund was used for funding land acquisitions. By the close of the 20th century, over 80% of the refuge lands that had been lost as a result of ANCSA and ANILCA were reinstated into the refuge, either through direct purchase or by means of conservation easements. Lands were also purchased in America, Westtown, and Shuyak Islands and transferred into state ownership. The Kodiak Brown Bear Trust coordinated a coalition of sportsmen and other wildlife conservation groups from around the nation to lobby for use of settlement funds to acquire Kodiak lands. The groups also directly contributed funding to protect small parcels of important bear habitat around the islands.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} to all, <b>the</b> <b>spilling</b> <b>of</b> {{pipeline}} may cause serious problems, especially when the pipe conveying petroleum, natural gas or other toxic substance. There are countless accidents during past century. Once <b>the</b> <b>spilling</b> occurs, <b>the</b> vibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipe would aggravate spill situation and even result in crack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pipe. The consequence will be more severe when the fluid inside is compressible. To prevent <b>the</b> detriment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spilling</b> model is developed by assuming the leakages as orifices or nozzles and a 2 -D vertical simply supported pipe is selected to analyze <b>the</b> phenomena <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oscillation.
