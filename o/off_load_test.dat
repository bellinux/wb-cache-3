40|$|For {{existing}} bridges {{with large}} uncertainties, analytical methods have limitations. Therefore, to reduce these uncertainties, field testing of a bridge can be used. A type {{of such a}} field test is a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> in which a load equivalent to the factored live load is applied. If the bridge can carry this load without signs of distress, the proof <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is successful, {{and it has been}} shown experimentally that the bridge fulfils the code requirements. It should be understood that this method for assessment is different from the diagnostic <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> that are carried out in Ecuador prior to opening a bridge. The loads used for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are significantly larger. Therefore, it is important to instrument the bridge for a proof <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> and to evaluate during the <b>test</b> that the <b>load</b> does not result in permanent damage to the bridge. To research this topic, and to develop recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests,</b> a series of proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> and a collapse test were carried out in the Netherlands. Additional laboratory testing was carried out as well. Based on this information, recommendations for proof <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> of reinforced concrete slab bridges have been developed for the failure modes of flexure and shear. In the German and North American guidelines for <b>load</b> <b>testing,</b> <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> for shear is not permitted. However, many existing bridges do not fulfil the requirements for shear upon assessment according to the current live load models. Even though more experimental research is needed to develop proof <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> for shear in a guideline or code for the Netherlands, the currently available research results already lead to interesting conclusions with regard to the behaviour of bridges proof <b>load</b> <b>tested</b> in shear, and the required safety margin to avoid damage to the bridge.

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} {{believed}} that the static <b>load</b> <b>test</b> is the most reliable method to obtain the load-settlement relation of a pile. Most static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted using reaction piles as the reaction system. However, some researches {{point out that the}} influence of the reaction piles on the measured load-settlement relation may not be neglected, and that an analysis of the measured data is required to obtain a true load-settlement of the. From this point of view, the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> or the rapid <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> may not be necessarily inferior to the static <b>load</b> <b>test,</b> considering cost and time performance of the dynamic <b>load</b> <b>test</b> as well. In this study, a new computer program for analysing the stress-wave propagation phenomena in pile driving was developed using a finite difference scheme and rational soil resistance models. Verification analyses of the proposed method are conducted first, and then the developed method is applied to the dynamic and static <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> on an end-bearing concrete pile...|$|R

40|$|Ultra-Large-Scale (ULS) systems face {{continuously}} evolving field workloads {{in terms}} of activated/disabled feature sets, varying usage patterns and changing deployment configura-tions. These evolving workloads often have a large impact {{on the performance of}} a ULS system. Hence, continuous <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> is critical to ensuring the error-free operation of such systems. A common challenge facing performance analysts is to validate if a <b>load</b> <b>test</b> closely resembles the current field workloads. Such validation may be performed by comparing execution logs from the <b>load</b> <b>test</b> and the field. However, the size and unstructured nature of execution logs makes such a comparison unfeasible without automated support.

40|$|Structural {{rehabilitation}} {{is regularly}} undertaken to diagnose and repair a building during its service life; this practice ensures that buildings operate under {{safe and reliable}} conditions. Engineers generally rely on existing drawings, site investigation findings, and engineering judgement to assess the serviceability and ultimate capacity of a structure. Another approach to evaluating an existing structure is {{through the use of}} a structural <b>load</b> <b>test.</b> Under the authority of the American Concrete Institute (ACI), there are two structural <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> code provisions that exist: ACI 437. 2 - 13 and Chapter 27 of ACI 318 - 14. Although both provisions provide requirements and guidelines for <b>load</b> <b>testing,</b> there are distinct differences in the <b>test</b> <b>load</b> magnitudes, loading protocols, and acceptance criteria. The primary purpose of this research was to develop an understanding of reliability-based <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> safety concepts in the context of the current provisions of ACI 437. 2 - 13 and ACI 318 Chapter 27. Based on these findings, enhanced, diagnostic insight into the assessment of the outcomes of structural <b>load</b> <b>testing</b> was obtained.
