Do you know why and how the Confessional arose? Have you looked, for instance, into the old middle-age Penitentials? If so, you must be aware that it arose in an age of coarseness, which seems now inconceivable; in those barbarous times when the lower classes of Europe, slaves or serfs, especially in remote country districts, lived lives little better than those of the monkeys in the forest, and committed habitually the most fearful crimes, without any clear notion that they were doing wrong: while the upper classes, to judge from the literature which they have left, were so coarse, and often so profligate, in spite of nobler instincts and a higher sense of duty, that the purest and justest spirits among them had again and again to flee from their own class into the cloister or the hermit's cell.|$|E

In Vietnamese, the glottal stop has a distributional restriction in that it occurs only syllable-initially.

Whether /w / is a segment, a secondary feature of the initial consonant, or a prosodic feature is an <b>open</b> <b>matter.</b> Its questionable status relates to a third question: Do triphthongs really exist in Vietnamese ʔ. This paper addresses these three interrelated issues and argues that /w / is an independent phoneme, the initial glottal stop is best treated as a phoneme, and such triphthongs are phonetic...|$|E

40|$|Upon {{incubation}} of UDP-N-acetyl[14 C]glucosamine and GDP-mannose with rough microsomes from rat liver, GlcNAc incorporation occurred mostly into acid-labile products extractable by chloroform/methanol {{that were}} {{presumed to be}} dolichol pyrophosphate GlcNAc and, for a small part, dolichol pyrophosphate N,N'-diacetylchitobiose. The production of this latter glycolipid was greatly enhanced when rough microsomes, previously treated with pyrophosphate, were incubated {{in the presence of}} GTP. Furthermore, under these particular conditions, high levels of radioactivity were obtained in products precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and not extracted by chloroform/methanol. The label appeared in acid-labile and in acid-resistant products, presumed to be dolichol pyrophosphate mannosylated oligosaccharides, and glycoproteins, respectively. From these results, dolichol pyrophosphate N,N'-diacetylchitobiose appears to be an obligate metabolic intermediate in protein glycosylation by this system. Whether or not dolichol pyrophosphate N,N'-diacetylchitobiose must be mannosylated prior to transfer of the N,N'-diacetylchitobiose moiety to protein is an <b>open</b> <b>matter,</b> because GlcNAc was also incorporated into acid-resistant products when the reaction was carried out in absence of GDP-mannose...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the semantics of knowledge attributions(K-claims, for short) and proposes a position holding that K-claims are contextsensitive that differs from extant views on the market. First I lay down the data a semantic theory for K-claims needs to explain. Next I present and assess three views purporting to give the semantics for K-claims: contextualism, subject-sensitive invariantism and relativism. All three views are found wanting with respect to their accounting for the data. I then propose a hybrid view according to which the relevant epistemic standards for evaluating K-claims are neither those at the context of the subject (subject-sensitive invariantism), nor those at the context of the assessor (relativism), but it is itself an <b>open</b> <b>matter.</b> However, given that we need a principled way of deciding which epistemic standards are the relevant ones, I provide a principle according to which the relevant standards are those that are the highest between those at the context of the subject and those at the context of the assessor/attributor.

40|$|Presently, IEEE 802. 11 based {{wireless}} {{local area}} networks (WLAN) {{have been widely}} deployed for business and personal applications. The main issue regarding wireless network technology is handoff or hand over management, especially in urban areas, due to the limited coverage of access points (APs) or base stations (BS). When a mobile station (MS) moves outside the range of its current access point (AP) it needs to perform a link layer handover. This causes data loss and interruption in communication. Many people have applied efficient location management techniques {{in the literature of}} next generation wireless system (NGWS). However, seamless handover management still remains an <b>open</b> <b>matter</b> of research. Here we propose a method to minimize the handoff failure probability by effectively placing a wireless local area network (WLAN) AP in the handoff region between two neighboring cells. The WLAN coverage, on one hand, provides an additional coverage in the low signal strength region, and on the other hand, relieves the congestion in the cellular network. Moreover, we perform the channel scanning (required for horizontal handover between the two base stations) within the WLAN coverage area, thus minimizing the handoff failure due to scanning delay...|$|E

40|$|Internet {{is moving}} towards {{the time of}} Quality of Service (QoS) networking. This move is taking place through the {{application}} of Differentiated Services (DiffServ) architecture. DiffServ offers low overhead tools to implement class based differentiation for the traffic. Decision of differentiation is, however, left as an <b>open</b> <b>matter,</b> to be settled between service provider and customer. Majority of customers are, based on our assumption, not ready to say what should be the quality or class for their traffic. This leaves space for provider intervention - service, to do this classification for the customer. Service provider is dealing with three problems which need to be solved concurrently: (1) Deciding the proper forwarding class for the application data stream (2) Separation of application flows from the packet stream (3) Constructing proper forwarding treatments. If successful with this operation, operator has direct control over the resource utilization within different classes and therefore service level provided to the customer. In order to cope with this service, tools for analyzing network traffic and forming suitable traffic groups are required. We present algorithms and methodologies which do differentiation of traffic based on the activity/traffic characteristics of applications. These values are determined from the flow analysis of packet lengths and inter-sending times...|$|E

This project work brings {{a new approach to}} sense and detect fake fingers, based on the analysis of fingerprint pores and its extraction. Making fake fingerprint now days an <b>open</b> <b>matter</b> for identifying fingerprint systems. In this case submitting an artificial fingerprint clone from a genuine user. Present sensors provide an image which is then processed as a “true ” fingerprint. this i s so- called 3 rd-level features, namely, pores, which are visible in high-resolution fingerprint image mostly 500 / 1000 ppi, have been used for matching. In this paper, we propose to analyze pores location for characterizing the “liveness ” of fingerprints. There are several features identifying a fingerprint which is Level- 1 (pattern), Level- 2 Minutia, Lvel- 3 (Pores and ridge counters). AFIS (Automated Fingerprint Identification System currently uses level 1 and level 2 features. The 3 level features allow you to scan 1000 ppi and extract all features along with pores and ridges using gabor and transform filters. It also uses the dual matching logic where we can user the combination of finger + face/iris to authenticate or prevent spoofing...|$|E

30|$|The {{first model}} that we {{considered}} is a self-coupled neuron model featuring I_NaP, I_CAN and the Na^+/K^+-pump current. An {{aspect of this}} model that is more biologically realistic than previous models studied in [15] and [23] is the inclusion of bidirectional coupling between voltage and calcium dynamics. In Sect.  3, we extended and applied analysis methods from [15] to the Jasinski model (1 a)–(1 g) and explained the mechanisms underlying its SB solutions. While the bidirectional coupling between V and Ca_i {{as well as more}} detailed Ca^ 2 + dynamics make the implementation of the decomposition method more difficult than in past work on similar models, fast-slow averaging allowed us to complete the analysis. Besides describing specific details of the SB solution features, we have also investigated whether this solution fundamentally involves three timescales. Unlike the MB solution in [13 – 15], our analysis shows that SB solution features are lost under the natural groupings to two timescales, supporting the preliminary conclusion that SB dynamics in system (1 a)–(1 g) requires at least three timescales. A more rigorous demonstration of this requirement is still an <b>open</b> <b>matter,</b> and indeed rigorous proofs that particular solution types can only occur when three (or more) timescales are present have not, to our knowledge, been provided in the literature to date.|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} role of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in thyroid cancer {{remains an}} <b>open</b> <b>matter</b> in literature. The main reason {{of this fact}} is that nodal disease is considered a non-relevant prognostic factor by some authors in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Aim {{of this study was}} to investigate the efficacy of radiocolloid lymphoscintigraphy and of hand held gamma probe procedure for SNB in patients with DTC and its potential clinical role. Forty-one consecutive pts with a small thyroid nodule highly suspected for malignancy at fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and without clinical and ultrasonographic (US) evidence of lymph node involvement entered the study. All patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy 3 hours before intervention using a 99 mTc-nanocolloid solution. One single intratumoral injection of 4 - 9 MBq in 0. 1 - 02 ml normal saline was obtained under US-guidance followed by a dynamic lymphoscintigraphy. After total thyroidectomy central and lateral compartments of the neck were scanned with a hand held gamma probe. The hottest node and any lymph node with a count rate of more than 10 % of the hottest node were removed. SLNs were sent to frozen section analysis and a surgical enlargement of corresponding compartment was performed when at least one SLN was positive at histology. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy was able to identify one node in six cases, two nodes in five cases, three nodes in 14 cases, four or more nodes in 16 cases. A papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) was diagnosed in 39 cases, a mixed papillary-medullary carcinoma in one case and a micro-follicular adenoma in one case. In 21 / 40 patients (pts) positive lymph nodes were found: in 16 / 21 patient one node showed micrometastasis only, in 5 / 21 patients more nodes were metastatic. In particular in 11 cases the first hottest node was involved (true SLN), in 10 cases a second or third hot lymph node was involved. In our preliminary experience lymphoscintigraphy with 99 mTc-nanocolloid resulted highly sensitive: in fact at least one lymph node was visualized in all cases and the surgeon was able to detect by means of hand held probe during intervention al least one hot SLN in all cases. In 21 / 40 pts (more than 50 % of cases) metastatic lymph nodes were found despite preoperative clinical and US examination negative for lymph node involvement. In prospective SLN technique might be proposed as a relevant tool in lymphoadenectomy decision in DTC patients with a small tumo...|$|E
