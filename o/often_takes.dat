5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the hydrogen data (including safety data) is confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the data is usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{spend much}} of their time resting and are {{inactive}} for about 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E
5|$|Palestinians bake {{a variety}} of {{different}} kinds of breads: they include khubz, pita and markook and taboon. Khubz is an everyday bread and is very similar to pita. It <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> the place of utensils; It is torn into bite size pieces and used to scoop various dips such as hummus or ful. Markook bread is a paper-thin unleavened bread and when unfolded it is almost transparent. Taboon receives its name from the ovens used to bake them.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the UN <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> {{a leading role}} in {{co-ordinating}} emergency relief. The World Food Programme (WFP), created in 1961, provides food aid in response to famine, natural disasters, and armed conflict. The organization reports that it feeds an average of 90 million people in 80 nations each year. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), established in 1950, works {{to protect the rights of}} refugees, asylum seekers, and stateless people. UNHCR and WFP programmes are funded by voluntary contributions from governments, corporations, and individuals, though the UNHCR's administrative costs are paid for by the UN's primary budget.|$|E
5|$|Compulsory {{education}} or grunnskóli (lit. “basic school”), is {{the period of}} education which is compulsory for all. The legislation concerning compulsory education was passed in 2007, and in 1996 municipalities took over the running of compulsory education. It comprises primary and lower secondary education, which <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> {{place at the same}} institution. The law states that education is mandatory for children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 16. The school year lasts nine months, and begins between August 21 and September 1, ending between May 31 and June 10. The minimum number of school days is 170, but after a new teachers’ wage contract, this will increase to 180. Lessons take place five days a week.|$|E
5|$|The {{beautiful}} nuthatch forages alone, {{in pairs}} {{or in small}} groups of four to five individuals, though an unusual gathering of 21 individuals was observed in one tree in Bhutan. It <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> part in mixed-species foraging flocks, and has been notably observed feeding with the Himalayan cutia (Cutia nipalensis) and the velvet-fronted nuthatch (Sitta frontalis) – two other species that prospect for food on tree trunks. Other foraging flock partners surveyed are the long-tailed broadbill (Psarisomus dalhousiae), the lesser racket-tailed drongo (Dicrurus remifer), the maroon oriole (Oriolus traillii) and the white-browed scimitar babbler (Pomatorhinus schisticeps).|$|E

5|$|The {{examination}} of skeletal remains <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> into account environmental {{factors that affect}} decomposition. Forensic taphonomy {{is the study of}} these postmortem changes to human remains caused by soil, water, and the interaction with plants, insects, and other animals. In order to study these effects, body farms have been set up by multiple universities. Students and faculty study various environmental effects on the decomposition of donated cadavers. At these locations, cadavers are placed in various situations and their rate of decomposition along with any other factors related to the decomposition process are studied. Potential research projects can include whether black plastic causes decomposition to occur faster than clear plastic or the effects freezing can have on a dumped body.|$|E
5|$|Thompson has a keen {{interest}} in music and has played the guitar for several years. He <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> the instrument to work with him, as a means of occupying himself during takes. The actor is part of a group: the Rusholme Ruffians, formed by himself and two of his fellow schoolmates while they were still at Radcliffe Riverside High. The Rusholme Ruffians have performed at venues throughout the UK and the band's set list includes their own material, as well as songs by home-town influences such as Morrissey, The Smiths, Oasis, James and The Stone Roses. Thompson has expressed an interest in getting into the music industry later in life.|$|E
5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving {{tangentially}} relative to the other. The configuration <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E
50|$|The brownback {{trevally}} is {{of minor}} importance to fisheries throughout its range, <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> as bycatch in various trawling and hook and line operations. It is generally not distinguished from other trevally species, and no catch statistics are reported. It is also <b>often</b> <b>taken</b> by small artisanal fisheries by various inshore fish traps.|$|R

5|$|The Earl {{can be a}} {{grotesque}} caricature of a Victorian gentleman: a rotund figure in cape and top hat (hiding his horns), with a perpetual enormous grin and pince-nez spectacles. Although his attitude is often cheerful, he is quick to reveal his more intimidating, malicious side. The Earl has a golem named , a pink umbrella with a small, talking jack-o-lantern at its tip. It usually talks excitedly or screams, adding {{its name to the}} end of almost every sentence. Lero, used by the Earl as a Mary Poppins-type flying umbrella, is very loyal to him and guards his sword. Road <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> Lero against its will, using it as a witch's broom or an ordinary umbrella. It {{has been used as a}} beacon to summon Akuma, to transport several exorcists to the Ark and to guard the Noah. Lero has a sword similar to Allen Walker's sword of exorcism, which surprises him when they clash on Noah's Ark. Despite his antipathy to the Noah Nea, the Earl grows depressed when he talks about him.|$|E
5|$|The sugar may {{be transported}} in bulk {{to the country}} {{where it will be}} used and the {{refining}} process <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> place there. The first stage is known as affination and involves immersing the sugar crystals in a concentrated syrup that softens and removes the sticky brown coating without dissolving them. The crystals are then separated from the liquor and dissolved in water. The resulting syrup is treated either by a carbonatation or by a phosphatation process. Both involve the precipitation of a fine solid in the syrup and when this is filtered out, many of the impurities are removed at the same time. Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular activated carbon or an ion-exchange resin. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly on the boot or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E

5|$|This {{nuthatch}} is omnivorous, eating {{insects and}} seeds. It places large food {{items such as}} acorns or hickory nuts in crevices in tree trunks, and then hammers them open with its strong beak; surplus seeds are cached under loose bark or crevices of trees. The diet in winter may be nearly 70% seeds, but in summer it is mainly insects. The insects consumed by the white-breasted nuthatch include caterpillars, ants, and pest species such as pine weevils, oystershell and other scale insects, and jumping plant lice. This bird will occasionally feed on the ground, and readily visits feeding stations for nuts, suet and sunflower seeds, the last of which it <b>often</b> <b>takes</b> away to store. The white-breasted nuthatch was also observed visiting raccoon latrines {{in order to find}} seeds.|$|E
