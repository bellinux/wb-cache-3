5|$|The {{privilege}} <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> {{by peers}} was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an ecclesiastical court (which included King Henry VI of England, Henry Beaufort and John Kemp) found Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, guilty of witchcraft and banished {{her to the}} Isle of Man, a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> by peers.|$|E
5|$|A {{defendant}} who is {{competent to}} stand trial is therefore also competent to plead guilty, waiving the full panoply <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> rights, but not necessarily competent enough to represent herself at trial {{in the face of}} a state procedural rule requiring a higher standard of competence for pro se representation.|$|E
5|$|During the company's 1975 centennial {{performances}} of all thirteen Gilbert and Sullivan Operas at the Savoy Theatre, Trial was given four times, as a curtain raiser to The Sorcerer, Pinafore and Pirates {{and as an}} afterpiece following The Grand Duke. Before {{the first of the}} four performances <b>of</b> <b>Trial,</b> a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as Carte, Kenneth Sandford as Gilbert and John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth <b>of</b> <b>Trial</b> in 1875. Trial by Jury was eliminated from the D'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.|$|E

5|$|Marking Specter's {{entire career}} in the Senate and, indeed, in all his public offices was one {{overriding}} fact: First and foremost, he considered himself essentially a trial attorney rather than a professional politician.

Shakur again attempted to remove the trial to federal court.

5|$|After {{the premiere}} <b>of</b> <b>Trial</b> by Jury in 1875, {{operetta}} companies in London, the British provinces and elsewhere {{picked it up}} rapidly, usually playing it as a forepiece or an afterpiece to a French operetta. The first American productions were at the Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia on 22 October 1875 and the Eagle Theatre in New York City on 15 November 1875. The world tour of the original British production took it to America, Australia, and elsewhere. It was even translated into German, and premièred as Im Schwurgericht, at the Carltheater on 14 September 1886, and as Das Brautpaar vor Gericht at Danzer's Orpheum on 5 October 1901.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} <b>of</b> <b>Trial</b> by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over {{the next two}} years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E

40|$|Some recent {{developments}} for the Shine-Bower single-subject ANOVA and the Shine Combined ANOVA are integrated {{in order to}} remove the restriction of an even number <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> for the Shine Combined ANOVA. SHINE (1977 b) has recently removed the restriction of an even num-ber <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> for the Shine-Bower single-subject ANOVA. This is done by basing the Shine-Bower error term on any subset or set of subsets <b>of</b> successive <b>trials</b> from the overall complete set <b>of</b> <b>trials,</b> {{rather than on the}} overall complete set <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> itself, where each subset is chosen on an a priori basis and has an even number <b>of</b> <b>trials,</b> This new procedure does not require an even overall number <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> and also allows the experimenter considerable flexibility to design the Shine-Bower error term (on an a priori basis) to fit the needs of his own experimentation. Shine (1977 a) has also recently presented a new procedure for getting around the independence and distributional problems of the original F test for the trial-by-subject interaction in the Shine Combined ANOVA. The purpose of the present paper is {{to make use of the}} above {{recent developments}} in order to remove the restriction of an even number <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> for the Shine Combined ANOVA. Since the tests for subject effects in the Shine Combined ANOVA are the only ones in that design which are based on the Shine-Bower error term, only those tests need consideration in the present paper. It is assumed throughout this paper that the basic assumptions of the Shine Combined ANOVA are met...|$|R
5|$|By {{the reign}} of Henry VII of England, there were two methods <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> by peers of the realm: trial in the House of Lords (or, in proper terms, by the High Court of Parliament) and trial in the Court of the Lord High Steward. The House of Lords tried the case if Parliament was in session; otherwise, trial was by the Lord High Steward's Court.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{managed the}} first tour <b>of</b> <b>Trial</b> by Jury, which {{stopped at the}} Theatre Royal in Dublin, Ireland, in September 1875. While there, he met a young Scottish actress, Susan Couper Black, who used the stage name Helen Lenoir. She became fascinated by his vision for {{establishing}} a company to promote English comic opera and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary. Well-educated, with an organisational ability, business acumen, focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte's, Lenoir gradually became intensely involved {{in all of his}} business affairs. Carte and Lenoir married in 1888, three years {{after the death of his}} first wife.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} initial {{production}} <b>of</b> <b>Trial</b> by Jury, however, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring {{in the summer of}} 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s La Périchole, and La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein, Lecocq's La fille de Madame Angot and Léon Vasseur's La Timbale d'argent), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (Happy Hampstead and Trial by Jury). Carte acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included W.H. Denny.|$|E

30|$|We next {{investigated}} whether visuospatial {{ability and}} self-efficacy {{had an impact}} on the simulator performance when subjects were trained. For this purpose, the 19 subjects (15 females and four males) who attended the 2 -day course and who then all passed the pre-evaluated credential levels were further studied. Whereas the average number of sessions to reach the credential level in the task “lifting and grasping” was 31, the other tasks only required between four and 15 sessions, suggesting that “lifting and grasping “was the most demanding task. The average number <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> <b>of</b> all tasks, to reach credential level, was 69. When assessing simulator data from the 2 -day course, we analyzed the number <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> until reaching the credential level in the task “lifting and grasping,” as well as the sum <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> <b>of</b> all tasks until reaching credential level. The sum <b>of</b> <b>trials</b> <b>of</b> all tasks to reach credential level was calculated to generate an overall result from the 2 -day training.|$|R

Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel's office {{that resulted in the}} disappearance <b>of</b> <b>trial</b> documents, amounting to half of the legal papers related to her case.
