5000|$|TFP {{is often}} {{interpreted}} as a rough average measure of productivity, more specifically the contribution to economic growth made by factors such as technical and <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation.</b> (OECD 2008,11). The most famous description is that of Solow’s (1957): ”I am using the phrase ’technical change’ as a shorthand expression {{for any kind of}} shift in the production function. Thus slowdowns, speed ups, improvements in the education of the labor force and all sorts of things will appear as ’technical change’ ”. The original MFP model (Solow 1957) involves several assumptions: that there is a stable functional relation between inputs and output at the economy-wide level of aggregation, that this function has neoclassical smoothness and curvature properties, that inputs are paid the value of their marginal product, that the function exhibits constant returns to scale, and that technical change has the Hicks’n neutral form (Hulten, 2009,5). In practice, TFP is [...] "a measure of our ignorance", as Abramovitz (1956) put it, precisely because it is a residual. This ignorance covers many components, some wanted (like the effects of technical and organizational innovation), others unwanted (measurement error, omitted variables, aggregation bias, model misspecification) (Hulten 2000,11). Hence the relationship between TFP and productivity remains unclear.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} how various factors influence {{the probability of}} attempts at <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> {{and the effects of}} such innovation. An integrated firm-level dataset obtained from two recent waves of the Norwegian Community Innovation Survey (CIS 3 & 4) and firms’ financial accounts is used to investigate these factors. An analysis which employed a Heckman two-step estimation to ensure against potential sample selection bias demonstrates that, between 1999 and 2004, Norwegian firms were persistent in <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation,</b> and this persistence raised the (positive) effects of <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> on their performance. In addition, the results indicate that a firm’s decision to pursue <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> can be influenced by its past economic performance and the high costs of innovation. The results also reveal that a good share of firms in the sample undertook, and benefitted from, different types of organisational change, and such benefits could increase by means of the complementarity of organisational and technological innovation. In further explaining the rates and consequences of <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation,</b> this study argues that a firm’s age and size have different impacts on its decision to undertake <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> and on the effects of such innovation on its performance. The study found some evidence to suggest that older, larger firms are more inclined to make an attempt at organisational change, while, in terms of outcomes, smaller firms are more able to benefit from such an attempt. <b>Organisational</b> <b>Innovation,</b> Firm Performance, Complementarity, Persistency, Age & Size...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} uncertainties and rapid changes in business environment, strategic planning has been extensively adopted in most organisations. Nowadays, nonprofit organisations also adopt strategic planning to improve their competitive advantage and long-term performance. This research aimed to study the mediation effect of <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> to improve organisational performance of non-profit organisations. It also focused on identifying dimensions that best represent strategic planning <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> and organisational performance. Besides that, it investigated how organisational performance can be achieved through strategic planning and iimovation. A mixed method research using survey questionnaire and a semistructured interview guide were adopted in the study. 257 Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of Saudi non-profit organisations participated in the survey and based on quota sampling, 30 CEOs participated in the semi-structured interview. The study validated the mediation impact of <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> on mission, knowledge and growth perspective, internal processes perspective, customer satisfaction perspective and financial perspective obtained from regression analysis and supported by Sobel Test. The findings of this research showed that <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> is a strong contributor to the improvement of internal processes whilst the contribution of <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> is moderate towards the mission, knowledge and growth and customer perspectives. The best dimensions that represent strategic planning processes are strategic orientation, strategic analysis, organisational resources management, top management support, audit and control strategy, and strategy implementation. In addition, dimensions that best represent organisational iimovation are organisational learning, <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> process, <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> and organisational structure, innovation strategy, and organisational linkages. Finally, dimensions that best represent organisational performance are mission achievement, customer satisfaction, internal processes, employee learning and growth, and financial performance. The findings also revealed that Saudi nonprofit organisations are increasingly becoming aware that strategic planning process and <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> {{have the ability to}} improve performance. Moreover, it has been revealed that strategy and innovation can improve performance through reduction of costs and time and enhance effectiveness.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation,</b> {{the introduction of new}} internet-based ICTs, de-verticalisation, and the rapid growth in business service outsourcing over the last decade. In order to examine this issue, a model of <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> is developed. In this model, the goal of managers is to identify an organisational design that more effectively integrates all the administrative activities of the firm. As {{part of the process of}} innovation, the managers can choose to carry out an administrative activity in-house or to outsource that activity. Key factors influencing this decision are the relative information costs of organising activities internally and the information costs associated with setting up and maintaining interfaces with external suppliers. The framework is examined within the context of a novel model of <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation.</b> Simulations conducted on this model enabled us to consider the short- and long-run impacts of outsourcing on administration overheads and on long-term productivity growth. An interesting finding is that managers of a firm can become locked into a low productivity growth trajectory, associated with the outsourcing of activities, if they are myopic and learn through their own actions. They perceive outsourcing to cut overhead costs in the short-run (as expected), and so engage in further outsourcing thereafter. This is to the detriment of long-run productivity gains (system economies) generated though <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation.</b> This occurs because the potential for <b>organisational</b> <b>innovation</b> is reduced when modular components are outsourced, placing them beyond the control of the firm’s management. The findings accord with the empirical data, and provide a salutary warning to managers and policy-makers about the potential long-term implications of outsourcing. ...|$|E
