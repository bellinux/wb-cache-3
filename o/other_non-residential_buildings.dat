40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce energy {{consumptions}} for sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing, continuous energy audit and process tracking of industrial machines are essential. Compared to <b>other</b> <b>non-residential</b> <b>buildings</b> that have been widely researched, industrial buildings are generally characterized by larger thermal loads, ventilation losses and pollution control requirements. This paper {{presents the results of}} a preliminary energy audit carried out on 8 large industrial buildings of a famous car manufacturing holding in Italy. Energy demand for heating varied from 6 to just over 74 kWh/m 3 year among the buildings of the site. The energy audit enabled to build a specific factory energy model which has been used in order to analyze the impact of various energy saving actions on the primary energy consumptions of the site. It has been demonstrated that in this specific case the improvement of the building envelopes and the optimization of the performances of the existing HVAC systems can determine a reduction of gas consumption up to 15 % per year with a predicted annual economic saving of the order of 100000 €; the total simple pay-back time of the proposed thermal retrofitting is evaluated to be less than 6 year...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{presents}} {{a set of}} step‐wise regression models which can incorporate multiple factors in modelling the costs of office buildings. The models appeared to be more accurate than the traditional method. Design/methodology/approach: The {{data were collected from}} historical office building projects, which were then, adjusted using the construction price index. The step‐wise regression was conducted to produce the linear cost models. Findings: Seven RC office buildings and 11 steel office buildings in Hong Kong completed in different years were selected randomly to verify the accuracy of the regression models developed. The data of these buildings were not used {{in the development of the}} cost models. The result shows that the variability of percentage difference is ranging from − 4. 11 per cent (4. 11 per cent underestimate) to + 2. 74 per cent (2. 74 per cent overestimate) for RC office buildings. For steel office buildings, it ranges from − 6. 65 per cent (6. 65 per cent underestimate) to + 2. 78 per cent (2. 78 per cent overestimate). Research limitations/implications: This study {{presents a}} methodology that can be used in cost estimation of office buildings in Hong Kong at early stage of construction project. The regression cost models developed above are based on, in total, historical data of 30 completed office buildings in Hong Kong. The reliability of the cost models can be further improved by including more office buildings to develop the cost models. Furthermore, the application of cost modelling by regression analysis is not limited to office buildings. The same approach can be applied to residential and <b>other</b> <b>non‐residential</b> <b>buildings</b> as well. Regression cost modelling, with sufficient updating for new cost data available, can provide economic, quick and accurate cost estimation at early stage of construction projects. It will become rational guide supplementing judgmental forecast of cost advisors in near future. Originality/value: Step‐wise regression procedure was applied to develop the cost models. Jackknife re‐sampling was carried out and both of the models show stability. Cross‐validation shows that the developed regression models performed satisfactorily. The paper considers that it can provide economic, quick and accurate cost estimation at the early stage of construction project. In addition, the approach of this study can be adopted to develop cost models of other types of buildings in other locations. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E
