During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect {{from the end of the}} school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing <b>Our</b> <b>Schools</b> policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available. Canberra also has the highest percentage of non-government (private) school students in Australia, accounting for 40.6percent of ACT enrollments.|$|E

25|$|Dianne M. Austin {{was born}} in Etobicoke, Toronto and later moved to Norland to raise a family. She is a veteran {{community}} organizer. In the 1980s, she led in a public campaign against school closures. The campaign was initially targeted against the Victoria County Board of Education's decision to close five village schools in favour of larger, consolidated units. Later, she joined with other groups across the province to form {{a group called the}} Save <b>Our</b> <b>Schools</b> coalition. She herself was elected as a school trustee to the Victoria County board in the 1988 municipal election and sought to reduce the power of unelected directors of education. She was re-elected in 1991 and 1994. In 1995, Austin became executive director of Big Brothers and Big Sisters in Victoria-Haliburton. She was elected as reeve of Somerville Township in the 1997 municipal election; by virtue of this position, she also served as a regional councillor for Victoria County. She opposed her community's amalgamation into Kawartha Lakes in 2000. Austin moved to Peterborough shortly before her term ended and was appointed as {{chief executive officer of the}} Peterborough and District Association for Community Living, a group that assists people with developmental disabilities. In 2001, she led a campaign to ensure low-income disabled people would receive subsidized bus passes. She also oversaw the building of new group homes to provide greater privacy and independence. She later moved to Brantford, where she served as executive director of the Brant United Way from 2007 to 2009 and subsequently became a regional manager for the ALS Society of Ontario. She was fifty-four years old during the 2010 election and focused on targeting unemployment. Her campaign included both Liberal and Conservative organizers, although she stressed that she was not representing any party ideology.|$|E
