5|$|Aalborg traces {{its history}} back over a {{thousand}} years. It was originally settled as a trading post because of its position on the Limfjord. The sites of what were two settlements and a burial ground {{can be seen on}} Lindholm Høje, a hill overlooking the city. These large settlements, <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 6th-century Germanic Iron Age, the other from the Viking Age in the 9th to 11th centuries, evolved at the narrowest point on Limfjord {{as a result of the}} traffic between Himmerland to the south and Vendsyssel to the north.|$|E

50|$|If {{reflections}} of a nonomino are considered distinct, {{as they are}} with one-sided nonominoes, then the first and fourth categories above double in size, resulting in an extra 1,215 nonominoes {{for a total of}} 2,500. If rotations are also considered distinct, then <b>the</b> nonominoes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first category count eightfold, <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> next three categories count fourfold, <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fifth category count twice, and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last category count only once. This results in 1,196 × 8 + (38+26+19) × 4 + 4 × 2 + 2 = 9,910 fixed nonominoes.|$|R

5|$|Burial customs, {{at least}} in {{southern}} Poland, included raising kurgans. The urn with the ashes {{was placed on the}} mound or on a post thrust into the ground. In that position, few such urns survived, which may be the reason why Slavic burial sites in Poland are rare. All dead, regardless of social status, were cremated and afforded a burial, according to Arab testimonies (<b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> end of the 9th century and another one from about 930). A Slavic funeral feast practice was also mentioned earlier by Theophylact Simocatta.|$|E

The replacement of a Democratic governor with <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rival National Republican party caused a great deal of angst among Democrats, but the ascendancy of Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead's willingness to retain Breathitt's secretary of state, Lewis Saunders, did much to allay their fears.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{receiving}} the order, Shimon Avidan called an emergency meeting at Hatzor. Yehoshua Goldrat, the only {{officer in the}} brigade who had experience from the British Army operating a combined force of infantry, armor, artillery and air, wrote the operational order. The order was in English, as Goldrat was not fluent in Hebrew, and was handed out to the battalion commanders on June 1. The battalion commanders translated the document into Hebrew for the company commanders. According to the plan, six companies (3 Palmach and 3 Irgun) would attack the Egyptians from the south. Three companies (2 from the 52nd and <b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 51st battalions) would attack from the north, and two companies (<b>one</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 53rd Battalion and one from Irgun) would prevent a retreat to the east. A company from the 53rd Battalion would block reinforcement from Majdal. Only senior officers knew of the full plans however. Simha Shiloni, commander of the Palmach forces (Negev Beasts Battalion), commented that his forces came exhausted and completely unprepared to the assembly points, and he had given consent for their deployment only after being assured that they would serve as the operational reserve (the plan in fact called for these forces to lead the southern assault).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, two {{separate}} embassies had been dispatched to Tyre {{to appeal to}} Ummidius Caius Quadratus, who as legate of Syria had some authority over the lower-ranking procurator of Iudaea. <b>One,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Samaritans, protested the Jewish attacks on Samaritan villages. The Jewish counter-embassy held the Samaritans responsible for the violence and accused Cumanus of siding with them. Agreeing to investigate, Quadratus proceeded in 52 to Iudaea, where he had all of Cumanus' Jewish prisoners crucified and ordered the beheading of several other Jews and Samaritans who {{had been involved in}} the fighting.|$|E
