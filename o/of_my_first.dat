These were not then, according to my present recollection, more than two Spinning Manufactories in Manchester, Arkwright's with its loft chimney, and Douglas's extensive Works, on the River Irwell, near the Broken bank... At the period <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> residence in Eccles Parish, I believe the above Mills chiefly supplied the Weavers of Eccles and other parishes with twist for warps, which were purchased by the Master Manufacturers.|$|E

Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself. Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a [...] "juniors lifestyle brand", which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and [...] "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed {{out that she was}} not merely licensing her name to the collection. [...] "I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all."

It was originally slated to be titled Lucky Star, after the track of the same name, but eventually titled simply Madonna, perhaps that this singular name could have star power. The album's artwork was shot by photographer Gary Heery and directed by Carin Goldberg. The front cover shows Madonna with short-cropped platinum hair, wearing a number of black rubber bangles {{on her hands and}} a dog chain around her throat. Her navel is also prominent on the inner sleeve of the album. Madonna commented: [...] "The picture inside the dust of sleeve <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> album has me, like, in this Betty Boop pose with my belly button showing. Then when people reviews the album, they kept talking about my cute belly button. [...] I think there are other unobvious places on the body that are sexy and the stomach is kind of innocent."

500|$|Crane {{decided to}} publish it privately, with money he had {{inherited}} from his mother. The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. [...] The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: [...] "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." [...] The name [...] "Maggie" [...] {{was added to the}} title later. Crane used the pseudonym [...] "Johnston Smith" [...] for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the nom de plume was the [...] "commonest name I could think of. [...] I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the [...] "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." [...] Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of The Arena, calling it [...] "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is." [...] Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. [...] He would later remember [...] "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought it would make. It fell flat. Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie!

500|$|In Wright's {{account of}} the Azores expedition, he listed {{as one of the}} expedition's members a [...] "Captaine Edwarde Carelesse, alias Wright, who in S. Frauncis Drakes West-Indian voiage was Captaine of the Hope". In another work, The Haven-finding Art (1599) (see below), Wright stated that [...] "the time <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{employment}} at sea" [...] was [...] "now more than tenne yeares since". The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography asserts that during the expedition Wright called himself [...] "Captain Edward Carelesse", and that he was also the captain of the Hope in Sir Francis Drake's voyage of 1585–1586 to the West Indies, which evacuated Sir Walter Raleigh's Colony of Virginia. One of the colonists was the mathematician Thomas Harriot, and if the Dictionary is correct it is probable that on the return journey to England Wright and Harriot became acquainted and discussed navigational mathematics. However, in a 1939 article, E.J.S. Parsons and W.F. Morris note that in Capt. Walter Bigges and Lt. Crofts' book A Summarie and True Discourse of Sir Frances Drakes West Indian Voyage (1589), Edward Careless was referred to as the commander of the Hope, but Wright was not mentioned. Further, while Wright spoke several times of his participation in the Azores expedition, he never alluded to any other voyage. Although the reference to his [...] "first employment" [...] in The Haven-finding Art suggests an earlier venture, {{there is no evidence that}} he went to the West Indies. Gonville and Caius College holds no records showing that Wright was granted leave before 1589. There is nothing to suggest that Wright ever went to sea again after his expedition with the Earl of Cumberland.|$|E

2500|$|... one <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>first</b> {{orders of}} {{business}} {{as secretary of}} the navy would be to solve ... the Rickover problem. Rickover's legendary achievements were in the past. His present viselike grip on much of the navy was doing it much harm. I had sought the job because I believed the navy had deteriorated to the point where its weakness seriously threatened our future security. The navy's grave afflictions included loss of a strategic vision; loss of self-confidence, and morale; a prolonged starvation of resources, leaving vast shortfalls in capability to do the job; and too few ships to cover a sea so great, all resulting in cynicism, exhaustion, and an undercurrent of defeatism. The cult created by Admiral Rickover was itself a major obstacle to recovery, entwining nearly all the issues of culture and policy within the navy.|$|E
