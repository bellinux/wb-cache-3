The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility of incorporating mango and acerola pulps into a biodegradable matrix as a source of polyphenols, carotenoids, and other antioxidant compounds. We also sought to evaluate the efficacy of mango and acerola pulps as antioxidants in film-forming dispersions using a response surface methodology design experiment. The bio-based films were used to <b>pack</b> palm <b>oil</b> (maintained for 45 days of storage) under accelerated oxidation conditions (63 % relative humidity and 30 C) to simulate a storage experiment. The total carotenoid, total polyphenol, and vitamin Ccontents of films were evaluated, while the total carotenoid, peroxide index, conjugated diene, and hexanal content of the packaged product (palm oil) were also monitored. The same analysis also evaluated palm <b>oil</b> <b>packed</b> in films without antioxidant additives (C 1), palm <b>oil</b> <b>packed</b> in low-density polyethylene films (C 2), and palm oil with no package (C 3) as a control. Although the filmforming procedure affected the antioxidant compounds, the results indicated that antioxidants were effective additives for protecting the packaged product. A lower peroxide index (36. 12 %), which was significantly different from that of the control (p < 0. 05), was detected in products packed in film formulations containing high concentration of additives. However, it was found that the high content of vitamin C in acerola pulp acted as a prooxidant agent, which suggests that the use of rich vitamin C pulps should be avoided as additives for films...|$|R

Both TBA value and POV increased through the period of drying, but decreased through the period of storage in the bag. Among the types of packaging, there was no clear defference in the effect on the changes of the oil in dried fish muscle.

Skurjeni’s paintings from this time period certainly reflect the movement, including figures with a more regular and proportionate anatomy, such as oval shaped heads. The Cultural-Educational Societies of Zagreb’s art sections considered Skurjeni’s art too primitive, however, and it was never exhibited in their shows in the 1950s.|$|R
