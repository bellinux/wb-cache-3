50|$|Though cassava is {{not widely}} {{cultivated}} in Sri Lanka, tapioca, called magngnokka in Sinhalese (and locally translated to English as manioc), {{is used as}} a supplementary food or sometimes as a breakfast food. Often the tapioca tuber is unearthed, cleaned while it is still fresh, and is then boiled in an <b>open</b> <b>pot.</b> The resulting boiled tapioca is often eaten strained with freshly scraped coconut. Some preparations call for the use of saffron to make tapioca yellowish in color, with or without adding peppercorn and scraped coconut directly to the boiling pot itself once the water is near fully evaporated. Another popular preparation contains katta sambol, a paste made of chili, shallots, Maldive fish (a preparation of dried fish) and lime juice, served side by side with boiled tapioca.|$|E
50|$|Pongala in pattupurackal bhagavathy temple celebrated {{every year}} during the annual festival. It is on just one day before {{starting}} the 12-day annual festival. Pongala is a sweet cooked rice with jaggery, ghee and coconut {{as well as other}} ingredients in the small <b>open</b> <b>pot</b> by women for seeking divine blessings. It is a momentous festival for married as well as unmarried women devotees. By offering pongala the women devotees believe that it brings blessings for their husband and children and also brings good life partner to unmarried women. Around 9 am the temple priests lights the hearth and this is passed to every women devotee to light up their hearth for preparing the pad. Around 11 am the pongala devote to temple deity. Women's from the different region come to participate in pongala festival. It is celebrating as the grant in this temple.|$|E

40|$|The edible ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes are {{difficult}} to inoculate in field for reforestation of trees and mushroom production due to insufficient mycelial colonization of substrate. Edible mushroom in the genera Cantharellus was tested for mycorrhization with Dendrocalamus using house waste tealeaves+sand based inoculum under laboratory and green house conditions using polythene bags and plastic boxes. Mycorrhizal seedlings were acclimatized in <b>open</b> <b>pot</b> soil. Dense Cantharellus mycelia colonized the substrate in 2 - 3 weeks. Inoculum survived for atleast six months and retained its viability. Occasionally few bacterial contaminants were observed, which were discarded.

40|$|Fungal viruses (mycoviruses) {{often have}} a {{significant}} impact not only on phenotypic expression of the host fungus but also on higher order biological interactions, e. g., conferring plant stress tolerance via an endophytic host fungus. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in the phylum Glomeromycota associate with most land plants and supply mineral nutrients to the host plants. So far, little information about mycoviruses has been obtained in the fungi due to their obligate biotrophic nature. Here we provide a technical breakthrough, “two-step strategy” in combination with deep-sequencing, for virological study in AM fungi; dsRNA is first extracted and sequenced using material obtained from highly productive <b>open</b> <b>pot</b> culture, and then the presence of viruses is verified using pure material produced in the in vitro monoxenic culture. This approach enabled us to demonstrate the presence of several viruses for the first time from a glomeromycotan fungus...|$|E
40|$|The {{addition}} of composted buffalo manure {{may lead to}} qualitative and quantitative improvement of the organic matter content of degraded tropical agricultural soils in Northern Vietnam. The objectives {{of this study were}} to follow the biochemical changes occurring during composting of buffalo manure with and without earthworms during 3 months and to study the effect of the end products (compost and vermicompost) on soil biochemical parameters and plant growth after two months of incubation under controlled conditions in an <b>open</b> <b>pot</b> experiment. Our conceptual approach included characterisation of organic matter of the two composts before and after addition to soil by elemental, isotopic analysis and analytical pyrolysis and comparison with conventional fertilisation. We also analysed for lignin content and composition. Our results showed that composting in the presence of earthworms led to stronger transformation of buffalo manure than regular composting. Vermicompost was enriched in N-containing compounds and depleted in polysaccharides. It further contained stronger modified lignin compared to regular compost. In the bulk soil, the amendment of compost and vermicompost led to significant modification of the soil organic matter after 2 months of exposure to natural weather conditions. The lignin component of SOM was unaffected whatever the origin of the organic amendment. Compost and vermicompost amendments both enhanced aggregation and increased the amount of organic matter in water stable aggregates. However, vermicompost is preferable to compost due to its beneficial effect on plant growth, while having similar positive effects on quantity and quality of SOM...|$|E

40|$|Stingless {{beekeeping}} {{has drawn}} the general attention of beekeepers {{because of the}} easy management {{and the quality of}} products. Nevertheless, little is known about their production and biology. The present study evaluated the development of Melipona scutellaris hives, considering the production parameters in a beekeeping environment. The growth parameter of hives is food storage. In the case of M. scutellaris, storage is made inside beeswax pots. Therefore, beeswax pots in the hives were classified and counted as nectar <b>pots,</b> pollen <b>pots,</b> <b>open</b> <b>pots,</b> closed pots and empty pots. Hive dimensions were also taken and evaluated. The results indicated that hives show different amounts of pots that vary {{as a function of the}} number of individuals in the hive. It was confirmed that the availability of food resources determines the utilization of food storage, i. e., if there is resource limitation and foraging is compromised, bees utilize the food that is stored inside the pots...|$|R
50|$|Mammillaria fraileana is {{not known}} for being easy to cultivate, however in good {{conditions}} with ventilation it can grow easily. Since this species thrives in an arid climate, they are especially sensitive to overwatering and require <b>open</b> <b>potting</b> soil with lots of air. The mix must be moderately acidic. Peat and other humus sources in the soil can be detrimental to growth along with limestone. Mammillaria fraileana needs maximum sunlight to grow and achieve success in flowering as {{they are used to}} warmer climates. Likewise frost can harm the plant as well. Letting the plant rest in winter to shrivel, even losing up to 25% of its summer height, will help the flowering process.|$|R

5000|$|Fryers are {{available}} {{with a variety of}} fry pot styles. Some commercial fryers have a “cold zone” {{at the bottom of the}} fry pot. This is where larger food particles sink and the lower temperature keeps them from burning and tainting the oil. A tube-style fry pot has a large cold zone because the tubes are slightly above the bottom of the vat, leaving generous space for cooler oil and crumbs. This is particularly useful for cooking heavily breaded foods (such as a blooming onion). A tube-style fry pot is more difficult to clean than an <b>open</b> fry <b>pot,</b> but the tubes allow easy access to the heat source. Tube fryers are often a little less expensive than their <b>open</b> fry <b>pot</b> counterparts. <b>Open</b> fry <b>pots</b> have an external heat source, which makes them easier to clean and affords better access to the oil, but they generally offer a smaller cold zone, so food particles that sink could scorch and pollute the flavor of the oil. However, these fryers work very well for lightly breaded foods. Flat-bottomed restaurant fryers—another type of open frypot fryer—can also be difficult to clean and have no cold zone, but they are highly effective for frying dough (such as donuts or funnel cakes). Flat-bottom fryer pots may also be used with a batter trapping insert that keeps loose batter from quickly scorching on the bottom where heat is normally applied. A batter trap can also help keep loose batter from being stirred up in the oil and adhering to subsequent batches of food in order to make foods taste better and the cooking oil lasts longer.|$|R
