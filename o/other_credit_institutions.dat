In particular we investigate whether the Single Supervisory Mechanism introduced by the European Central Banks and based on banks‚Äô total asset is a good proxy to quantify their systemic importance.

In other words, the system of deposits insurance is needed, which is based on the necessary participation of all banks and credit organizations, drawing money resources into deposits.
