5|$|The Andes play {{a crucial}} role in {{determining}} the climate of Patagonia because their north–south orientation creates a barrier for humid air masses coming from the Pacific Ocean. Since the predominant wind is from the west and most air masses come from the Pacific Ocean, the Andes cause these air masses to ascend, cooling adiabatically. Most of the moisture is dropped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> side, resulting in abundant precipitation, while in much of the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically and becomes drier as it descends. As a result, the Andes create an extensive rain-shadow in much of Argentine Patagonia, causing most of the region to be arid. South of 52oS, the Andes are lower in elevation, reducing the rain shadow effect in Tierra del Fuego Province, allowing forests to thrive on the Atlantic coast.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, El Concierto {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its production, Miguel's vocals, and his renditions of Jiménez's rancheras. The album peaked at number {{two on the}} Billboard Top Latin Albums chart and both the album and video were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

El Concierto won the Eres award for Album of the Year and received a nomination for Pop Album of the Year at the 1996 Lo Nuestro Awards.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the centre}} {{and the eastern}} {{parts of the country}} are mostly flat, the west is mountainous. Both the Andes and Sierras Pampeanas affect the climate of Argentina, leading to {{differences}} in temperature, pressure, and spatial distribution of precipitation depending on the topography and altitude. Here, the Andes exert an important influence on the climate. Owing to the higher altitudes of the Andes north of 40oS, they completely block the normal westerly flow, preventing low pressure systems containing moisture from the Pacific Ocean from coming in. Thus, much of Argentina north of 40oS is dominated by wind circulation patterns from the South Atlantic High. South of 40oS, the Andes are lower in altitude, allowing much of Patagonia to be dominated by westerly winds and air masses from the Pacific Ocean. However, the north–south orientation of the Andes creates a barrier for humid air masses originating from the Pacific Ocean. This is because they force these air masses upwards, cooling adiabactically. Most of the moisture is dropped <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> side, causing abundant precipitation and cloudiness while on the Argentine side, the air warms adiabatically, causing it to become drier as it descends. Thus, an extensive rain–shadow is present in much of Patagonia, causing it to receive very little precipitation. The Sierras Pampeanas influences the climate on a much smaller scale than the Andes.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, {{sovereignty}} {{claims by}} Argentina over Picton, Lennox and Nueva Islands in Tierra del Fuego led {{the two countries}} in December 1978 {{to the brink of}} war.

The threat of war caused the Chilean Pinochet regime to give logistical support and information to the British during the Falklands War of 1982.

25|$|One early {{introduction}} of energy market concepts and privatization to electric power systems {{took place in}} Chile in the early 1981s, in parallel with other market-oriented reforms associated with the Chicago Boys. The Chilean model was generally perceived as successful in bringing rationality and transparency to power pricing. Argentina improved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> model by imposing strict limits on market concentration and by improving the structure of payments to units held in reserve to assure system reliability. One of the principal purposes of the {{introduction of}} market concepts in Argentina was to privatize existing generation assets (which had fallen into disrepair under the government-owned monopoly, resulting in frequent service interruptions) and to attract capital needed for rehabilitation of those assets and for system expansion. The World Bank was active in introducing a variety of hybrid markets in other Latin American nations, including Peru, Brazil, and Colombia, during the 1990s, with limited success.|$|E
25|$|Precipitation {{is highly}} {{seasonal}} in northwestern Patagonia. For example, Villa La Angostura in Argentina, {{close to the}} border with Chile, receives up to 434mm of rain and snow in May, 297mm in June, 273 in July, compared to 80 in February and 72 in March. The total for the city is 2074mm, {{making it one of}} the rainiest in Argentina. Further west, some areas receive up to 4,000mm and more, especially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> side. In the northeast, the seasons for rain are reversed: most rain falls from occasional summer thunderstorms, but totals barely reach 500mm in the northeast corner, and rapidly decrease to less than 300mm. The Patagonian west coast, which belongs exclusively to Chile, has a cool oceanic climate, with summer maximum temperatures ranging from 14°C in the south to 19°C in the north (and nights between 5°C and 11°C) and very high precipitation, from 2,000 to more than 7,000mm in local micro-climates. Snow is uncommon at the coast in the north, but happens more often in the south, and frost is usually not very intense.|$|E

25|$|Darwin's fox is {{considered}} critically endangered {{because of their}} small known population of 250 mature individuals {{as well as their}} restricted distribution. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chilean</b> mainland, the population is limited to Nahuelbuta National Park and the surrounding Valdivian rainforest. Similarly on Chiloé Island, their population is limited to the forests that extend from the southernmost to the northwestern most part of the island. Though the Nahuelbuta National Park is protected, 90% of the species live on Chiloé Island. A major problem the species faces, therefore, is their dwindling, limited habitat due to the cutting and burning of the unprotected forests. Because of deforestation, the Darwin's fox habitat is shrinking, allowing for their competitor's (chilla fox) preferred habitat of open space, to increase; the Darwin's fox, subsequently, is being outcompeted. Another problem they face is their inability to fight off diseases transmitted by the increasing number of pet dogs. To conserve these animals, researchers suggest the need for the forests that link the Nahuelbuta National Park to the coast of Chile and in turn Chiloé Island and its forests, to be protected. They also suggest that other forests around Chile be examined to determine whether Darwin's foxes have previously existed there or can live there in the future, should the need to reintroduce the species to those areas arise. And finally, the researchers advise {{for the creation of a}} captive breeding program, in Chile, because of the limited number of mature individuals in the wild.|$|E
