The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction. Three new generators were placed in the lighthouse to provide an electric light source, the lantern being re-lit on 6 August 1959.|$|E

5|$|In {{order for}} a chain {{reaction}} to occur, fissioning uranium atoms had to emit additional neutrons to keep the reaction going. At Columbia University in New York, Enrico Fermi, John Dunning, Herbert L. Anderson, Eugene T. Booth, G. Norris Glasoe, and Francis G. Slack conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States on 25 January 1939. Subsequent work confirmed that fast neutrons were indeed produced by fission. Szilard obtained permission {{from the head of}} the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months, and persuaded Walter Zinn to become his collaborator. They conducted a simple experiment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor</b> of Pupin Hall at Columbia, using a radium-beryllium source to bombard uranium with neutrons. They discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible.|$|E

The telegraph operating room was connected to the ground floor by pneumatic tubes. The fourth and fifth floors of the building were originally home to the Taxation Department, and the sixth floor was home to miscellaneous other Federal departments, as well as providing accommodation for Federal Members of Parliament. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor</b> was a staff dining room and rest areas.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, followed by its explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in December 1938, ignited {{a flurry of}} activity, with nearly one hundred articles on the subject published {{by the end of}} 1939. At Columbia, Fermi and Dunning were quick to verify Hahn's and Strassmann's results, and there was a lively debate over whether uranium-235 or its more abundant uranium-238 isotope was primarily responsible. Two groups began working at Columbia on attempting to create a nuclear chain reaction in natural uranium. Both were in the Pupin Physics Laboratories, but working independently, at least initially, and on different floors: Fermi and Anderson in the basement, and Szilard and Zin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Ensenberger Building was {{designed}} by local architect Arthur Pillsbury in an eclectic interpretation of the Art Deco Style. It {{was to be the}} last building designed by Pillsbury and one he would never see open as he was killed in an automobile accident in October 1925. The building included a six-room, fully furnished Spanish-style bungalow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor</b> when it opened in 1926. The bungalow had white stucco walls and arched windows and doorways. The original design of the building include gothic spires on the roof which gave the building a much less Art Deco appearance than it has today. The spires were removed in 1941 to give the building a more modern feeling. At one time there were plans to replace the terra cotta panels on the east facade with stainless steel panels. The WWII steel shortage stopped those plans and the terra cotta panels remain one of the building's most prominent features.|$|E

According to Cecil Beaton the clientele was a [...] "mixed brew"; to its wartime chronicler, it was [...] "a building in which the respectable and the dubious mixed by the thousand, knocking back cocktails and indulging in careless talk". In March 1945, Ernest Hemingway and Time correspondent and lover Mary Welsh stayed at the Dorchester, where they were entertained by Emerald, Lady Cunard, who had a three-room suite <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

On doing so, they discovered significant neutron multiplication in natural uranium, proving that a chain reaction might be possible. Szilard later described the event: [...] "We turned the switch and saw the flashes. We watched them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home." [...] He understood the implications and consequences of this discovery, though. [...] "That night, there was very little {{doubt in my mind that}} the world was headed for grief".|$|E
