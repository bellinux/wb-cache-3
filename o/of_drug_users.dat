The same survey also reported that 19% of the users had been introduced to hard drugs when they were less than 15 years old; and 14.4% <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were attending school or college. Only 12 of the 17 municipalities studied had any type of rehabilitation centre. There has been a sharp increase in the seizure of drugs such as hashish, heroin and opium in the past few years; and there are indications that drug traffickers are trying to establish Nepal as a transit point.|$|E

40|$|Appropriate ways {{to monitor}} the {{availability}} and use <b>of</b> illicit <b>drugs</b> were examined. Four methods were tested concurrently: (1) a quantitative survey <b>of</b> injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> (2) a qualitative key informant study <b>of</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and professionals working in the drug field, (3) examination of existing sources of survey, health and law enforcement data and (4) an ethnographic study of a high risk group <b>of</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> The first three methods were recommended for inclusion in an ongoing national monitoring system, enabling the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data on a range <b>of</b> illicit <b>drugs</b> in a relatively brief, quick and cost-effective manner. A degree of convergent validity was also noted among these methods, improving the degree <b>of</b> confidence in <b>drug</b> trends. The importance <b>of</b> injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> as a sentinel population <b>of</b> illicit <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> was highlighted, along with optimal methods for qualitative research...|$|R
2500|$|In a {{study of}} {{self-reported}} effects of MDMA (ecstasy) on metamemory, metamemory variables such as memory-related feelings/beliefs and self-reported memory were examined. [...] Results suggest that drug use may cause retrospective memory failures. Although other factors such as high anxiety levels <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> might contribute to memory failure, drug use can impair metamemory abilities. Further, {{research has shown that}} benzodiazepine lorazepam has effects on metamemory. When studying four-letter nonsense words, persons on benzodiazepine lorazepam displayed impaired episodic short-term memory and lower FOK estimates. However, benzodiazepine lorazepam did not affect the predictive accuracy of FOK judgments.|$|E
2500|$|Similarly to {{the rest}} of the European Union member states and American democracies, {{controlled}} drugs are illegal in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, illegal drugs are consumed worldwide, causing concern in the international community. According to the United Nations Drug Control Programme, results in the 2001 World Drug Report estimate [...] "that the extent of drug abuse in the world involves about 180 million people, which represents 3% of the global population. The majority <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> (80%) used cannabis, followed by amphetamine-type stimulants such as methamphetamine, amphetamine and substances of the ecstasy group (16%), cocaine (8%), heroin (5%) and other opiates (2%)".|$|E
2500|$|The {{increasingly}} common practice of drug testing, especially urinalysis, {{has led to}} {{an increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> looking for ways to beat the tests, and has spawned a number of urban legends as a result. [...] One should note that time is the only scientifically proven method for certainly passing a test, apart from not consuming any substances at all that are likely to be tested for. However, this does not stop users from getting creative in their attempts to somehow shorten the detection times and/or mask the contents of their fluid specimens, with varying degrees of success or lack thereof.|$|E

The results reveal that methadone maintenance programmes can make the seropositive subject neuropsychologically vulnerable.

2500|$|Duterte {{has denied}} {{responsibility}} for the extrajudicial killings. He has also frequently announced his support for them. According to Reuters, [...] "Duterte's loud approval for hundreds of execution-style killings <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and criminals over nearly two decades helped propel him to the highest office of a crime-weary land." [...] In 2009 Duterte said: [...] "If you are doing an illegal activity in my city, {{if you are a}} criminal or part of a syndicate that preys on the innocent people of the city, for as long as I am the mayor, you are a legitimate target of assassination." [...] In 2015, Duterte confirmed his links to extrajudicial killings in Davao, and warned that, if elected president, he may kill up to 100,000 criminals. After the said confirmation, Duterte challenged human rights officials to file a case against him if they could provide evidence to his links with vigilante groups.|$|E
2500|$|Duterte's {{political}} {{success has}} been aided by his vocal support for the extrajudicial killing <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> and other criminals. Human rights groups have documented over 1,400 killings allegedly by death squads operating in Davao between 1998 and May 2016; the victims were mainly drug users, petty criminals and street children. A 2009 report by the Philippine Commission on Human Rights confirmed the [...] "systematic practice of extrajudicial killings" [...] by the Davao Death Squad. Duterte has alternately confirmed and denied his involvement. The Office of the Ombudsman closed an investigation in January 2016 stating that they {{found no evidence that}} the Davao Death Squad exists, and no evidence to connect the police or Duterte with the killings. The case has since been reopened. Duterte has repeatedly confirmed that he personally killed three kidnapping suspects at a police checkpoint while Mayor of Davao in 1988.|$|E
