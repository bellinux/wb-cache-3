Deemed the Hauptstadt der Bewegung (Capital of the Movement), Munich was a significant place in terms of the Nazi ideology. The city was home to the NSDAP headquarters, the Beer Hall Putsch and also saw the establishment of Dachau, the first Nazi concentration camp. Post-war designs were not pursued until 1949.|$|E
5|$|The Base Realignment and Closure 2005 {{commission}} {{originally planned}} to close Otis Air National Guard Base and dissolve the 102d.

5|$|Chris angrily demands Leslie {{bring the}} {{painting}} to city hall {{the next day to}} be destroyed. When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses disappointment that she would give up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot to draw a penis on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris, but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other, then it will eventually happen.|$|E

5|$|In Madame Satan (1930), {{adultery}} {{is explicitly}} condoned {{and used as}} a sign for a wife {{that she needs to}} act in a more enticing way to maintain her husband's interest. In Secrets (1933), a husband admits to serial adultery, <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> he repents and the marriage is saved. The films took aim at what was already a damaged institution. During the Great Depression, relations between spouses often deteriorated due to financial strain, marriages lessened, and husbands abandoned their families in increased numbers. Marriage rates continually declined in the early 1930s, finally rising in 1934, the final year of the pre-Code era, and although divorce rates lowered, this is likely because desertion became a more common method of separation. Consequently, female characters, such as Ruth Chatterton's in Female, live promiscuous bachelorette lifestyles, and control their own financial destiny (Chatterton supervises an auto factory) without regret.|$|E
5|$|In the 2004 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, McCain {{was once again}} frequently mentioned for the vice-presidential slot, <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> {{as part of the}} Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry. McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had. At the 2004 Republican National Convention, McCain supported Bush for re-election, praising Bush's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks. At the same time, he defended Kerry's Vietnam War record. By August 2004, McCain had the best favorable-to-unfavorable rating (55percent to 19percent) of any national politician; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously, though the two remained situational allies rather than friends.|$|E
5|$|With Central Europe {{now under}} the Empire's dominance, Barbarossa turns his {{attention}} to Italy, namely Milan and the Pope. The rise of the Holy Roman Empire has challenged {{the power of the}} Pope in Europe, hence why Barbarossa must be able to subjugate the Italian realms who plot against him. Once again, Henry the Lion betrays Barbarossa, <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> he is stripped of his titles and forced into exile whilst Barbarossa is able to ascertain his superiority in Italy. The Third Crusade begins in the Middle East, and Barbarossa pledges his Empire's support to the coming campaign. But the Holy Roman Empire's army is far too strong for any Navy to carry, forcing Barbarossa to march his troops through hostile Constantinople and Anatolia, which is crawling with Seljuk Turks. During this march, Barbarossa drowns by the weight of his armour in a river current, leaving his army to continue to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem with their dead Emperor to fulfil his wishes.|$|E

5|$|When he was {{approximately}} 15, Stiller obtained {{a small part}} with one line on the television soap opera Guiding Light, although in an interview he characterized his performance as poor. He was later cast in {{a role in the}} 1986 Broadway revival of John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves, alongside John Mahoney; the production would garner four Tony Awards. During its run, Stiller produced a satirical mockumentary whose principal was fellow actor Mahoney. His comedic work was well received by the cast and crew of the play, and he followed up with a 10-minute short called The Hustler of Money, a parody of the Martin Scorsese film The Color of Money. The film featured him in a send-up of Tom Cruise's character and Mahoney in the Paul Newman role, <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> as a bowling hustler instead of a pool shark. The short got the attention of Saturday Night Live, which aired it in 1987, and two years later offered him a spot as a writer. In the meantime, he also had a bit part in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Caesar's {{political}} appointments {{is complex and}} uncertain. Caesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate, but alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship. His powers within the state seem to have rested upon these magistracies. He was first appointed dictator in 49BC, possibly to preside over elections, but resigned his dictatorship within 11 days. In 48BC, he was reappointed dictator, <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> for an indefinite period, and in 46BC, he was appointed dictator for 10 years.|$|E

By the 1830s and 1840s, nationalist leader Daniel O'Connell was leading a demand for the Repeal of the Act of Union and the re-establishment of an Irish parliament in Dublin, <b>only</b> <b>this</b> <b>time</b> one to which Catholics could be elected, in contrast with the entirely Anglican assembly that had met in the old Houses of Parliament.|$|E
