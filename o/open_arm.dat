40|$|In {{exploratory}} animal {{models of}} anxiety, {{such as the}} elevated plus maze, the anxiogenic- and anxiolytic-like effects of drugs may be confounded by changes in locomotor activity. In the present experiments, the sensitivity of several measures of anxiety and locomotor activity in the elevated plus maze were assessed. Both chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (CDP, 7. 5 mg/kg) and d-amphetamine sulphate (AMP, 0. 75, 1. 5 mg/kg) increased the percent time on the <b>open</b> <b>arms</b> and doses of 7. 5 mg/kg and 1. 5 mg/kg CDP and AMP, respectively, {{increased the number of}} entries into the <b>open</b> <b>arms.</b> The increase in these measures might suggest that both compounds induced an anxiolytic-like effect. Although FG 7142 (30. 0 mg/kg) did not decrease the number of entries to the <b>open</b> <b>arms,</b> it did decrease the time on the <b>open</b> <b>arms,</b> which might suggest that it had anxiogenic-like effects. Similarly, buspirone reduced both the number of entries into the <b>open</b> <b>arms</b> and the time spent on the <b>open</b> <b>arms.</b> However, all the compounds significantly affected locomotor activity. CDP (3. 0 and 7. 5 mg/kg) increased the total number of arm entries, the distance travelled on the <b>open</b> <b>arms</b> and the mean speed of the animals on the open, and in the closed arms. Moreover, the distance travelled by the animals in the closed arms was increased by 1. 0 mg/kg CDP, a dose that had no measurable effects on the indices of anxiety.

50|$|Anxiety {{reduction}} is {{indicated in the}} plus-maze {{by an increase in}} the proportion of time spent in the <b>open</b> <b>arms</b> (time in <b>open</b> arms/total time in <b>open</b> or closed <b>arms)</b> and an increase in the proportion of entries into the <b>open</b> <b>arms</b> (entries into <b>open</b> arms/total entries into <b>open</b> or closed <b>arms).</b> The total number of arm entries and number of closed-arm entries are sometimes used as measures of general activity. The relationship between the EPM and other tests of exploratory activity (open-field and emergence) have been analyzed in two mouse strains.|$|R
30|$|Anxiolytic {{effect of}} drug {{molecules}} is evaluated by EPM test {{which is a}} well-established model for assessing neuropharmacological responses of rodents [39]. The effect is observed when the experimental drug increases <b>open</b> <b>arms</b> entries without altering {{the total number of}} arm entries. In our present study, both of the doses of LM increased the percentage of entries of rats into the <b>open</b> <b>arms.</b> But LM 200 showed {{a significant increase in the}} percentage of time spent in the <b>open</b> <b>arms</b> of the maze. This was slightly larger than the effects observed following treatment with the reference anxiolytic drug diazepam. These results indicate an anxiolytic-like activity of LM.|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of "one-trial tolerance" {{to the effects}} of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (CDP) in the elevated plus maze was re-examined. Unlike previous experiments, pre-exposure to the maze resulted in habituation and a consequential reduction in time spent on the <b>open</b> <b>arms.</b> The habituation effect was measured by recording the actual distance travelled by the rats in the maze and this was found to be significantly reduced by pre-exposure. Pre-exposure to the maze in the presence of CDP resulted in a reduced response to its "anxiolytic-like" effects (increasing time on the <b>open</b> <b>arms</b> compared to vehicle control rats). However, although the time spent on the <b>open</b> <b>arms</b> was reduced by pre-exposure, CDP significantly increased the time spent on the <b>open</b> <b>arms</b> by rats pre-exposed under a non-drugged state. These results suggest that rats do not become tolerant {{to the effects of}} CDP, but rather the reduced response to CDP after pre-exposure is due to habituation of exploratory behaviour...|$|R
50|$|GML-1 is a TSPO (peripheral {{benzodiazepine}} receptor) ligand with anxiolytic activity. Its binding affinity (Ki value) to TSPO {{is comparable}} with PK11195. GML-1 is selective for TSPO versus the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR, GABAA receptor). The compound GML-1 {{was the most}} active {{of a series of}} 1-arylpyrrolo1,2-apyrazine-3-carboxamides, and its anxiolytic effects were examined using the open field test (OFT) and the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. The EPM test is a general anxiety test measuring the time spent by animals in the open or the enclosed arms. When compound was administered to CD-1 mice at the dose of 1.0 mg/kg, it significantly increased the percentage of <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> entries and the time spent in the open arms. GML-1 is a potential antianxiety agent.|$|E
5000|$|PopMatters {{correspondent}} Michael Kabran concluded [...] "Broken Arm Trio clearly {{features the}} work of three musicians who, while tremendously adept at playing jazz, are snuggly rooted in the rock and European classical and folk idioms". [...] Writing for All About Jazz, Mark Corroto observed [...] "Friedlander seems to be opening his music to jazz and no-jazz fans. Much like Bill Frisell and Charlie Haden's <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> approach to jazz that can swallow both country and classical, Friedlander is pushing his vision into the open ended world defined simply as music". On the same site Troy Collins noted [...] "A tireless artist, always open to expanding the acoustic cello language, Broken Arm Trio is one of Friedlander's most refreshing and vibrant efforts". A.D. Amorosi stated in JazzTimes that [...] "it’s gorgeous, soulful and smart".|$|E
5000|$|The {{elevated}} T maze (ETM) {{has three}} {{arms in the}} shape of the letter [...] "T". One arm is closed and perpendicular to the other two arms which are open. This test is designed to observe anxiety effects and how it affects learning. The rodent is placed on the enclosed arm and allowed to explore. The trial ends when the rodents sets all four paws in on the open arms. Rats are allowed multiple trials until they learn to stay in the <b>open</b> <b>arm</b> for 300 seconds. This is a measurement of inhibitory avoidance.Depending on what the rodents were treated with during the training sessions, they would learn at different rates giving information on how the brain stores memories. This test can be used to assess long term memory. When a rodent has been sufficiently trained, researchers will test the rodent again after a week to observe if the rodent still remembers to stay in the enclosed arm.|$|E
