500|$|Aigler {{came under}} fire in 1936 for his public {{statement}} about moves at the University of Wisconsin to shift oversight of athletics away from the faculty. Aigler issued a statement {{on behalf of the}} Big Ten criticizing Wisconsin for establishing a non-faculty governing body. Aigler said, [...] "The evidence before the Conference indicated strongly that the Wisconsin regents for several years have shown a disposition to subordinate faculty desires to the wishes of such outsiders." [...] In response to Aigler's charge, one Wisconsin newspaper asked: [...] "Was he Ignorant, <b>or</b> <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> Want Some Publicity?" ...|$|E
500|$|A receipt {{found among}} Sibelius's papers {{refers to a}} [...] "Symphonie" [...] being bound by the firm of Weilin & Göös in August 1938. While it is not {{established}} that this transaction related to the Eighth, the Sibelius scholar Kari Kilpeläinen points out {{that none of the}} earlier symphony scores carry the unnumbered heading [...] "Symphonie", and asks: [...] "Could he have omitted the number to prevent news of the now completed Eighth from spreading? <b>Or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> not give the work a number at all, because he was not satisfied with it?" [...] The composer's daughter Katarina spoke of the self-doubt that afflicted her father at this time, aggravated by the continuing expectations and fuss that surrounded the Eighth Symphony. [...] "He wanted it to be better than the other symphonies. Finally it became a burden, even though so much of it had already been written down. In the end I don't know whether he would have accepted what he had written." ...|$|E
500|$|Nansen's {{status was}} never seriously challenged, {{although}} he did not escape criticism. American explorer Robert Peary wondered why Nansen had not returned to the ship when his polar dash was thwarted after a mere three weeks away. [...] "Was he ashamed to go back after so short an absence, or had there been a row ... <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> go off for Franz Josef Land from sensational motives or business reasons?" [...] Adolphus Greely, who had initially dismissed the entire expedition as infeasible, admitted that he had been proved wrong but nevertheless drew attention to [...] "the single blemish"—Nansen's decision to leave his comrades hundreds of miles from land. [...] "It passes comprehension", Greely wrote, [...] "how Nansen could have thus deviated from the most sacred duty devolving on the commander of a naval expedition." [...] Nansen's reputation nevertheless survived; a hundred years after the expedition the British explorer Wally Herbert called the Fram voyage [...] "one of the most inspiring examples of courageous intelligence in the history of exploration".|$|E
6000|$|MYRRHINA. Where <b>does</b> <b>he</b> dwell, the {{beautiful}} young hermit {{who will not}} look {{on the face of}} woman? Has he a house of reeds or a house of burnt clay <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> lie on the hillside? <b>Or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> make his bed in the rushes? ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Shadow was so {{confused}} <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not know what}} to say <b>or</b> <b>do.</b> <b>He</b> {{sat on the edge of}} the bed the picture of despair.|$|R
5000|$|The rest of {{the story}} unravels the choice that Raja makes. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> break Shantha's heart and marry Raji to save his sister’s life <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> follow his heart at any cost? ...|$|R
500|$|J. K. Rowling has {{cited the}} Three Witches as an {{influence}} in her Harry Potter series. In {{an interview with}} The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet, when asked, [...] "What if [...] never heard the prophecy?", she said, [...] "It's the 'Macbeth' idea. I absolutely adore 'Macbeth.' It is possibly my favourite Shakespeare play. And that's the question isn't it? If Macbeth hadn't met the witches, would he have killed Duncan? Would any of it have happened? Is it fated <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> make it happen? I believe he made it happen." [...] On her website, she referred to Macbeth again in discussing the prophecy: [...] "the prophecy (like the one the witches make to Macbeth, if anyone has read the play of the same name) becomes the catalyst for a situation that would never have occurred {{if it had not}} been made." [...] More playfully, Rowling also invented a musical band popular in the Wizarding world called The Weird Sisters that appears in passing in several books in the series as well as the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The third Harry Potter movie's soundtrack featured a song by John Williams called [...] "Double Trouble", a reference to the witches' line, [...] "Double double, toil and trouble". The lyrics of the song were adapted from the Three Witches' spell in the play.|$|E
2500|$|For instance: Exhibit F {{shows an}} [...] "American Smoker," [...] by Jean Metzinger. Who is the American? Where is {{the rest of}} his face? Was it carved off in a duel at one of the foreign {{universities}} <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> dislike it and have it remodeled? Such are some of the questions being asked by those most interested—and the catalogue merely says [...] "American Smoking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vere {{immediately}} convenes a court-martial, at which, {{after serving}} as sole witness and as Billy's de facto counsel, Vere urges the court to convict and sentence Billy to death. [...] The trial is recounted in chapter 21, the longest chapter in the book. It has {{become the focus of}} scholarly controversy; was Captain Vere a good man trapped by bad law, <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> deliberately distort and misrepresent the applicable law to condemn Billy to death? ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{round face}} of the grub-man peered upon me now. [...] "His dinner is ready. Won't he dine to-day, either? <b>Or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> live without dining?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The plot {{concerns}} {{a doctor who}} engineered a woman with narcotic blood encounters his creation 20 years later and falls in love... <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he?</b> Is this love or addiction? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A priest, say you!--is he a hard drinker--a real camp-idler--a fellow {{to breed}} a famine in a regiment? <b>Or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> seem {{a man who}} is earnest in his trade?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Historians debate Smith's motivation—was it {{a cynical}} attempt {{to defeat the}} bill by someone opposed to both civil rights for blacks and women, <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> support women's rights and was {{attempting}} to improve the bill by broadening it to include women? Smith expected that Republicans, who had included equal rights for women in their party's platform since 1944, would probably vote for the amendment. Historians speculate that Smith was trying to embarrass northern Democrats who opposed civil rights for women because [...] the clause was opposed by labor unions.|$|E
2500|$|Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) asked Mueller [...] "Did {{you have}} an {{opportunity}} to talk to General Ashcroft, <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> discuss what was discussed in the meeting with Attorney General Gonzales and the chief of staff?" [...] He replied [...] "I did have a brief discussion with Attorney General Ashcroft." [...] Lee went on to ask [...] "I guess we use [...] TSP , we use warrantless wiretapping. So would I be comfortable in saying that those were the items that were part of the discussion?" [...] He responded [...] "It was—the discussion was on a national—an NSA program that has been much discussed, yes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anquetil took a forthright and {{controversial}} {{stand on the}} use of performance-enhancing drugs. He never hid that he took drugs and in a debate with a government minister on French television said only a fool would imagine it was possible to ride Bordeaux–Paris on just water. He and other cyclists had to ride through [...] "the cold, through heatwaves, in the rain and in the mountains", and they had the right to treat themselves as they wished, he said in a television interview, before adding: [...] "Leave me in peace; everybody takes dope." [...] There was implied acceptance of doping right {{to the top of the}} state: the president, Charles de Gaulle, said of Anquetil: [...] "Doping? What doping? Did he <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> not make them play the Marseillaise [...] abroad?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Hi! there, Luke Wright, {{has that}} scurvy father of yours mended his ways yet, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> think the king's {{officers}} will wait awhile before sending {{him to the}} gallows where he belongs?" ...|$|R

2500|$|Although {{this really}} {{was not a}} cliffhanger, {{the end of the}} fifth episode of the {{original}} Dallas miniseries saw J.R. go up to the loft of the barn to talk to Pam, who had gone up there to find her cousin Jimmy, after Digger had fallen off the wagon at the Ewing barbecue. J.R., intoxicated, tries to convince her to tell Bobby not to leave the ranch. However, she {{does not want to be}} bothered, and, in trying to escape J.R., she falls from the loft, landing square on her stomach. Pam, who is pregnant, miscarries her unborn child. Later, Sue Ellen questions J.R. as to whether it was really an accident <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> mean for Pam to fall on purpose. J.R. says, [...] "I did not." [...] When Sue Ellen asks J.R. if he cares that Pam lost the baby, J.R. does not answer her, leaving it up to the viewer to decide.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not {{quite the}} young man he was," [...] Jocelyn Thew {{observed}} thoughtfully. [...] "Is it my fancy, I wonder, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> drink {{a few too many}} cocktails when he is on leave?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But will <b>he</b> <b>do</b> his best?" [...] Jacob cried, in a passion. [...] "Will <b>he</b> help me, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> {{think the}} work is done when we have learned where Joseph Brant has gone on his work of bloodshed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why <b>does</b> <b>he</b> ask Gudrun as well?' {{she asked}} herself at once. 'Does he want to protect himself, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> think I would not go alone?' She was tormented {{by the thought that}} he wanted to protect himself. But at the end of all, she only said to herself: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 1. Did man {{originally}} live in {{the patriarchal}} family, <b>or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> live in more or less modified promiscuity, with uncertainty of blood-ties, and especially of male parentage? ...|$|E

6000|$|But Mrs. McIlvaine {{was made}} a triffe uneasy by it [...] "He wouldn't give you y'r money? <b>Or</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say he couldn't?" [...] she inquired in her {{moderate}} way.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first of}} these {{characters}} is the [...] "hero" [...] (or rather the anti-hero) Jean of Leiden. The deepest nature of the character remains ultimately ambiguous: <b>does</b> <b>he</b> truly believe in the mission that God {{is said to have}} entrusted to him ( [...] in the prophetic dream of the second act, the vision of his victorious attack on Munster {{at the end of the}} third, and the coronation ceremony)? <b>Or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> know that he is ultimately only a usurper who takes advantage of circumstances (hence his bad conscience and his repentance when he confronts his mother in the last act)? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> really believe in the ideals of equality and social justice <b>he</b> defends? <b>Or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> only act out of vengeance? Is he manipulated by the three Anabaptists? Or is he constantly controlling the situation? The libretto does not say.|$|R
6000|$|This last {{argument}} admitted of no reply, nor did Edward attempt any; he rather {{chose to}} bring back the discourse to Donald Bean Lean. 'Does Donald confine himself to cattle, <b>or</b> <b>does</b> <b>he</b> LIFT, as you call it, anything else that comes in his way?' ...|$|R
5000|$|How can Maya {{convince}} Ariel {{that she}} is `Ms. Right’?
