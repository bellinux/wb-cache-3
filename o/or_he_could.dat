If she did not prove her case, but was proved to be a bad wife, she was drowned.|$|E

To the west, he directed General of Division Jean-Baptiste Dominique Rusca and his division to march {{up the valley}} of the Piave, then turn east. He ordered General of Division Jacques MacDonald with one cavalry and two infantry divisions, 14,000 troops, to march due east and seize the Austrian base at Ljubljana (Laibach) in Carniola. From there, MacDonald might link up with General of Division Auguste Marmont advancing north from Dalmatia, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> capture Graz or Maribor (Marburg an der Drau). Eugène sent one division under General of Division Jean Mathieu Seras moving north up the Soča (Isonzo) toward Tarvis via the Predil Pass.

500|$|By nightfall on 12 May, Guderian's XIX. Panzerkorps {{rolled into}} Sedan. Guderian {{reported}} {{there was no}} sign of the enemy. With the city itself secured, Guderian would now have to strike south, across the defended rear behind Sedan, which in turn was protected by a large bunker complex located on Marfee ridge, a piece of high ground covering the Sedan-Meuse river to the south. But there were three fundamental choices. He could obey tactical necessity and protect the bridgeheads against a French counter-attack from the south; he could strike west towards Paris with his Corps; <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> carry out the dash to the Channel.

Washington extensively lobbied Forbes and other British officers to use Braddock's route, which would have been more advantageous to Virginia interests. [...] Forbes and others took a dim view of this activity, suspecting personal and provincial financial motivation. In response to a letter in which Washington bemoaned [...] "our Enterprize [...] Ruind", and blamed Colonel Henry Bouquet for his advocacy of the Pennsylvania route, Forbes angrily wrote, [...] "I am now at the bottom, of their Scheme against this new road" [...] and chastized Washington, writing that his heavy-handed advocacy [...] "was a shame for any officer to be Concerned in." [...] Forbes ultimately chose the Pennsylvania route for pragmatic military reasons: the army, was expected to occupy and hold Fort Duquesne, and would require a reliable supply route, and the Pennsylvania route was superior for this purpose. [...] However, as the expedition pushed west and Forbes learned that the last ridge to cross would prove particularly difficult, he granted that Washington and other advocates of the Virginia route may have been correct in their assessment of the chosen route's problems.|$|E
500|$|Asch's {{conformity}} {{experiment was}} conducted using 123 male {{participants who were}} told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each subject was put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive [...] "real" [...] participant). The group was shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked to say which line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a [...] "trial". The [...] "real" [...] participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other [...] "participants" [...] gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer.

500|$|Middleton was {{the only}} {{commander}} that VIII Corps had ever had in combat. [...] He had been {{away from home for}} over 1200 days since departing in January 1942, and had logged 480 days in combat, more time than any other American general officer during World War II. [...] Near the end of May 1945 groups of general officers, other officers and enlisted men were sent to several major cities across the United States to appear in parades. Middleton was part of a group headed by Courtney Hodges that went to Atlanta, where he and his son reunited with his wife and daughter (his son, Lieutenant Troy Middleton Jr. had been with him in Europe) and where they were treated to a reception held by the mayor. [...] From Atlanta the family flew to Baton Rouge where Middleton took 15 days of leave, after which he went to Washington D.C. to meet with General Marshall. [...] Marshall told Middleton that he could either return to Germany to be with his corps, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> wait at home until the unit returned to the states, Middleton opting for the latter. Marshall also told Middleton that VIII Corps was being ticketed for Japan. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Middleton went back to Washington, and this time Marshall told him he doubted any more units would be sent to the Pacific. Asked if he wanted to stay in the army, Middleton's reply was that he had retired in 1937, and he intended to be returned to retired status once he was no longer needed as a combat commander.|$|E

500|$|With {{the bridge}} {{considered}} important by the advancing US Eighth Army, the Australians {{were determined to}} a force a passage across the river. However, with only a platoon from D Company holding a tenuous bridgehead at the Pakchon ford as dusk fell, Green could either cross the river the following morning via the ford, <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> attempt a lodgement across the bridge that night. Acting boldly he resolved to strengthen his position and at 19:00 A and B Companies were sent across the river to secure the bridgehead and prevent the North Koreans from being reinforced and consolidating their position on the western bank. Again using the broken span, the Australians crossed the river and scaled the bank in the moonlight, before establishing defensive positions {{on both sides of}} the road on the crest [...] from the Taeryong. Achieving their objectives the Australians then spread out along the ridgeline, with A Company under Captain William Chitts on the left and B Company on the right commanded by Major George Thirlwell. Unchallenged, the Australians suspected that the North Koreans had withdrawn and, still largely without winter clothing, they then began to dig-in amid a sub-zero wind which blew in from Manchuria, [...] away. Green deployed the remainder of the battalion on the eastern bank, with D Company to the north near Kujin, C Company to the east flanking the road to Sinanju and battalion headquarters located to the south in a paddy field. The American tanks were subsequently allocated to both C and D Companies and they provided rear security to the battalion during the night.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main purpose}} of the Hungarian Spring Campaign, led by Artúr Görgei was to push the Habsburg main armies out of Hungary towards Vienna. The {{first phase of the}} Spring Campaign was successful, and forced the {{imperial}} forces to retreat from the foreground of the Hungarian capitals: Pest and Buda, thanks to the victory of Isaszeg. For {{the second phase of the}} campaign on 7 April 1849 the Hungarian commanders elaborated another plan. According to this plan the Hungarian army had to split, General Lajos Aulich with the II. Hungarian Army Corps, and the division of Colonel Lajos Asbóth remained in front of Pest, doing such military maneuvers which have to make the imperials to believe that the whole Hungarian army is there, diverting their attention from north, where the real Hungarian attack had to start with the I., III. and the VII., corps which had to go westwards, on the northern bank of the Danube via Komárom, to relieve it from the imperial siege. The Kmety division of the VII. corps had to cover the three corps march, and after the I. and the III. corps occupied Vác, the division had to secure the town, while the rest of the troops together with the two remaining divisions of the VII. corps, had to advance to Garam river, than heading for the south to relieve the northern section of Austrian siege of the fortress of Komárom. After this, they had to cross the Danube and relieve the southern section of the siege. In the eventuality of finishing all of these with success, the imperials had only two chances: Or to retreat from Middle Hungary towards Viena, or face the encirclement from the Hungarian troops in the Hungarian capitals. This plan was very risky (as was the first plan of the Spring Campaign too) because if Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz had discovered that in front of Pest remained only a Hungarian corps, with an attack could destroy Aulich's troops, and with this he could easily cut the support lines of the main Hungarian army, and even occupy Debrecen, the seat of the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament and the National Defense Committee (interim government of Hungary), <b>or</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> encircle the three corps advancing to relieve Komárom. To secure the success of the Hungarian army, the National Defense Committee sent from Debrecen 100 wagons with munitions. At 10 April the III. Hungarian army corps, led by General János Damjanich defeated in the Battle of Vác the Ramberg division led by Major General Christian Götz, who was fatally wounded.|$|E

The imperial high commandment led by Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz even after this battle, was unsure if the main Hungarian army stayed before Pest of it already moved towards north, wanting to relieve Komárom. They still believed in the possibility that only a secondary unit attacked Vác, and moves towards the besieged Hungarian fortress. When Windisch-Grätz finally seemed to grasp what is happening in reality, wanting to make a powerful attack at 14 April against the Hungarians at Pest, than to cross the Danube at Esztergom, and cut the way of the army which was marching towards Komárom, but his corps commanders, General Franz Schlik and [...] Lieutenant Field Marshal Josip Jelačić refused to obey to his commands, so his plan, which could cause serious problems to the Hungarian armies, was not realized.|$|E
