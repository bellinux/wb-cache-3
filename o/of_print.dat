40|$|There is {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} the properties <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> material (papers and films) on features <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> production <b>of</b> nanophotonic systems and on photoluminescent properties <b>of</b> obtained <b>printed</b> coatings with nanoscale photoactive components. There was experimentally determined the impact of surface microstructure, porosity, linen of paper, polymer film thickness, humidity <b>of</b> <b>printing</b> material on luminescent characteristics <b>of</b> obtained <b>printed</b> nanophotonic systems. There was determined that practically all inadequate values <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> materials that will lead to a decrease in luminescence intensity <b>of</b> nanophotonic <b>printed</b> layers can be compensated by the thickness of the deposition layer and increasing concentrations of the luminescent component in the composition, in other words, by the methods of increasing the intensity of luminescence nanophotonic layer. There was shown that the use <b>of</b> <b>printed</b> material with optimal characteristics will reduce rates of consumption of luminescent nanomaterial, and nanophotonic composition, increase the safety of nanophotonic system for use in food packaging due to a decrease in the amount of substances that can migrate into a packaged product, as well as reduce the cost <b>of</b> the <b>printed</b> product by reducing the cost of nanophotonic composition. ??????????? ??????? ??????? ??????????????? ?????????
