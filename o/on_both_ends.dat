5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{within a}} population for a trait that can vary across {{a range of}} values, such as height, can be categorised into three different types. The first is directional selection, which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time—for example, organisms slowly getting taller. Secondly, disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common, with selection against the average value. This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage, but not those of medium height. Finally, in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends,</b> which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity. This would, for example, cause organisms to slowly become all the same height.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{is unknown}} except for {{possibly}} {{a portion of}} lower jaw found at the same site {{as the rest of}} the known Coelurus material. Although it has the same preservation and coloring as the fossils known to belong to the Coelurus skeleton, it is very slender, which may mean it does not belong to the skeleton; this bone is 7.9centimeters long (3.1in) but only 1.1centimeters tall (0.43in). In general, its vertebrae were long and low, with low neural spines and thin walls to the bodies of the vertebrae. Its neck vertebrae were very pneumatic, with numerous hollow spaces on their surfaces (pleurocoels); these hollows were not evenly distributed among the vertebrae and varied in size. The neck vertebrae were very elongate, with bodies four times longer than wide, and they articulated with concave faces <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> (amphicoely). The back vertebrae were not as elongate, lacked surface hollows, and had less developed concave faces and bodies that were hourglass-shaped. The tail vertebrae also lacked surface hollows.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} four business routes of Interstate69 (I-69) in the US state of Michigan. Designated Business Loop Interstate69 (BL I-69), {{they are all}} former routings of I-69's predecessor highways, US Highway27 (US27), M-78 or M-21, {{in whole or in}} part. The BL I-69 in Coldwater and the one in Charlotte were both parts of US27 before the freeway bypassed those two cities in 1967 and the early 1970s, respectively. The BL I-69 through Lansing and East Lansing was previously part of M-78 and Temporary I-69 until it was redesignated in 1987. Before 1984, the loop in Port Huron was originally part of M-21 and was initially a business spur numbered Business Spur Interstate69 (BS I-69). It was later redesignated when it was extended to run concurrently with that city's BL I-94 which was originally part of I-94's predecessor, US25. Each business loop follows streets through each city's downtown areas and connects to I-69 <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends,</b> giving traffic a route through the downtown and back to the freeway.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Several {{series of}} {{light-emitting}} oligo(p-phenylene-vinylene) s (BIII and BV series containing three- and five-conjugated phenylene rings) with various side groups and end groups {{attached to the}} cores were synthesized and characterized. The analo-gous PBV polymers, derived from the BV series, were also synthesized and investigated. Blue and greenish light emissions were observed in the photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the blend and pure films with these p-conjugated structures. In contrast to the three-conjugated ring oligomers, the five-conjugated ring derivatives (oligomers and polymers) had larger maximum emission wavelength values of PL and EL emissions. Mesomorphism was introduced into the BV series by the replacement of three-conjugated rings (BIII series) with five-conjugated phenyl cores (BV series). The liquid-crystalline properties of the BV series with <b>end</b> groups (<b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> rings) were better than those of analogous BV-OC 8 without end groups. Polarized PL emissions were obtained by the alignment of liquid-crystalline phase in rubbing cells. Upon heating, different PL emission wavelengths and intensities were observed in various phases. Not only the solubility and thermal properties but also the PL and EL properties could be effectively adjusted by the attachment of flexible alkoxy groups either on the central rings or <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> rings of the conjugated cores.

5|$|There {{have been}} nine {{business}} routes for Interstate75 in the US state of Michigan. Numbered either Business Loop Interstate 75 (BL I-75) or Business Spur Interstate 75 (BS I-75) depending {{if they are}} a full business loop or a business spur, these highways are former routings of I-75's predecessor highways in the state. They were designated as I-75 was completed through the various areas of Michigan. The business loop in Pontiac runs through that city's downtown along a section of Woodward Avenue and a segment of roadway formerly used by M-24. The former Saginaw business loop was once a part of US Highway23 (US23), as was most of the original Bay City business loop. The roadways {{that make up the}} business loops in West Branch and Roscommon were previously part of M-76, I-75's predecessor through that part of the state. In Northern Michigan, the Grayling and Gaylord BL I-75s were part of US27, and the two business routes in St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan were part of US2. A tenth business route, a loop through Indian River has been proposed. Each of the business loops connects to I-75 <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> and runs through their respective cities' downtown areas. The two business spurs only connect to I-75 on one end and run into the appropriate downtown.|$|E
