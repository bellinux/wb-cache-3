5|$|Directly {{named for}} Kepler's {{contribution}} to science are Kepler's laws of planetary motion, Kepler's Supernova (Supernova 1604, which he <b>observed</b> <b>and</b> described) and the Kepler Solids, {{a set of}} geometrical constructions, two of which were described by him, and the Kepler conjecture on sphere packing.|$|E

5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if <b>observed</b> <b>and</b> aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|At least 32 {{synthetic}} isotopes of yttrium {{have been}} <b>observed,</b> <b>and</b> these range in atomic mass number from 76 to 108. The least stable {{of these is}} 106Y with a half-life of >150ns (76Y has a half-life of >200ns) and the most stable is 88Y with a half-life of 106.626days. Apart from the isotopes 91Y, 87Y, and 90Y, with half-lives of 58.51days, 79.8hours, and 64hours, respectively, all the other isotopes have half-lives of {{less than a day}} and most of less than an hour.|$|E
5|$|Bewick is {{best known}} for his A History of British Birds, which is admired today mainly for its wood engravings, {{especially}} the small, sharply <b>observed,</b> <b>and</b> often humorous vignettes known as tail-pieces. The book was the forerunner of all modern field guides. He notably illustrated editions of Aesop's Fables throughout his life.|$|E

5|$|Evidence {{from studies}} of {{mitochondrial}} DNA suggests that humans may have passed through a genetic bottleneck around this time that reduced genetic diversity below what would be expected given {{the age of the}} species. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, proposed by Stanley H. Ambrose of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1998, the effects of the Toba eruption may have decreased the size of human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals. However, this hypothesis is not widely accepted because similar effects on other animal species have not been <b>observed,</b> <b>and</b> paleoanthropology suggests there was no population bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Following World War I, in the {{capacity}} as an engineering advisor, Verville joined General Billy Mitchell and his aide, Lieutenant Clayton Bissell, on their sailing trip to Europe in December 1921. The three men toured France, Italy, Germany, Holland, and England in order {{to check on the}} European progress of aviation. From their research they produced a 206-page report, which was published as an U.S. Army Air Service Information Circular. General Mitchell asked Verville to incorporate some of the European developments they had <b>observed</b> <b>and</b> to produce a plane for the U.S. Army Air Service's participation in the upcoming 1922 National Air Races.|$|E

Clear records of the comet's appearances were made by Chinese, Babylonian, and medieval European chroniclers, but were not recognized as reappearances of the same object at the time. The comet's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom it is now named.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the evidentiary guidelines forensic anthropologists should always {{keep in mind that}} the remains they are working with were once a person.

5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, {{preparations}} were taken along threatened areas of coastal Florida (mainly the Tampa Bay Area), including the evacuation of thousands of residents. Damage was extensive in Cuba, and five people were killed there. The cyclone's effects in the United States were minor to moderate, and the most significant impact was to citrus crops. No deaths occurred in the country, although high tides caused some flooding of low-lying terrain. The cyclone's structure was extensively <b>observed</b> <b>and</b> investigated.|$|E

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} iron {{consists of}} four stable isotopes: 5.845% of 54Fe, 91.754% of 56Fe, 2.119% of 57Fe and 0.282% of 58Fe. Of these stable isotopes, only 57Fe has a nuclear spin (−). The nuclide 54Fe theoretically can undergo double electron capture to 54Cr, but the process has never been <b>observed</b> <b>and</b> only a lower limit on the half-life of 3.1×1022 years has been established.|$|E
5|$|On 10 June a patrol—designated Operation Faun Fare—consisting of 7 Platoon, C Company under Lieutenant Robert Guest, {{accompanied}} the company commander Major Ivor Hodgkinson, the Intelligence Officer and a fire control party, {{left the company}} base at Serikin to mount an ambush on the Sungei Koemba river. The site of the ambush {{was to be a}} little further downstream from the successful action the previous month, being more towards the Indonesian positions at Siding. The Australian patrol occupied its intended ambush position early the next morning and proceeded to wait. During the day two boats occupied by civilians were <b>observed</b> <b>and</b> allowed to pass unhindered, as were three more the next morning.|$|E

5|$|Telescopium was {{introduced}} in 1751–52 by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille with the French name le Telescope, depicting an aerial telescope, after he had <b>observed</b> <b>and</b> catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. All but one honored instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. Covering 40 degrees of the night sky, the telescope stretched out northwards between Sagittarius and Scorpius. Lacaille had Latinised its name to Telescopium by 1763.|$|E

Thayer obtained a patent in 1902 to paint warships, both submarines and surface ships, using countershading, but failed to convince the US Navy to adopt his ideas.|$|E
