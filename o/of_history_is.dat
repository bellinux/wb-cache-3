5|$|In {{spite of}} the {{overwhelming}} British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian Edward Ingram noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue {{the war in the}} Middle East and later to return to Europe personally unscathed. The potential of a successful engagement at sea to change the course <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> underscored by the list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, Louis-Alexandre Berthier, Auguste de Marmont, Jean Lannes, Joachim Murat, Louis Desaix, Jean Reynier, Antoine-François Andréossy, Jean-Andoche Junot, Louis-Nicolas Davout and Dumas were all passengers on the cramped Mediterranean crossing.|$|E

25|$|It is {{now widely}} {{accepted}} outside Indonesia {{that the official}} version <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> largely fabricated. The western support and endorsement for this ‘fabricated version’ of history whereby the PKI was the enemy {{can be explained by}} their opposition to the communist ideals. The nature of the killings of the generals were hence represented to exaggerate the cruelty involved in order to instigate people’s disdain towards the PKI.|$|E

25|$|Stapledon's {{conception}} <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} the Hegelian Dialectic, following a repetitive cycle with many varied civilisations rising from and descending back into savagery over millions of years, {{but it is also}} one of progress, as the later civilisations rise to far greater heights than the first. The book anticipates the science of genetic engineering, and is an early example of the fictional supermind; a consciousness composed of many telepathically-linked individuals.|$|E
25|$|The end <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>is,</b> alas, {{also the}} end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E
25|$|Initially twelve volumes were planned, {{but after}} the work began it became evident that {{coverage}} of modern Lithuanian history would require an additional volume.

Artūras Dubonis, prof. dr. Zigmantas Kiaupa, prof. habil. dr. Jūratė Kiaupienė, dr. Česlovas Laurinavičius, dr. Rimantas Miknys, dr. Gintautas Sliesoriūnas, and dr. Gintautas Zabiela. More than 20 scholars are working on this project. Each volume is peer reviewed and has an additional responsible editor.

In particular, the novel argues that knowledge <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> power, particularly as it is written in books. The title can refer {{to any of the}} major characters, including Dracula. As Nancy Baker explains in The Globe and Mail, the novel is [...] "about the love of books" [...] and the knowledge and comfort they offer the characters– even Dracula himself is a bibliophile. As one critic explains, the novel is specifically about the love of scholarship. At the heart of the novel is an exploration of [...] "the power and price of scholarly obsession".

500|$|The view {{of history}} propounded in this text is very {{strongly}} influenced by Giambattista Vico, and the metaphysics of Giordano Bruno of Nola {{are important to the}} interplay of the [...] "characters." [...] Vico propounded a cyclical {{view of history}}, in which civilisation rose from chaos, passed through theocratic, aristocratic, and democratic phases, and then lapsed back into chaos. The most obvious example of the influence of Vico's cyclical theory <b>of</b> <b>history</b> <b>is</b> {{to be found in the}} opening and closing words of the book. Finnegans Wake opens with the words [...] "riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs." [...] ("vicus" [...] is a pun on Vico) and ends [...] "A way a lone a last a loved a long the." [...] In other words, the book ends with the beginning of a sentence and begins with the end of the same sentence, turning the book into one great cycle. Indeed, Joyce said that the ideal reader of the Wake would suffer from [...] "ideal insomnia" [...] and, on completing the book, would turn to page one and start again, and so on in an endless cycle of reading.|$|E
