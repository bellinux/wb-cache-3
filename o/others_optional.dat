[...] Examples given are South Indian music, which doesn't modulate and isn't equally tempered (13 & 14), and music such as that of Claude Debussy, Béla Bartók, and others who [...] "have developed consonance-dissonance patterns directly from the total chromatic" [...] (14-17).|$|E
50|$|A raga is {{a central}} concept of Indian music, {{predominant}} in its expression. According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of raga cannot be offered {{in one or two}} sentences. Raga may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, {{in a manner similar to}} how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression. In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in <b>others</b> <b>optional.</b> The raga allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.|$|E

The message is broken into three distinct sections: the head, body and tail. Fields must remain within the correct section and within each section the position may be important as fields can act as delimiters that stop one message from running into the next. The final field in any FIX message is tag 10 (checksum).|$|E

Also, some words (for example, many measure words, such as units) have a special [...] "count form" [...] (счётная форма) for use in numerical phrases instead of genitive (for some words mandatory, for <b>others</b> <b>optional),</b> for example, восемь мегабайт, пять килограмм and пять килограммов, три ряда́ and три ря́да, and полтора часа́.|$|E

50|$|The European Hotelstars Union {{system is}} based on the earlier German hotelstars system that had widely {{influenced}} the hotel classifications in central Europe, with five stars and a Superior mark to flag extras. Instead of a strict minimum in room size and required shower facilities (e.g. a bath tub in a four-star hotel) there is a catalogue of criteria with 21 qualifications encompassing 270 elements, where some are mandatory for a star and <b>others</b> <b>optional.</b> The main criteria are in quality management, wellness and sleeping accommodation. In the catalogue of criteria each entry is associated with a number of points - each Hotelstars level requires a minimal sum of points besides some criteria being obligatory for the level. The minimum requirement for the Superior flag requires the same sum of points as for the next Hotelstars level which however was not awarded due to at least one obligatory requirement being left out.|$|E

40|$|Kari (1976) {{shows that}} in {{underlying}} /nV / sequences in Navajo, the vowel is often deleted, while the nasal becomes syllabic. The applicability of the process depends on what follows the /nV / sequence—in some cases it is obligatory, in <b>others</b> <b>optional,</b> and in others blocked. Furthermore, in optional cases deletion occurs more frequently in faster or more casual speech. In this paper I attempt to answer two questions regarding this process. First, why does the [n] become a nucleus even in contexts where it could remain a coda? Second, how can we account for the optionality of the process in terms of Optimality Theoretic constraint ranking? In § 1 I analyze the creation of syllabic nasals {{as a type of}} compensatory lengthening. In § 2 I model the varying behavior of vowel deletion under a range of different speech styles by allowing a single markedness constraint to be reranked along a fixed hierarchy of faithfulness constraints. This account uses AGREE constraints in a novel way: they block the creation of a heterorganic NC sequence on the surface rather than force the repair of an underlying heterorganic sequence. Finally, in § 3 I discuss some issues left unresolved in my account...|$|E
40|$|Background There is a {{shortage}} of suitably qualified therapists able to deliver evidence-based treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), precluding timely access to intervention. This work aimed to develop an optimally effective, feasible, and acceptable guided self-help (GSH) program for treatment of the disorder. Methods The study followed Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance {{for the development of a}} complex intervention. A prototype GSH program was developed through an initial modeling phase. Systematic reviews of the literature informed a portfolio of up-to-date information for key stakeholders to consider and discuss in a series of focus groups and semistructured interviews, which included 10 mental health professionals with expertise in the fields of GSH and/or PTSD, and seven former PTSD sufferers. Data were analyzed through a process of Inductive Thematic Analysis and used to inform the content, delivery, and guidance of a GSH program for PTSD. The prototype was piloted with 19 PTSD sufferers in two pilot studies, and refined on the basis of their quantitative results and qualitative feedback. Results The final version was available online and in hardcopy. It included 11 modules, some being mandatory and <b>others</b> <b>optional,</b> allowing tailoring of the intervention to meet an individual's specific needs. Qualitative and quantitative results of the pilot studies supported its efficacy in terms of reducing traumatic stress symptoms and its acceptability to PTSD sufferers. Conclusion...|$|E
