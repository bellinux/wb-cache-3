5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they {{relate to each other}} as systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E

5|$|The {{ecological}} succession concept, pioneered in the 1900s and 1910s by Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederic Clements, {{was important in}} early plant ecology. Alfred Lotka's predator-prey equations, G. Evelyn Hutchinson's studies of the biogeography and biogeochemical structure of lakes and rivers (limnology) and Charles Elton's studies of animal food chains were pioneers among the succession of quantitative methods that colonized the developing ecological specialties. Ecology became an independent discipline in the 1940s and 1950s after Eugene P. Odum synthesized many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> of ecosystem ecology, placing relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) {{at the center of}} the field.|$|E

5|$|The {{publication}} of Alfred Wegener's (1880–1930) theory of continental drift 1912 gave additional impetus to comparative physiology {{and the study}} of biogeography while ecology in the 1930s contributed the important ideas of plant community, succession, community change, and energy flows. From 1940 to 1950 ecology matured to become an independent discipline as Eugene Odum (1913–2002) formulated many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> of ecosystem ecology, emphasising relationships between groups of organisms (especially material and energy relationships) as key factors in the field. Building on the extensive earlier work of Alphonse de Candolle, Nikolai Vavilov (1887–1943) from 1914 to 1940 produced accounts of the geography, centres of origin, and evolutionary history of economic plants.|$|E
5|$|The terms First World, Second World, and Third World were {{originally}} used {{to divide the}} world's nations into three categories. The model did not emerge to its end state all at once.

5|$|While earlier cases {{expressed}} {{this stage}} of the test as a determination of whether a law is discriminatory, the Court of Appeal has warned against the confusing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> of differentiation and discrimination. A differentiating law is one that draws distinctions between groups of people. A discriminatory law or executive act, on the other hand, is one that contravenes Article 12(1) and hence is unconstitutional. Therefore, the mere finding of a differentiating measure in this first stage does not necessarily make the law discriminatory, as the other two stages will still have to be taken into consideration. If the impugned statute does not contain such a differentiating measure, it is a good law and the objection fails.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of its development, Sicilian Baroque still lacked the freedom of style that it was later to acquire. Giovanni Battista Vaccarini was the leading Sicilian {{architect}} during this period. He arrived on the island in 1730 bringing with him a fusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> of Bernini and Borromini, and introduced to the island's architecture a unified movement and a play of curves, {{which would have been}} unacceptable in Rome itself. However, his works are considered of lesser quality than that which was to come. Notable works which date from this period are the 18th century wings of the Palazzo Biscari at Catania; and Vaccarini's church of Santa Agata, also in Catania. On this building Vaccarini quite clearly copied the capitals from Guarino Guarini's Architettura Civile. It is this frequent copying of established designs that causes the architecture from this period, while opulent, also to be disciplined and almost reined in. Vaccarini's style was to dominate Catania for the next decades.|$|E
5|$|The doctrinal {{changes in}} the church {{occurred}} gradually, but by 1994, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concepts</b> of Armstrongism had been largely modified or discontinued. However, the major bombshell was dropped during {{what is now called}} the Christmas Eve Sermon. Tapes of Tkach's sermon (dated January 7, 1995) were delivered to local congregations for viewing. In this sermon, he publicly declared that the Worldwide Church of God was a New Covenant church and, therefore, not bound by the terms of the Old Covenant. Christian theology defines the Old Covenant as the Mosaic Law embodied in the Torah. Hence, by making this statement, Tkach officially dropped all doctrines based on Mosaic Law (i.e., the keeping of the Sabbath, the Holy Days, and the dietary laws), making observance of such practices an individual choice. He also dropped the requirement of tithing, declaring that giving as taught in the New Testament was voluntary. The last change had a significant and rather immediate impact on church finances.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> vague <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> a European {{cultural}} heritage is frequently referred to – but rarely explicitly defined – in scholarly discussion. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> in academia constructs a European {{cultural heritage}} {{as a category}} in research and explicitly and implicitly produces its focuses and outlines.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to discuss <b>the</b> 'versatility' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> social representations, in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-saxon tradition <b>of</b> social psychological research. This {{is done by}} analysing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept's</b> internal features - what we call <b>the</b> 'openness' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> - along with the various {{ways in which it}} has been incorporated by other approaches within social psychology - bringing about what we call <b>the</b> 'closure' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept.</b> It is suggested that the theory has provided a 'convenient social package' to social psychological perspectives historically criticized as being asocial. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> pre-established methods and techniques combined with social representations theory provides a "safe" territory to do research, where one introduces something allegedly "novel", i. e. the social, {{and at the same time}} does not assume <b>the</b> full consequences <b>of</b> that novelty. We argue that while the very openness and flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> might invite convenient combinations, these are usually achieved at a cost. <b>The</b> theoretical integrity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept</b> is compromised, mainly by treating social representations as a technological answer to theoretical lacuna <b>of</b> other perspectives. <b>The</b> outcome is a premature epistemological closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>concept,</b> which disempowers its otherwise lively theoretical resources...|$|R

As a teenager, he obtained a news butcher job on the Missouri Pacific Railway, selling various products to train passengers, including newspapers, candy, and cigars. Many years later, after co-founding the Walt Disney Company with his older brother Roy O. Disney, he started playing polo. Fractured vertebrae and other injuries led him to abandon the sport on the advice of his doctor, who recommended a calmer recreational activity. Starting in late 1947, he developed an interest in model trains after purchasing several Lionel train sets.|$|E
