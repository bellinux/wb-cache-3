5|$|In 2012, DeMarco {{went back}} to {{recording}} as a solo artist and was signed by Captured Tracks. They released his EP Rock and Roll Night Club in early 2012; it received positive reviews from contemporary music critics. His second studio album, 2, followed later the same year. 2 was met with critical acclaim and peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. It was followed by DeMarco’s third studio album, Salad Days in 2014. Salad Days was also praised by critics and peaked at number 90 on the UK Albums Chart, and number 30 on the Billboard 200. DeMarco released an EP titled Some Other Ones and the mini-LP Another One {{in the summer of}} 2015. Another One was met with positive reviews and peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart. In the United States, it peaked at number 25 on the Billboard 200, selling 13,000 copies in its first week. This <b>Old</b> <b>Dog,</b> DeMarco's fourth album was released in the summer of 2017 to critical acclaim.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011, Wold {{signed to}} Play It Again Sam to release {{his new album}} with the {{exception}} of the US, where it will be released on Third Man Records. Subsequently his new album You Can't Teach an <b>Old</b> <b>Dog</b> New Tricks was released on his new labels and it was announced that former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones had played on the new album, and performed alongside Wold to promote it. This caused some to believe that he will tour with Wold as a part of his backing band, joining his then-current drummer Dan. John Paul Jones did indeed appear onstage to play with Wold at the Isle of Wight 2011 festival and on the main stage of Rock Werchter 2011.|$|E
25|$|Henry Jones {{also gave}} him the liberty to train his own stud over his grounds, and one of these was Half Caste (a horse owned by the team of John Gerard Leigh and Samuel Brisco Sheward). Other horses {{mentioned}} as being under his management were <b>Old</b> <b>Dog</b> Tray, Lady Hathaway, Abd-el-Kader (by Scutari, and so not the 1850 and 1851 National winner, although Green did ride him unsuccessfully in the 1858 Grand National), The Screw, Fox and Yeoman. Half Caste learnt 'his fine quick style of jumping' at Apes Hall and was prepared for the 1859 Grand National here and finally at Newmarket - Green relocated from Littleport to the premises (off Station Road) lately occupied by W. Smith in Newmarket. A month before the Aintree race, he was still taking in horses for training.|$|E

500|$|Andersen biographer Alison Prince {{believes}} the tale to be a parable representing {{the different kinds}} of love. When the Snowman asks the dog why a young man and woman stroll about the wintry garden hand-in-hand, the disillusioned <b>old</b> <b>dog</b> tells him the two are engaged and will soon be moving into [...] "the same kennel together and sharing each other's bones". The Snowman has a different idea of love, being enamored of the stove. Prince considers the image of the poker found within the Snowman's remains [...] "a homoerotic image of such potency that a failure to spot it seems inconceiveable." ...|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free <b>Old</b> <b>Dog</b> Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That just goes to show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Salt Lake Tribune gave <b>Old</b> <b>Dogs</b> {{a rating}} of zero stars out of a {{possible}} four, and criticized the film for [...] "hammy acting and sledgehammer editing". Film critic Roger Moore of The Orlando Sentinel gave <b>Old</b> <b>Dogs</b> {{a rating of}} one and a half stars {{out of a possible}} four. [...] "Trashing <b>Old</b> <b>Dogs</b> is a bit like kicking a puppy. But here goes. The new comedy from some of the folks who brought us Wild Hogs is badly written and broadly acted, shamelessly manipulative and not above stopping by the toilet for a laugh or two," [...] wrote Moore.|$|R

500|$|Both Grand Forks and East Grand Forks had {{to decide}} whether to develop the land along the river. The {{president}} of the East Grand Forks planning-and-zoning commission commented on the idea of development, [...] "The river had been our friend for all these years. It had been like an <b>old</b> <b>dog,</b> sleeping comfortably at our feet, and then one day it jumped up and bit us. We {{had to decide}}: Do we put it to sleep or try to make amends?" [...] What were once entire neighborhoods are now covered by grass and trees, part of an extensive area of parkland called the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. In East Grand Forks, this transformation is especially visible. One former neighborhood is now a large campground, the center of what is now known as the Red River State Recreation Area. The cities of today are significantly different from their pre-flood state, but many residents are pleased with this, seeing it as fulfillment of President Bill Clinton's promise that the cities would [...] "rebuild stronger and better than ever." [...] Population estimates by the Census Bureau and by the city of Grand Forks itself now show a growing community.|$|E

2500|$|Richards' {{keynote address}} to the 1988 Democratic National Convention {{put her in the}} {{national}} spotlight. The speech was highly critical of the Reagan Administration and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush. Her address was notable for including several humorous remarks displaying her down-home Texas charm such as: [...] "I'm delighted to be here with you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like", [...] "Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth", [...] "…two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels." [...] and [...] "When we pay billions for planes that won't fly, billions for tanks that won't fire, and billions for systems that won't work, that <b>old</b> <b>dog</b> won't hunt. And you don't have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesn't make America strong, that it's a bum deal." [...] Richards' convention address has been cited by rhetorical experts as a historically significant speech.|$|E

Even at that {{distance}} of a hundred yards and more he could see the dawning recognition in the obese brown-white body. The <b>old</b> <b>dog</b> got off his haunches, and his tail, close-curled over his back, began a feeble, excited fluttering; he came waddling forward, gathered momentum, and disappeared {{over the edge of the}} fernery. Jolyon expected to meet him at the wicket gate, but Balthasar was not there, and, rather alarmed, he turned into the fernery.
