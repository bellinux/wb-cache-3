40|$|SummaryDyggve-Melchior-Clausen {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} spondylo-epiphyseal disease, which almost constantly leads to both bilateral hip degeneration and dislocation. Few authors have reported to date the surgical management of this <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorder.</b> We present two new cases affecting siblings. One brother was treated by unilateral triple pelvic osteotomy combined with varus osteotomy of the proximal femur; the other was treated by bilateral Pemberton osteotomies with varus osteotomy of the proximal femur. At a respective 5 -year and 3 -year follow-up delay, both cases had evolved towards progressive subluxation recurrence along with severe hip degeneration. Based on both our experience and literature review, it seems that one should avoid operating these hips unless pain renders surgery mandatory. Total hip arthroplasty seems the only reliable surgical solution at the adult age and paediatric surgeons {{should keep in mind}} that previous femoral osteotomies will make it more challenging for adult orthopaedic surgeons to implant on a remodeled anatomy...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{molecular}} biology has paved {{way for an}} era of personalized medicine. Though medical disciplines such as oncology and cardiology are advanced {{in their use of}} genomics, implementation has been slower in other specialties, such as orthopaedics. Recent advances in genomic technology have shed light on the underlying genetic basis of various pediatric <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorders.</b> Prior understanding of the genetic makeup of a patient may help individualize care in patients with conditions including idiopathic scoliosis, congenital talipes equinovarus and congenital limb deformities. The fastpaced growth of information in orthogenomics often makes it challenging for an orthopaedic surgeon to effectively use this information for patient care. Genetic characterization of a patient will help indicate risk of progression of a condition, recurrence and/or response to a treatment modality, and a collaborative approach between an orthopaedic surgeon and a geneticist can help tailor patient care.

The {{aim of the}} present study is to determine the underlying molecular defect of HME in two multigenerational Tunisian families with 21 affected members and to examine the degree of intrafamilial variability. Linkage analysis was performed using three microsatellite markers encompassing the EXT 1 locus and mutation screening was carried out by direct sequencing. In family 1, evidence for linkage to EXT 1 was obtained {{on the basis of a}} maximum LOD score of 4. 26 at theta = 0. 00 with D 8 S 1694 marker. Sequencing of the EXT 1 revealed a heterozygous G > T transversion (c. 1019 G > T) in exon 2, leading to a missense mutation at the codon 340 (p. Arg 340 Leu). In family 2 we identified a novel heterozygous 1 bp deletion in the exon 1 (c. 52931 delA) leading to a premature codon stop and truncated EXT 1 protein expression (p. Lys 177 LysfsX 15). This mutation was associated with the evidence of an intrafamilial clinical variability and considered to be a novel disease-causing mutation in the EXT 1 gene.

30|$|<b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>disorders</b> {{are very}} frequent, {{globally}} found and often partially unresolved despite the substantial advances {{in science and}} medicine. Their surgical intervention is multifarious and the most favourable treatment is chosen by the orthopaedic surgeon {{on a case-by-case basis}} depending on a number of factors related with the patient and the lesion. Numerous regenerative tissue engineering strategies have been developed and studied extensively in laboratory through in vitro experiments and preclinical in vivo trials with various established animal models, while a small proportion of them reached the operating room. However, based on the available literature, the current strategies have not yet achieved to fully solve the clinical problems. Thus, the gold standards, if existing, remain unchanged in the clinics, notwithstanding the known limitations and drawbacks. Herein, the involvement of regenerative tissue engineering in the clinical orthopaedics is reviewed. The current challenges are indicated and discussed in order to describe the current disequilibrium between the needs and solutions made available in the operating room. Regenerative tissue engineering is a very dynamic field that has a high growth rate and a great openness and ability to incorporate new technologies with passion to edge towards the Holy Grail that is functional tissue regeneration. Thus, the future of clinical solutions making use of regenerative tissue engineering principles for the management of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorders</b> is firmly supported by the clinical need.|$|R

40|$|Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD) is a common, {{painful and}} {{debilitating}} <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorder</b> of dogs with a partly genetic, multifactorial aetiology. Worldwide, potential breeding dogs are evaluated for CHD using radiographically based screening schemes {{such as the}} nine ordinally-scored British Veterinary Association Hip Traits (BVAHTs). The effectiveness of selective breeding based on screening results requires that {{a significant proportion of}} the phenotypic variation is caused by the presence of favourable alleles segregating in the population. This proportion, heritability, was measured in a cohort of 13, 124 Australian German Shepherd Dogs born between 1976 and 2005, displaying phenotypic variation for BVAHTs, using ordinal, linear and binary mixed models fitted by a Restricted Maximum Likelihood method. Heritability estimates for the nine BVAHTs ranged from 0. 14 - 0. 24 (ordinal models), 0. 14 - 0. 25 (linear models) and 0. 12 - 0. 40 (binary models). Heritability for the summed BVAHT phenotype was 0. 30 ± 0. 02. The presence of heritable variation demonstrates that selection based on BVAHTs has the potential to improve BVAHT scores in the population. Assuming a genetic correlation between BVAHT scores and CHD-related pain and dysfunction, the welfare of Australian German Shepherds can be improved by continuing to consider BVAHT scores in the selection of breeding dogs, but that as heritability values are only moderate in magnitude the accuracy, and effectiveness, of selection could be improved by the use of Estimated Breeding Values in preference to solely phenotype based selection of breeding animals...|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis of {{the spine}} Tuberculosis {{of the spine}} is an age-old disease with a {{recorded}} history which {{dates back to the}} time of Hippocrates, and possibly before. Until the middle of this century, it was a common <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorder</b> throughout the world but in the last 30 years or so it has become mainly a problem of the Third World. More recently, the disease has been appearing again in developed countries because of immigration and associ-ation with such chronic debilitating conditions as alcoholism and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Its relative rarity in developed countries has led to a decreased awareness of the condition and sometimes to delay in its diagnosis. Before the advent of antituberculous therapy in the 1940 s, treatment was by bed-rest, improvement of the patient’s nutritional status, and, in some cases, posterior spinal fusion to rest the disease focus locally. Consistently effective treatment began after the discovery of strepto-mycin, para-aminosalicylic acid, and isoniazid. These ‘first-line ’ drugs were later supplemented in resistant cases by ‘second-line ’ drugs. In 1944, Wilkinson revived an interest in active surgical intervention for tuberculosis of the spine (Wilkinson 1950). This was popularised and much expanded by the work of Hodgson and his coworkers in Hong Kong. On the other hand, Konstam and Konstam in 1958 and Konstam and Blesovsky in 1962 reported encouraging results from Nigeria using chemotherapy alone, and allowing the patients, if not incapacitated by paraparesis, to be ambulatory. Plaster jackets were used initially, but later only sparingly. In the face of such conflicting claims of good results from twodifferent methods oftreatment, the Medical Research Council of Great Britain (MRC) started prospective multi-centre clinical trials in Asia and Africa to attempt to find a scientific answer to this controversy.

When compared to other breeds, Rottweiler and Bernese Mountain dogs showed significantly high-   er risk to be affected by ED (odds ratio 3. 2 and 3. 0, respectively). Conversely, sex did not significantly affect the onset   of ED. When compared to the youngest group of dogs at screening (average: 14 months), the oldest group of screened   dogs (average: 40 months) exhibited a significantly higher risk of being diagnosed as affected by ED (odds ratio: 1. 9).   A negative status of hip joints appeared positively associated with a negative status of elbow joints, and dogs diagnosed   as affected by HD had a 40 % increased risk of being diagnosed as affected by ED.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to explain the theory and {{practice}} of Cognitive Therapeutic Exercise (CTE) for the re-education of <b>orthopaedic</b> ankle <b>disorders.</b> The most important characteristic of CTE is to consider the purpose of the exercises as an appropriate intervention in the cognitive process of motor learning.

The CTE for re-education of the ankle is divided into three phases : the non-weight-bearing phase, the partial weight-bearing phase, and the full weight-bearing phase. The purpose of the first phase is to re-educate the pressure sensation of the plantar part of the foot and the ankle joint position sense, which supply important informations for postural control. The second phase consists of weight transfer exercises on specially developed therapeutic tools.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{extent to}} which {{patients}} undergoing elective surgery for orthopaedic disorders were incapacitated for work while {{they were on the}} waiting list and whether they were able to return to work after surgery were studied. DESIGN [...] This was a prospective cohort study of patients admitted to hospital for elective orthopaedic surgery. Main outcome measures were occurrence of sickness certification during the waiting time, and whether those incapacitated for work at the time of surgery returned to work during the first year after treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios for factors influencing return to work. SETTING [...] Orthopaedic department in charge of all elective orthopaedic surgery in a population of 197, 354 persons in central Norway. SUBJECTS [...] All 2803 patients admitted to hospital for chronic orthopaedic disorders in the defined population between 1 September 1988 and 31 August 1990 were included in the study. MAIN RESULTS [...] Of the 1333 patients who were employed, 42 % had been certified sick due to the <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorder</b> for some period of the waiting time. Sickness benefits from the national insurance scheme (paid from the 15 th day of sickness certification) had been received by 33 % and were received by 29 % at the time of surgery. Of 380 patients incapacitated for work at the time of surgery, 53 % returned to work within the first year after surgery. Using those treated within one month of being placed on the waiting list as the reference group, the adjusted odds ratios for not returning to work during the first year after surgery were 9. 2 (p < 0. 0001) for those who waited more than a year for surgery, 6. 2 (p = 0. 002) for those waiting nine to 12 months, and 4. 9 (p = 0. 02) for those waiting for six to nine months. CONCLUSIONS [...] A high proportion of these patients were incapacitated for work, 53 % of those incapacitated returned to work within the first year after surgery. The probability of returning to work after surgery is strongly influenced by the length of time on the waiting list. Waiting for more than one year, compared with immediate treatment, was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 9. 2 for not returning to work...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{years of}} dedicated {{research into the}} origin of idiopathic scoliosis, the pathogenesis of this classic <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorder</b> has so far remained elusive. A striking feature of idiopathic scoliosis {{is the fact that}} it does not occur in vertebrates other than humans, despite many similarities in the basic architecture of the vertebral column across the species. From recent work by Castelein et al, it was demonstrated that the fully erect posture, which is unique to humans, significantly alters spinal loading conditions. It was shown that the backward inclined or 'declive' segments of the human spine are subject to dorsal shear loads. These dorsal shear loads are an important distinction between the human spine and the spine of all other vertebrates. In this thesis, it was postulated that excessive dorsal shear loads during the period of rapid growth, could lead to rotational instability of the declive segments of the spine. If progressive, these dorsal shear loads not only reduce rotational stability, but also can enhance a slight preexistent vertebral rotation. 1. In a biomechanical in vitro study on porcine and human spinal segments, we showed that at the mid and lower thoracic levels, significantly more vertebral rotation occurred under dorsal shear loads than under ventral shear loads. These data show that, in humans and in quadrupeds, the thoracic spine is less rotationally stable under dorsal shear loads than under ventral shear loads. We believe that these dorsally directed shear loads can, under critical circumstances during growth, introduce vertebral rotation, whereas ventrally directed loads counteract rotation. 2. The normal, nonscoliotic human spine shows a preexistent pattern of rotation in the transverse plane. The thoracic vertebrae are predominantly rotated to the right side, similar to what is seen in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. We believe that if the spine starts to decompensate into scoliosis, it seems logical that this built-in rotational pattern will be followed. 3. In neuromuscular scoliosis, it was demonstrated that despite the difference in origin, curve patterns in neuromuscular disease show many similarities with those in idiopathic scoliosis, such as a strong prevalence of right convex thoracic curves. We concluded that preexistent rotation, rather than muscle imbalance, also plays an important role in directing subsequent rotation in neuromuscular disease, as it does in idiopathic scoliosis. 4. We also showed the existence of a predominant rotation of the thoracic vertebrae to the right side in the quadruped spine, similar to what was found in humans. It was concluded that preexistent rotation can be considered as a physiological process in the normal development of the spine, independent of the pathogenesis of idiopathic scoliosis. 5. Finally, we demonstrated that the normal, nonscoliotic spine of humans with a complete mirror image reversal of the internal body organs (situs inversus totalis) shows a preexistent pattern of vertebral rotation opposite to what is seen in humans with normal organ anatomy. It was concluded that the asymmetrical anatomy of the thoracic organs is likely to play an important role in the development of this preexistent rotational tendency...|$|E

Hip US has also proven to be of great practical benefit when performing aspiration and injection within the joint and in the periarticular soft tissues. The relatively limited acoustic windows available to the US beam is the principal limitation to hip US thereby making detailed examination of some important structures impossible together with the interpretation of power Doppler signal sometimes unreliable.

40|$|SummaryOrthopaedic {{surgeons}} {{are often}} the first physicians to evaluate paediatric patients {{in the event of}} delayed walking, gait abnormalities, or parental concern about motor abilities. Therefore, orthopaedic surgeons must be thoroughly familiar with the normal neurodevelopmental stages. Neurological disorders are often first recognised during an orthopaedic evaluation. Minimal neurological abnormalities should be taken as warning signs that require additional investigations. Consequently, the evaluation must follow a strict protocol, even in children referred for apparently trivial functional disorders. We have developed an original physical examination protocol in which the largest possible number of signs is sought in each body position to ensure that the examination is both systematic and rapid. About ten minutes are required when all findings are normal. This protocol is extremely helpful for identifying the cause of the problem that motivated the evaluation or for reassuring the child and family. The main causes of paediatric <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorders</b> are cerebral palsy, spinal dysraphism, myopathies, peripheral neuropathies, motor neuron diseases, and intraspinal tumours. In some instances, no definitive diagnosis can be established clinically. In this situation, appropriate orthopaedic treatment can be initiated, although considerable caution is in order when establishing the indications. The cause may be detected only much later, when the clinical manifestations become more prominent...|$|R

Force platform was used to measure body's posture and kinematics during a STS test and therefore to assess (a), (b) and maximum vertical velocity (VVpeak), assumed as outcome measurement. Knee extensor maximal isometric voluntary contraction normalized by body mass (nMVC) was an indicator of (c). A multiple regression model was built to predict VVpeak from the three determinants of STS movement. In both groups, the model significantly determined VVpeak, with (a) and (c) being significant predictors of VVpeak and (a) being the major predictor. Rehabilitation was effective in improving nMVC. This process resulted in a change of the relative importance of (a) and (c), strength becoming the major predictor of VVpeak.

Existing hand function assessment methods, e. g. rating scales, accelerometers and electromyographical devices, are often time-consuming to administer, subjective in interpretation and/or expensive. Graphonomic tests are gaining popularity {{as a way}} of avoiding these drawbacks while relating directly to writing and drawing. Here we present a computerized Extended Drawing Test (EDT), which improves on an earlier Drawing Test for stroke patients in three ways. First, it assesses isolated proximal arm movement using a graphics pen in a puck-like pen holder, and in addition combined arm and finger dexterity in movements using a normal writing grip. Secondly, we calibrated our test against 186 healthy subjects (3 � 70 years), finding significant age- and handedness-related differences in both speed and accuracy of drawing. Thirdly, to simplify assessment we devised an overall performance measure using a variant of Fitts� Law combining speed and accuracy, which we found to be age-independent for healthy subjects above 3 years of age. This result enables us to provide age-independent performance norms using both hands, with and without the pen holder. These norms may assist quantification of specific arm dysfunction by comparing patient performance with the healthy norms, and also by comparing within-patient performance in the dominant and non-dominant hands with and without the pen holder. Using our freely available software, this new test will allow clinicians to rapidly assess arm and hand function across a wide range of patient categories and ages...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} included (N= 60) females {{from the}} territory of Municipality of Novi Sad. The sample of individuals included females of {{the average age of}} 58. 5 ± 6. 90, average body mass of 70. 9 kg± 15. 32, and average body height of 164. 8 m± 7. 24. The walking test of 2 kilometres of length offers the possibility to determine the Fitness Index (general ability) and evaluate maximal consumption of oxygen VO 2 max. Since the individuals were older, very demanding tests were not recommendable, so we chose UKK test of 2 kilometre walking. Although it engages great muscle groups, it is not considered a risky activity which can bring to quick body exhaustion. Nordic walking is very convenient for intensifying of the training, and {{the important thing is that}} it protects joints. The use of sticks off-loads the whole passive composition for moving, such as ligaments and connective tissues, back and joints (especially knees), for some 15 to 35 tonnes per hour. Because of that, Nordic walking is ideal as a rehabilitation sport for people with <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorders.</b> The protocol of the test requires observation of the air temperature in the span of 5 - 25 °C, moderate humidity, casual clothes or sweat suit and appropriate clothes and sneakers, and 5 to 10 minutes of warm-up: stretching of the spine muscles, legs muscles, and fast walking of 200 meters. After such preparations, the test starts, and each individual sets own tempo of walking. After 2 kilometres, we measure achieved time and the value of the puls...|$|R
30|$|The poor {{translation}} of regenerative tissue engineering to the clinics has been causing a demand and supply disequilibrium, and the tremendous effort of tissue engineers remain somewhat unappreciated. Apparently, {{it has been}} recognised that having {{a fundamental change in}} the clinical intervention of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorders</b> is not a short-term task. Besides, it is evident that success in the laboratory is a critical determinant for a human trial. However, the success of laboratory experiments can be maximised, and the outcomes of the research can be enhanced when academic researchers and clinicians work together and make joint efforts throughout the development of the clinical solution including the early stages of idea formation. Since the time of the idea generation and proposal preparation, clinical relevance with defined indications and efficacy measures are needed to create a roadmap for on the envisioned solution. Besides, regulatory requirements (Grieshober et al. 2017; Lysaght et al. 2017) should be known by the research team members from the beginning. For Europe, the Regulation (EC) no 1394 / 2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs), which is an optional classification procedure, and amending Directive 2001 / 83 /EC and Regulation (EC) No 726 / 2004 is available on [URL] Well-organised preclinical, clinical studies, especially multicenter, randomised clinical trials, although very challenging (Büchler et al. 2011; Ergina et al. 2009; Lyman et al. 2016) are extremely costly by all means. However, this is the robust way to study whether there is an evidence that regenerative tissue engineering solutions can be favoured over comparator treatments for targeted clinical conditions or not.|$|R
30|$|There {{have been}} several {{exciting}} advances in orthopaedic tissue engineering. Many lessons have been learned. Some issues were already solved, but many {{still need to be}} addressed while future problems may also arise. Reaching and getting through a clinical trial is a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive path, while all these things get exponential once entering the operating room. Based on the current evidence, there is a disequilibrium between the demand and supply in the clinics, and tissue engineering has still ample room to grow before delivering fully functional solutions. This mandatory growth will be an outcome of the teamwork between the scientific researchers, orthopaedic surgeons, research funding bodies, industry, investors, governmental bodies, and regulatory bodies. Orthopaedic tissues are 3 D solid/filled tissues that perform mechanically, thus scaffolds are and will be an indispensable volume filling and mechanically supporting component for large lesions. Future scaffold-based regeneration strategies should be evidenced to have: (i) superior tissue regeneration capability with excellent long-term clinical outcomes, and (ii) comparable cost with the existing methods. For this, the challenges should be recognised and addressed. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are worthy and bring original results from existing results. Although it may not be so easy, a superior research and funding mind-set seems to be necessary to encourage academic scientists and clinicians to execute studies that seek long-term outcomes, and high quality randomised clinical trials that take many years and consume a tremendous amount of money but yield only one paper eventually. With its dynamic and enthusiastic nature, tissue engineering may hopefully enable a major change in the clinical management of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorders</b> in the future, and in particular to personalised approaches, with only one ultimate goal – the healthier individuals.|$|R
40|$|Background: Therapy with mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs) has been {{reported}} to provide beneficial effects in the treatment of neurological and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorders</b> in dogs. The exact mechanism of action is poorly understood. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gives the opportunity to observe MSCs after clinical administration. To visualise MSCs with the help of MRI, labelling with an MRI contrast agent is necessary. However, it must be clarified whether there is any negative influence on cell function and viability after labelling prior to clinical administration. Results: For the purpose of the study, seven samples with canine adipose-derived stem cells were incubated with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO: 319. 2 µg/mL Fe) for 24 h. The internalisation of the iron particles occurred via endocytosis. SPIO particles were localized as free clusters in the cytoplasm or within lysosomes depending on the time of investigation. The efficiency of the labelling was investigated using Prussian blue staining and MACS assay. After 3 weeks the percentage of SPIO labelled canine stem cells decreased. Phalloidin staining showed no negative effect on the cytoskeleton. Labelled cells underwent osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. Chondrogenic differentiation occurred to a lesser extent compared with a control sample. MTT-Test and wound healing assay showed no influence of labelling on the proliferation. The duration of SPIO labelling was assessed using a 1 Tesla clinical MRI scanner and T 2 weighted turbo spin echo and T 2 weighted gradient echo MRI sequences 1, 2 and 3 weeks after labelling. The hypointensity caused by SPIO lasted for 3 weeks in both sequences. Conclusions: An Endorem labelling concentration of 319. 2 µg/mL Fe (448 µg/mL SPIO) had no adverse effects on the viability of canine ASCs. Therefore, this contrast agent {{could be used as a}} model for iron oxide labelling agents. However, the tracking ability in vivo has to be evaluated in further studies...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Femoral Neck Anteversion (FNA) is an {{important}} parameter for diagnosis of gait abnormality in children, risk of various congenital and acquired <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>disorders</b> as well as corrective osteotomy and hip arthroplasty. Femoral anteversion is the lateral rotation of {{the neck of the}} femur to the long axis of its shaft. Variability in FNA has been reported and is due to torsional forces applied on femur during development. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the angle of anteversion of femur in both genders on both sides. The present study was an attempt to provide baseline data of FNA in South Indian population, in particular, Andhra Pradesh. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was conducted mechanically on 70 dried adult unpaired human femora, i. e. 48 male and 22 female bones. The Kingsley Olmsted 1 method was used for the study and the data was analysed. Statistical analysis - Statistical analysis was done using student unpaired ‘t’ test. The data was analysed using GraphPad Prism 5. 0 (Free Trial Version). RESULTS Out of the 70 femora undertaken, mean value of FNA obtained in male is 15. 95, 14. 1 on right and 17. 8 on left sides and in female it is 19. 2, 21. 8 on right and 16. 6 on left side. Statistical analysis revealed significant (p < 0. 05) greater average anteversion in female bones and right-left variations being greater on the left side. CONCLUSION In the present study, the mean FNA was 17. 8 deg. There was a gender variation for the FNA values in the population studied with females showing higher value than the male with a statistically significant difference. The reason for the difference obtained could be the small sample size of female femora due to the rarity of the donated female bodies. The value was higher on the left side than the right; 50...|$|R
40|$|Work related {{injury to}} the thumb has become a {{recognised}} problem for physiotherapists who perform manual techniques {{in the treatment of}} patients with <b>orthopaedic</b> musculoskeletal <b>disorders.</b> Pain in the thumb often causes physiotherapists to alter their methods of treatment, which may decrease the effectiveness of physiotherapy services and lead to increased financial costs for patients and their funding agencies. Substantial numbers of physiotherapists have changed their specialty area or left the profession because of work-related injury, which further burdens education and healthcare systems. The extent of the influence of individual risk factors and preventive strategies on the development of thumb pain in physiotherapists has not been conclusively determined. This paper discusses the potential causes and consequences of thumb pain in physiotherapists, and reviews the supporting evidence on the incidence, risk, prevention, and treatment of this common occupational injury in physiotherapists...|$|R
