5|$|In 1960, {{while they}} were still dating, Achebe {{dedicated}} to Christie Okoli his second novel, No Longer at Ease, about a civil servant who is embroiled in the corruption of Lagos. The protagonist is Obi, grandson of Things Fall Aparts main character, Okonkwo. Drawing on his time in the city, Achebe writes about Obi's experiences in Lagos to reflect the challenges facing a new generation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of Nigerian independence. Obi is trapped between the expectations of his family, its clan, his home village, and larger society. He is crushed by these forces (like his grandfather before him) and finds himself imprisoned for bribery. Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional Igbo culture, Achebe demonstrated in his second novel an ability to depict modern Nigerian life.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Downtown Houston {{consisted}} {{of a collection of}} midrise office structures. Downtown was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of an energy industryled boom in 1970. A succession of skyscrapers was built throughout the 1970s—many by real estate developer Gerald D. Hines—culminating with Houston's tallest skyscraper, the 75-floor, -tall JPMorgan Chase Tower (formerly the Texas Commerce Tower), completed in 1982. It is the tallest structure in Texas, 15th tallest building in the United States, and the 85th-tallest skyscraper in the world, based on highest architectural feature. In 1983, the 71-floor, -tall Wells Fargo Plaza (formerly Allied Bank Plaza) was completed, becoming the second-tallest building in Houston and Texas. Based on highest architectural feature, it is the 17th-tallest in the United States and the 95th-tallest in the world. In 2007, downtown Houston had over 43million square feet (4,000,000m²) of office space.|$|E

5|$|On 16 September 1983 Druze forces massed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>threshold</b> of Suk El Gharb, {{a village}} defended by the Lebanese Army. Suk El Gharb was a village with {{strategic}} importance: the militias {{coming up from}} the south had to traverse Suk El Gharb to get to the Beirut–Aley road. Moreover, Suk El Gharb controlled a ridge that overlooked Baabda, Yarze, which was the location of the Ministry of Defence, and East Beirut. From that ridge, the Militia gunners could shoot directly downhill at those locations with artillery. United States Navy warships shelled Druze positions and helped the Lebanese Army hold the town of Suk El Gharb until a cease-fire was declared on 25 September, on which day the battleship New Jersey arrived on the scene. The arrival of New Jersey was one of several factors contributing to a {{reduction in the number of}} attacks on the Marines.|$|E

50|$|The first {{multiscale}} speckle reduction {{methods were}} based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>thresholding</b> of detail subband coefficients. Wavelet thresholding methods have some drawbacks: (i) <b>the</b> choice of <b>threshold</b> {{is made in}} an ad hoc manner, supposing that signal and noise components obey their known distributions, irrespective of their scale and orientations; and (ii) <b>the</b> <b>thresholding</b> procedure generally results in some artifacts in the denoised image.
