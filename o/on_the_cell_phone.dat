Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone.</b> Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E

Cooper then apologizes to Rex, stating that [...] "no son should pay for the sins of the fathers", and walks out of the shack.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of modern {{information and communication}} technologies has been predicted to have a dramatic impact on cultures and civil societies, especially in those developing countries that have been 'isolated' from the information society.

40|$|Background: Nowadays {{mobile phones}} are an {{important}} means of communication. These are used {{in an environment of}} high bacterial presence and become reservoirs for bacterial transmission especially when used in hospitals where these mobile phones become a source of spread of nosocomial infections, a threat to hospital hygiene. The present study was done <b>on</b> <b>the</b> purpose to detect and compare the growth of bacteria <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mobile phones of health care workers (HCWs) and the growth of bacteria <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mobile phones of non health care workers (non-HCWs). Objectives: To detect the presence of bacterial colonization <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mobile phones of health-care workers and compare it with the bacterial colonization of mobile phones of non-health care workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 2011. Sterile swabs were wiped over 150 mobile phones equally divided among HCWs and non HCWs. Each participant was also given a questionnaire to fill. The swabs were streaked <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> blood agar. Isolation was done using routine microbiological tests. Then the isolated organisms were tested for antibiotic resistance through antibiotic discs. All the ethical issues were taken into consideration. Results: The results showed growth on 92 % of the HCWs mobile phones and 85. 3 % of the non HCWs phones. The most common organisms found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> of HCWs were MSSA 38 % and MRSA 20 %. The most common organisms found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phones</b> of non HCWs were MSSA 54 % and streptococci 17. 3 %. 92 % of the HCWs were using mobile phones in the hospital while attending patients. 46. 7 % of the health care workers were carrying their medical belongings with the mobile phones. Conclusion: The results established the fact that mobile phones are a source of bacterial transmission. As personal hygiene is not at its standard in densely populated city of Karachi, contaminated mobile phones can lead to potential infections. Hand washing practices should be taken up by both the Health care workers and the non health care workers to minimize spread of disease through the mobile phones...|$|R

50|$|In Carpenter, the {{government}} is expected to rely upon the Stored Communications Act and Smith v.

As a result <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> technology, such as its Short Message Service (SMS) texting function in combination with the Audience Response System (ARS), Poll Everywhere, has not been extensively explored as teaching and learning tools in the school classroom. The {{purpose of this article is}} to, through a small scale pilot study, explore and assess how the ARS, Poll Everywhere (www. polleverywhere. com), which is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cell</b> <b>phone’s</b> SMS function, can be integrated into History lessons to support and enhance the teaching and learning experience of secondary school learners. The article furthermore aims to establish the perceptions and attitudes of History learners (n= 52), as well as the experience of the teacher after having had a firsttime opportunity to integrate SMS technology and Poll Everywhere into their lessons. The results indicate among others that although most of the participants singled out data charges as the biggest possible hindrance to its utilisation, the overwhelming majority had positive perception levels about <b>the</b> integration of <b>cell</b> <b>phone</b> technology and <b>the</b> Poll Everywhere application into their History class.

50|$|When a {{cell phone}} {{receives}} a call made to an office number, the caller ID display would normally show the office as the caller, since the call is routed though the PBX.
