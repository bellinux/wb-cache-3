5|$|<b>Once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made {{available}} to researchers and academics, Skirth's memoir began to attract attention, and his story was featured in Richard Schweitzer's The Cross and the Trenches (2003), Michele Barrett's Casualty Figures (2007), and in Ian Hislop's documentary Not Forgotten: The Men Who Wouldn't Fight (2008), in which Hislop interviewed Jean Skirth about her father's war experiences.|$|E

5|$|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame paid $6,000 to {{taxidermist}} Sergio Vigilato {{to preserve}} the dress. It had been frozen following the two television appearances, although Vigilato discovered signs of decomposition on the dress which had occurred prior to it being frozen, and noted it was emitting an odor <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> defrosted. It was treated with bleach, formaldehyde and detergent to kill any bacteria which had formed, and was reconditioned by being dyed dark red <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> preserved so {{to give it the}} same appearance as when first worn. However, after the preservation there were several pieces of beef left over and not included in the reworked dress.|$|E
5|$|After the war, <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{safe for}} {{him to return to}} his native Kentucky, he settled down with much of his family in Bowling Green. He started {{practicing}} law, which led him to serve on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, eventually becoming its Chief Justice. Later, he practiced law in Frankfort, Kentucky, until his death in 1898, keeping many of the secrets of Confederate espionage from public knowledge.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{minimise}} the casualties to his brigade, Porter decided {{to isolate the}} Pocket with two infantry companies while a heavy artillery barrage was fired into the area over several days. An attempt to capture the Pocket would only be made <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> judged that the Japanese were no longer capable of resisting effectively. As part of this plan, the 2/12th Field Regiment eventually fired 140 tons of shells into the Pocket between 15 and 20 June.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} plan for Luigi's Mansion involved a game where the levels revolved {{around a large}} mansion or complex. Tests were later done with Mario characters in dollhouses and such. <b>Once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> transitioned into a GameCube project, Luigi {{was selected as the}} main character {{in order to keep the}} game original and new. The other gameplay ideas, such as ghosts and the ghost-sucking vacuum cleaner, were added later. Older concepts, such as a role-playing game-like system which made real-time changes to rooms, as well as an underground cave area located under the mansion, were also scrapped due to the inclusion of the new ideas.|$|E
5|$|Vasey was {{concerned}} about the security of the Kaiapit area, as he believed that the Japanese were inclined to continue with a plan <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in motion. Taking advantage of good flying weather on 22 September, 99 round trips were made between Nadzab and Kaiapit. Most of the 2/16th Infantry Battalion and some American engineers were flown in. The 2/14th Infantry Battalion and a battery of the 2/4th Field Regiment arrived on 25 September, and Brigadier Kenneth Eather's 25th Infantry Brigade began to arrive two days later, freeing Dougherty to advance on Dumpu.|$|E
5|$|With {{virtually}} no new work being commissioned, Holden spent {{the war years}} planning for the reconstruction {{that would be required}} <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> over. Holden {{was a member of the}} RIBA's twelve-man committee which formulated the institute's policy for post-war reconstruction. Holden's town planning ideas involved the relocation of industry out of towns and cities to new industrial centres in the style of Port Sunlight or Bournville where workers could live close to their workplace. The new industrial centres would be linked to the existing towns with new fast roads and reconstruction in town centres would be planned to provide more open space around the administrative centres.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Chunuk Bair, {{while his}} bravery was not questioned, Malone {{initially}} {{came in for}} criticism of {{his handling of the}} defences, particularly the placement of his defence trenches. In the planning for the battle, and earlier in the Gallipoli Campaign, he had clashed with Major Arthur Temperley, Johnston's brigade major. Temperley, a British Army officer like Johnston, was one of the foremost critics of Malone's defensive arrangements and may have unduly influenced the subsequent official reports on the battle. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this criticism was misplaced and {{there were a number of}} crucial failures higher up in the chain of command. In particular, Johnston's delay in getting reinforcements to Chunuk Bair <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> captured likely led to the failure to hold the gains made by Malone's battalion.|$|E
5|$|After the Veterans' Mountain Camp {{was closed}} in the 1960s, the {{property}} was sold off to private owners, turning NY971D into {{little more than a}} private drive. Thus, the road saw little use, handling less than 10 vehicles per day on average. As a result, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) no longer considered the highway worthy of inclusion in the state highway system and began to take steps to remove the highway from the system. On February22, 1999, NYSDOT sent a memorandum to the New York State Senate that laid out the groundwork for a bill which, if passed, would allow NYSDOT to remove NY971D from the state highway system <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> able to transfer ownership and maintenance of the highway to another entity. A bill based on the memo was introduced in the State Senate on March29 and eventually passed by the Senate and the New York State Assembly. The bill was signed into law by Governor George Pataki on July27, 1999. The former routing of NY971D is now officially a private drive.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chester Canal was not {{a success}} as traffic was sparse, this changed <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{connected}} to the Ellesmere Canal. The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to Chester, Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The canal to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later on, but trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within the network of canals, and traffic between the canals and Liverpool increased steadily, much of it passing along the former Chester Canal. Receipts for the Ellesmere Canal were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 just two years later.|$|E

5|$|By 1967, Ballard {{would not}} show up for {{recording}} dates, or would arrive at shows too inebriated to perform. For some early 1967 shows, she was replaced by Marlene Barrow. Looking for a more permanent replacement, Gordy once again thought of Barbara Randolph, possibly believing that Randolph could be groomed as lead singer for the group <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> decided to take Ross solo. However, Ross did not receive Randolph well. In April 1967, Gordy then contacted Cindy Birdsong, a member of Patti LaBelle & the Blue Belles who superficially resembled Ballard, with plans to bring her in as Ballard's replacement. He made his plans clear to Ballard and her group mates at a mid-April meeting, and Birdsong {{was brought in to}} begin rehearsals. Gordy did not fire Ballard outright at that time, asking Ballard instead to quit on her own.|$|E
5|$|By 24 November, Potiorek was {{predicting}} that Serbia would be defeated {{within a matter}} of days and appointed Stjepan Sarkotić to be the country's governor <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> occupied. The Austro-Hungarians made further gains on 25 November, forcing the Serbian Army from Čovka and Vrače Brdo with an intense artillery bombardment. On 26 November, they attempted to cross the Kolubara at its junction with the Sava River and managed to do so in their initial attack. The Serbs soon counterattacked and forced the invaders back, inflicting 50 percent casualties on the Austro-Hungarians and causing their offensive to grind to a halt. On 27 November, the Serbian Army attacked Čovka and Vrače Brdo and succeeded in forcing the Austro-Hungarians out.|$|E
5|$|Development of Igor quickly ceased <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{named as}} a nearby {{disturbance}} produced moderate wind shear over the storm, displacing convection from its center. Embedded within a monsoon trough over the eastern Atlantic, the system maintained a slow westward track as it weakened to a tropical depression on September9. Intensification resumed {{the following day}} once shear lessened and the dominant steering factor shifted to a mid-tropospheric ridge north of Igor; it would remain so throughout {{the remainder of the}} cyclone's existence. Contrary to its earlier movement, the storm's forward motion markedly increased. Following the development of an intermittent eye feature and steady convection around its center, Igor strengthened into a hurricane around 0000UTC on September12.|$|E

5|$|Frazee {{sold the}} rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a {{baseball}} player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. <b>Once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner {{that he was getting}} the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, 2008, Staff Sergeant Petry and {{his unit}} {{were on a}} mission in Paktia Province, Afghanistan. He was {{assigned}} to D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, which was on a daylight raid to capture a high-value target from the Taliban. Petry was to locate with the platoon headquarters in the target building <b>once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> secured. Once there, he was {{to serve as the}} senior non-commissioned officer at the site {{for the remainder of the}} operation. The team of 70 Rangers encountered about 40 Taliban, 12 of them armed. Almost immediately after getting out of the helicopters that delivered the unit to the attack site, the Rangers came under strong fire. Petry provided additional supervision to an assaulting squad during the clearance of a building, and afterward he took Private First Class Lucas Robinson to clear an outer courtyard.|$|E
5|$|On two issues, women's suffrage, and the {{prohibition}} of alcohol, where picking the wrong side would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, he indicated {{that he could not}} support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant that by the time Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, who drank, initially voted against banning alcohol. He voted for the Eighteenth Amendment, which imposed Prohibition, after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. <b>Once</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's veto of the Volstead Bill, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the Anti-Saloon League.|$|E
