5|$|The Gray's Inn masque in 1588 {{with its}} centrepiece, The Misfortunes of Arthur by Thomas Hughes, is {{considered}} by A.W. Ward be the most impressive masque thrown {{at any of the}} Inns. William Shakespeare performed at the Inn at least once, as his patron, Lord Southampton, was a member. For the Christmas of 1594, his play The Comedy <b>of</b> <b>Errors</b> was performed by the Lord Chamberlain's Men before a riotous assembly of notables in such disorder that the affair became known as the Night <b>of</b> <b>Errors</b> and a mock trial was held to arraign the culprit.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} {{also has}} Scotland's first fully robotic pharmacy, where robots dispense and label medicines. It {{is estimated that}} in reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> and requiring less staff time the system, which cost £400,000 to install, has cut the hospital's drug bill by £700,000. Instead of completing prescription forms, staff on the wards order drugs via computer terminals.|$|E
25|$|If {{an article}} about a poll does not report the margin <b>of</b> <b>error,</b> but does state that a simple random sample of a certain size was used, the margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> can be {{calculated}} for a desired degree of confidence {{using one of the}} above formulae. Also, if the 95% margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> is given, one can find the 99% margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> by increasing the reported margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> by about 30%.|$|R
25|$|The margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for the {{difference}} between two percentages {{is larger than the}} margins <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for each <b>of</b> these percentages, and may even be larger than the maximum margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for any individual percentage from the survey.|$|R

Essentially, {{this section of the}} article records the development of the constitution through amendments. Such amendments include the abolishment of the New Jersey Court <b>of</b> <b>Errors</b> and Appeals and Chancery, transferring the cases before them and offices under the other courts, such as the New Jersey Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} {{the merit of}} the works {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise competitively, but always within {{the reach of}} the middle class, the audience he most wanted to serve. One way that he reduced costs was by printing texts in the provinces and then importing them to London; many of Priestley's works, for example, were printed locally in Birmingham. Johnson did not take great care with the printing of many of his books; they are full <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> and poorly bound. But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|The margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for a {{particular}} individual percentage will usually be smaller than the maximum margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> quoted for the survey. This maximum only applies when the observed percentage is 50%, and the margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> shrinks as the percentage approaches the extremes of 0% or 100%.|$|R
40|$|Integrals <b>of</b> {{products}} <b>of</b> <b>error</b> functions {{with other}} functions are presented, {{taking into account}} a combination <b>of</b> the <b>error</b> function with powers, a combination <b>of</b> the <b>error</b> function with exponentials and powers, a combination <b>of</b> the <b>error</b> function with exponentials of more complicated arguments, definite integrals from Laplace transforms, and a combination <b>of</b> the <b>error</b> function with trigonometric functions.

Also not included is the margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> created by rounding to the nearest whole number or any margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> from methodological sources. Most online polls—because of their opt-in method of recruiting panellists which results in a non-random sample—cannot have a margin <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> In such cases, shown is what the margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> would be for a survey using a random probability-based sample of equivalent size.|$|R
5|$|Meksi did {{not live}} to see the 1827 {{publication}} of his translation of the New Testament; he had died a bachelor six years earlier, at the age of about 51. The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language, it ran to 2,000copies, a huge number for the time. It preceded the modern Bulgarian version by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty. A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens, but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full <b>of</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} works of Shakespeare are Richard III {{and the three}} parts of Henry VI, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy <b>of</b> <b>Errors,</b> The Taming of the Shrew, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period. His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for {{the origins of the}} Tudor dynasty. The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca. The Comedy <b>of</b> <b>Errors</b> was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it is related to a separate play of the same name and may have derived from a folk story. Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics and directors.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Unearthed Arcana {{was written}} primarily by Gary Gygax, {{and published by}} game publisher TSR in 1985 for use with the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons first edition rules. The book consisted mostly of material previously published in magazines, and included new races, classes, and other material to expand the rules in the Dungeon Masters Guide and Players Handbook. The book was notorious for its considerable number <b>of</b> <b>errors,</b> and was received negatively by the gaming press whose criticisms targeted the over-powered races and classes, among other issues. Gygax intended to use the book's content for a planned second edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons; however, much of the book's content was not reused in the second edition, which went into development shortly after Gygax's departure from TSR.|$|E
40|$|Effects of cochannel {{interference}} and synchronization <b>error</b> <b>of</b> {{the carrier}} phase on the probability <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in binary communications are considered. Several bounds on the probability <b>of</b> <b>error</b> are proposed. The bounds {{are easy to}} compute and do not require complete statistical characterization <b>of</b> the <b>errors.</b> They {{turn out to be}} simple linear combinations <b>of</b> <b>error</b> probabilities with no cochannel interferences and no phase errors. Several illustrative examples are given which show that the bounds can be tight...|$|R
40|$|While {{one most}} often thinks <b>of</b> <b>error</b> from {{sampling}} variability, the total-survey-error paradigm establishes {{that there are}} many different sources <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in surveys and that they may involve both random error (or variance) and systematic error (or bias) (Smith, 2005). Among the different sources <b>of</b> <b>error</b> are sample frame coverage, sampling variance, nonresponse, mode...|$|R

To earn Viswanathan's approval, Ashok pretends to be the only heir of a rich businessman; he is supported by his friend Vasu, who poses as Ashok's fictional millionaire father Chidambaram. A comedy <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> ensues when Vasu discovers his lover Kanchana is Viswanathan's other daughter.|$|E
5|$|To {{obtain the}} desired oligonucleotide, the {{building}} blocks are sequentially coupled to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the sequence of the product (see Synthetic cycle below). The process has been fully automated since the late 1970s. Upon {{the completion of the}} chain assembly, the product is released from the solid phase to solution, deprotected, and collected. The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length of synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the number <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being synthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain the desired oligonucleotides in high purity. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules around 15–25 bases in length.|$|E
5|$|Æthelred also {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with Ælfred, an ealdorman, where Ælfred was granted the life use of a Canterbury estate in return for bequeathing one of his estates to Canterbury after his death. The document that records this agreement is not dated, however, so it is unknown when exactly during Æthelred's episcopate the document was drawn up. Another problem for the archbishop was {{a decline in the}} abilities of the scribes at Canterbury, which is dramatically illustrated by the document, which has a number <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> and duplications. Other documents of the period show that some of the scribes had little knowledge of Latin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first two}} laws <b>of</b> <b>error</b> that were {{proposed}} both originated with Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first law {{was published in}} 1774 and stated that the frequency <b>of</b> an <b>error</b> could be expressed as an exponential function of the numerical magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>error,</b> disregarding sign. The second law <b>of</b> <b>error</b> was proposed in 1778 by Laplace and stated that the frequency <b>of</b> the <b>error</b> is an exponential function of the square <b>of</b> the <b>error.</b> The second law <b>of</b> <b>error</b> is called the normal distribution or the Gauss law. [...] "It is difficult historically to attribute that law to Gauss, who {{in spite of his}} well-known precocity had probably not made this discovery before he was two years old." ...|$|R

30|$|It can be deduced that Eq.

In our analysis, we have chosen this type <b>of</b> <b>error</b> criterion specifically in order to minimize the total probability error. It will be shown in Section 5 that the total probability <b>of</b> <b>error</b> criterion enables the cognitive system to utilize free spectrum more efficiently than the NP criterion, for certain SNR values considered in simulations.|$|R
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural hearing loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Hearing loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural hearing loss and conductive hearing loss.|$|E
5|$|At the UK Championship, O'Sullivan {{produced}} dominant {{displays in}} the opening rounds defeating Boonyarit Keattikun 6–0 in the first, Rhys Clark 6–0 {{in the second and}} Michael Georgiou 6–1 in the third. He then beat Matthew Stevens 6–2 in the fourth round, Mark Williams 6–2 in the quarter-finals, and Marco Fu 6–5 in a tense semi-final, winning the deciding frame with a decisive break of 130. In the final, O'Sullivan played Mark Selby. In the first session after O'Sullivan went 2–1 up, Selby took advantage <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> by O'Sullivan to win 5 straight frames. However, in a high quality second session, O'Sullivan fought back to close to within one frame at 7–8, but Selby prevailed winning the next two frames and the title 7–10. In the last six frames of the match, a total of 5 century breaks were made, 2 by O'Sullivan of 134 and 130. This defeat marked the first time O'Sullivan had lost in a UK Championship final and the third consecutive defeat in a major final in this season.|$|E
5|$|Gray's Inn {{does not}} claim a {{specific}} foundation date; {{there is a}} tradition {{that none of the}} Inns of Court claims to be any older than the others. Law clerks and their apprentices have been established on the present site since at least 1370, with records dating from 1381. During the 15th and 16th centuries, the Inn grew steadily with great prestige, reaching its pinnacle during the reign of Elizabeth I. The Inn was home to many important barristers and politicians, most notably Francis Bacon, and counted Elizabeth herself as a patron. Thanks to the efforts of prominent members such as William Cecil and Gilbert Gerard, Gray's Inn became the largest of the four by number, with over 200 barristers recorded as members. During this period, the Inn became noted for the masques and revels that it threw, and William Shakespeare is believed to have first performed the Comedy <b>of</b> <b>Errors</b> play there.|$|E

5|$|In Albany, New York, a disk jockey named Bryan Jackson helped {{organize}} a relief effort for the Texas town {{of the same}} name, with sponsorship from radio station WOKO and a local supermarket chain. After raising six tons of emergency aid and $1,000 from area residents, a C-130 airplane was loaded with the provisions, but the plane was continuously grounded due to calls saying that Albany, Texas was not a disaster area and did not need the relief. After what was described by U.S. Senator Samuel S. Stratton as almost a comedy <b>of</b> <b>errors,</b> the flight {{was funded by the}} Defense Department and was able to take off.

5|$|Lyndsay {{produced}} an interlude at Linlithgow Palace {{for the king}} and queen thought to be a version of his play The Thrie Estaitis in 1540, which satirised the corruption of church and state, and which is the only complete play to survive from before the Reformation. Buchanan was major influence on Continental theatre with plays such as Jepheths and Baptistes, which influenced Pierre Corneille and Jean Racine and through them the neo-classical tradition in French drama, but his impact in Scotland was limited by his choice of Latin as a medium. The anonymous The Maner of the Cyring of ane Play (before 1568) and Philotus (published in London in 1603), are isolated examples of surviving plays. The latter is a vernacular Scots comedy <b>of</b> <b>errors,</b> probably designed for court performance for Mary, Queen of Scots or James VI. The same system of professional companies of players and theatres that developed in England in this period was absent in Scotland, but James VI signalled his interest in drama by arranging for a company of English players to erect a playhouse and perform in 1599.|$|E
5|$|Radiocarbon {{dates are}} {{generally}} {{presented with a}} range of one standard deviation (usually represented by the Greek letter sigma as 1σ) {{on either side of the}} mean. However, a date range of 1σ represents only 68% confidence level, so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted. This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory, in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months. The results varied widely (though consistently with a normal distribution <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> in the measurements), and included multiple date ranges (of 1σ confidence) that did not overlap with each other. The measurements included one with a range from about 4250 to about 4390 years ago, and another with a range from about 4520 to about 4690.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{confidence}} intervals, {{the margin}} <b>of</b> <b>error</b> {{can be defined}} for any desired confidence level, but usually a level of 90%, 95% or 99% is chosen (typically 95%). This level is {{the probability that a}} margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> around the reported percentage would include the [...] "true" [...] percentage. Along with the confidence level, the sample design for a survey, and in particular its sample size, determines the magnitude of the margin <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> A larger sample size produces a smaller margin <b>of</b> <b>error,</b> all else remaining equal.|$|R
50|$|However, {{often only}} one margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> is {{reported}} for a survey. When results are reported for population subgroups, a larger margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> will apply, {{but this may}} not be made clear. For example, a survey of 1000 people may contain 100 people from a certain ethnic or economic group. The results focusing on that group will be much less reliable than results for the full population. If the margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for the full sample was 4%, say, then the margin <b>of</b> <b>error</b> for such a subgroup could be around 13%.|$|R
5000|$|In statistics, {{the term}} [...] "error" [...] arises in two ways. Firstly, it arises {{in the context}} of {{decision}} making, where the probability <b>of</b> <b>error</b> may be considered as being the probability of making a wrong decision and which would have a different value for each type <b>of</b> <b>error.</b> Secondly, it arises {{in the context of}} statistical modelling (for example regression) where the model's predicted value may be in error regarding the observed outcome and where the term probability <b>of</b> <b>error</b> may refer to the probabilities of various amounts <b>of</b> <b>error</b> occurring.|$|R
