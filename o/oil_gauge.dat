5000|$|Aurea {{vehicles}} contain Veglia instruments {{from the}} Veglia family of Bolongna Italy; later versions contain O.S. instruments as {{a variation of}} the Veglia standard type. Amp gauge is American Westinghouse and <b>oil</b> <b>gauge</b> is [...] "Aurea" [...] insignia marked.|$|E
50|$|On December 12, 1974, Edson {{suffered}} {{a fire in}} the after fireroom while training with the USS Coral Sea. The fire was caused by the ignition of oil which was spraying from a rupture in a lube <b>oil</b> <b>gauge</b> line. The area was secured and fire extinguished with no personnel casualties.|$|E
50|$|The {{state of}} the car is {{monitored}} by a brace of custom Jaeger instruments all bearing the Monica name. Gauges include a speedometer, tachometer, <b>oil</b> temperature <b>gauge,</b> <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gauge,</b> ammeter, water temperature gauge, fuel gauge, and clock.|$|R
50|$|<b>Oil</b> Temperature <b>Gauge</b> - Indicates {{the engine}} oil temperature.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the first}} American front-wheel drive car to be offered to the public, beating the Ruxton {{automobile}} by several months, in 1929. The brainchild of former Miller engineer Carl Van Ranst, its drive system borrowed from the Indianapolis 500-dominating racers, using the same de Dion layout and inboard brakes. This allowed it to be much lower than competing cars. Both stock cars and special bodies built on the Cord chassis by American and European coachbuilders won prizes in contests worldwide. The L-29 came with full instrumentation, including a temperature <b>gauge,</b> <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gauge,</b> and speedometer on the left with a gas <b>gauge,</b> <b>oil</b> level <b>gauge,</b> and Ammeter {{on the right of}} the steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|The car {{tested by}} The Times also had white leather {{upholstery}} and deep lambswool carpets, tachometer, ammeter, <b>oil</b> <b>gauge,</b> clock, headlamp flasher (vital) and water temperature gauge. Further extras were: a laminated wood steering wheel to maintain firm grip (by soaking up sweat), automatic red caution lights on open doors, a reading light, cigar lighter, twin-speaker radio and {{an air blower}} to demist the rear window.|$|E
50|$|The car's {{switch and}} <b>oil</b> <b>gauge</b> are mounted below the petrol tank on the dash, where Phillimore {{considered}} they stood {{a good chance}} of getting severe kicks from passengers' feet. Prices were £240 or £250 for the chassis depending on wheelbase which may be 8 ft 3 in or 9 ft. The shorter body was priced at £55, the longer £65. Hood and screen were extra.|$|E
50|$|This was {{apparently}} the first demonstration of a monoplane to the U.S. government. On January 20, 1913 at Garden City, New York she attempted a women's altitude record, {{but had to}} return to ground when an <b>oil</b> <b>gauge</b> broke and oil obscured her vision. With increasing disapproval of women flying after the death of Harriet Quimby, and suffering financial difficulties, she gave up aviation soon after.|$|E

5000|$|At about 19:06 {{the duty}} {{engineer}} in the aft engine car reported an apparent oil pressure problem. At 19:16 {{he shut the}} engine down, and after a short discussion with the Chief Engineer {{it was decided to}} replace the <b>oil</b> <b>gauge,</b> there being nothing apparently wrong with the engine. This work was put in hand, and the engine was eventually restarted at 22:56, by which time R101 was over the English Channel. With one engine stopped airspeed was reduced by around 4 mph to 58.7 mph ...|$|E
50|$|Standard {{features}} include analog speedometer and tachometer and an LCD multi-function gauge that includes fuel and <b>oil</b> <b>gauge,</b> hour meter, low fuel, oil, voltage and overheat warnings, compass, trip meter and clock, {{air and water}} temperature, average and peak speed and various maintenance information. The gauges are recessed in the hood, {{in front of the}} handlebars. The craft also features dual mirrors and a true tow rope hook. Like all of Sea-Doo's models, the GTX features Sea-Doo's Digital Electronic Security System, which uses a lanyard fitted with a computer chip encoded with a specific code for your boat.|$|E
50|$|Optional extras were a luggage rack, chrome bumpers and Stevenson Jacking system. The {{upholstery}} was {{leather cloth}} with leather seating. The only known Super 9 to have Bedford Cord throughout is the prototype; this {{also has a}} smokers vent in the roof which is shown on brochures, but is not seen on any production 9’s. Instruments consisted of a speedometer, clock, <b>oil</b> <b>gauge</b> and ammeter. After 1931 a petrol gauge was added, prior to this a fuel tap was incorporated to give a reserve supply. Dash switches consisted of, a dash light, interior light, ignition, and a starter button, also choke and fast running control. External lights switching, battery charge rate, and ignition timing were all at {{the centre of the}} steering wheel.|$|E

5000|$|Jaeger {{revolution}} counter driven from the forward {{end of the}} camshaft, Sunbeam <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gauge,</b> fuel tank air pressure gauge, twin magneto switches, twin glass oil restrictors.|$|R
50|$|Inside the 1600 had an <b>oil</b> {{temperature}} <b>gauge,</b> bucket {{seats with}} headrests and electric front windows as standard. Cromodora alloy wheels like those {{found on the}} 1600 HF were optional.|$|R
5000|$|In 1962, Reliant {{introduced}} the Mk VII,code named [...] "TW7" [...] (Three Wheeler 7). This version featured a new OHV Reliant engine, a new steel chassis and bonded shell {{design for the}} body, fully updated visual styling, and was badged as the Regal 3/25, Regal 3/30 (number of wheels/bhp), Regal 21E or Regal 21E 700. The 600cc engine produced 25 bhp (actually 598cc/24 bhp) and the 700cc engine produced 30 bhp (actually 701cc / 29 bhp). The 21E version was fitted with 21 extras, which were otherwise available as optional extras to the standard car. These extras included a spot light, a fog light, chrome plated bumper over-riders, sun visors, an <b>oil</b> <b>gauge,</b> outer wheel trims and metallic paint. In 1973, the Regal {{was replaced by the}} Reliant Robin (code named [...] "TW8").|$|E
50|$|The {{most notable}} {{differences}} from the M12 are {{the use of}} forged pistons, T28 turbos, a front anti-roll bar, stiffer springs, different shocks, Pirelli P Zero tyres, a smoother gear shifter, and a slightly narrower central tunnel as the driver now sits a bit more central than previous models. Exterior differences remain subtle. The colour scheme tends to incorporate anthracite (Gris) wheels, rear wing supports and wing ends but some examples maintain silver wheels and supports. The front splitter is now removed (Although many owners opt to have this put on). The main change is the addition of side pods to enhance air into the system {{and to create a}} visual impact. Air conditioning is now an £1,995 option and adds to the weight. The interior has an added <b>oil</b> <b>gauge</b> that resides next to the boost one. Additionally the sparco alcantara seats and finishings differ to the other Noble's (Alcantara is one third the weight of leather). The Noble M400 won the car of the year award in 2005 for one publication. The M400 is designed to be an outstanding track car that is also pleasant to drive on the road. With just 75 examples made (UK/Europe) this version is sought after and rare.|$|E

50|$|Some vehicle engines have an oil {{pressure}} switch that switches a warning light on at low {{oil pressure}}. Some vehicles have an <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gauge</b> in the dashboard or instrument cluster.|$|R
50|$|All 880s and Custom 880s {{received}} a revised instrument cluster layout, replacing the previous design {{which had been}} in use with little change since 1961. An <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gauge</b> was standard. Front leg room was 41.9 inches.|$|R
50|$|The <b>oil</b> {{pressure}} <b>gauge,</b> or warning lamp, gives {{only the}} pressure {{at the point}} where its sender enters that part of the pressurized system - not everywhere, not an average, nor a generalized picture of the systemic pressure.|$|R
40|$|The AutoTest {{framework}} automates {{the software}} testing process {{by relying on}} programs that contain the instruments of their own verification, {{in the form of}} contract-oriented specifications of classes and their individual routines. Modern engineering products—from planes, cars, and industrial plants down to refrigerators and coffee machines—routinely test themselves while they operate. The goal is to detect possible deficiencies and to avoid incidents by warning the users of needed maintenance actions. This self-testing capability {{is an integral part of}} the design of such artifacts. The lesson that their builders have learned is to design for testability. This concept was not always understood: With cars, for example, we used to have no clue (save for the <b>oil</b> <b>gauge)</b> that major mechanical trouble might be imminent; if we wanted to know more, we would take our car to a mechanic who would check every component from scratch, not knowing what actually happened during operation. Today’s cars, in contrast, are filled with sensors and gauges that perform continuous testing and gather data for maintenance. While software does not physically degrade during operation, its development requires extensive testing (and other forms of verification); yet software design usually pays little attention to testing needs. It is as if we had not learned the lessons of other industries: Software construction and software verification are essentially separate activities, each conducted without much consideration of the other’s needs. A consequence is that testing, in spite of improved tools, remains a labor-intensive activity. AUTOTEST AutoTest is a collection of tools that automate the testing process by relying on programs that contain the instruments of their own verification, in the form of contracts—specifications of classes and their individual routines (methods). The three main components of Auto-Test address complementary aspects: • Test Generation: automatically creates and runs test cases, without any human input such as manually prepared test cases and test oracles. • Test Extraction: automatically produces test cases from execution failures. The observation behind Tes...|$|E
