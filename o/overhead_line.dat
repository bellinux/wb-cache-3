5|$|In 1902, the {{decision}} was taken to electrify the railway using power generated from the hospital's own power plant, which was also connected to the National Grid. The line was electrified at 500V DC using a single <b>overhead</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1993, {{proposals}} {{were made to}} re-open the line to Tryvandshøiden Station, so that the Tryvann Ski Resort would be more accessible to Oslo residents. Oslo Sporveier, the operator, turned down the proposals, arguing that it would cost about 3billion NOK to lay the tracks and put up <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> equipment, {{and that it would}} not attract enough passengers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{thesis is}} a design of <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> of {{transmission}} system under specific weather conditions in given area. Furthermore, {{it gives a}} summary about the transmission and distribution systems and describes basics of <b>overhead</b> <b>lines,</b> used conductors and pylons in Czech Republic. It also presents the issue of climate conditions having a eminent influence on <b>overhead</b> <b>lines.</b> Moreover, theoretical part of thesis contains conductor mechanics and also mentions asymmetric state of <b>overhead</b> <b>lines.</b> Practical part deals with a design of specific part of <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> at voltage level of 400 kV and generally evaluates area where lines would be operated. In this area the new power energy source is hypothetically planned and therefore thesis analyzes possible variants of connection this source to transmission system. For one of these variants there are the calculations of two sections of the <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> under different weather conditions in more detail. The results bring longitudinal profile and assembling table for each section and they demonstrate the major impact of icing on the <b>overhead</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R
5|$|The train's {{derailment}} caused {{severe damage}} to the <b>Overhead</b> <b>Line</b> Equipment and tripped the entire circuit between Brock (near Preston) and Tebay resulting {{in a number of}} other electric-powered services coming to a halt and all signalling equipment immediately turning to danger (red) in accordance with the system's fail safe design.|$|E
5|$|Although a cable haulage {{system had}} {{initially}} been considered, Ramsgate Olympia decided {{early in the}} line's planning to electrify the line. A third rail system was rejected due to concerns {{for the safety of}} the large numbers of children expected to use the line, and the locomotives had trolley poles drawing power from a single 400-volt DC <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> running the length of the tunnel. The wire ran along the wall of the old tunnel, on brackets in the roof of the new tunnel, and was supported by poles at the open-air stations. The electricity was supplied by an electrical substation built by English Electric, inside the tunnel near the lower end.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway {{began in}} 1845. The line was opened in October 1849, with {{services}} from Manchester London Road via Sale to Altrincham. In 1931 it {{became one of}} Great Britain's first electrified railway lines, with a 1,500V DC <b>overhead</b> <b>line.</b> At {{the same time a}} new Altrincham station was opened on the same line, at Navigation Road, serving housing developments in the area. By 1937, 130train services ran daily between Manchester and Altrincham. The line was renovated in the early 1990s to form part of the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Broadheath railway station served the northern part of Altrincham between 1853 and 1962, on the line from Manchester, via Lymm to Warrington.|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} grid requires the new upcoming electrical connections, resulting in limited {{capacity of the}} existing <b>overhead</b> <b>lines.</b> One of the possible solutions {{of the problem is}} to build the new <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> and substation. <b>Overhead</b> <b>lines</b> designing are associated with several considerable technical, environmental and economical problems.

50|$|For the Valtellina line, {{three-phase}} power was supplied at about 3,000 volts through two <b>overhead</b> <b>lines,</b> while the running rails supplied the third phase. At junctions, the two <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> {{had to cross}} and this prevented the use of very high voltages.|$|R

50|$|The Maastunnel {{was opened}} to the public on 14 February 1942 and was the first car tunnel in the Netherlands. At the end of the Second World War <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> were {{installed}} to allow for the passage of trolleybuses. Although two buses were ready for these experimental rides, they were never used for public transportation in Rotterdam, as the <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> were removed from the tunnel and used to repair the Rotterdam tramway network <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> which had been destroyed during the bombing. In 1944 the German invaders placed explosives in the tunnel so they could destroy it at a moment's notice. Perhaps due to the sabotage of the detonators (the <b>overhead</b> <b>lines)</b> by the Dutch resistance the explosives were not detonated.|$|R
50|$|The first tram with <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> was {{presented}} by Werner von Siemens at the International Electric Exposition in Paris 1881: the installation was removed after that event.In October 1883, the first permanent tram service with <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> {{was on the}} Mödling and Hinterbrühl Tram in Austria. The trams had bipolar <b>overhead</b> <b>lines,</b> consisting of two U-pipes, in which the pantographs hung and ran like shuttles. In April to June 1882, Siemens had tested a similar system on his Electromote, an early percursor of the trolleybus.|$|R
25|$|The {{permanent}} {{track and}} the <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> {{on the northern}} section between Ilmenau and Erfurt would be built between August 2010 and November 2013, on the middle section between Coburg and Ilmenau between December 2012 and December 2015 and on the southern section between Bad Staffelstein and Coburg between January 2013 and December 2015. The contracts, which comprise the fixed track, including {{the foundations of the}} masts for the <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> and wind and noise protection equipment, were let for the approximately 44 kilometre-long middle section for around €104 million and the approximately 22 kilometre-long southern section for around €60 million.|$|E
25|$|Infrastructure {{problems}} have affected performance. According to Network Rail, the main {{problems have}} been track-circuit failures, broken rails, track faults, points failures and <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> equipment (OLE) failures. Network Rail, {{which is responsible for}} the infrastructure, intended to improve performance by work carried out during a planned closure of London Liverpool Street station over Christmas and New Year 2007/8. This allowed much of the outer London <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> equipment to be replaced by modern, self-tensioning lines. The work was carried out, but overran at short notice by some 24 hours, causing ridicule in the national press.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of medium-voltage <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> are currently operated with AlFe conductors {{which have a}} simple construction and which rank among the cheapest versions of <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> {{from the point of}} view of initial investments. These <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> can be susceptible, however, to faults primarily in mountain and wooded areas, with an ensuing decrease in safety and operations reliability, as well as with limitations to the electric power supply. This draws attention to outdoor <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> with covered conductors, which are relied upon for use for connecting “defined” systems (SMART GRIDS) with an external electric power system. These conductors, with mostly XLPE and PE basic insulation, are able to resist both mechanical and electric strain caused by falling trees or branches and consequently their total number of faults is significantly lower. Massive usage of <b>overhead</b> <b>lines</b> with covered conductors is currently contradicted by prevailing difficulties in detecting faults. This article describes the possibility of detecting covered conductor faults and verifying the methodology under both laboratory and real conditions. Web of Science 3031103109...|$|R
