500|$|Knight sees {{abstinence}} from reproduction as an altruistic choice– a way {{to prevent}} involuntary human suffering– and cites the deaths of children from preventable causes {{as an example of}} needless suffering. Knight claims that non-reproduction would eventually allow humans to lead idyllic lifestyles in an environment comparable to the Garden of Eden, and maintains that the last remaining humans would be proud of their accomplishment. Other benefits <b>of</b> <b>ceasing</b> human reproduction that he cites include the end of abortion, war, and starvation. Knight argues that [...] "procreation today is de facto child abuse". He maintains that the standard of human life will worsen if resources are consumed by a growing population rather than spent solving existing issues. He speculates that if people ceased to reproduce, they would use their energy for other pursuits, and suggests adoption and foster care as outlets for people who desire children.|$|E
500|$|Yahoo!'s Kathleen Perricone gave [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] a mixed review, {{and said}} it was [...] "not exactly worthy of all the hype", and Alicia Lutes of Hollywood.com criticized its lyrical meaning and {{repetitive}} production. Malene Arpe of Toronto Star wrote that it [...] "is really terrible and rather than making you want to scream and shout, it sorta lulls you into a nice nap-like state <b>of</b> <b>ceasing</b> to care around the three-minute mark." [...] The Huffington Post journalist Kia Makarechi called the song a [...] "competent piece of airy dance pop", and wrote that the only mildly inspiring moment on [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] is the sample from [...] "Gimme More". An editorial writer from Popjustice was negative towards [...] "Scream & Shout" [...] and Pitbull's song [...] "Feel This Moment" [...] (2012), stating that what the [...] "two songs represent is pop music writhing around in its own shit." [...] Kurt Schlosser of NBCNews.com also criticized the song's lyrical content, and wrote that it [...] "plays like a forgotten sample from a Black Eyed Peas song, with Britney doing the Fergie talkie parts..." [...] and that it is will.i.am's song.|$|E

2500|$|Relations {{between the}} United States and Turkey have shown signs of {{deterioration}} during the Syrian Civil War and especially over the handling over the Kurdish question.

Turkey overtly defied American orders <b>of</b> <b>ceasing</b> Turkey's military bombardment of the YPG fighters in their bid to take the town of Azaz in northern Syria. Signs of strain were then displayed when Barack Obama refused to have a formal meeting with Erdogan when the latter visited the United States in March 2016.|$|E

30|$|In brief, we {{find that}} the {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>ceased</b> DI workers have earnings after program exit. For obvious reasons, individuals who remain eligible for benefits are less likely to seek employment than they would if they were ceased; for that group, we estimate an upper bound for the likelihood of having earnings of about 43 percentage points if they were ceased. Average earnings are generally low, only $ 13, 000. Additionally, while over half <b>of</b> <b>ceased</b> DI workers earn above the SGA level or the individual poverty threshold in {{at least one of the}} 5  years after program exit, only about 20  % consistently earn over SGA or the poverty threshold in all post-program years.|$|R

60|$|Now {{the older}} economists taught, and the educated world {{for about a}} century believed, that these {{limitations}} which hedged the particular employer about were fixed and assigned by natural economic law.

And it is quite true that the particular employer can no more break away from these limits than he can jump out of his own skin. He can only violate them at the expense <b>of</b> <b>ceasing</b> to be an economic being at all and degenerating into a philanthropist.|$|E

They ravaged the lands of Pistoja so often, that the Pistojese submitted themselves, on condition of receiving back their Guelph exiles, and admitting a Florentine garrison into Pistoja. Next they attacked Monte Reggione, the March-fortress of the Sienese; and pressed it so vigorously that Siena was fain to make peace too, on condition <b>of</b> <b>ceasing</b> her alliance with the Ghibellines. Next they ravaged the territory of Volterra: the townspeople, confident in {{the strength of their}} rock fortress, came out to give battle; the Florentines beat them up the hill, and entered the town gates with the fugitives.|$|E
6000|$|My own {{main point}} for {{notice in the}} chapter is the {{purchase}} of his body for its [...] "weight in gold." [...] Swindling angels held {{it up in the}} scales; it did not weigh so much as a web of gossamer. [...] "Had such excellent odor, too, and came for a mere nothing of gold," [...] says Carlyle. It {{is one of the first}} commercial transactions of Germany, but I regret the conduct of the angels on the occasion. Evangelicalism has been proud <b>of</b> <b>ceasing</b> to invest in relics, its swindling angels helping it to better things, as it supposes. For my own part, I believe Christian Germany could not have bought at this time any treasure more precious; nevertheless, the missionary work itself you find is wholly vain. The difference of opinion between St. Adalbert and the Wends, on Divine matters, does not signify to the Fates. They will not have it disputed about; and end the dispute adversely, to St. Adalbert--adversely, even, to Brandenburg and its civilizing power, as you will immediately see.|$|E
60|$|The {{days were}} too short. There {{was so much}} he wanted to study. He cut his sleep down to five hours and found {{that he could get}} along upon it. He tried four hours and a half, and regretfully came back to five. He could joyfully have spent all his waking hours upon any one of his pursuits. It was with regret that he ceased from writing to study, that he ceased from study to go to the library, that he tore himself away from that chart-room of {{knowledge}} or from the magazines in the reading-room that were filled with the secrets of writers who succeeded in selling their wares. It was like severing heart strings, when he was with Ruth, to stand up and go; and he scorched through the dark streets so as to get home to his books at the least possible expense of time. And hardest of all was it to shut up the algebra or physics, put note-book and pencil aside, and close his tired eyes in sleep. He hated the thought <b>of</b> <b>ceasing</b> to live, even for so short a time, and his sole consolation was that the alarm clock was set five hours ahead. He would lose only five hours anyway, and then the jangling bell would jerk him out of unconsciousness and he would have before him another glorious day of nineteen hours.|$|E

60|$|The {{essence of}} this change is the {{reversal}} of the position which, in primitive society, ethics holds in relation to theology. Originally, that which men worship is a theological hypothesis, not a moral ideal. The prophets, in substance, if not always in form preach the opposite doctrine. They are constantly striving to free the moral ideal from the stifling embrace of the current theology and its concomitant ritual. Theirs was not an intellectual criticism, argued on strictly scientific grounds; the image-worshippers and the believers in the efficacy of sacrifices and ceremonies might logically have held their own against anything the prophets have to say; it was an ethical criticism. From {{the height of his}} moral intuition--that the whole duty of man is to do justice and to love mercy and to bear himself as humbly as befits his insignificance in face of the Infinite--the prophet simply laughs at the idolaters of stocks and stones and the idolaters of ritual. Idols of the first kind, in his experience, were inseparably united with the practice of immorality, and they were to be ruthlessly destroyed. As for sacrifices and ceremonies, whatever their intrinsic value might be, they might be tolerated on condition <b>of</b> <b>ceasing</b> to be idols; they might even be praiseworthy on condition of being made to subserve the worship of the true Jahveh--the moral ideal.|$|E
60|$|There was no {{recovering}} Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood <b>of</b> <b>ceasing</b> to pity her; but a {{few weeks}} brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse. The compliments of his neighbours were over; {{he was no longer}} teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be different from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.|$|E
60|$|Therein {{lies the}} best hope of {{advanced}} thought, {{and the best way}} to help its prospects is to provide in the fullest, frankest way for the conditions of the present day. War is one of its conditions; it is its principal condition. It lies at the heart of every question agitating the fears and hopes of a humanity divided against itself. The succeeding ages have changed nothing except the watchwords of the armies. The intellectual stage of mankind being as yet in its infancy, and States, like most individuals, having but a feeble and imperfect consciousness of the worth and force of the inner life, the need of making their existence manifest to themselves is determined in the direction of physical activity. The idea <b>of</b> <b>ceasing</b> to grow in territory, in strength, in wealth, in influence--in anything but wisdom and self-knowledge--is odious to them as the omen of the end. Action, in which is to be found the illusion of a mastered destiny, can alone satisfy our uneasy vanity and lay to rest the haunting fear of the future--a sentiment concealed, indeed, but proving its existence by the force it has, when invoked, to stir the passions of a nation. It will be long before we have learned that in the great darkness before us there is nothing that we need fear. Let us act lest we perish--is the cry. And the only form of action open to a State can be of no other than aggressive nature.|$|E
