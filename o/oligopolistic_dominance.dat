Dataset listing 94 mergers from all {{examined by the}} European Commission (EC) between 1990 and the revision to the EC merger regulation in 2004 in {{which one of the}} following phrases was used at least once in the merger report: joint dominance, collective dominance, (tacit) collusion, <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>dominance.</b> Project description: The ESRC Centre for Competition Policy (CCP) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) undertakes interdisciplinary research into competition policy and regulation that has real-world policy relevance without compromising academic rigour. It prides itself on the interdisciplinary nature of the research and the members are drawn from a range of disciplines, including economics, law, business and political science. The Centre was established in September 2004, building on the pre-existing Centre for Competition and Regulation (CCR), with a grant from the ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council). It currently boasts a total of 26 faculty members (including the Director and a Political Science Mentor), 4 full- and part-time researchers and 23 PhD students...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This essay {{analyses}} how {{the concept}} of collective dominance is applied in the case-law of E. C. merger control. The method used in the analysis is to investigate the legal arguments that are applied {{in the assessment of}} collective dominance and to discuss how they can be understood in the economic context of every case at issue. Thus, the starting platform in the analysis is a legal one. The economic theories taken up in this essay are intended to provide a common understanding of the economics behind the legal concept of collective dominance. The theories are considered as a whole, even though a structural and a behavioural (game-theoretical) approach is distinguished. An important conclusion drawn from the analysis in the essay is that an understanding of the relation between law and economics is essential for the collective dominance appraisal. In this relation law takes precedence over economics, but as a paradox, like it may appear, a high legal standard in merger control is directly connected to a high economic standard.

40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} {{a critical}} {{assessment of a}} very topical and highly debated question {{in the development of}} EU competition law: does the European Merger Control Regulation apply to concentrations that result in collective (or joint respectively <b>oligopolistic)</b> <b>dominance?</b> And, if so, under what conditions?The study suggests that the Merger Control Regulation does, indeed, cover cases of collective dominance. It recommends, however, that a proposed transaction should only be blocked on grounds of collective dominance if it raises substantive doubts that the transaction will create an anti-competitive market structure (like, for example, the Gencor/Lonrho case). Should the doubts not attain the required level, then a two-stage approach is suggested. The first stage would have to screen the proposed transaction as being reasonably capable of guaranteeing a competitive environment (despite the initial doubts as to the collective dominance issue). The second stage would be opened only if the Commission has legitimate reasons to believe that the firms concerned are effectively involved in either concerted practices (Art. 85 EEC Treaty) or in a collective abuse of a dominant position (Art. 86). Interestingly, the Commission seems to have adopted a similar approach in some of the latest border-line cases. After an extensive analysis of the landmark decision Nestle/Perrier, this thesis finds that the described two-stage approach would also have been appropriate in this case...|$|E
