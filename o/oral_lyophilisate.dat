40|$|Desmopressin 120 mu g <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> and 200 mu g tablet are {{considered}} bioequivalent, based on extrapolation of studies {{in a limited}} number of adults and on one dose-finding study of desmopressin <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> in children. However, no comparative pharmacokinetic study in children was executed confirming this statement. No data are available on the influence of food intake on the bioavailability of desmopressin tablet in a pediatric setting, although studies in adults have documented that food intake results in a significantly lower desmopressin plasma concentration. In this study, we analyzed plasma concentrations of desmopressin <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> and tablet with concomitant food intake. Twenty-three children with monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (mean age, 12. 7 years) were recruited. Two tests were performed on two separate days in identical conditions with a standardized food and fluid intake. Desmopressin was administered as desmopressin tablet or desmopressin <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> immediately after a meal. Desmopressin plasma concentration was measured at 1 h, 2 h, and 6 h postdosing. No significant difference in plasma concentration of 120 mu g desmopressin <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> and 200 mu g tablet was demonstrated, even with concomitant food intake. A significant difference in variability was found, identifying a smaller variance for desmopressin <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> plasma concentrations at all time points. This study demonstrates comparable plasma levels for desmopressin <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate,</b> despite the lower dose. The dosage for desmopressin <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> is more predictable due to the significantly smaller variance. Therefore, desmopressin <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> seems more suitable, especially in the younger age group for which time interval between dinner and drug administration is limited...|$|E
40|$|Nocturnal {{enuresis}} (NE) is {{a common}} disorder in children. Choice of treatment depends on the frequency and severity of symptoms, the child's age and motivation. Treatment options for NE are alarm, desmopressin and imipramine. In particular, the main desmopressin therapeutical effect is the antidiuretic activity. The different formulations of desmopressin are an injectable solution, an oral tablet formulation and the recent <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> (MELT). MELT with its higher biodisponibility guarantee the same therapy response of other formulations with a lower doses and it represents the first line and safety treatment for the NE...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the pharmacodynamic properties {{of a new}} <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> formulation of desmopressin (in single doses of 30, 60, 120, 240, 360 or 480 microg) in children with known primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) and thus identify those dosages that could provide a duration of action corresponding to a typical length of night-time sleep in children with PNE; additional objectives were to {{determine the}} safety and tolerability of desmopressin in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Children with PNE (mean three or more wet nights/week), aged 6 - 12 years, were randomized into a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. An overhydration technique was used before dosing to suppress endogenous vasopressin production and thereby ensure that any antidiuresis {{could be attributed to}} treatment. Dosing with desmopressin or placebo occurred when urinary production was > 0. 13 mL/min/kg. Urinary volume, osmolality and duration of urinary-concentrating action (above three threshold levels: 125, 200 and 400 mOsm/kg) were determined as endpoints. RESULTS: All 72 participants receiving desmopressin had a pharmacodynamic response to the drug, while there was no change in urinary output in the 12 placebo-treated patients. There was a clear relationship between desmopressin dose and duration of action and osmolality during action, although the three highest-dose groups had similar results. The mean duration of action of desmopressin at the lowest osmolality threshold level was 3. 6 - 10. 6 h, according to dose; for the highest threshold, the values were 1. 3 - 8. 6 h. CONCLUSION: Desmopressin, as the <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate,</b> causes a marked decrease in urinary output in hydrated children with PNE. A small dose range (120 - 240 microg) is likely to control diuresis for a period corresponding to a night's sleep (7 - 11 h) in most children with PNE. However, some patients might require a higher dose to obtain antidiuresis for the complete night. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Orally {{disintegrating}} tablets and <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisates</b> are novel attractive dosage {{forms that}} disintegrate or dissolve in the buccal cavity within seconds without necessity of drinking. The major limitation in designing of these dosage forms is unpleasant {{taste of the}} drug substance. Cetirizine dihydrochloride is a H 1 -antihistamine substance indicated {{for the treatment of}} allergy. It is characterized by extremely bitter taste, therefore in order to deliver cetirizine dihydrochloride using orodispersible formulations, effective taste-masking is required. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether microparticles containing cetirizine dihydrochloride could be successfully used to formulate orally disintegrating tablets by direct compression method and <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisates</b> by freeze-drying process. Taste masking of cetirizine dihydrochloride was achieved by the spray-drying technique using Eudragit® E PO as the drug agent carrier. Based on the preliminary studies, optimal compositions of microparticles, tablets and lyophilisates were chosen. Obtained dosage forms were characterized for drug content, disintegration time and mechanical properties. In order to determine whether the microparticles subjected to direct compression and freeze-drying process effectively mask the bitter taste of cetirizine dihydrochloride, the in vivo and in vitro evaluation was performed. The results showed that designed formulates with microparticles containing cetirizine dihydrochloride were characterized by appropriate mechanical properties, uniformity of weight and thickness, short disintegration time, and the uniform content of the drug substance. Taste-masking assessment performed by three independent methods (e-tongue evaluation, human test panel and the in vitro drug release) revealed that microparticles with Eudragit® E PO are effective taste – masking carriers of cetirizine dihydrochloride and might be used to formulate orally disintegrating tablets and <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisates...</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the feasibility to design: (a) a mucoadhesive interpolyelectrolyte complex (IPEC) loaded with clobetasol propionate (CP) intended to treat oral lichen planus and (b) individuate an orodispersible dosage form suitable for its administration. IPECs were synthesized by mixing Eudragit® E PO (EPO) and different grades of cross-linked polyacrylate derivatives, in different molar ratios, namely 1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 2 : 1. All IPECs resulted at nanoscale independently of their composition (120 – 200 nm). Both zeta-potentials (ζ) and mucoadhesive performances were influenced by the ratio between polymers. On the bases of the preliminary data, IPECs made of Polycarbophil and EPO in the 1 : 2 ratio were loaded with CP. The encapsulation efficiency was up 88 % independently of the CP-IPEC ratio. The drug encapsulation caused IPEC destabilization in water, as it was noticed by the increase of ζ values {{and the formation of}} aggregates. <b>Oral</b> <b>lyophilisates</b> were prepared by freeze-drying slurries made of placebo or CP loaded IPECs, maltodextrin with a dextrose equivalent 38 and Span® 80. The optimized formulation permitted to obtain a fast disintegration upon contact with water reducing the tendency of IPECs to aggregate. Moreover, <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisates</b> allowed improving the apparent solubility of CP throughout the in vitro release experiment...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the funtion of fenugreek seed mucilage (FSM) as potential matrix forming agent for orodispersible pharmaceutical lyophilisates. The FSM was isolated and characterized. FSM colloidal dispersions were prepared and the rheological evaluation was performed. <b>Oral</b> <b>lyophilisates</b> (OLs) with different FSM concentrations, containing meloxicam as model drug were prepared by freeze drying method. The OLs were characterized and compared to gelatin containing tablets, prepared under the same conditions. The FSM dispersions revealed shear thinning flow type. Based on colloidal dispersions' rheological properties, five FSM concentrations were taken forward to the lyophilization step. Completely dry and elegant tablets were obtained. Texture analysis indicated highly porous structures, confirmed by SEM analysis, which explain the fast disintegration properties. All the prepared tablets disintegrated in less than 47 s. The disintegration process was prolonged by the increase in FSM content, due to the high viscosity the polymer creates in aqueous media. FSM tablets presented longer disintegration times, as compared to gelatin tablets, but also higher crushing strength. Considering the fast disintegration and the high crushing strength, FSM is a good candidate as matrix forming agent for fast disintegrating dosage forms or other freeze-dried preparations...|$|R

Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for grass pollen-induced rhino-conjunctivitis has been developed to make immunotherapy available to a broader group of allergic patients. In the largest clinical programme ever conducted with allergen-specific immunotherapy, over 1, 700 adults and 260 children have been exposed to Grazax®. Grazax is formulated as an <b>oral</b> <b>lyophilisate</b> (tablet) for sublingual administration, containing 75, 000 SQ-T standardized allergen extract of grass pollen from Phleum pratense. Grazax is indicated for treatment of grass pollen-induced rhinitis and conjunctivitis in adult patients with clinically relevant symptoms and diagnosed with a positive skin prick test and/or specific IgE test to grass pollen. In phase I trials doses from 2, 500 to 1, 000, 000 SQ-T were tested. All doses were well tolerated and 75, 000 SQ-T, with approximately 15 μg major allergen protein, was chosen as the optimal dose. Three phase III trials are ongoing, one being a long-term trial. Results from GT- 08 trial first and second treatment years showed a reduction of 30 % and 36 %, respectively, in daily rhino-conjunctivitis symptom scores and a reduction of 38 % and 46 % of daily rhino-conjunctivitis medication scores compared with placebo over the entire grass pollen season. Subjects treated with Grazax also had an increased number of well days and improved quality of life, and more subjects experienced excellent rhino-conjunctivitis control. The most common adverse events related to Grazax are local reactions, such as pruritus, edema mouth, ear pruritus, throat irritation, and sneezing. We conclude that Grazax is efficacious and safe for treatment of rhino-conjunctivitis due to grass pollen allergy...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{neonates}} {{and small}} infants, early diagnosis of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) and treatment with desmopressin in low doses (avoiding severe hypo- or hypernatremia) {{are important to}} prevent associated high morbidity and mortality in this particular age group. Case Presentation: We described pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results {{of the use of}} recently launched <b>oral</b> desmopressin <b>lyophilisate</b> (Minirin Melt®) in two infants with CDI, diagnosed at the age of 12 and 62 days, respectively. We observed that a starting dose of 60 μg of Minirin Melt ® in the first case resulted in a pharmacokinetic profile largely exceeding the reference frame observed in children with nocturnal enuresis, while a dose of 15 μg in the second case resulted in acceptable concentrations. After initial dose adjustments, administration of sublingual lyophilisate resulted in rather stable serum sodium concentrations...|$|R
