5|$|Cassie is the {{daughter}} of Nathan and Elena and Samuel's niece. She was named after Cassandra Morgan, Nathan and Samuel's deceased mother. She is voiced and motion captured by Kaitlyn Dever. She is playable in the epilogue chapter of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. While wandering around the house looking for her parents, she stumbles across the keys to Nathan's private wardrobe, where she discovers her parents' shady past before she is caught by Nathan and Elena. Cassie demands to know the truth, and Nathan and Elena decide she is <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b>|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them; his son was only <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them, as his son was only <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E

2500|$|Martin {{was born}} in Bowling Green, Warren County Kentucky, at Western University Hospital. He has written and talked {{extensively}} about his gender dysphoria and transgender issues. He is a gay man, and has said, [...] "Ever since I was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what gay men were, I've considered myself a gay man that happens {{to have been born}} in a female body, and that's the perspective I'm coming from." [...] In 2003, Martin wrote that, while gender theorists like Kate Bornstein would call him a [...] "nonoperative transsexual", Martin would not insist on a pedantic label, writing [...] "I'm just me". In August 2010, he began the process of gender reassignment, and, in 2011 expressed that he would prefer to be referred to by male pronouns.|$|E
2500|$|For Series 5 (2005â€“2006), {{the theme}} was {{normally}} {{a parody of}} a traditional game show, most of which aired many years earlier, {{long enough for the}} contestants not to be <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> them. In whatever format the game took, the current 1st, 2nd and 3rd placed Bungalow Heads (The Prize Winners) competed against the 4th, 5th and 6th placed Bungalow Heads (The Prize Losers). If the Prize Winners won, then they would keep their current positions, and win the three prizes on offer. If the Prize Losers won, then they became the new 1st, 2nd and 3rd, and take the prizes off the previous Prize Winners. Featured gameshow parodies included Catchphrase, [...] Blockbusters, Telly Addicts, Name That Tune, The Crystal Maze, Call My Bluff, Countdown and Deal or No Deal.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{the quantum}} of Presbyterian merit, {{during the four}} years' reign of that weak, bigoted, and ill-advised prince, {{as well as at}} the time of the Revolution, will easily be computed, by a {{recourse}} to a great number of histories, pamphlets, and public papers, printed in those times, and some afterwards; beside the verbal testimonies of many persons yet alive, who are <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> and observed the Dissenters' conduct in that critical period.|$|R
60|$|Old Mr. Toad was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> better. It is bad <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> see {{young and}} foolish creatures puffed up with pride, {{but it is}} worse to see any one as old as Old Mr. Toad that way. He held his head so high that he couldn't see his own feet, and more than once he stubbed his toes. Presently he met his old friend, Danny Meadow Mouse. He tipped his head a little higher, puffed himself out a little more, and pretended not to see Danny.|$|R

She later distanced herself from him and remarked: I'm <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> now <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I'd never be taken in again {{by the likes of}} Peter Foster. But then, I was 22 and impressionable. My parents had split and here was a man who was clever, manipulative and domineering. I came close to marrying him because I was so vulnerable.

2500|$|Tatiana {{did have}} her {{concerns}} about the storyline. She {{did not want the}} show to do a gay stereotype. Riegel voiced the same concerns earlier on about the character; she clarified that she asked the show's writers and producers to make the character three-dimensional and not [...] "so heavily centered" [...] on the character's sexual orientation. Having grown up close to an out lesbian sister, who [...] "came out" [...] in her early 20s, Riegel was familiar with how Bianca should be if stereotypes were to be avoided. At the time of Tatiana's [...] "coming-out" [...] process, Riegel and brother Sam were children. Tatiana relayed that being gay was not an issue and that she could not remember having had a conversation with them about it at that age. By the time Riegel and Sam were <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what being gay meant, they had grown to love Tatiana's girlfriend and the family was closer than before. Riegel having acquired the role of Bianca led her and Tatiana to discuss certain specifics of the character. Riegel's mindset was centered on what it must have been like for Tatiana to grow up as gay. She said that she had never heard Tatiana's whole coming-out story before and that it was nice to talk about.|$|E

I will say nothing hard of Lucy, though she be my rival." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good-bye, my dear. If {{you will}} quarrel, it isn't my doing.' Then Sir Damask led Miss Longestaffe out, {{and put her}} into Madame Melmotte's carriage. 'It's the most absurd thing I ever knew in my life,' said the wife as soon as her husband had {{returned}} to her. 'She hasn't been able to bear to remain down {{in the country for}} one season, when all the world knows that her father can't afford to have a house for them in town. Then she condescends to come and stay with these abominations and pretends to feel surprised that her old friends don't run after her.

6000|$|... "Not a line. You {{answer me}} of course, when I say THAT, you answer me with your adored Lady Julia, and will want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what then becomes {{of the lucky}} resemblance.

But that dear sweet blessed thing {{is very much the}} same lost secret as the dear sweet blessed OTHER thing that went away with it--the decent leisure that, for the most part, we've also seen the last of. It's the thing at any rate that poor Nanda and all her kind have most effectually got rid of. Oh if you'd trust me a little more you'd see that I'm quite at one with you on all the changes for the worse. I bear up, but I'm <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known.</b> All the same Mrs. Brook has something--say what you like--when she bends that little brown head.

60|$|Leaving by {{an early}} train, I got to Limmeridge {{in time for}} dinner. The house was oppressively empty and dull. I had {{expected}} that good Mrs. Vesey would have been company {{for me in the}} absence of the young ladies, but she was confined to her room by a cold. The servants were so surprised at seeing me that they hurried and bustled absurdly, and made all sorts of annoying mistakes. Even the butler, who was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> better, brought me a bottle of port that was chilled. The reports of Mr. Fairlie's health were just as usual, and when I sent up a message to announce my arrival, I was told that he would be delighted to see me the next morning but that the sudden news of my appearance had prostrated him with palpitations for the rest of the evening. The wind howled dismally all night, and strange cracking and groaning noises sounded here, there, and everywhere in the empty house. I slept as wretchedly as possible, and got up in a mighty bad humour to breakfast by myself the next morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure of {{one very}} {{important}} thing. I {{am sure that}} Midwinter--I must call him by his ugly false name, or I may confuse the two Armadales before I have done--I am sure that Midwinter is perfectly ignorant that I and the little imp of twelve years old who waited on Mrs. Armadale in Madeira, and copied the letters {{that were supposed to}} arrive from the West Indies, are one and the same. There are not many girls of twelve who could have imitated a man's handwriting, and held their tongues about it afterward, as I did; but that doesn't matter now. What does matter is that Midwinter's belief in the Dream is Midwinter's only reason for trying to connect me with Allan Armadale, by associating me with Allan Armadale's father and mother. I asked him if he actually thought me <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> either of them. And he said No, poor fellow, in the most innocent, bewildered way. Would he say No if he saw me now? Shall I turn to the glass and see if I look my five-and-thirty years? or shall I go on writing? I will go on writing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Agatha," [...] said Miss Wilson, shaken, [...] "these {{expressions}} of regard cost you so little, {{and when they}} have effected their purpose, are so soon forgotten by you, that they have ceased to satisfy me.

But as your uncle has told you, you are <b>old</b> and sensible <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the difference between order and disorder. Hitherto you {{have been on the}} side of disorder, an element which was hardly known here until you came, as Mrs. Trefusis can tell you. Nevertheless, if you will promise to be more careful in future, I will waive all past cause of complaint, {{and at the end of}} the term I shall be able to judge as to your continuing among us." ...|$|R

60|$|Morally {{as well as}} physically, {{there were}} moments, at this period of their lives, when even her own father hardly {{recognized}} his daughter of former days. She had lost her childish vivacity--her sweet, equable flow of good humor. Silent and self-absorbed, she went through the daily routine of her duties enduringly. The hope of meeting me again had sunk to a dead hope in her by this time. She made no complaint. The bodily strength that she had gained in these later days had its sympathetic influence in steadying her mind. When her father once or twice ventured to ask if she was still thinking of me, she answered quietly that she had brought herself to share his opinions. She could not doubt that I had long since ceased to think of her. Even if I had remained faithful to her, she was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> now <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{that the difference between}} us in rank made our union by marriage an impossibility. It would be best (she thought) not to refer any more to the past, best to forget me, as I had forgotten her. So she spoke now. So, tried by the test of appearances, Dame Dermody's confident forecast of our destinies had failed to justify itself, and had taken its place among the predictions that are never fulfilled.|$|R
6000|$|In those days, wishful to {{give the}} world the benefit of my wisdom, and seeking for a candle-stick wherefrom my brilliancy might be visible and helpful unto men, I arrived before a dingy portal in Chequers Street, St. Luke's, behind which a {{conclave}} of young men, together with a few <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> better, met every Friday evening {{for the purpose of}} discussing and arranging the affairs of the universe. [...] "Speaking members" [...] were charged ten-and-sixpence per annum, which must have worked out at an extremely moderate rate per word; and [...] "gentlemen whose subscriptions were more than three months in arrear," [...] became, by Rule seven, powerless for good or evil. We called ourselves [...] "The Stormy Petrels," [...] and, under the sympathetic shadow of those wings, I laboured two seasons towards the reformation of the human race; until, indeed, our treasurer, an earnest young man, and a tireless foe of all that was conventional, departed for the East, leaving behind him a balance sheet, showing that the club owed forty-two pounds fifteen and fourpence, and that the subscriptions for the current year, amounting to a little over thirty-eight pounds, had been [...] "carried forward," [...] but as to where, the report afforded no indication. Whereupon our landlord, a man utterly without ideals, seized our furniture, offering to sell it back to us for fifteen pounds. We pointed out to him that this was an extravagant price, and tendered him five.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Harris had {{remained}} {{loyal to the}} core to Luke and to his fortunes.

She liked Luke, and it would be shabby to leave him in the lurch, now that the last of the society rats were scurrying to leave the sinking ship. They were doing it, too, in a mighty hurry. The invitations which the penniless younger son received {{toward the end of the}} London season were considerably fewer than those which were showered on him at its beginning before the world had realized that Philip de Mountford had come to stay, and would one day be Earl of Radclyffe with a rent roll of eighty thousand pounds a year, and the sore need of a wife.|$|R

60|$|In the {{foregoing}} paragraphs I have strayed {{away to a}} long distance from the road to Stratford-on-Avon; for I remember no such stone fences as I have been speaking of in Warwickshire, nor elsewhere in England, except among the Lakes, or in Yorkshire, and the rough and hilly countries {{to the north of}} it. Hedges there were along my road, however, and broad, level fields, rustic hamlets, and cottages of ancient date,--from the roof of one of which the occupant was tearing away the thatch, and showing what an accumulation of dust, dirt, mouldiness, roots of weeds, families of mice, swallows' nests, and hordes of insects had been deposited there since that old straw was new. Estimating its antiquity from these tokens, Shakespeare himself, in one of his morning rambles out of his native town, might have seen the thatch laid on; at all events, the cottage-walls were <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> him as a guest. A few modern villas were also to be seen, and perhaps there were mansions of old gentility at no great distance, but hidden among trees; for it is a point of English pride that such houses seldom allow themselves to be visible from the high-road. In short, I recollect nothing specially remarkable along the way, nor in the immediate approach to Stratford; and yet the picture of that June morning has a glory in my memory, owing chiefly, I believe, to the charm of the English summer-weather, the really good days of which are the most delightful that mortal man can ever hope to be favored with. Such a genial warmth! A little too warm, it might be, yet only to such a degree as to assure an American (a certainty to which he seldom attains till attempered to the customary austerity of an English summer-day) that he was quite warm enough. And after all, there was an unconquerable freshness in the atmosphere, which every little movement of a breeze shook over me like a dash of the ocean-spray. Such days need bring us no other happiness than their own light and temperature. No doubt, I could not have enjoyed it so exquisitely, except that there must be still latent in us Western wanderers (even after an absence of two centuries and more), an adaptation to the English climate which makes us sensible of a motherly kindness in its scantiest sunshine, and overflows us with delight at its more lavish smiles.|$|R
