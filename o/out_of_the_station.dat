5|$|When {{the station}} was first opened in 1838 by the North Union Railway, the line north of the station passed through a tunnel under {{the west end of}} Fishergate (then Preston’s major thoroughfare). It was on a slope so steep that {{sometimes}} station staff had to push trains <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, {{the only part}} of Viper that was not torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform in the front and an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E

5|$|The hasty {{departure}} from Manchester degenerated into chaos. Mechanical failures {{and a lack}} of space to turn the locomotives meant that the seven trains on the northern track were unable to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> Only three carriages—the Duke's among them—managed to leave successfully. At around 6.30pm the Duke arrived in Roby, and went to spend the night at the Marquess of Salisbury's house at Childwall Hall. Meanwhile, the remaining 24 passenger carriages were eventually lashed together with rope and fastened to the three locomotives which remained usable, which hauled this single long train, carrying around 600 passengers, out of Manchester at a speed of around 5mph (8km/h), further slowed by crowds of people standing on the tracks and by grit and mud settling on the rails.|$|E
5|$|Although the old Cleveland Railway had not {{provided}} any passenger services, during the 1870s the NER built {{a number of}} stations at {{the eastern end of}} the line. Passenger services began from Brotton, Skinningrove and Loftus in 1875, plus Boosbeck in 1878. The tortuous history of the Cleveland Railway had a lasting effect on the provision of rail services to Guisborough. It did not at any time offer a passenger service to the town, leaving that instead to the M, which provided only a single-platform station {{at the end of its}} line into the town. This line was bypassed by the Cleveland Railway en route to Skinningrove. After the westbound Cleveland Railway was closed, the eastbound line was joined with the M line, leaving Guisborough railway station at the end of a spur. Trains thus had to reverse <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> before continuing along the line to Loftus. It remained this way until the line was closed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Green Lantern Coaster {{begins with}} a u-turn <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> It ascends a chain lift hill before going down a small dip and into an s-bend {{followed}} by a u-turn. After a slight ascent, the car enters a 120.5° drop – the steepest in the southern hemisphere. The track then returns to approximately two thirds of its original height before entering {{the first set of}} block brakes. These brakes lead into a left turn with reverse or outward banking. It then drops under the block brakes and into the first inversion – a Dive Loop. The inversion begins with half of an inline twist which transitions into half of a vertical loop. Upon exiting the inversion the track inclines into a second set of block brakes. The train then goes around a right u-turn and into the second inversion – a downwards inline twist. This leads into a cutback-style turnaround before entering the final brake run and returning to the station.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{controversy}} {{between the}} local organisation Galleri Texas and the state-owned corporation Follo Futura arose, regarding the hiring contract {{of the station}} building, and which of them were to operate the cultural meeting place. Follo Futura, which together with the Norwegian National Rail Administration and Rom Eiendom officially owned the station building wanted {{to take over the}} café business. They argued that they were better fit to operate it, since Galleri Texas did not have the economical capacity to run the café with the art exhibition and gift shop the whole week. The local community wanted Galleri Texas to operate the café, arguing that replacing a local company for a governmental one would weaken the local and patriotic spirit of the café. On 1 January 2010, the operation of the café and the cultural meeting place was transferred from Galleri Texas to Follo Futura, since Galleri Texas no longer could pay the rental costs. In 2010, smoke was tumbling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> but it turned out that it was only a cigarette that had not been quenched, and had been laying overnight in a flower basket.|$|E
5|$|The $46.9 million {{station was}} opened during a ribbon-cutting {{ceremony}} on February 4, 2002, attended by Everett Mayor Ed Hansen, Governor Gary Locke, U.S. Representative Rick Larsen, Snohomish County Executive Bob Drewel and Sound Transit Board chairman and King County Executive Ron Sims. Initially, only Everett Transit and Community Transit operated <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> on opening day, {{but they were}} quickly joined by Sound Transit Express service the following day and Greyhound intercity bus service that summer. Amtrak was initially expected to begin serving Everett Station in July 2002, but {{the construction of a}} passing track delayed the move of the Cascades and Empire Builder from Bond Street Station to November 12. Construction of a Sounder commuter rail platform and rail spur was approved by the Everett City Council in September 2002, pending reimbursement from Sound Transit and Amtrak for its cost of $726,000. Sounder service to King Street Station in Seattle via Edmonds began with special Seattle Seahawks gameday service on December 22, 2003, carrying 700 passengers on the inaugural run of the Sounder North Line.|$|E
5|$|The {{station at}} Chalfont Road was built with almost all {{facilities}} {{on the up}} side (the London-bound platform). As Chalfont St Giles, the largest nearby settlement, {{was on the other}} side of the tracks, most passengers travelling to and from the station were obliged to take a lengthy detour from the single exit. A footpath across the tracks was added in 1925, but an approach road giving access to the station from the southern side of the railway line was not built until 1933. The station had three platforms; one platform in each direction on the London–Aylesbury line, and a bay platform alongside the up platform for trains to Chesham. A run-around loop was built to allow locomotives reversing in the bay platform always to be at the front of their trains. It was built outside the station, meaning locomotives reversing on the Chesham line were obliged to push their trains <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> before performing the manoeuvre.|$|E

25|$|Following the accident, rail {{service to}} and from the Hoboken station (including PATH service) was {{suspended}}, and local buses and ferries, as well as Metro-North Railroad, were cross-honoring NJ Transit train tickets. PATH service was suspended due to fears that the roof of the PATH station, where the derailed NJ Transit train came to rest, might collapse. PATH service into and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was restored {{by the end of the}} day, as was Hudson-Bergen Light Rail service in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> Delays to rail service in the area persisted into the following week.|$|E

5000|$|... 15 December 2011 (6.45 pm-11.40 pm) - A 40m {{stretch of}} power rail damaged between City Hall and Dhoby Ghaut MRT {{stations}} caused service disruption on the North-South line between Marina Bay and Bishan MRT stations. Services on southbound trains resumed at around 9pm while North-bound train services between <b>the</b> affected <b>stations</b> resumed at 11.40pm. Lights {{went off and}} ventilation was inadequate in some trains. A window in C151 067/068 was smashed and doors were forced open to provide ventilation.

25|$|At the {{southern}} end of York station a short length of fourth track was installed in early 2011 at Holgate Junction with accompanying OLE and signalling systems. This work helped to remove one of the bottlenecks on the East Coast Main Line. Previously, trains from Leeds would sometimes have to wait before entering the station. The improvement allows for better flow of trains in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
25|$|The station {{experienced}} a renaissance during the 2000s. At {{that time the}} station started generating commuter traffic to Kristiansand. This traffic had increased greatly and now constitutes the bulk of traffic <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> Ridership was 2,400 annually in 2005, rising to 17,096 in 2010. Around then the Norwegian National Rail Administration carried out a cleaning of the station, renovating the station building, asphalting {{the parking lot and}} clearing out wild growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} was {{an architectural}} and engineering marvel of its time, designed with ramps to allow pedestrian traffic to flow in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> quickly and easily. The station was served by two single-track tubes {{connected by a}} loop to speed train movements. The loop included five tracks and 3 platforms (2 center island and one side) and was somewhat similar to the current arrangement. By 1914, passenger volume at the Hudson Terminal had reached 30,535,500 annually. Volume nearly doubled by 1922, with 59,221,354 passengers that year.|$|E

25|$|The {{area and}} traffic {{generated}} by transshipment was so extensive {{that a new}} station building was needed. Balthazar Conrad Lange had become NSB's head architect, and was issued the task of designing a new main station building. The second station building was located east of the old, at roughly {{the location of the}} current bus station. Also built in wood, it received a roof which hung over the platform. The old station building was converted to railway offices. The track <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> was moved further away from the lakeshore. The new station was taken into use in 1880.|$|E
