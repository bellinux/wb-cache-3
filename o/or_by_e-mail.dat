5|$|The Croatian Parliament tasked the Croatian State Election Committee with {{referendum}} voting organization, ballot counting, {{and result}} publication. The committee scheduled the referendum vote for 22 January 2012 starting at 07:00 and lasting until 19:00, at regular polling stations in Croatia, in Croatian military units, in Croatian diplomatic missions abroad, on Croatian-flagged vessels and in prisons: 6,750polling stations in all. For the referendum, all polling stations were grouped {{in a single}} district. Voters traveling abroad were permitted {{to vote in the}} Croatian diplomatic missions as with Croatian presidential elections; however, the initial instructions by the Ministry of Public Administration did not allow voters within Croatia who were away from their place of residence to vote in the referendum, nor did it allow absentee ballots. GONG, the Croatian election supervision NGO, requested that the authorities correct this. One restriction was removed by 3 January, when voters were permitted to register to vote in Croatia away from their legal residence. Registration was possible until 7 January, in person, by fax, <b>or</b> <b>by</b> <b>e-mail.</b> When the registration process completed in early January 2012 ahead of the referendum, there were 4,504,686voters in the voter registry (the same one used in parliamentary and presidential elections).|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) with an {{additional}} requirement of strict b - tau unification {{in the region of}} small tan(beta). We find that the parameter space becomes completely limited below about 1 TeV by physical constraints alone, without a fine-tuning constraint. We study the resulting phenomenological consequences, and point out several ways of falsifying the adopted b - tau unification assumption.

40|$|Modern {{machine control}} systems {{rely heavily on}} {{software}} to achieve system functionality. Until recently, control software’s primary purpose was to provide logic and sequencing of machine execution. With computer hardware now providing power and memory to spare, control software is broadening its horizon from a focus on execution control to multiple phases within a control systems lifetime, such as design, testing, and maintenance. This paper reviews an object-oriented Finite State Machine (FSM) framework developed at National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that exploits this potential and expands the software utility and functionality of machine control logic. The public domain FSM framework handles additional control requirements such as reusability, extensibility, modularity, testing, diagnostic troubleshooting, reporting, and maintenance.

Learning is supported in different ways, for instance, via worksheets, textbooks or simply informal conversation. There are distinct uses of the Tandem method which promote independent learning e.g. Tandem Partnerships (two people, supported by counsellors), and Binational Tandem Courses (for groups, organised by moderators). The classic style is that where partners equally share the available time during the exchange. For example, a Portuguese speaker and a German speaker can talk for half an hour in German and then for half an hour in Portuguese. In this way, through language exchange partnerships with native speakers, and extra social and cultural experiences, participants become fully immersed in the target language culture. The only condition for participation in self-directed Tandem is to be at a lower intermediate level of language proficiency (Lower B1 Threshold). The Common European Framework of References for Languages ( [...] CEFR) Can-Do statements provide a clear description of language ability at the Threshold level (B1) in several European languages.|$|R
