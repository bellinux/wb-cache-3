40|$|Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) are a huge threat for {{millions}} of people worldwide, since they act as vectors for devastating parasites and pathogens. Culicidae control is of crucial importance. Mosquito eggs, larvae, and pupae are usually targeted using organophosphates, insect growth regulators, and microbial agents. Indoor residual spraying and insecticide-treated bed nets are also employed. However, these chemicals have negative effects on human health and the environment, and induce resistance in a number of species. Eco-friendly tools have been recently implemented against mosquito vectors, including botanical insecticides. The majority of researches focused on larvicides (745 SCOPUS results, July 2015) and adult repellents (434 SCOPUS results), while limited efforts were conducted to identify effective <b>ovicides</b> of botanical origin (59 SCOPUS results). Here, I review current knowledge on the effectiveness of plant-borne <b>ovicides</b> against major mosquito vectors of medical and veterinary importance. The majority of researches focused on the toxicity of crude extracts, their fractions, or essential oils against three important mosquito vectors, Anopheles stephensi, Aedes aegypti, and Culex quinquefasciatus. As a general trend, C. quinquefasciatus eggs were the most resistant to botanical <b>ovicides.</b> Five studies proposed selected compounds from plant extracts and essential oils as <b>ovicides</b> effective at few parts per million. However, no efforts were conducted to shed light on possible mechanisms underlying the toxicity of plant-borne <b>ovicides.</b> In the final section, a number of hot issues needing further research and cooperation among parasitologists, entomologists, and researchers working in natural product chemistry are outlined...|$|R

50|$|House wrens are feisty and pugnacious animals {{considering}} {{their tiny}} size.

50|$|Infanticide in burying beetles {{may have}} led to male parental care. In this species males often {{cooperate}} with the female in preparing a piece of carrion, which is buried with the eggs and eaten by the larvae when they hatch. Males may also guard the site alongside the female. It is apparent from experiments that this behavior does not provide their young with any better nourishment, nor is it of any use in defending against predators. However, other burying bugs may try to take their nesting space. When this occurs, a male-female pair is over twice as successful in nest defense, preventing the <b>ovicide</b> of their offspring.|$|E
50|$|While {{this became}} a widely {{accepted}} idea, {{it was less}} noted that Hamilton published a later paper that modified this view.

The indirect adaptive benefits of such acts can surpass certain costs of the act (either helpful or harmful) itself.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the lethal concentration, oviposition deterrence and ovicidal activity of acetone extracts of Melanochyla fasciculiflora (M.  fasciculiflora) leaf and Gluta renghas (G.  renghas) leaf against Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus). Methods: To determine the lethal concentration of Anacardiaceae, ten test concentrations of the extracts ranging from 200 to 650  mg/L {{were selected for}} larvicidal bioassays and 25 early fourth instar larvae {{were exposed to the}} extracts for 24  h. The sub-lethal concentrations used for oviposition deterrence was the value of LC 25, LC 50 and LC 75 from above study which is 235  mg/L, 470  mg/L and 705  mg/L for M.  fasciculiflora extract and 187. 5  mg/L, 375  mg/L and 562. 5  mg/L for G.  renghas extract, respectively. Twenty gravid Ae. albopictus were allowed to oviposit in different treated concentrations. For <b>oviciding</b> procedure, a total of 300 eggs of Ae. albopictus were soaked in solution with each treated concentration as mentioned above for 24  h. After 24  h, eggs were sieved and soaked in seasoned water, and hatching rates were calculated. For comparison, only seasoned water was used in control experiment. Results: G.  renghas demonstrated lower LC 50 value of 372. 80  mg/L compared to M.  fasciculiflora (467. 90  mg/L). The activity index of negative oviposition revealed the deterrent effect and thus, caused a remarkable negative response resulting in oviposition of fewer eggs compared with control (without plant extract). The acetone extract of M.  fasciculiflora was more effective than G.  renghas extract in displaying oviposition deterrence potential since the latter did not possess the deterring effect within the concentration range tested. However, both plant extracts exhibited excellent <b>oviciding</b> effect as 92. 33 % of eggs failed to be hatched when treated with 705. 0  mg/L of M.  fasciculiflora and 86. 67 % with 562. 5  mg/L of G.  renghas. The oviposition deterrence and percentage of egg mortality were directly proportional to the concentrations of extracts in both plants tested. Conclusions: These results clearly indicate that the acetone extract of G.  renghas could be served as potential larvicide, whereas M.  fasciculiflora has better sub-lethal effect for oviposition deterrence and against Ae. albopictus as an <b>oviciding</b> agent...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ovicide,</b> superparasitism {{and host}} {{rejection}} are alternative reproductive tactics facing female parasitoid wasps encountering an already-parasitized host. Superparasitism {{is simply the}} addition of an egg or a clutch of eggs by the secondary parasitoid, but under <b>ovicide</b> the primary clutch is removed or destroyed. Host rejection occurs if the wasp leaves without laying a clutch. The ectoparasitoid Laelius pedatus (Say) (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae) performs <b>ovicide</b> in this situation. Clutch manipulation experiments show that secondary clutches suffer high mortality in competition with primary clutches, which increases with increasing time delay between clutches. Primary clutches however suffer little in competition with secondary clutches, {{even if there is}} minimal time delay between clutches. These data suggest that the offspring of ovicidal females are substantially fitter than the offspring of superparasitizing females. Handling time and clutch size do not differ significantly between first (sole) parasitoids and second (ovicidal) parasitoids. The same is true for offspring survival and development time. However, offspring of second females are slightly smaller. This suggests that parasitized and unparasitized hosts are resources of similar quality when <b>ovicide</b> is performed. These data strongly support the predictions of evolutionary models of <b>ovicide.</b> They may also give some insight into the taxonomic distribution of <b>ovicide</b> in parasitoids...|$|E

40|$|Proximate {{mechanisms}} underlying reproductive skew are obscure in {{many animals}} that breed communally. Here, we address causes of reproductive skew in brood-parasitic associations of burying beetles (Nicrophorus vespilloides). Male and female burying beetles feed and defend their larvae on buried carcasses. When several females locate the same small carcass, {{they engage in}} violent physical altercations. The subordinate then acts as an intraspecific brood parasite, laying eggs, but not providing care. The dominant female largely monopolizes access to the carcass; she alone provides parental care and her share of the brood is {{much larger than the}} subordinate's. On larger carcasses, subordinates have greater access to the carcass than on small ones, and reproductive skew is reduced. Differential fecundity, <b>ovicide</b> and larvicide have been suggested as causes of skew on small carcasses. Here, we report the results of the experiments pertaining to the first two of these potential mechanisms. <b>Ovicide</b> did not significantly contribute to reproductive skew on small carcasses, but differential fecundity did. Fecundity differences were due to dominance status, not body size per se. Fecundity differences disappeared when supplemental food was available, suggesting that reduced access to the carcass limits fecundity by causing nutritional deficiencies. Supplemental food prevented such nutritional deficiencies and allowed subordinates to produce as many eggs as dominants.

During storage, the E orientalis population decreases gradually and it disappears completely in less than two months after the beginning of storage. E.

40|$|Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) {{are a key}} threat for {{millions}} of people worldwide, since they act as vectors for devastating parasites and pathogens. Mosquito young instars are usually targeted with organophosphates, insect growth regulators and microbial control agents. Indoors residual spraying and insecticide-treated bed nets are also employed. However, these chemicals have strong negative effects on human health and the environment. Newer and safer tools have been recently implemented to enhance control of mosquitoes. In this review, I focus on characterization, effectiveness, and non-target effects of mosquitocidal nanoparticles synthesized using botanical products (mosquitocidal nanoparticles, MNP). The majority of plant-fabricated MNP are silver ones. The synthesis of MNP is usually confirmed by UV-visualization spectroscopy, followed by scanning electron microscopy or transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction studies. Interestingly, plant-synthesized metal nanoparticles have been reported as effective <b>ovicides,</b> larvicides, pupicides, adulticides, and oviposition deterrents against different mosquito species of medical and veterinary importance. Few parts per million of different MNP are highly toxic against the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi, the dengue vector Aedes aegypti, and the filariasis mosquito Culex quiquefasciatus. However, despite the growing number of evidences about the effectiveness of MNP, moderate efforts have been carried out to shed light on their possible non-target effects against mosquito’s natural enemies and other aquatic organisms.

The lethal concentration 50 values calculated were 1. 3 and 0. 8 %, respectively, for neem and J. curcas. By contrast, larval survival was not affected by the oil treatments. In the field, Furadan, neem and J. curcas oils significantly reduced the number of M. nigrivenella larvae by 16 – 49. 2 %, while aqueous extracts of T. vogelii and H. suaveolens were similar to the emulsified water control. The treatments did not significantly influence cob weight, and only neem oil at both concentrations and Furadan significantly reduced cob damage and consequently grain losses. These results showed that oil emulsions of A. indica and J. curcas oils act not only as an oviposition deterrent but also as <b>ovicides.</b> The prospects for possible inclusion of botanicals into integrated M. nigrivenella control in maize cropping systems are discussed.

40|$|For European and French millers, the ban of methyl and {{the loss}} of {{dichlorvos}} (DDVP) are very problematic to disinfest their structures. Currently, sulfuryl fluoride (ProFume®, DowAgrosciences) is the only fumigant registered since 2006 for flour mills fumigation in France. This gas began to be used at commercial scale in 2007. However, the main drawback of this compound, compared with methyl bromide, is the <b>ovicide</b> efficacy which needs much more gas than the 20 g/m 3 of methyl bromide used in France before its withdrawal. The most tolerant life stage of flour beetles. with sulfuryl fluoride is the egg stage (Bell et al, 1998), that’s why it is necessary to make flour mill’s fumigations with dosages higher than those used for MB. This kind of practice can be expensive for millers and the cost of the fumigation is quite often a barrier to the use of ProFume®. However, there is a huge difference between the dosages which ensure to control post embryonic stages of insect pests, and those able to kill the egg stage, particularly eggs of flour beetles.

40|$|Head lice are {{insects that}} have been parasitizing human beings for {{thousands}} of years. Chemical pediculicides have been used extensively {{for the treatment of}} infestations since the early 20 th century. Resistance to these pediculicides, such as permethrin, is constantly increasing and {{there is a need for}} the development of new effective compounds killing adult lice and eggs. Natural products have been used in traditional medicine since long ago and have been more and more an issue of interest, since the costs are usually lower and they are in general considered less toxic. However, toxicology information on natural products is poor. Here we present an evidence-based review on plant compounds for the treatment of head lice infestations. An overview is given on published evidence on the use of pediculicides and <b>ovicides</b> in in vitro studies and clinical trials to cure pediculosis. Additionally, the available data on deterrent compounds are reviewed. We conclude that large numbers of plant products, such as neem and tea tree oils, offer promise for new compounds to treat head lice infestation. The number of clinical studies is very limited, and there is an urgent need to increase research assessing the effectiveness and safety of promising compounds. Over the counter natural products should be supported by in vitro data and adequately designed controlled trials that evaluate cure rates and safety. Providing that a new family of synthetic insecticides is not discovered, it is possible that plant products will replace chemical insecticides on the market in future...|$|R
40|$|Berliner {{insecticides}} {{have demonstrated}} considerable potential in cotton insect pest management, although problems with persistence have limited commercial use. One {{option for the}} control of insecticide resistant tobacco budworm includes the use of B. thuringiensis insecticides with chemical <b>ovicides</b> for control of low infestations of tobacco budworm in normal non-transgenic B. thuringiensis cotton cultivars during phase I (June) of the cotton production season. The primary objective of these studies {{was to determine the}} efficacy and persistence of two B. thuringiensis insecticides, Dipel ES and Condor OF, compared with a standard chemical insecticide, Larvin 3. 2 F, against this pest in laboratory and field tests. Literature Summary. The tobacco budworm has developed resistance to all recommended classes of insecticides used on cotton. Applied entomologists have recommended the use of B. thuringiensis at rates of 2. 0 to 64. 0 oz acre- 1 as a component of insecticide resistance management guidelines to manage tobacco budworm populations resistant to pyrethroid insecticides. Researchers in Texas have suggested that low rates are not recommended to produce mortality but rather to slow development of tobacco budworm and expose them to natural mortality factors. Other information suggests rates less than 48 oz acre- 1 is generally ineffective against tobacco budworm. Therefore, cost-effective rates of B. thuringiensis insecticides need to be defined for tobacco budworm management in cotton. Study Description. In 1992 through 1994, the B. thuringiensis Berliner var. kurstaki insecticides, Dipel ES and Condor OF, were evaluated for efficacy against tobacco budworm larvae in laboratory (plant terminal) and field trials in Louisiana. These insecticides were tested at rates of 0. 29, 0. 58, 1. 17, 2. 34, and 4. 67 liters ha- 1 (4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 oz acre- 1) against the tobacco budworm...|$|R
