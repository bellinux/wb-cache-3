Parsons had launched the project after identifying a need to replace the wool coat then in use with an <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> that was lightweight, water repellent, and windproof, and could incorporate a liner for warmth during the winter.|$|E
25|$|The loincloth is the {{simplest}} form of underwear; {{it was probably}} the first undergarment worn by human beings. In warmer climates the loincloth was often the only clothing worn (effectively making it an <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> rather than an undergarment), as was doubtless its origin, but in colder regions the loincloth often formed the basis of a person's clothing and was covered by other garments. In most ancient civilizations, this was the only undergarment available.|$|E
25|$|The mourners {{traditionally}} make a tear (keriah קריעה) in an <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> {{before or}} at the funeral. The tear {{should be on the}} left side (over the heart and clearly visible) for a parent, including foster parents, and on the right side for siblings (including half-brothers and half-sisters), children, and spouses (and {{does not need to be}} visible). Non-Orthodox Jews will often make the keriah in a small black ribbon that is pinned to the lapel rather than in the lapel per se.|$|E

25|$|The basic costume of the Mongol {{fighting}} man {{consisted of}} a heavy coat fastened at the waist by a leather belt. From the belt would hang his sword, dagger, and possibly an axe. This long robe-like coat would double over, left breast over right, and be secured with a button a few inches below the right armpit. The coat was lined with fur. Underneath the coat, a shirt-like undergarment with long, wide sleeves was commonly worn. Silk and metallic thread were increasingly used. The Mongols wore protective heavy silk undershirts. Even if an arrow pierced their mail or leather <b>outer</b> <b>garment,</b> the silk from the undershirt would stretch to wrap itself around the arrow as it entered the body, reducing damage caused by the arrow shaft, and making removal of the arrow easier.|$|E
25|$|The {{weapon of}} the knight changed a little: swords were longer, some with long {{cruciform}} hilts with grips over 15cm in length (providing {{room for two}} hands), straight double-edged blades often over 90cm in length, and weigh typically between 1.2 and 1.4kg (so called greatswords or bastards). On the contrary armour transformed significantly. Mail was gradually enriched with iron plates, which covered the most of endangered parts of the body, and {{in the beginning of}} 15th century was replaced with full plate armour. Worth to know that the armour was covered with <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> of tunic form, open at the sides and so usually belted, usually emblazoned with coats of arms, known as tabard. Uncomfortable great helms went out of use, replaced with first visored bascinets, typically fitted with an aventail and hinged visor.|$|E
25|$|Her <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> was {{a bright}} colored plaid worsted cloak {{reaching}} to within about six inches of the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit {{at the side of}} the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag — I couldn't tell which — was hidden by the ample folds of the garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.|$|E

25|$|The jillayeh (the {{embroidered}} <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> for wedding costume) used in Bayt Dajan {{was quite}} {{similar to those of}} Ramallah. The difference was in decoration and embroidery. Typical for Bayt Dajan would be a motif consisting of two triangles, mirror-faced, with or without an embroidered stripe between them, and with inverted cypresses at the edges. A jillayeh from Bayt Dajan (c. 1920s) is exhibited at the British Museum. The caption notes that the dress would be worn by the bride at the final ritual of wedding week celebrations, a procession known as 'going to the well'. Accompanied by all the village women in their finest dress, the bride would go to the well to present a tray of sweets to the guardian of the well and fill her pitcher with water to ensure good fortune for her home. There are also several items from Bayt Dajan and the surrounding area is in the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection at Santa Fe, United States.|$|E

2500|$|... : A kimono-shaped robe worn by {{both men}} and women beneath the main <b>outer</b> <b>garment.</b> Since silk kimono are {{delicate}} and difficult to clean, the nagajuban helps to keep the outer kimono clean by preventing contact with the wearer's skin. Only the collar edge of the nagajuban shows from beneath the outer kimono. Many nagajuban have removable collars, to allow them to be changed to match the <b>outer</b> <b>garment,</b> and to be easily washed without washing the entire garment. While the most formal type of nagajuban are white, they are often as beautifully ornate and patterned as the outer kimono. Since men's kimono are usually fairly subdued in pattern and color, the nagajuban allows for discreetly wearing very striking designs and colors.|$|E

2500|$|Art is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a young female figure wearing a floor-length tunic underneath an intricately tied <b>outer</b> <b>garment,</b> which is pinned at her proper left shoulder with a fibula. The <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> is belted at the sculpture's upper and lower waist and is approximately two inches shorter than the tunic. The skirts of both the tunic and <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> fall towards {{the floor in a}} multitude of folds. It is crossed diagonally over her shoulder blades and loosely gathered on her proper right chest, exposing her neck and breastbone. The statue's hair is parted in the middle and pulled back from her face into a twisted bun, and a crown of laurel leaves is nestled atop her head. Her gaze is directed forwards and her features are idealized, like the other female figures of the sculpture group with the exception of Justice. In her proper left hand, she carries a round palette held down at her side, and in her proper right hand, a paintbrush held in front of her at waist height. She stands with her weight on both feet, with her proper right foot extended slightly forward of her proper left. There are several dots of an unknown black substance on the marble base underneath her feet, in front of her proper left foot. There is no discernible foundry mark or signature, but the statue is identified by the black label attached to the cement pedestal underneath her feet, which reads [...] "ART" [...] in gold lettering.|$|E
2500|$|Shiva [...] ( [...] , {{literally}} [...] "seven") is the week-long mourning {{period in}} Judaism for first-degree relatives: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, and spouse.

[...] This state lasts for seven days, during which family members traditionally gather in one home (preferably the home of the deceased) and receive visitors. At the funeral, mourners traditionally wear an <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> or ribbon that was torn at the funeral in a ritual known as keriah. This garment is worn throughout shiva.|$|E
2500|$|Colour {{plays an}} {{important}} role as well. Gold represents the radiance of Heaven; red, divine life. Blue is the color of human life, white is the Uncreated Light of God, only used for resurrection and transfiguration of Christ. If you look at icons of Jesus and Mary: Jesus wears red undergarment with a blue <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> (God become Human) and Mary wears a blue undergarment with a red overgarment (human was granted gifts by God), thus the doctrine of deification is conveyed by icons. [...] Letters are symbols too. Most icons incorporate some calligraphic text naming the person or event depicted. Even this is often presented in a stylized manner.|$|E

2500|$|A Tzitzit (alternatively spelled Ṣiṣit, plural: Tzitziyot or Ṣiṣiyot) is a knotted or braided tassel worn by observant Jews (both Karaite and Rabbinic) {{on each of}} {{the four}} corners of what is often an <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> or their Tallit.

[...] The [...] "charges" [...] (figures) of the arms are embroidered in gold on linen pieces, appliquéd onto coloured silk velvet fields. [...] It is vertically quilted, with wool stuffing and a silk satin lining. [...] This type of coat, originally worn out of sight under armour, was in fashion as an <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> from about 1360 until early the next century.

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the parade, [...] "Eros" [...] lowered {{enough to}} help a {{pregnant}} woman remove her <b>outer</b> <b>garment.</b> This last part represents the ceremony coming into full circle: the [...] "Clepsydra" [...] segment began with the image of the Minoan fertility goddess and is now ending with a pregnant woman representing the future of all humanity and history. With belly glowing, the woman moved into the lake of water as the stadium's lights dimmed and lights underneath the pool of water were turned on, thus creating an image of stars in a galaxy. According to Greek myth, the stars of the galaxy were born out of the milk of Hera's fertile breasts. In fact, the name for the Milky Way Galaxy, the home to planet Earth, was born out of this myth. Slowly the stars rose around the woman, and moved to form a rapidly rotating DNA double helix, which is the basis for all life on the planet. Humanity's attempt to understand itself, a theme that has been omnipresent throughout the entire ceremony beginning with the Cycladic head, is further reinforced by the representation of the DNA double helix, which symbolizes humanity's latest and most recent attempt to understand itself: the late 20th and early 21st centuries witnessed great advances in the field of genetics with the mapping of the human genome.|$|E

2500|$|... "One covereth {{violence}} {{with his}} garment": or, [...] "and violence covereth his garment," [...] or, it might be, {{in the same}} sense, [...] "he covereth his garment with violence" [...] , so that it cannot be hid, nor washed away, nor removed, but envelopes him and his garment; and that, to his shame and punishment. It was, as it were, [...] "an <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> of violence", as Asaph says in Psalm 73:6, [...] "violence covereth them as a garment;" [...] or David in Psalm 109:18, [...] "he clothed himself with cursing as with a garment." [...] It was like a garment with [...] "fretting leprosy," [...] unclean and making unclean, to be burned with fire. Leviticus 13:47-58. Contrariwise, the redeemed saints had Revelation 7:14 [...] "washed their robes and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb." [...] Having declared God's hatred of this their doing, he sums {{up in the same}} words, but more briefly; [...] "and this being so, ye shall take heed to your spirit, and not deal treacherously." [...] Maurer translates, [...] "And (Jehovah hateth him who) covereth his garment (that is, his wife, in Arabic idiom; compare Genesis 20:16, 'He is to thee a covering of thy eyes'; the husband was so to the wife, and the wife to the husband; also Deuteronomy 22:30; Ruth 3:9; Ezekiel 16:8) with injury." [...] The Hebrew favors [...] "garment," [...] being accusative of the thing covered (as in Psalm 73:6). Their [...] "violence" [...] is the putting away of their wives; the [...] "garment" [...] with which they try to cover it is the plea of Moses' permission (Deuteronomy 24:1; compare Matthew 19:6-9).|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} opinions concerning {{the origin of the}} pallium. [...] Some trace it to an investiture by Constantine I (or one of his successors); others consider it an imitation of the Hebrew ephod, the humeral garment of the High Priest. Others declare that its origin is traceable to a mantle of St. Peter, which was symbolic of his office as supreme pastor. A fourth hypothesis finds its origin in a liturgical mantle, used by the early popes, which over time was folded into the shape of a band; a fifth says its origin dates from the custom of folding the ordinary mantle-pallium, an <b>outer</b> <b>garment</b> in use in imperial times; a sixth declares that it was introduced as a papal liturgical garment (which, however, was not at first a narrow strip of cloth, but as the name suggests, a broad, oblong, and folded cloth). There is no solid evidence tracing the pallium to an investiture of the emperor, the ephod of the Jewish High Priest, or a fabled mantle of St. Peter. It may well be that it was introduced as a liturgical badge of the pope, or that it was adopted in imitation of its counterpart, the pontifical omophor, already in vogue in the Eastern Church. It was bestowed on papal vicars (like the bishop of Arles, who represented the pope in the regions of Gaul) and other bishops with exclusive links to the Apostolic See. Also in this rank were missionaries sent with papal approval to organise the church among newly converted peoples. St. Augustine of Canterbury in seventh-century England and St. Boniface in eighth-century Germany fell into this category.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{called his}} {{garments}} [...] "my honor." [...] Rabbi Aha bar Abba said in Rabbi Johanan's name that [...] "And he shall put off his garments, {{and put on}} other garments," [...] teaches that a change of garments {{is an act of}} honor in the Torah. And the School of Rabbi Ishmael taught that the Torah teaches us manners: In the garments in which one cooked a dish for one's master, one should not pour a cup of wine for one's master. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba said in Rabbi Johanan's name that it is a disgrace for a scholar {{to go out into the}} marketplace with patched shoes. The Gemara objected that Rabbi Aha bar Hanina went out that way; Rabbi Aha son of Rav Nachman clarified that the prohibition is of patches upon patches. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba also said in Rabbi Johanan's name that any scholar who has a grease stain on a garment is worthy of death, for Wisdom says in [...] "All they that hate me ( [...] , mesanne'ai) love (merit) death," [...] and we should read not , mesanne'ai, but , masni'ai (that make me hated, that is, despised). Thus a scholar who has no pride in personal appearance brings contempt upon learning. Ravina taught that this was stated about a thick patch (or others say, a bloodstain). The Gemara harmonized the two opinions by teaching that one referred to an <b>outer</b> <b>garment,</b> the other to an undergarment. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba also said in Rabbi Johanan's name that in [...] "As my servant Isaiah walked naked and barefoot," [...] "naked" [...] means in worn-out garments, and [...] "barefoot" [...] means in patched shoes.|$|E
