5|$|Roaring Brook is {{the largest}} {{tributary}} of the Lackawanna River. It is a third-order stream. Its headwaters are situated immediately {{to the west of}} the watershed of the Lehigh River. Forested land comprises 70 percent of the watershed's upper reaches. 20 percent is agricultural land and 10 percent is developed. Some abandoned mine land occurs in the watershed as well. <b>Other</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> include high-density residential land and downtown commercial land. Major roads in the watershed include Interstate 380, Interstate 84, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. South Washington Avenue is located near the stream's mouth. The University of Scranton is located near the stream.|$|E
5|$|There {{are large}} areas of {{agricultural}} land in the middle reaches of the watershed of Little Catawissa Creek, {{but most of the}} agricultural operations in the watershed are relatively small. The main areas of residential development in the watershed are the communities of Aristes and Ringtown. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has issued four mining permits in the watershed of the creek. All of these permits are for mining on a ridge on the northern edge of the watershed. There are a number of <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> in the creek's watershed.

However, forests and <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> are also present, and some pockets of development occur in the creek's valley. The creek causes flooding in the southern part of Union Township. A number of bridges have been constructed across Silver Creek.

25|$|The beaver (genus Castor) is a large, {{primarily}} nocturnal, semiaquatic rodent. Castor {{includes two}} extant species, the North American beaver (Castor canadensis) (native to North America) and Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) (Eurasia). Beavers {{are known for}} building dams, canals, and lodges (homes). They are the second-largest rodent in the world (after the capybara). Their colonies create one or more dams to provide still, deep water to protect against predators, and to float food and building material. The North American beaver population was once more than 60 million, but as of 1988 was 6–12 million. This population decline {{is the result of}} extensive hunting for fur, for glands used as medicine and perfume, and because the beavers' harvesting of trees and flooding of waterways may interfere with <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses.</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose Village landscapes, which {{integrate}} small-scale agriculture with housing, forestry {{and a host}} of <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>use</b> practices, {{cover more}} than 2 × 106 km 2 across China.

2500|$|The {{dispossession}} and liquidation of Japanese-Canadian property {{began in}} April 1942, when Ian Mackenzie asked {{the head of}} the Soldier Settlement Board, [...] Thomas A. Crerar, and administrative head, Gordon Murchison, to look into taking over Japanese Canadian farms for the Veteran’s Land Act program, which was not yet law. They undertook a survey of the farms, but their survey metrics were flawed. They used measures from the Depression Era, when property values were low, did not take into account current crops or <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses,</b> and discounted the value of buildings by 70%. In June 1942, Order in Council PC 5523 authorized Crerar to buy or lease Japanese Canadian farms without consulting their owners. Because of this, 572 farms were sold for $841,225, substantially less than their assessed value of $1,239,907.|$|E
2500|$|Borlaug {{continually}} advocated increasing {{crop yields}} {{as a means}} to curb deforestation. The large role he played in both increasing crop yields and promoting this view has led to this methodology being called by agricultural economists the [...] "Borlaug hypothesis", namely that increasing the productivity of agriculture on the best farmland can help control deforestation by reducing the demand for new farmland. According to this view, assuming that global food demand is on the rise, restricting crop usage to traditional low-yield methods would also require {{at least one of the}} following: the world population to decrease, either voluntarily or as a result of mass starvations; or the conversion of forest land into crop land. It is thus argued that high-yield techniques are ultimately saving ecosystems from destruction. On a global scale, this view holds strictly true ceteris paribus, if deforestation only occurs to increase land for agriculture. But <b>other</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> exist, such as urban areas, pasture, or fallow, so further research is necessary to ascertain what land has been converted for what purposes, to determine how true this view remains. Increased profits from high-yield production may also induce cropland expansion in any case, although as world food needs decrease, this expansion may decrease as well.|$|E
