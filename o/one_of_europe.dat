Mayerne was part of a vast network of highly educated Calvinists dispersed across Europe and constantly in communication with one another. Like many of his correspondents, he had also benefited from his education in Calvinist institutions, which were uniquely open to diverse medical theories. The service which he could render with the knowledge he accumulated was in demand across religious divides, so that he did not depend for his protection exclusively on Calvinist dignitaries. Mayerne was regarded as the foremost European physician of his day, and was attentive to his image: he was frequently portrayed holding skull as an emblem of his profession...|$|E

IPREG is an established "network of networks" encompassing researchers, policy makers and business people in twelve countries: Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and UK. The initial stage of the project was to map out the current policies and actors in each country and to develop a comprehensiveness index based upon interviews and survey feedback. This work would then facilitate the diverse debates that occur regarding the production and evaluation of research on policy and policy making in different contexts within Europe. It was envisaged that the scientific impact of the project actions would be the construction of a tanglible knowledge base on the size, function and efficiency of the European " support industry" {{and the development of a}} structure for further research on the evaluation and implementaion of growth policies...|$|E
40|$|Lone Scherfig was {{the first}} of a number of women {{directors}} to take up the challenge of Dogme, the back-to-basics, manifesto-based, rule-governed, and now globalized film initiative introduced by Danish filmmakers Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg in 1995. Entitled Italiensk for begyndere (Italian for Beginners), Scherfig 2 ̆ 7 s Dogme film transformed this already accomplished filmmaker into <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> 2 ̆ 7 s most noteworthy women directors. Danish and international critics lavished praise on Scherfig and her film, and their reactions harmonized with those of festival juries.

40|$|Over centuries {{dramatic}} changes {{have occurred in}} the species composition of the Wadden Sea, a shallow coastal sea bordering the North Sea. Natural dynamics as well as direct and indirect anthropogenic influences have resulted in the introduction and the disappearance of important benthic populations. Historic records and extensive surveys show large variability in benthic suspension-feeder stocks. Infaunal species like the cockle (Cerastoderma edule) are extremely variable over time and space, hence shows a typical resilient response. Mussel (Mytilus edulis) beds seem to be more stable over time. Once lost, mussel beds need more time to re-establish bed structures. It is hypothesized that infaunal populations have a high resilience, while epifauna species are characterized by resistance to changes as they form structures like reefs or beds. On the basis of this hypothesis the consequences of new introductions can be evaluated. It can be expected that the recent introduction of the resistant reef-building epifaunal Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, will lead to shifts in benthic suspension-feeder populations and eventually will develop a new stable state for the Wadden Sea that potentially offers less food for birds. This situation may deviate considerably from the actual nature conservation objectives that focus {{on the role of the}} Wadden Sea as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> s most important wetlands for migratory bird population...|$|E

40|$|Although Byron's {{popularity}} {{has been growing}} in recent years, his writings have a greater significance than has usually been attributed to them. A study of the biographies and articles written about him shows that ihe importance of Byron's influence on the political thought {{of the nineteenth century}} has been seriously neglected. It is my aim, in the following chapters, to discuss the political theories which Byron held and to estimate the influence they had on Europe. To present a proper background, it has been necessary to paint a sketchy account of eighteenth-century Europe and a slightly more detailed <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> between the outbreak of the French Revolution and Byron's departure for Italy in 1816. In doing this, not only have the historical events been given, but those ideas which were formulating {{in the minds of the}} English witers, philosophers, and politicians of the Revolutionary period have also been incorporated. The main body of this study, however, is concerned with the political beliefs of Byron, and here I have turned almost exclusively to the pages of Byron's poetry and letters. As so many other people have done, I have been content, as far as it was possible, to let Byron speak for himself...|$|E

Australia's cultural identity, however, due to the immigrant past of its very diverse population, have had to be invented from scratch during the past two centuries, and the process of its formation continues to these days. This gives us an exceptional opportunity to study the processes of cultural identity construction in an almost direct transmission. Based on the bibliographical research, the thesis assumes that the roots can be identified in the following areas: (1) cultural traditions of the Australian Aboriginal societies, (2) recent cultural stereotypes that emerged during the past two centuries, and (3) specific natural and climatic conditions coupled with the presence of unique animal and plant species. This thesis will focus on the broadest, yet most significant area: Aboriginal culture in both its past and present state, and on its existence within the context of contemporary Australian society. The area of contemporary cultural stereotypes, of which many are related to Aboriginal cultural tradition, will also be briefly discussed. Australian [...] ...|$|E

Students met and spoke with ecologists and engineers about the history, importance, and goals of this project.

Students trekked through parts of the river that have been restored to a natural environment, parts that are in the process of being restored, and parts that still, after 100 years operate under the open sewage system.

40|$|Sturgeons {{belong to}} one of the oldest {{families}} of bony fish in existence, having their first appearance in the fossil records approximately 200 million years ago. Their natural habitats are found in the subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. In the Romanian waters, five anadromous species of sturgeon, out of the total 25 species known by science, once migrated from the Black Sea into the Danube for spawning: beluga; Huso huso, Russian sturgeon; Acipenser gueldenstaedtii, stellate sturgeon; A. stellatus, ship sturgeon; A. nudiventris and the European Atlantic sturgeon; A. sturio (Knight, 2009). The NW Black Sea and Lower Danube River sturgeons, like many Acipenserids, were seriously affected by the rapid changes brought by human development. Being one of the finest caviar producers in the world they were intensively harvested for many centuries. Heavy uncontrolled fishing and destruction of habitat led to the collapse of most of the Acipenserids and the total disappearance of the European Atlantic sturgeon (A. sturio) from the NW Black Sea. Public attention was focused world wide on sturgeons after their listing in the IUCN Red List of Threatened species in 1996. In 1998, after evaluating their abundance in the wild, CITES also decided to strictly regulate the international trade in all Acipenserids. The paper aims to analyze and review conservation measures that were taken locally, nationally and internationally by humans and the effect they had on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> 9 ̆ 2 s only naturally reproducing sturgeon populations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain why the two {{neighbouring}} Nordic countries Norway and Denmark, despite many political and cultural similarities, have had very different legal frameworks regulating pornography. Denmark was the first country in the world legalizing both literary (1967) and pictorial pornography (1969). Norway, on the other hand, to this date has had <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>Europe</b> s strictest regulations, and legalized hardcore pornography as late as in 2006. Through combining the method of most similar designs with process tracing, this paper makes a historical comparative analysis of the political development leading to the different legislative outcomes. The paper argues that there are several reasons why the countries legislations represent opposite ends of the spectre in Europe. First, Christian conservative values have been much more widespread in Norway than in Denmark, as seen by an influential Christian Conservative party and massive popular resistance against liberalization in the four decades after World War 2. Second, Feminist groups in particular, but also Christian organizations and others mobilized massively against legalization in the 1970 s and 1980 s, contributing to keeping up strict regulations. Third, early legalization was to a much larger extent in Denmark than in Norway supported by the rulings of the court system. Fourth, prominent Danish intellectuals also contributed to a more liberal attitude in the public opinion, while liberal intellectuals in Norway met harsh resistance from other intellectuals and the public in general. The legalization in Norway came only after society, much as a result of influence from abroad, as a whole gradually had changed its attitude towards pornography.
