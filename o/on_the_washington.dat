5|$|Canterbury Castle was {{designed}} by Jeter O. Frye and constructed between 1929 and 1931. Immediately following construction, Frye was unable {{to sell the house}} and left Portland in bankruptcy to resume his career in California. Visitors immediately showed interest in touring the house. The castle attracted paying tourists and school groups, became a stop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> Park bus tour and hosted Halloween parties for a local radio station. The house became known as Canterbury Castle over time due to the plat and name of the street on which it was situated. The terraced garden was eliminated in the 1950s when a portion of the land was sold. The property was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under the ownership of Dale and Karen Bernards, who had submitted an application for listing one year prior.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the removal}} of the reactor in October 2008, the {{university}} proposed demolishing the structure and redeveloping the site for other uses. The plan was stopped after the reactor building was placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Washington</b> Heritage Register, the state's list of historic buildings, a designation that was contested by the University of Washington. Preservationists suggested re-using the building as a museum dedicated to the state's nuclear history and continuing research. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, based on an application from UW architecture student Abby Inpanbutr (then Abby Martin) submitted in spring 2008.|$|E
