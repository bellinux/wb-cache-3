30|$|The {{volume of}} {{haemorrhage}} {{was chosen to}} mimic the clinical scenario with a life-threatening haemorrhage in which early transfusion of blood products have been suggested to be beneficial [2]. Based on the high mortality both prior to resuscitation and after resuscitation, the high lactate values and low central venous oxygen saturation prior to resuscitation, we conclude that the model fulfilled our objective. The observation that blood pressure was not normalized following resuscitation to a normal blood volume suggests that the haemorrhage caused a systemic inflammatory reaction with decreased vascular resistance and/or decreased cardiac contractility [18]. This is also supported by <b>our</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> increase in plasma concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α after haemorrhage.|$|R

40|$|A {{principal}} goal of {{this work}} is to determine connectivity in cultured neuronal networks as they mature {{so that we can}} understand the relationship between connectivity and behavior in biologically generated neuronal net-works.

Recently, x-ray grating interferometers were developed that extend {{the possibility of}} phase-contrast imaging from highly brilliant radiation sources like third-generation synchrotron sources to non-coherent conventional x-ray tube sources. Here, we present the first installation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> three grating x-ray interferometer at a low-coherence wiggler source at the beamline W 2 (HARWI II) operated by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht at the second-generation synchrotron storage ring DORIS (DESY, Hamburg, Germany). Using this type of the wiggler insertion device with a millimeter-sized source allows monochromatic phase-contrast imaging of centimeter sized objects with high photon flux. Thus, biological and materials-science imaging applications can highly profit from this imaging modality. The specially designed grating interferometer currently works in the photon energy range from 22 to 30 keV, and the range will be increased by using adapted x-ray optical gratings. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> energy-dependent visibility measurement in comparison to corresponding simulations demonstrate {{the performance of the}} new setup...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{emergence}} of the West Nile virus (WNV) in the northeastern United States has drawn emphasis {{to the need for}} expanded arbovirus surveillance in Connecticut. Although the state <b>of</b> Connecticut began <b>a</b> comprehensive mosquito-screening program in 1997, only since 1999 have there been efforts to determine the prevalence of arboviruses in bird populations in this state. Herein, we report on <b>our</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> arbovirus survey <b>of</b> 1, 704 bird brains. Included in this report are the first known isolations of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) from crows and data on the geographic and temporal distribution of 1, 092 WNV isolations from crow species. Moreover, these nine isolations of EEEV identify regions of Connecticut where the virus is rarely found. With the exception of WNV and EEEV, no other arboviruses were isolated or detected. Taken together, these data illustrate the distribution of avian borne EEEV and WNV in 2000 and support the need for ongoing avian arbovirus surveillance in Connecticut...|$|R

In this paper we introduce a new parallel algorithm that both is work efficient and has small constant but sacrifices logarithmic time; it achieves only an O(log 2 n) time.

In this article, we examine the specific requirements for key management schemes to be used in ALM-based distribution systems and analyze existing key management approaches with respect to these requirements [1], [2], [3]. Based on the results of this analysis, we design a new key management scheme that combines ideas of the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) protocol [4], [5] and the Iolus approach [6]. We compare the resulting scheme to a simple approach that is based on pairwise keys between neighboring nodes without further keyhierarchy based optimization and that serves as a benchmark. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comparative simulation study clearly indicate the suitability of our scheme for ALM-based live-streaming.

40|$|Conservation areas (CAs) {{are among}} the most {{restrictive}} English planning policies. Designation implies a significant limitation of owners’ control over the shape and appearance of their properties. The policy, however, can also be argued to solve a sort of ‘prisoners’ dilemma’, in which it might be collectively rationale to preserve the character of an area, but an individual homeowner may be tempted to inappropriately alter their property, thus free-riding on nearby properties’ character. The net-benefit of the policy depends largely on the existence of positive ‘heritage effects’ and acknowledgement from homeowners that policy contributes to neighbourhood stability and the preservation of these positive effects. <b>Our</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mixed-method analysis of close to 1 million property transactions near to about 8000 CAs and 111 interviews with residents in nine representative CAs in Greater London suggest that positive heritage externalities exist and that residents in CAs tend to value their local environments, acknowledge the need for planning control and execute their right to object to neighbour’s planning request...|$|E
