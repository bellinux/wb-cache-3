5|$|A one-off golden replica trophy was {{commissioned}} by the Premier League thereafter; it was awarded to Arsenal before their first home game of the following season. The team eclipsed the league record of 42 matches without defeat (set by Nottingham Forest) against Blackburn Rovers and went seven more matches unbeaten until they lost – away to Manchester United in October 2004. Although Arsenal regained the FA Cup – on penalties against United – they finished second to Chelsea in the league. The move to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 coincided with a transitional phase for the club. Several experienced first teamers were displaced in favour <b>of</b> <b>youth</b> <b>and</b> the style of football shifted more towards ball retention. Arsenal have since failed to regain the league title; they nevertheless remain a fixture in the Champions League under Wenger's stewardship as of 2016.|$|E
