5|$|While in Kuwait, Manning {{was placed}} on suicide watch after her {{behavior}} caused concern. She was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on July 29, 2010, and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury (POI) status. POI status is one stop short of suicide watch, entailing checks by guards every five minutes. Her lawyer, David Coombs, a former military attorney, said Manning {{was not allowed to}} sleep between 5 am (7 am on weekends) and 8 pm, and was made to stand <b>or</b> <b>sit</b> up if she tried to. She was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into her mattress, and a blanket designed not to be shredded. Manning complained that she regarded it as pretrial punishment.|$|E
5|$|The churches {{had three}} aisles, divided by wooden columns, often solomonic columns, carved with twisted fluting {{resembling}} those at St. Peter's baldachin in St Peter's, Rome. Until modern times, {{there were no}} pews so the congregation had to kneel <b>or</b> <b>sit</b> on the floor. A variety of fine pieces of art adorn {{the inside of the}} churches, notably their altars, which are sometimes covered in gold, silver or mica. Especially remarkable are the pulpits made of brightly painted wood and supported by carved sirens. The pulpit in the church of San Miguel de Velasco features motifs derived from local vegetation. Elements specific to the Chiquitos missions exist also in other decorations. The altars of the churches of San Xavier and Concepción include depictions of notable Jesuits together with indigenous peoples. There remain a handful of original sculptures in retablos often depicting Madonnas, the crucifixion, and saints, carved in wood and then painted. These sculptures exhibit a style unique to the Chiquitos region, differing from that of the reductions in Paraguay or the Bolivian highlands. The tradition of figure carving has been preserved to the present day in workshops where carvers make columns, finials and windows for new or restored churches or chapels in the area. In addition, carvers produce decorative angels and other figures for the tourist market.|$|E

25|$|The {{circular}} or polygonal form lent {{itself to}} those buildings within church complexes that perform a function {{in which it}} is desirable for people to stand, <b>or</b> <b>sit</b> around, with a centralised focus, rather than an axial one. In Italy the circular or polygonal form was used throughout the medieval period for baptisteries, while in England it was adapted for chapter houses. In France the aisled polygonal plan was adapted as the eastern terminal and in Spain the same form is often used as a chapel.|$|E
25|$|The jungle gym, {{also known}} as monkey bars or {{climbing}} frame, {{is a piece of}} playground equipment made of many pieces of thin material, such as metal pipe or, in more current playgrounds, rope, on which children can climb, hang, <b>or</b> <b>sit.</b> The monkey bar designation was for the resemblance that playing children had to the rambunctious, climbing play of monkeys, though the term nowadays often refers specifically to a single row of overhead bars designed to be swung across. The jungle gym was invented and patented by Sebastian Hinton of Chicago in 1920.|$|E

In some Bara villages, it is forbidden {{to carry a}} load alone; {{at least two people}} must carry it together. A common prohibition throughout Bara communities forbids serving food or drink to someone with the utensils, plates or cups that were used to serve another. It is also fady to step over someone seated or lying on the ground, lift or carry an item over another person's head or body, brush another person with one's lamba, <b>or</b> <b>sit</b> on or lean against another's bed.|$|E

In January 1890 he {{went from}} Allahabad to Ghazipur and met Pavhari Baba, an Advaita Vedanta ascetic who {{spent much of his}} time in meditation. At the time he {{suffered}} from lumbago, and it was becoming impossible for him to move <b>or</b> <b>sit</b> in meditation. After meeting Baba, Narendra wanted to become his disciple and Baba asked him to stay a few more days at Ghazipur. However, the night before his initiation Narendra had a dream in which Ramakrishna looked at him with a melancholy face. This dream convinced Narendra that no one other than Ramakrishna could be his teacher, and he abandoned the idea of becoming Baba's disciple.|$|E
25|$|After 1900, {{around the}} time of his father's death, Ryder's {{creativity}} fell dramatically. For {{the rest of his life}} he spent his artistic energy on occasionally re-working existing paintings, some of which lay scattered about his New York apartment. Visitors to Ryder's home were struck by his slovenly habits—he never cleaned, and his floor was covered with trash, plates with old food, and a thick layer of dust, and he would have to clear space for visitors to stand <b>or</b> <b>sit.</b> He was shy and did not seek the company of others, but received company courteously and enjoyed telling stories or talking about his art. He gained a reputation as a loner, but he maintained social contacts, enjoyed writing letters, and continued to travel on occasion to visit friends.|$|E
25|$|Eton Society: {{commonly}} known as Pop. Over the years its power and privileges have grown. Pop is the oldest self-electing society at Eton. The rules were altered in 1987 and again in 2005 so that the new intake are not elected solely by the existing year and a committee of masters. Members of Pop are entitled to wear checked spongebag trousers, and a waistcoat designed as they wish. Historically, only members of Pop were entitled to furl their umbrellas <b>or</b> <b>sit</b> on the wall on the Long Walk, {{in front of the}} main building. However, this tradition has died out. They perform roles at many of the routine events of the school year, including School Plays, parents' evenings and other official events.

500|$|On his {{way back}} from Rome Æthelwulf again stayed with King Charles the Bald, and may have joined him on a {{campaign}} against a Viking warband. On 1 October 856 Æthelwulf married Charles's daughter, Judith, aged 12 or 13, at Verberie. The marriage was considered extraordinary by contemporaries and by modern historians. Carolingian princesses rarely married and were usually sent to nunneries, {{and it was almost}} unknown for them to marry foreigners. Judith was crowned queen and anointed by Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims. Although empresses had been anointed before, this is the first definitely known anointing of a Carolingian queen. In addition West Saxon custom, described by Asser as [...] "perverse and detestable", was that the wife of a king of Wessex could not be called queen <b>or</b> <b>sit</b> on the throne with her husband– she was just the king's wife.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of the Petition by the House of Lords, Charles sent a message to the Commons [...] "forbidding them to meddle with affairs of state", something that produced a furious debate. John Finch, the Speaker of the House of Commons, announced that he had been commanded to interrupt any Member of Parliament who should insult or cast aspersion on a Minister of State, such as the Duke of Buckingham. This produced a [...] "spectacle of passions" [...] in the House; the tradition of free speech within the Commons was a long one, and many MPs found themselves [...] "unable to speak for tears running down their faces at the thought of the destruction of the liberties of Parliament". Coke, although crying, declared {{that he did not know}} whether he would be allowed to speak in Parliament again, but named Buckingham anyway, saying that [...] "the Duke of Buckingham is the cause of all our miseries, and till the King be informed thereof we shall never go out with honour, <b>or</b> <b>sit</b> with honour here; that man is the grievance of grievances; let us set down the cause of all our disasters and they will reflect upon him".|$|E

500|$|However, {{dolphins}} {{in these}} areas can also coexist with humans. For example, {{in the town of}} Laguna in south Brazil, a pod of bottlenose dolphins resides in the estuary, and some of its members cooperate with humans. [...] These cooperating dolphins are individually recognized by the local fishermen, who name them. [...] The fishermen typically stand up to their knees in the shallow waters <b>or</b> <b>sit</b> in canoes, waiting for the dolphins. Now and then, one or more dolphins appear, driving the fish towards the line of fishermen. [...] One dolphin then displays a unique body movement outside the water, which serves as a signal to the fishermen to cast their nets (the entire sequence is shown here, and {{a detailed description of the}} signal's characteristics is available here). [...] In this unique form of cooperation, the dolphins gain because the fish are disoriented and because the fish cannot escape to shallow water where the larger dolphins cannot swim. Likewise, studies show that fishermen casting their nets following the unique signal catch more fish than when fishing alone, without the help of the dolphins. [...] The dolphins were not trained for this behavior; the collaboration began before 1847. Similar cooperative fisheries also exist in Mauritania, Africa.|$|E
500|$|In January 1967 Peng {{was taken}} to his first [...] "struggle session", {{in which he was}} paraded in chains before several {{thousand}} jeering Red Guards, wearing a large paper dunce cap and with a wooden board hung from his neck, on which his [...] "crimes" [...] were written. In the fall Peng was held at a PLA military prison outside of Beijing, and was allowed to receive extra clothing. In July Mao and Lin Biao, cooperating with Jiang Qing's faction, ordered the PLA to form an [...] "investigation group" [...] to determine Peng's [...] "crimes", so that Peng could be more thoroughly humiliated in future struggle sessions. Peng's jailers attempted to force Peng to confess that he was a [...] "great warlord", a [...] "great ambitionist", and a [...] "great conspirator" [...] who had [...] "crept into the Party and the Army". Peng refused to confess to these accusations or to [...] "surrender to the masses", so his jailers strapped Peng to the floor of an unlit cell, and did not allow him to stand <b>or</b> <b>sit</b> up, drink water, rise to go to the toilet, or move in his sleep for several days. After Peng still refused to [...] "confess", his jailers began routinely beating him, breaking several ribs, injuring his back, and damaging his internal organs, especially his lungs. Peng's violent [...] "interrogations" [...] lasted over ten hours a day, but his interrogators were replaced every two hours in order to keep them from developing any sympathy for Peng (a practice pioneered by Stalinist secret police in the 1930s). Peng was [...] "interrogated" [...] in this way over 130 times. During interrogations he shouted denials to the Red Guards who beat him, and it is reputed that he pounded the table so hard that the cell walls shook.|$|E
