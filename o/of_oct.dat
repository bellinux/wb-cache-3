2500|$|January, 2005, Canada [...] British Columbia Paramedics {{have since}} been {{identified}} as Micheal McGregor and Darren Lam who subsequent to a Taser incident reported to be Torture, testified to a surviving victim by way of writing replies to the victim using only their badge numbers to identify who they are. [...] Both have testified they had already arrived in an BC Emergency Services ambulance parked outside a student-residence at 1816 Fairhurst Avenue, {{where they had been}} advised a [...] "22 year old male" [...] would waiting outside for their ambulance to transport a [...] "22 year old male friend" [...] to a local hospital for laboratory toxicology testing. [...] 911 had been called by Todd Halpen, who has also testified to the surviving victim's mother. [...] Todd did not reside at that address though he called 911 from his own cell phone outside. [...] Todd advised he had delivered pizza with mushrooms to his friend there four days earlier. [...] Todd identified himself as captain of a U.Vic. men's varsity team, who was also a part-time pizza-delivery business employee. [...] Todd had delivered the pizza there to his friend Micheal Leon (also 22 years old) who had arrived from Brampton, Ontario, and gathered several friends together, as he was in process of moving out to other housing. [...] Todd said they would be waiting outside with his cell phone as they wanted to talk to paramedics about some possible toxicology remaining from eating mushrooms. [...] Todd had already told the paramedics answering his call that he had eaten the same mushrooms [...] "at least 20 times" [...] suffering no adverse effects, but believed he had developed a [...] "tolerance" [...] yet [...] "his friend" [...] was worried about a possible allergic reaction remaining from mushrooms or possibly contaminated mushrooms. [...] Arriving there, unable to identify which one of the two [...] "22 year old males" [...] was reporting the anxiety about mushroom [...] "toxicology" [...] - which they failed to specify as to species, or whether processed or cooked adequately for food-safety, a paramedic called the Saanich Police from inside the ambulance. [...] A voice from the Ambulance stated police assistance was needed to get [...] "a 22 year old male who was still acting out, who took mushrooms there at that address on Saturday". [...] Constables Shane Coughlan and Paul Luhowy, arrived while the paramedics both waited inside the ambulance, evidently further confused by the paramedic's brief and misleading request for assistance. [...] The paramedics have testified the constables did not speak further to them - and ignored both Todd and Micheal though they saw two young men outside. [...] The police proceeded then going inside the residence where no traces of pizza or mushrooms could be found, and no one was home who had actually eaten the suspect pizza. [...] Todd had advised the paramedics he did not think the person at home there had a phone inside - he thought the landlord had not provided a landline contact number, and he only had returned with one of his friends who had eaten the mushrooms the previous Saturday. [...] The 6 separate student room-units inside were all rented other University of Victoria students - none of whom were [...] "22 years old". [...] None renting the property had eaten the suspect pizza or suffered any illness or reported any possible poisoning because of what Todd had delivered there the previous Saturday. [...] Only one 20-year-old student was home in his room - he had just undressed to take a shower when two constables burst into his bedroom. [...] Arriving thus confused by mis-communication of the paramedics, and their own over-zealous assumptions - Cst. Shane Couglan and Paul Luhowy began questioning that 20-year-old student insisting he had to take the ambulance to a hospital, while the student waited on his bed, aware that he had no personal need to do so. [...] Receiving no explanation, fully aware that police are required to provide an allegation of crime, when making an arrest, the student waited on his bed to be told where he was being taken - desiring to call his parents or a lawyer or at least his landlord - he was restricted by the four offices so he could not reach his prescription glasses or his cell phone. [...] He was subsequently accused informally of [...] "resisting an arrest under the BC Mental Health Act" [...] by the Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner in 2006, in relation to his own complaint of Torture filed upon the direction his parents received while caring for him as directed by the Governor General's office of Canada in 2005. [...] At the time, in January 2005 - [...] Cst. Shane Coughlan and Cst. Paul Luhowy felt bothered by what they regarded as [...] "resistance" [...] to taking an non-emergency called ambulance to an emergency hospital department, evident only to them in 20-year-old student who knew ER departments are needed for patients who really are at risk of dying - and that he did not need laboratory testing, and was fully insured and assessed as [...] "very healthy" [...] under Alberta Health Care and privately insured to live there peacefully - while the police failed to advise any reason for insisting the residence be evacuted by him so suddenly without any reason given, nor warning, Cst. Luhowy called for further assistance from Cst. Douglas Cripps and Paul Douglas. [...] Immediately when the 4 constables were all gathered around the 20-year-old student sitting on his bed - in that student's bedroom - where the student had nothing more than a pillow to throw - all four constables attacked and assaulted him several times, dragging him onto the floor [...] "hog-tied" [...] while Douglas Cripps applied his TASER in a [...] "touch-stun" [...] capacity shooting amperage full-force into the 20 year old's leg and lower back five times in rapid succession. [...] Only then were the paramedics called inside, who took the nearly murdered student in restraints to a hospital from out of his bedroom naked. [...] All the authorities involving themselves, to interfere with the innocent student, then abandoned any duty to return ex-post facto to required legal process to identify themselves or the student. [...] They left all the student's property all abandoned incluscive of his Canadian Passport and ID leaving his bedroom and the entire home open to further theft and fraudulent use and vandalism. [...] The 20-year old's computer and cell phone were thereafter found with his passport on his desk by his parents who were called by a by-stander neighbour who reported their son had evidently been kidnapped. [...] While the cell phone found, was indeed the one the student and his mother had contracted with Telus.ca to use - it had certainly not been used to call 911 - his computer was found to have suffered hacking and virus contamination, but it remained undetermined whether anyone had taken their credit-card information. [...] His mother's credit card was also found in the student's wallet on the desk - which by mutual agreement she had given her son for pre-authorized use if he'd needed new contact lenses or any other medical services or groceries or books for his studies at U.Vic. [...] And some time later, that credit card number was also found to have suffered a fraudulent attempt to reserve a hotel room and UBER car rental in Europe - by neither of them. [...] As of May 2017, all this unwarranted, illegal, private-property invading use of a TASER to commit Torture and fraudulent extortion by kidnapping, has been testified of by the student who states he barely survived it - escaping BC with his mother's help and recovering in care of their family doctor H.Duvel MD, who disagnosed [...] "Post Taser Attack PTSD" [...] together with Dr. Philip Klemks, MD who also testified for the surviving student's mother. [...] The diagnosis of [...] "post-Taser Attack PTSD" [...] was reported to Revenue Canada, as being disabling after the televised view of the homocide of Robert Dziekanski was so ruled by a British Columbia coroner in 2007. [...] The student had to be rescued by his parents to recover in Alberta - was moved there {{as soon as he was}} released from the Royal Jubilee Hospital voluntarily. [...] His mother is Alison Beil, plaintiff in Federal Court, and her witnesses testimonies were recorded on CD at Edmonton Alberta Federal Tax Court May 16, 2017. [...] Judge Hogan reserved time to consider the mother's claim for tax-credits, as her son's care-giver. [...] The author of this report, at the time of the incident in 2005, was a grad-student hopeful of residing in the same student residence as one room had been advised available. [...] The intention was of applying to University of Victoria to transfer into the Faculty of Law or Education there for further Graduate studies as acknowledge by the Landlord for the student who was assaulted and his mother. [...] His mother has claimed tax-credits due to loss suffered of $60,000 invested in their educations, property rental agreement, and to legally investigate the mis-doings of Canada's and BC's public Safety authorities, and grossly negiglent failures - failures to provide any warning, nor recognition of their human rights and Citizenship rights and status - while permitting the importation of TASERS from Taser International Inc, into Canada, without any liability insurance for police error and USA based prejudices, false advertising and promotion of police carrying a concealed, prohibited weapon, into a private home and bedroom legally leased to herself also for post-graduate studies, Canadian (Alberta Teacher Association) visiting student residence.
