The First Bosnian-Serb Calendar for the Common Year 1869 (Први босанско-српски календар за просту годину 1869), consisting of 58 pages, was edited by Jovan R. Džinić. In Serbian tradition, calendars contained more than just calendarical data and were also popular literary and educational almanacs. Džinić's calendar had more <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>educational,</b> rather than literary, character.|$|E

Meetings are generally organised annually either under the patronage <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>educational</b> institution or sports club, or by a group or business that serves as the meeting promoter. In the case of the former, athletes are selected to represent their club or institution. In the case of privately run or independent meetings, athletes participate on an invitation-only basis.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the campus}} is found wanting {{in some of}} the more basic {{requirements}} <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>educational</b> institution.

25|$|Outcome-based {{education}} (OBE) is {{an educational}} theory that bases each part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>educational</b> system around goals (outcomes). By {{the end of}} the educational experience, each student should have achieved the goal. There is no single specified style of teaching or assessment in OBE; instead, classes, opportunities, and assessments should all help students achieve the specified outcomes. The role of the faculty adapts into instructor, trainer, facilitator, and/or mentor based on the outcomes targeted.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011 the Pennsylvania Legislature {{passed an}} {{amendment}} stating that {{an employee of}} a school who engages in sexual relations with any student or athletic player {{under the age of}} 18 may receive a third-degree felony charge. In 2014 Governor of Pennsylvania Tom Corbett signed into law an amendment making this law apply to athletic coaches who work outside <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>educational</b> setting. Historically Pennsylvania prosecutors were only allowed to issue misdemeanor charges such as corruption of minors against teachers and coaches who had sex with 16 and 17-year-old students. In addition to the corruption of minors charge, Pennsylvania prosecutors have also brought child endangerment charges against schoolteachers who had sex with 16 and 17-year-old students.|$|E
25|$|It was Hucklesby's {{dream that}} the house would become a museum that would be 'interesting as well as <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>educational</b> nature'. Unfortunately, the house itself had been {{neglected}} and suffered from dry rot, Luton council could not immediately afford the renovations. It remained empty for several years until it became a military hospital during the First World War. After the war, rooms were let to council employees with a cafe opening on the ground floor. The museum opened in 1930, having moved from the Carnegie library where it started in 1927. At first the museum displays were held in just two rooms, {{but over the years}} it has filled the entire house. The museum is open Tuesdays to Saturdays from 10am to 5pm and Sundays from 1 to 5pm.

500|$|The square {{fell into}} disuse after the {{district}} court disbanded, and, in 1817, the city's trustees sold half of the city square {{to raise money for}} the establishment <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>educational</b> institution known as Danville Academy.

On February 13, 1818, the trustees voted to sell the other half of the square and allocate the money to the same purpose. There is no record that Danville Academy was ever established, however; advocates of the academy's establishment apparently combined their efforts with those of the individuals who established Centre College in Danville, and the funds that had been designated for the founding of Danville Academy were re-allocated to Centre.|$|E

500|$|Leslie {{laid out}} an {{aggressive}} legislative agenda {{in his inaugural}} address to the General Assembly on September 5, 1871, but legislators were more concerned with passing the Southern Railroad bill that would create {{a connection between the}} railroads of Cincinnati, Ohio, and those of the Southern United States. The line would pass through central Kentucky, opening up trade to the region. It would be funded primarily by capital from Ohio, and would provide competition to the Louisville and Nashville Railroad's monopoly in the state. Though Leslie wasn't particularly supportive of the bill, he refused to veto it because of the potential economic benefits to the state. Leslie was also faced with the issue of post-war violence by the Ku Klux Klan. The legislature had refused to pass a law against mob violence in 1871. In his address to the legislature on December 6, 1871, Leslie endorsed legislation that made it illegal to write or post threatening notices and to band together and wear disguises. This proposal enjoyed favorable public opinion, and was passed during the legislature's next session. With the railroad and violence issues resolved, Governor Leslie urged the legislature to improve the status of blacks in the state, including the creation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>educational</b> system for blacks and the approval of the testimony of blacks in the state's courts. He commissioned a new geological survey, appointing native Kentuckian Nathaniel Southgate Shaler to head the work. An advocate of the temperance movement, he secured additional regulations on the sale of liquor. Also during Leslie's tenure, [...] the penal system was improved.|$|E
