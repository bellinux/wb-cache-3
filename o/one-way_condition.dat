In pairs, participants (n= 180) played an endowment version of Chicken involving either no communication, one-way communication, or two-way communication. Participants were each given a sum of money which they could either Invest or Not Invest. Based on both participants' decisions, the initial amount of money could be increased or decreased. Although cheap talk did not significantly increase the proportion of equilibria outcomes, one-way and two-way cheap talk influenced participants' behaviour in opposing ways. In the <b>one-way</b> <b>condition,</b> senders used their messages {{to take charge of}} the game while two-way communication elicited greater cooperativeness between participants. These findings support the idea that two messages can create a focal point even when they do not constitute a Nash equilibrium.

The increase of vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s volume will cause traffic jam. Roads with the traffic jam potential is Sugiyopranoto, Imam Bonjol, and Pemuda. Then the idea of one way traffic management proposed with the purpose to determine the traffic performance at existing condition and provide a recommendation about the better traffic regulation. Observation such as traffic survey has been done on roads and intersections in road network in the west region of Semarang. Analysis of traffic performance based on Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s Highway Capacity Manual (IHCM) 1997 with an analysis of existing saturated conditions at peak hours in the morning, afternoon, and evening as a benchmark for short-term design. One way traffic management that applied are the change of green time at the signalized intersection, the route, traffic diversion by the application of the one way traffic chain on the road network, traffic facilities, and geometric. The analysis result of roads and intersection in the region shows the performance with degree of saturation > 0, 75. The ideal limit is ≤ 0, 75. The result of the intersection analysis also showed unsatisfactory performance. The degree of saturation is high and delay time of intersection still large. so the one way traffic management applied on the Sugiyopranoto road, the entire segment of Imam Bonjol Road, The entire segment of Pemuda road, and Pierre Tendean road. The intersection changes is by removing the signal of Poncol intersection and Tendean intersection. Several signal at Tugumuda intersection suchas signal from Sugiyopranoto, signal from Pemuda, and the signal in front of Sutomo also removed. The results of the analysis for <b>one-way</b> <b>condition</b> showed better performance. The traffic flow is also distributed optimally. The based parameter is the change of speed and pace time that can be felt directly by road users.

In particular, for military use secure communications are very important.

This paper presents chaos synchronization of two identical chaotic motions of symmetric gyros. It has been demonstrated that applying four different kinds of <b>one-way</b> coupling <b>conditions</b> can synchronize two identical chaotic systems. The sign of the sub-Liapunov exponent has been used as an indicator for the occurrence of chaos synchronization. It has also been found that when chaos synchronization occurs the positive major sub-Liapunov exponent transverses the zero value and becomes negative for the last time. Chaos synchronization can also be shown by phase trajectory. In addition, synchronization time is also examined. Furthermore, it has been found that different distances of the initial conditions between the master system and slave system do not affect the occurrence of chaos synchronization...|$|R

This study compared the multisession effect of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX {{with that of the}} typical antipsychotic haloperidol on the expression of avoidance responding. Rats (N 199) were trained to move to safety on presentation of a tone in <b>one-way</b> active <b>conditioned</b> avoidance and were tested across 5 sessions. Intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of CNQX (20 -min injection–test interval) produced a dose-dependent, immediate block of avoidance responding, compared with the extinction-like decline of avoidance responding produced by haloperidol (intraperi-toneal [ip], 60 -min injection–test interval; icv, 60 but not 20 -min injection–test interval). Previous exposure to CNQX significantly reduced its efficacy, illustrating that its effects may not be specific to the conditioned safety-related stimuli that control responding in conditioned avoidance, as proposed for antidopaminergic compounds. The new multisession profile of disrupted avoidance responding illustrated by CNQX suggests different roles for glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in conditioned avoidance responding.

40|$|As attested by {{accident}} statistics, road crossing {{is a highly}} difficult task for older pedestrians. In a series of experiments in a street-crossing simulator we have observed that the high speed of approaching cars and traffic complexity (two-way streets) are critical external factors that cause older pedestrian to make risky street-crossing decisions. With regard to internal factors, we have shown that functional declines contribute to {{increase the risk of}} collisions: processing speed and visual attention abilities (measured by UFOV) were found to play the most important role in predicting risky street-crossing decisions, together with time-to-arrival estimation, walking speed and executive functions. In two experiments we studied the possibility of training older pedestrians to make safer decisions in simulated street-crossing situations. The first study focused on <b>one-way</b> traffic <b>conditions</b> and used a combined educational and behavioural (on a street-crossing simulator) intervention program. This kind of training proved effective in improving the overall street-crossing safety of older pedestrians in by shifting the decision criterion towards more conservative judgments.

These methods are compared in the realistic framework of interactions between a 1 / 15 ° model of the Bay of Biscay and a 1 / 3 ° model of the North Atlantic, over a 3 -year simulation (1996 - 1998). The clamped and radiation boundary conditions systematically lead to energy accumulation and problematic recirculations along the boundary, and can disturb the internal dynamics of the regional domain. The one-way or two-way-nesting and the full-coupling methods result in far more satisfactory behaviour. For long periods of integration, the two-way mode improves both the fine and coarse-grid solutions. The full coupling method provides the most regular solution at the boundary, and also opens interesting new perspectives since it should enable the coupling of models with different physics.

To investigate the relationship among somatosensory function, balance control, and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Balance control requires the contribution of somatosensory, visual, and vestibular inputs. Previous {{studies have shown that}} abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were associated with AIS. METHODS. A total of 105 girls with AIS and 57 normal girls aged 11 - 14 years entered the study, and were evaluated with bilateral tibial nerve evoked cerebral SSEPs and standing balance control under reduced or conflicting sensory conditions (i. e., the sensory organization test). One-way analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the effects of scoliosis and somatosensory function tested by SSEPs on the performance of sensory organization test. RESULTS. There were 15 patients with AIS who had abnormal SSEPs. Postural sway was measured on all subjects under normal, reduced, or conflicting somatosensory, visual, and vestibular <b>conditions.</b> <b>One-way</b> analysis of variance indicated no significant effect of spinal deformity or SSEPs on the balance control when there was an increased reliance on the somatosensory, visual, and vestibular systems during stance (P > 0. 05). However, in the patients with abnormal SSEPs, a significant effect was found when subjects had to rely on somatosensory input for their balance control (P = 0. 023). The effect of scoliosis by itself was not found to be significant (P = 1. 0). CONCLUSIONS. The finding of significantly larger difference in bilateral SSEP latencies in patients with AIS indicated the association of abnormal SSEPs with AIS. The finding of a significant effect of SSEPs on the balance control further indicated the presence of abnormal somatosensory function in a subgroup of patients with AIS.

"May 2012 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] A primary goal of this dissertation was to examine the ways the media may be used to provide social support for individuals with various personality types, stress, and social support needs. To accomplish this goal, two studies were conducted. The first study utilized a cross-sectional survey design to explore which communication medium was preferred by individuals based on their personality traits, their social support needs, their stress controllability and the type of stress they were currently experiencing. A model of optimal stress-support matching and the uses and gratifications framework were used to underpin this survey research. The second study was a between-subject laboratory experiment attempting to test how social support affects individuals' perceived support receipt, stress and emotion across different communication channels. The results from the survey study failed to provide support to the model of optimal stress-support matching. The role of personality traits was also investigated. Agreeableness and openness were positively associated with perceived need for social support. Perceived social support need revealed positive effects on preference for one-to-one face-to-face interaction and group face-to-face discussion. Further, conscientiousness and neuroticism revealed significant impacts on preferences for using anonymous online communication and one-way media channels for social support. Interaction effects were found between stress types and controllability on one-to-one face-to-face and one-way media preferences. The experiment found that communication channels interacted with neuroticism to affect individuals' positive emotion scores. Specifically, individuals who were high in neuroticism reported higher scores of positive emotion than individuals who were low in neuroticism when they were in the one-way media (i. e. video viewing) condition, whereas the low neuroticism individuals reported higher positive emotion than high neuroticism individuals when they were in the face-to-face condition. Moreover, by specifically examining individuals in the <b>one-way</b> media <b>condition,</b> individuals who were high in perceived parasocial interaction reported higher levels of social support than individuals who were low in social support. This dissertation bridges interpersonal communication and media communication and the findings provide important contribution to social support literature. Findings suggest that, for certain personality types, mediated communication may be an effective tool for social support receipt and stress as well as emotion management. A primary goal of this dissertation was to assist individuals in discovering appropriate ways to seek out, obtain and provide social support. Both social support providers and seekers can benefit from the results regarding which communication means is effective in terms of providing social support to individuals with different needs and personalities...|$|R
40|$|Background: Adequate {{radiotherapy}} services provision entails systematic planning due {{to their}} high capital costs and the requirement for specialised staff. A treatment attendance (called a fraction) is a fundamental unit of productivity in a radiotherapy department. There is variation in radiotherapy fractionation practices, however, there is no evidence-based benchmark for appropriate activity. A radiotherapy utilisation model was previously constructed and estimated that 52. 3 % of cancer patients should receive external beam radiotherapy at least once during their illness. The next challenge is to translate an overall radiotherapy utilisation rate into a more practical estimate of radiotherapy demand. Aim: To construct an evidence-based model to estimate the optimal number of fractions for the first course of radiotherapy, building on the radiotherapy utilisation model. Methods: Evidence-based treatment guidelines, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials were reviewed for fraction number recommendations for each indication of radiotherapy for notifiable cancers with an incidence of &# 8805; 1 %. The previously published radiotherapy utilisation tree was adapted so that the most appropriate evidence-based fraction number was added to each branch. Epidemiological data previously used were updated. For each cancer type, the optimal fraction number was then calculated using the TreeAge software, {{taking into account the}} frequency of specific clinical conditions where radiotherapy is indicated and the recommended fraction number for each <b>condition.</b> <b>One-way</b> sensitivity analyses were performed {{to assess the impact of}} uncertainties on the model. Results: For each cancer type, the optimal number of fractions for the first course of radiotherapy ranged from 0 to 26. 1 per cancer patient, and 0 to 30. 8 per course. Head and neck, brain and anal cancers had the highest number of fractions per course. Overall, the optimal fraction number was 9 per cancer patient and 18 per course. Sensitivity analysis showed that this ranged from 8. 6 to 9. 6 per cancer patient, and 17. 2 to 19. 2 per course. Conclusion: These results represent the first evidence-based benchmark for radiotherapy services delivery, and allow comparisons with actual practices. The model can be used to predict workload to aid in radiotherapy services planning, and adapted to future changes in cancer incidence, stage distribution and fractionation recommendations...|$|R
40|$|Changing the {{direction}} of locomotion, {{often referred to as}} 2 ̆ 2 steering 2 ̆ 2, is an integral component of human locomotion. Steering requires maintaining dynamic balance while translating and rotating the body in the new travel direction. Given the level of sensation thought to be involved in sub serving goal directed modifications in steering, it is highly likely that steering control may require attention. Since attention resources decline with increasing age, we may see the influence of age on steering performance when attention resources are limited. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the role of attention in steering using a dual task paradigm in healthy young and healthy older adults. Twenty-five healthy young adults and nineteen healthy older adults completed the experimental protocol that involved baseline and dual task conditions. In the baseline condition, the participants walked and turned 900 at a comfortable pace. In the dual task condition, the participants walked and turned 900 while reciting serial 7 subtractions. We measured the time taken to turn, and the turn onsets of the eyes, head, trunk and pelvis in the baseline and dual task <b>conditions.</b> <b>One-way</b> ANOVA and Multivariate analyses ascertained the effects of age on the time taken to turn, and the turn onsets of the eyes, head, trunk and pelvis in the baseline and dual task conditions. The results of the study indicated a significant impact of age on steering performance under dual task conditions. In healthy young adults, the dual task condition increased the time taken to turn, but it did not affect the turn onsets of the eyes, head, trunk and pelvis. In older adults however, the dual task condition not only increased the time taken to turn, but it also altered the turn onsets of various body segments. These results provided evidence that steering performance varied with age, under dual task conditions. This is an important finding as turning in activities of daily living are rarely done in isolation of a secondary motor or cognitive task. Disruption of steering performance could place older adults at risk of disruptions to turning movements, resulting in a loss of balance and/or falling. Future research should focus on studying the level of variance in steering due to dual tasking that might infer details about the nature of motor control during turning in older adults. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} sought to {{determine}} the influence of environmental conditions and protective clothing on physiological, perceptual and performance responses during batting activity. The investigation examined mean skin temperature, average heart rate, estimated sweat rate, rating of perceived exertion, thermal sensation rating, average sprint time and pre-post choice reaction time. Twenty-five cricketers (18 - 22 yr, 73. 1 ± 9. 6 kg, 1768 ± 75 mm, 12. 6 ± 3. 1 % body fat, 1. 89 ± 0. 16 m 2) performed a work-bout consisting of a seven-Over batting period, during which time they faced deliveries from a bowling machine and performed two shuttle runs every third ball to total four sprints per Over. Trials were carried out under High-stress (23. 8 ± 2. 2 °C) and Low-stress (13. 3 ± 1. 9 °C) environmental conditions (WBGT). Within each environmental condition subjects performed the test wearing full protective batting gear and no protective gear. Thus, four specific conditions were examined; high full-gear (HFG), high no-gear (HNG), low full-gear (LFG) and low no-gear (LNG). Two-way ANOVAs were calculated to determine whether there were differences between environmental conditions and whether differences existed between the clothing <b>conditions.</b> <b>One-way</b> ANOVAs were utilised to compute differences between the four specific conditions combining clothing and environment. High environmental stress and wearing protective clothing caused batsmen to experience significant physiological strain. The environment was the greatest stressor, with the protective gear exacerbating these effects. However, when padding covered skin areas directly, this was the primary skin temperature stressor, particularly later in the activity. For skin temperature and heart rate, the strain was the most pronounced {{at the end of the}} trials. Perceptual responses indicated that the protective gear had no influence on effort sense, thermal sensation or thermal comfort. However, environmental conditions had an effect, and High-stress conditions resulted in significantly higher perceptions of effort, elevated sensations of heat and greater thermal discomfort. Effort was perceived to be greatest towards the end of the trial. There were mixed findings for performance factors. In general sprint performance was not hindered by environmental stress, but protective clothing caused a reduction in several sprint times. Choice reaction times were for the most part unaffected by either environment or clothing and few differences were observed between pre and post times. It is contended that intense short duration batting activity, likely encountered during one-day participation, imposes a stress on batsmen. The stress is greater when conditions are warmer and protective padding is worn, although it is not sufficient to impede choice reaction time. However, protective gear did have a deleterious effect on sprint performance...|$|R
