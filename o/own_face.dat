5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson {{at the expense of}} Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, with Loxton taking 0/12. Loxton came in at 2/327 and made 12, before sweeping a ball from Freddie Brown into his <b>own</b> <b>face</b> and breaking his nose. He retired hurt and took no further part in the match. Australia declared at 8/469 and the hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E
5|$|Matejko {{was fascinated}} by Stańczyk from the times of his youth, and portrayed him in several of his works (most notably, besides the {{painting}} discussed here, in Consecration of King Sigismund's Bell, 1874 and Prussian Homage, 1882). Working on this painting, Matejko was also inspired by the book Król zamczyska by Seweryn Goszczyński, whose main character– a loner, living in the castle's ruins, trying to reconcile past and present, and himself inspired by Stańczyk– likely influenced this painting. Completed in 1862, when Matejko was twenty four years old, {{it is one of}} his most famous works and the one that launched him to fame. It is seen as a key painting for the understanding of Matejko's style and intentions in his art. Matejko used his <b>own</b> <b>face</b> for Stańczyk, and with this work, began a series of paintings analyzing and interpreting the history of Poland through the figure of Stańczyk.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the final}} match for Bradman in England, and the ground was crowded despite rain interruptions. It was Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches. During the last Australian campaign in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test line-up being the inclusion of Johnson {{at the expense of}} Ring. The host captain Walter Robins won the toss and decided to bat, but Lindwall took 6/59 in an innings that lasted into the second day, bowling four of his victims and taking five of the last six wickets to fall as the hosts lost their last six wickets for 57 runs. Bradman and Barnes made 153 and 151 respectively, sharing a second-wicket partnership of 225 after Morris was out for 62. Loxton hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his <b>own</b> <b>face,</b> breaking his nose. Australia reached 2/407 on the third and final afternoon before collapsing to 8/469 before Bradman declared without attempting to force a result. Leveson-Gower's XI played out time, with Bradman bowling the last over.|$|E

50|$|By {{the second}} half of the nineteenth century, the Dutch, Spanish, Swiss, Belgian, Japanese, Portuguese, Italian, Romanian, Swedish, Chilean, Mexican, Greek and Turkish armies had come to follow French {{standardised}} arrangements, although in some cases variety might still be used to denote different types of infantry (grenadiers, fusiliers, rifles, light infantry etc.) within a particular army, each with its own uniform and facings. As a general rule, cavalry uniforms tended to be more varied, and it was not uncommon for each mounted regiment to retain its <b>own</b> <b>facing</b> colours up to 1914. Artillery, engineers and support corps normally had a single branch colour, although exceptionally each regiment of Swedish artillery had its <b>own</b> <b>facing</b> colour until 1910.|$|R
25|$|Simeon the Just (a High Priest) {{was opposed}} to the nazirite vow and ate of the {{sacrifice}} offered by a nazirite on only a single occasion.

He therefore wished to offer up his hair to God, and Simeon then partook of the sin-offering which he brought.|$|E
25|$|The results {{uncovered}} by this study at least suggest some {{issues with the}} classic mirror test; primarily, that it assumes that children will recognise the dot of rouge as abnormal and attempt to examine or remove it. The classic test may have produced false negatives, because the child's recognition of the dot {{did not lead to}} them cleaning it. In their modified test, in which the doll was cleaned first, they found a stronger relationship between cleaning the doll's face and the child cleaning its <b>own</b> <b>face.</b> The demonstration with the doll, postulated to demonstrate to the children what to do, may lead to more reliable confirmation of self-recognition.|$|E
25|$|In {{designing}} the Jedi Master Yoda, Stuart Freeborn used his <b>own</b> <b>face</b> {{as a model}} and added the wrinkles of Albert Einstein for the appearance of exceptional intelligence. Sets for Dagobah were built five feet above the stage floor, allowing puppeteers to crawl underneath and hold up the Yoda puppet. The setup presented communication problems for Frank Oz, who portrayed Yoda, as he was underneath the stage and unable to hear the crew and Mark Hamill above. Hamill later expressed his dismay at being the only human character on set for months; {{he felt like a}} trivial element on a set of animals, machines, and moving props. Kershner commended Hamill for his performance with the puppet.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT—Observing {{touch on}} another person’s body ac-tivates brain regions {{involved}} in tactile perception, {{even when the}} observer’s body is not directly stimulated. Pre-vious work has shown that in some synaesthetes, this effect induces a sensation of being touched. The present study shows that if perceptual thresholds are experimentally manipulated, viewing touch can modulate tactile experi-ence in nonsynaesthetes as well. When observers saw a face being touched by hands, rather than a face being merely approached by hands, they demonstrated enhanced de-tection of subthreshold tactile stimuli on their <b>own</b> <b>faces.</b> This effect was specific to observing touch on a body part, and was not found for touch on a nonbodily stimulus, namely, {{a picture of a}} house. In addition, the effect was stronger when subjects viewed their <b>own</b> <b>faces</b> rather tha...|$|R
