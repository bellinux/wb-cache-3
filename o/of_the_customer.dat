5|$|New {{office manager}} Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) picks {{favorites}} among the staff, including Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner), Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), a sycophantic Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson), who is attending business school thanks to Deangelo. He is also favorable towards Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who {{he believes is}} the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> service department, and Kelly Kapoor's (Mindy Kaling) direct supervisor. Kelly is initially irate at the situation, but Ryan agrees {{to be a more}} dutiful boyfriend in exchange for Kelly keeping up the charade. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) desperately aspires to join the inner circle, while Deangelo repeatedly attempts to win over Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who is still apathetic toward the new boss. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) sees his style as sexist, as every member of the inner circle is male, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) agrees to, as Deangelo has repeatedly been acting coldly towards her. To prove to the staff that he's not sexist, Deangelo hires a woman named Jordan Garfield (Cody Horn), who turns out to have no business experience (having previously worked in Anthropologie) over other qualified candidates, including a friend of Pam's. Kelly later attempts to tell Deangelo the truth about Ryan's actual position as a temp worker, but Deangelo simply appoints Ryan as the department head rather than figuring out the truth.|$|E

5|$|State {{funding was}} allocated, {{allowing}} {{the airport to}} be upgraded. The regional airport opened on 1 August 1974, {{the same day as}} four other airports in Finnmark. Both Widerøe and Norving applied to operate the subsidized regional routes in Finnmark, which included the route to Berlevåg. Widerøe was awarded the contract in 1973. Because of the steadily more regular flights to Berlevåg, Norving applied to the government for permission to operate these as taxi routes. While the airline had been forced to operate its taxi service on the time specifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer,</b> taxi routes would allow the airline to operate feeder services with timetables. No such permission was granted. Widerøe took over operations from 1 August 1974 using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter. On 14 November 1980 the garage and workshop burned down; a new building was built and opened in 1982. The passenger terminal was expanded in 1988 with a new arrivals and departure hall. Widerøe introduced the Dash8 in 1994. The state and the Civil Aviation Administration took over ownership and operations of the airport from 1 January 1997, in exchange for 2.2 million Norwegian krone (NOK) being paid to Berlevåg Municipality. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005.|$|E

When it is clear what product the customer needs and the possible modifications to this product {{it is necessary to}} determine if the customer current configuration suits the new product. The current configuration is compared to the constraints of the new product. This can also be done automatically by the configuration management system. When the configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customer</b> appears to be insufficient the customer is informed about this. For example the vendor can make clear to the customer that it will need an external product for this new product to run properly. Besides this the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system of the vendor is updated. There is more information about this in the chapter about CRM.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In the {{differentiated}} services (DS) enabled networks, Internet {{service providers}} (ISPs) establish {{service level agreements}} (SLAs) with their <b>customers.</b> Prices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SLAs and quality of data transmission services should correspond to <b>the</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> and operations aims <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ISPs. For this reason, IP domains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ISPs should contain a control system for setting <b>the</b> selling prices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SLAs and DS services used for data flows <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SLAs. The control system should consider dynamically both requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> and quality <b>of</b> end-to-end data transmission services. This task is complex because <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> and operators <b>of</b> other networks may not give useful information to the ISPs for the control task. For this reason, a new fuzzy controller based control system is developed. The system operates using local measurements of ingress routers of IP domains about <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers.</b> It does not inquire <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> about offered data transmission services, or capacities of networks <b>of</b> other operators. <b>The</b> operations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> control system are tested using the Networ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> finding <b>the</b> optimal routing <b>of</b> {{a single}} vehicle that delivers K different products to N customers {{according to a}} particular <b>customer</b> order. <b>The</b> demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> for each product {{are assumed to be}} random variables with known distributions. Each product type is stored in its dedicated compartment in the vehicle. Using a suitable dynamic programming algorithm we find the policy that satisfies <b>the</b> demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> with <b>the</b> minimum total expected cost. We also prove that this policy has a specific threshold-type structure. Furthermore, we investigate a corresponding infinite-time horizon problem in which <b>the</b> service <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> does not stop when <b>the</b> last <b>customer</b> has been serviced but it continues indefinitely with <b>the</b> same <b>customer</b> order. It is assumed that <b>the</b> demands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>customers</b> at different tours have the same distributions. It is shown that the discounted-cost optimal policy and the average-cost optimal policy have the same threshold-type structure as the optimal policy in the original problem. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
