50|$|Due to {{the lower}} {{pressures}} and temperatures required to die cast semi-solid metal the die material {{does not need to}} be as exotic. Often graphite or softer stainless steels may be used. Even non-ferrous dies can be used for one time shots. Because of this the process can be applied to rapid prototyping needs and mass production. This also allows for the casting <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> metals, such as tool steel and stellite, if a higher temperature die material is used. Other advantages include: easily automated, consistent, production rates are equal to or better than die casting rates, no air entrapment, low shrinkage rates, and a uniform microstructure.|$|E

50|$|Involves {{the removal}} of {{material}} from metal-containing solid targets by irradiating the surface with high-powered (~100 mJ/pulse) short (10 Hz) laser pulses, usually with wavelengths in the ultraviolet (UV) region of the light spectrum. When such a laser pulse is adsorbed by a solid target, material from the surface region of the target absorbs the laser energy and either (a) evaporates or sublimates from the surface or is (b) converted into a plasma (see laser ablation). These particles are easily transferred to the substrate where they can nucleate and grow into nanowires.The laser-assisted growth technique is particularly useful for growing nanowires with high melting temperatures, multicomponent or doped nanowires, as well as nanowires with extremely high crystalline quality. The high intensity of the laser pulse incident at the target allows the deposition <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> materials, without having to try to evaporate the material using extremely high temperature resistive or electron bombardment heating. Furthermore, targets can simply be made from a mixture of materials or even a liquid. Finally, the plasma formed during the laser absorption process allows for the deposition of charged particles {{as well as a}} catalytic means to lower the activation barrier of reactions between target constituents.|$|E

2500|$|Unsaturated {{vegetable}} oils {{can be transformed}} through partial or complete [...] "hydrogenation" [...] into oils <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b> The hydrogenation process involves [...] "sparging" [...] the oil at high temperature and pressure with hydrogen {{in the presence of}} a catalyst, typically a powdered nickel compound. As each carbon–carbon double-bond is chemically reduced to a single bond, two hydrogen atoms each form single bonds with the two carbon atoms. The elimination of double bonds by adding hydrogen atoms is called saturation; as the degree of saturation increases, the oil progresses toward being fully hydrogenated. An oil may be hydrogenated to increase resistance to rancidity (oxidation) or to change its physical characteristics. As the degree of saturation increases, the oil's viscosity and <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> increase.|$|R

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of phosphatidylglycerol and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol has been {{measured in the}} leaves of 27 species of higher plants from six families whose members differed in their degrees of chilling sensitivity. The content <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> fatty acids (represented by the sum of hexadecanoic, trans- 3 -hexadecenoic and octadecanoic acids) in phosphatidylglycerols varied little between {{members of the same}} plant family and was not obviously related to the relative chilling sensitivity of members of that family. The saturated fatty acid content (hexadecanoic + octadecanoic acids) of sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerols also appeared to be characteristic of a plant family, although some exceptions were found. In one case, (Carica papaya) the content of saturated fatty acids in sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol was sufficiently high to suggest that this lipid could undergo phase separations above 0 °C. It is concluded that the content <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> fatty acids in leaf phosphatidylglycerol is not a direct indication of the chilling sensitivity of a plant, but rather may be a reflection of the genetic origin of that plant...|$|E

30|$|SiC {{nanoparticles}} can {{be formed}} by nucleation according to reaction (3) with gas–solid interaction but {{the growth of}} SiC NWs is believed to undergo a gas–gas interaction in reaction (4).

The surface energy of { 111 } planes of SiC is much smaller than those of the other crystal planes; therefore, < 111 > oriented SiC NWs can be easily prepared. In the process of cooling down, SiC–SiO 2 nanowires with core–shell structure can be formed because <b>of</b> <b>higher</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point</b> and faster solidification speed of SiC than SiO 2, which is consistent with the previous reports [28, 29].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Geometry of electrodes, {{distance}} between them, work atmosphere and ambient temperature are the important factors, which determine quantity {{and variety of}} structures synthesized via arc discharge. Usually, electrodes of different cross-section are placed away from each other, allowing a large vapor stream directed into the reactor inside to be obtained. Generally, the anode is thinner than the cathode; it heats up to a high temperature, sublimates and supplies the carbon vapor required for nanoparticle synthesis. In contrast to this commonly used approach, when electrode dimensions are appropriately chosen and electrodes placed closely together, temperature interaction between them becomes considerable, discharge area constrains and hot electrodes {{can be used as}} heaters for the evaporation of materials <b>of</b> <b>high</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point...</b>|$|E
