40|$|It is {{well-known}} that many sub-attributes of line quality, such as edge raggedness, line waviness, etc., {{contribute to the}} perception of the <b>overall</b> line <b>quality.</b> But the relative importance of these sub-attributes is not clear, nor is there a method available for combining them into one representative number for <b>overall</b> line <b>quality.</b> To address these issues, we have designed and conducted a series of psychophysical experiments, which explore the shape of the human visual transfer functions (VTF) relevant to {{the perception of the}}se sub-attributes. Based on this, we have proposed an approach to assess <b>overall</b> line <b>quality.</b> In our method, we first pre-process the line image acquired (for example from a scanner) and extract certain profiles relevant to line quality measurement. A set of corresponding VTF’s is then applied to these profiles to calculate the various sub-attributes. Finally, <b>overall</b> line <b>quality</b> is determined by the weighted combination of these individual sub-attributes. Our preliminary results show that this measurement correlates well with human perception of <b>overall</b> line <b>quality,</b> for the sub-attributes studied...|$|R

Critics had mixed opinions regarding the platforming elements, the convergence of video game and TV show, and the <b>overall</b> <b>quality</b> of the TV show. The Windows 10 version was criticized for its technical issues. As a result, the game was released for Steam on 29 September 2016.

5|$|Cited as an {{influential}} {{title in the}} video game industry {{and one of the}} best games of all time, Shadow of the Colossus is often regarded as an important example of video game as art due to its minimalist landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey.

5|$|SCI is {{extremely}} disruptive to sexuality, and it most frequently happens to young people, {{who are at}} a peak in their sexual and reproductive lives. Yet the importance of sexuality {{as a part of}} life is not diminished by a disabling injury. Although for years people with SCI were believed to be asexual, research has shown sexuality to be a high priority for people with SCI and an important aspect of quality of life. In fact, of all abilities they would like to have return, most paraplegics rated sexual function as their top priority, and most tetraplegics rated it second, after hand and arm function. Sexual function has a profound impact on self-esteem and adjustment to life post-injury. People who are able to adapt to their changed bodies and to have satisfying sex lives have better <b>overall</b> <b>quality</b> of life.|$|E

40|$|To improve {{ecological}} validity, perceptual {{and instrumental}} assessment of disordered voice, including <b>overall</b> voice <b>quality,</b> should ideally sample both sustained vowels and continuous speech. This investigation assessed {{the utility of}} combining both voice contexts {{for the purpose of}} auditory-perceptual ratings as well as acoustic measurement of <b>overall</b> voice <b>quality.</b> Sustained vowel and continuous speech samples from 251 subjects with (n = 229) or without (n = 22) various voice disorders were concatenated and perceptually rated on <b>overall</b> voice <b>quality</b> by five experienced voice clinicians. After removing the nonvoiced segments within the continuous speech samples, the concatenated samples were analyzed using 13 acoustic measures based on fundamental frequency perturbation, amplitude perturbation, spectral and cepstral analyses. Stepwise multiple regression analysis yielded a six-variable acoustic model for the multiparametric measurement of <b>overall</b> voice <b>quality</b> of the concatenated samples (with a cepstral measure as the main contributor to the prediction of <b>overall</b> voice <b>quality).</b> The correlation of this model with mean ratings of <b>overall</b> voice <b>quality</b> resulted in r(s) = 0. 78. A cross-validation approach involving the iterated internal cross-correlations with 30 subgroups of 100, 50, and 10 samples confirmed a comparable degree of association. Furthermore, the ability of the model to distinguish voice-disordered from vocally normal participants was assessed using estimates of diagnostic precision including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as likelihood ratios (LRs), which adjust for base-rate differences between the groups. Depending on the cutoff criteria employed, the analyses revealed an impressive area under ROC = 0. 895 as well as respectable sensitivity, specificity, and LR. The results support the diagnostic utility of combining voice samples from both continuous speech and sustained vowels in acoustic and perceptual analysis of disordered voice. The findings are discussed in relation to the extant literature and the need for further refinement of the acoustic algorithm...|$|R
