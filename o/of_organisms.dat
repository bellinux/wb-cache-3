5|$|Evolution {{influences}} {{every aspect}} of the form and behaviour <b>of</b> <b>organisms.</b> Most prominent are the specific behavioural and physical adaptations that are the outcome of natural selection. These adaptations increase fitness by aiding activities such as finding food, avoiding predators or attracting mates. Organisms can also respond to selection by cooperating with each other, usually by aiding their relatives or engaging in mutually beneficial symbiosis. In the longer term, evolution produces new species through splitting ancestral populations <b>of</b> <b>organisms</b> into new groups that cannot or will not interbreed.|$|E
