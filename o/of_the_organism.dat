5|$|The {{chemicals}} in the red-colored zone include an aromatic quinone, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. The quinone is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought {{to function as a}} radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular DNA repair following exposure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> to UV-damage, such radiation protectants are often found in lichens and in extremophilic situations and are essential for survival.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{cementation}} of the overlying substrate {{relative to}} the rate of decomposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> determines whether the top or bottom surface of an organism is preserved.

5|$|Discs : Circular fossils, such as Ediacaria, Cyclomedusa and Rugoconites led to {{the initial}} {{identification}} of Ediacaran fossils as cnidaria, which include jellyfish and corals. Further examination has provided alternative interpretations of all disc-shaped fossils: not one is now confidently recognised as a jellyfish. Alternate explanations include holdfasts and protists; the patterns displayed where two meet have led to many 'individuals' being identified as microbial colonies, and yet others may represent scratch marks formed as stalked organisms spun around their holdfasts. Useful diagnostic characters are often lacking because only the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> is preserved by fossilisation.|$|E

5|$|Evolutionary {{innovation}} {{may sometimes}} begin in Lamarckian style with epigenetic alterations of gene regulation or phenotype generation, subsequently consolidated by {{changes at the}} gene level. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation, as well as nonprogrammed remoulding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent plasticity of developmental mechanisms. The biologists Stuart A. Newman and Gerd B. Müller have suggested that organisms early {{in the history of}} multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early macroevolutionary changes.|$|E
5|$|In {{multicellular}} eukaryotes, {{cells in}} different organs and tissues have different patterns of gene expression and therefore have {{different sets of}} enzymes (known as isozymes) available for metabolic reactions. This provides a mechanism for regulating the overall metabolism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> For example, hexokinase, the first enzyme in the glycolysis pathway, has a specialized form called glucokinase expressed in the liver and pancreas that has a lower affinity for glucose yet is more sensitive to glucose concentration. This enzyme is involved in sensing blood sugar and regulating insulin production.|$|E
5|$|Most {{living things}} have predators and {{therefore}} {{are in a}} constant evolutionary arms race to develop antipredator adaptations, while the predator adapts to become more efficient at defeating the prey's adaptations. Some organisms have evolved to make detection less likely, for example by nocturnality and camouflage. Others have developed chemical defences such as the deadly toxins of certain snakes and wasps, or the noxious scent of the skunk. Such prey often send clear and honest warning signals to their attackers with conspicuous aposematic (warning) patterns. The brightness of such warning signs is correlated {{with the level of}} toxicity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E

5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of sexual reproduction over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, sexual reproduction affords {{a better chance of}} developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving sexual reproduction variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> Among the most important toolkit genes are the Hox genes. These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.|$|E
5|$|Different {{areas of}} the brain exhibit {{different}} forms of LTP. The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> when LTP is observed. For example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus. The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the NMDA receptor, others may depend upon the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether. The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP is observed. For example, LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor-dependent, whereas LTP in the mossy fiber pathway is NMDA receptor-independent.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{evidence that}} the negative geotactic behavior of Paramecium caudatum takes place by <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> buoyancy-oriented upward swimming. Photographs of swimming pathways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organisms</b> were completely described by two dynamic equations for <b>the</b> translational motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> gravity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism's</b> body and for <b>the</b> rotational motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism's</b> body about its center <b>of</b> gravity, where <b>the</b> rotational torque is induced by a slight difference in position between <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> gravity and <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> buoyancy. It now seems unlikely that complicated mechanisms such as the statocyst mechanism and the gravity-propulsion mechanism, which have been proposed by many investigators, need be considered for other protozoa since preliminary observation and analysis of other ciliates such as Paramecium multimicronucleatum, Paramecium tetraurelia, and Tetrahymena pyriformis also strongly suggested that their negative geotaxis is due to buoyancy-oriented upward swimming...|$|R

5|$|Gene {{duplication}} is not {{the only}} way that venom has become more diverse. There have been instances of new venom proteins generated by alternative splicing. The Elapid snake Bungarus fasciatus, for example, possesses a gene that is alternatively spliced to yield both a venom component and a physiological protein. Further diversification may have occurred by gene loss of specific venom components. For instance, the rattlesnake ancestor is believed to have had genes for neurotoxic PLA2 toxins, which are absent in modern non-neurotoxic Crotalus species. The various recruitment events had resulted in snake venom evolving into a very complex mixture of proteins. The venom of rattlesnakes, for example, includes nearly 40 different proteins from different protein families, and other snake venoms have been found to contain more than 100 distinct proteins. The composition of this mixture has been shown to vary geographically, and to be related to the prey species available in a certain region. Snake venom has generally evolved very quickly, with changes occurring faster in the venom than in the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, the bulk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism</b> lies unseen beneath the ground as an {{aggregation}} of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near {{the margin of the}} cap, and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from the margin of the cap. The cap surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from the cap, and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it.|$|E
5|$|Nervous {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs {{and there is a}} central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system. The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.|$|E

5|$|The {{field is}} characterised by some key concepts, which took {{biologists}} by surprise. One is deep homology, {{the finding that}} dissimilar organs such as the eyes of insects, vertebrates and cephalopod molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as pax-6, from the evo-devo gene toolkit. These genes are ancient, being highly conserved among phyla; they generate the patterns {{in time and space}} which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for enzymes; what does differ is the way that gene expression is regulated by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times {{in different parts of the}} embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple pleiotropic reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which natural selection would oppose.|$|E
5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one {{generation}} to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>organism.</b> However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E
