40|$|With {{the fast}} growth of image database, {{managing}} image contents {{is becoming an}} increasingly {{important part of the}} development of <b>organizational</b> memory <b>information</b> systems. However, effective and precise image retrieval still remains a problem because of the extreme difficulty in image understanding, and high-level knowledge required. In this paper, a new semantic image retrieval method using the analytic hierarchical process is proposed, to provide a new way to incorporate experts' judgment into the system and to evaluate the fitness of a semantic description used to represent an image. The main aim of the proposed method is to facilitate mapping the perceptions of low-level features of the knowledge users to higher-level organizational knowledge. A prototype of this system is implemented and experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is excellent when compared to traditional techniques. The implications, limitations, and future works of the proposed method for the development of <b>organizational</b> memory <b>information</b> systems are discussed. <b>Organizational</b> memory <b>information</b> systems AHP Content-based image retrieval Trademark retrieval systems Semantic image Vector space model...|$|R

50|$|<b>Organizational</b> <b>Information</b> Theory (OIT) is a {{communication}} theory offering systemic {{insight into the}} unique ways information is disseminated and utilized throughout organizations. Based, in large part, on seminal studies undertaken by Karl Weick, its core principles revolve around his belief that organizations are process-driven, rather than structurally driven. Given this acknowledgement to the role flow and evolution play in driving most work endeavors, OIT places strong emphasis on reducing levels of messaging equivocality, or uncertainty which normally exist in dynamic, information-rich, environments. With a framework that is interdisciplinary in nature, <b>organizational</b> <b>information</b> theory's desire to eliminate both ambiguity and complexity from workplace messaging builds upon earlier findings from general systems theory and phenomenology.|$|E
