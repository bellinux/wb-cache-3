50|$|SHVERA {{also offers}} DBS {{operators}} {{the opportunity to}} deliver distant digital network signals into “digital white areas” where the nearest network broadcaster does not currently offer digital content, or where adequate <b>off-air</b> <b>reception</b> does not occur.|$|E
50|$|The {{start date}} is for ITV service from the site. It {{is not clear}} when the BBC service commenced. The {{transmitter}} was classed as a relay of Blaenplwyf about 65 km to the south (for BBC) and as a relay of Preseli about 120 km to the south (for ITV). However, the line-of-sight to Preseli is obstructed about 10 km {{to the south of}} Ffestiniog, and {{it is likely that the}} signal feed was obtained by <b>off-air</b> <b>reception</b> of Arfon about 25 km to the west, itself a repeater of Preseli.|$|E
5000|$|The Benghazi station used {{an improvised}} studio at its {{transmitting}} station, as its studio headquarters were burnt down by protesters {{in the early}} days of the revolution. [...] None of the stations operated a website. However, in early April 2011, a live internet stream of the Benghazi station was established independently by a political activist, relaying <b>off-air</b> <b>reception</b> of the 675 AM signal. The location where the activist was receiving the 675 AM signal was not disclosed, though it must have been within Libya or its immediate vicinity as it had daytime reception of the signal by ground wave propagation.|$|E
50|$|Some cable TV systems {{receive the}} local {{television}} stations' programming by dedicated coaxial, microwave link or fiber-optic line, installed between the local {{station and the}} headend. A device called a modulator at the local station's facilities feed their programming over this line to the cable TV headend, which in turn receives it with another device called a demodulator. It is then distributed through the cable TV headend to subscribers. This is usually more reliable than receiving the local stations' broadcasts over the air with an antenna. However, <b>off-air</b> <b>reception</b> {{is used as a}} backup by the headend in case of failure. In some cases systems receive local channels by satellite.|$|E
5000|$|Subscribers of Charter Communications, {{the major}} cable {{provider}} in the state, can receive {{each of the}} UNC-TV digital subchannels. Time Warner Cable built a direct-fiber optic connection to UNC-TV's studios in RTP, a connection inherited by Charter when it merged with Time Warner Cable in 2016. Cable providers with a direct fiber optic link to UNC-TV (including Charter) also carry UNC-MX (formerly UNC-ED) on their digital tiers. UNC-MX features a mix of how-to and public affairs programs, along with encore presentations of programs originally broadcast on the primary UNC-TV channel. Cable providers which rely on <b>off-air</b> <b>reception</b> for broadcast stations are limited to the four-channel lineup. On February 1, 2016, UNC-MX was renamed UNC-NC [...] "The North Carolina Channel" [...] and was added over-the-air on subchannel 4 on both channel configurations. [...] On July 2, 2016, UNC-KD was renamed ROOTLE, offering 24-hour programming for children ages 3-8.|$|E
40|$|Free-to-air {{television}} stations remain {{the most popular}} source of programming, even in pay TV households. Consumers value the bundling of pay TV channels with retransmitted free-to-air channels {{for a variety of}} reasons, in particular the improved signal quality provided in areas where <b>off-air</b> <b>reception</b> is less than ideal. Hence, the conditions under which pay TV services can retransmit free-to-air signals are of crucial importance. This paper compares US and Australian signal retransmission regulations and assesses their impact on competition between pay TV and free-to-air television and on actual or potential competition between pay TV media such as cable and satellite television. The analysis also touches on the competitive implications of common ownership of satellite and cable pay TV services. To place the signal retransmission issues in the proper context, the paper examines differences in the structure of free-to-air television distribution systems in Australia and the US. In particular, it contrasts the Australian tendency to distribute most programming and sell most advertising nationally with the more locally oriented network—affiliate system in the US. The paper considers the relative merits of compulsory licensing and full copyright protection for free-to-air television signals and examines mandatory signal carriage ('must-carry') regulations. competition, copyright, free-to-air TV, pay TV, retransmission,...|$|E
