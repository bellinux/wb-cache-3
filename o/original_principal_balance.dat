40|$|Extracting {{the most}} {{essential}} information out of compositional data {{can be done by}} a method called <b>principal</b> <b>balances</b> [5]. This method is, however, compu- tationally only feasible for low-dimensional data. For high-dimensional composi- tional data we introduce the concept of sparse <b>principal</b> <b>balances,</b> a method that relies on sparse principal component analysis to construct principal directions with many zero loadings. Sparse <b>principal</b> <b>balances</b> are fast to compute even for very high-dimensional data, and their interpretation is easier than <b>principal</b> <b>balances...</b>|$|R
50|$|The unpaid <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> will {{decrease}} {{as time goes}} on for the loans that are structured with level payments. For these common loans, each monthly payment includes both interest and principal. The unpaid <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> {{at the beginning of a}} given month is reduced by that portion of the level payment that is designated principal for that month; so that the unpaid <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> at the end of the month is the beginning UPB less the principal paid for the month. Hence, the UPB decreases over time.|$|R
5000|$|Neg-Ams {{also have}} {{what is called}} a recast period, and the recast <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> cap is in the U.S. based on Federal and State legislation. The recast period is usually 60 months (5 years). The recast <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> cap (also known as the [...] "neg am limit") is usually up to a 25% {{increase}} of the amortized loan balance over the original loan amount. States and lenders can offer products with lesser recast periods and <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> caps; but cannot issue loans that exceed their state and federal legislated requirements under penalty of law.|$|R

50|$|An interest-only loan is a loan in which, {{for a set}} term, the {{borrower}} pays only the interest on the <b>principal</b> <b>balance,</b> with the <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> unchanged. At {{the end of the}} interest-only term {{the borrower}} may enter an interest-only mortgage, pay the principal, or (with some lenders) convert the loan to a principal and interest payment (or amortized) loan at his/her option.|$|R
40|$|<b>Principal</b> <b>balances</b> {{are defined}} as a {{sequence}} of orthonormal balances which maximize successively the explained variance in a data set. Apparently, computing <b>principal</b> <b>balances</b> requires an exhaustive search along all possible sets of orthogonal balances. This is unaffordable for even {{a small number of}} parts. Three suboptimal, but feasible, alternatives are explored. The approach is illustrated using a data-set of geochemical composition of glacial sediment...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} main ways {{repayment}} may be structured: the entire <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> {{may be due}} at the maturity of the loan; the entire <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> may be amortized over the term of the loan; or the loan may partially amortized during its term, with the remaining principal due as a [...] "balloon payment" [...] at maturity.

50|$|Individual borrowers who {{expect to}} prepay their loans early should {{generally}} favor {{a combination of}} lower <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> and higher interest rate (which stops accruing after prepayment), rather than a below-market interest rate and higher <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> (which much be paid in full, regardless of prepayment). In general, only borrowers who expect to keep their loans for many years should opt for below-market interest rates by paying mortgage origination points or forgoing automobile rebates.|$|R
5000|$|Loan modification: This is {{a process}} whereby a homeowner's {{mortgage}} is modified and both lender and homeowner are bound by the new terms. The most common modifications are lowering the interest rate and extending the term to up to 40 years. Reduction in the <b>principal</b> <b>balance,</b> however, is so rare that the Federal Reserve wrote in a report that they could find no evidence that lenders were reducing <b>principal</b> <b>balances</b> on mortgages.|$|R

2500|$|When a {{borrower}} makes a Pay-Option ARM payment that is {{less than}} the accruing interest, there is [...] "negative amortization", which means that the unpaid portion of the accruing interest is added to the outstanding <b>principal</b> <b>balance.</b> For example, if the borrower makes a minimum payment of $1,000 and the ARM has accrued monthly interest of $1,500, $500 will be added to the borrower's loan balance. Moreover, the next month's interest-only payment will be calculated using the new, higher <b>principal</b> <b>balance.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{a portion}} of every payment is applied towards both the {{interest}} and the <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> of the loan, the exact amount applied to principal each time varies (with the remainder going to interest). An amortization schedule indicates the specific monetary amount put towards interest, {{as well as the}} specific amount put towards the <b>principal</b> <b>balance,</b> with each payment. Initially, a large portion of each payment is devoted to interest. As the loan matures, larger portions go towards paying down the principal.|$|R

50|$|The type of {{the loan}} also may affect the LTV and is {{considered}} when evaluating the collateral. Most loans include payments towards the <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> of the mortgage. These pose the lowest risk since the LTV is decreasing as the mortgage payments are paid. Recently, interest only mortgage have become increasingly popular. These mortgages allow the borrower to make payments that simply meet the interest due on the loan without making any contribution to the <b>principal</b> <b>balance.</b> In addition, there are loans that allow negative amortization, which means the payments {{do not meet the}} interest due on loan. Therefore, the interest that is not paid is subsequently added to the <b>principal</b> <b>balance</b> {{of the loan}}. In this case, it is possible to owe more than the value of the home {{during the course of the}} loan, which exposes the lender to the highest risk.|$|R
