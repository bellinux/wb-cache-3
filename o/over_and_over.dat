5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E
5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores {{even when the}} same person takes the same test <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall.|$|E
5|$|GamesRadar {{estimated}} {{that there are more}} than 80 hours of content available in the game. Villoria called the world engaging, and its replay value very high, as players can play the story <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again with a different origin. Juba agreed, as did Yin-Poole, who added that the way companions react to the player's decisions, as well as the six origin stories, significantly expand the game's longevity.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{a finite}} {{subdivision}} rule is a recursive way of dividing a polygon or other two-dimensional shape into {{smaller and smaller}} pieces. Subdivision rules in a sense are generalizations of fractals. Instead of repeating exactly the same design <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> they have slight variations in each stage, allowing a richer structure while maintaining the elegant style of fractals. Subdivision rules {{have been used in}} architecture, biology, and computer science, {{as well as in the}} study of hyperbolic manifolds. Substitution tilings are a well-studied type of subdivision rule.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Lois urges Peter {{to watch}} {{relationship}} videos with her, but the videos {{turn out to}} be pornography hosted by Dr. Amanda Rebecca, who strips after asking the women to leave the room. Peter becomes addicted to the videos, much to Lois's chagrin. She gets herself on the end of one of the tapes in black lingerie and entices Peter. While kissing, Peter rewinds the tape, playing the part of Lois taking her robe off <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Red Army was {{scheduled}} to enter Lithuanian territory from three separate directions at 3:00 pm and had orders {{to take control of}} Vilnius, Kaunas, Raseiniai, Panevėžys, and Šiauliai. The Lithuanian Army was ordered not to resist and to extend friendly greetings; its air force was ordered to remain on the ground. The Soviets came in great numbers clogging Lithuanian roads. They had an obvious intention to show power and intimidate any resistance. Writer Ignas Šeinius claimed that he observed the same squadron of Soviet planes making the same flight <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again to create an impression of much larger Soviet Air Forces.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, the world is trapped in a time loop, and only one woman, named Pam (Carrie Hamilton), seems to know. Each day the events that happen differ slightly. A bank robbery is committed <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again until finally the eventual bombing of the building is prevented. Somehow, Mulder and Scully are trapped {{in the middle of}} it all.|$|E
5|$|The {{support of}} the Celtic {{supporters}} and the team's performance during the campaign provided the inspiration {{for a number of}} books, television programmes, and DVDs. This included a book called <b>Over</b> <b>and</b> <b>Over,</b> which documented the experience of the travelling fans. The official video and DVD produced by the club was entitled The Road to Seville. The DVD edition included a bonus disc featuring the full away match with Liverpool at Anfield. A television programme and subsequent DVD produced by STV that took its name from the team was called The Bhoys from Seville.|$|E

5|$|This {{same general}} {{area of the}} {{property}} was used also for the drying of the varnished fabric. This consisted of twenty foot high clothes line-type poles that were 100 feet apart and further protected by wind-break fences of canvas. Between the poles were strung wires for laying the wet varnished fabric onto for drying. After drying the fabric was then rewound onto rollers and varnished <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again several more times to each side and thoroughly dried each time. Each application of new varnish added a thin layer.|$|E
5|$|A {{subdivision}} rule takes a tiling of {{the plane}} by polygons and turns it into a new tiling by subdividing each polygon into smaller polygons. It is finite if there are only finitely many ways that every polygon can subdivide. Each way of subdividing a tile is called a tile type. Each tile type is represented by a label (usually a letter). Every tile type subdivides into smaller tile types. Each edge also gets subdivided according to finitely many edge types. Finite subdivision rules can only subdivide tilings that {{are made up of}} polygons labelled by tile types. Such tilings are called subdivision complexes for the subdivision rule. Given any subdivision complex for a subdivision rule, we can subdivide it <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again to get a sequence of tilings.|$|E
5|$|Kingston had to {{genuinely}} slap Matt Smith {{several times}} in a scene because {{it was difficult to}} fake. Kingston recalled that after a few takes, Smith got red cheeked and grew frustrated at having to do the sequence <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. The Oval Office set was constructed at Upper Boat Studios in South Wales. Because the production crew had access to several pictures and plans of the real office, they were able to replicate it in almost every detail. The main problem for building the set was the plastering; the crew normally plaster one wall at a time for normal rooms, but because the Oval Office was round, they had to do the entire set at once. The American-style diner scene when the companions reunite with the Doctor in this episode is actually located in Cardiff Bay. The Laurel and Hardy film The Flying Deuces, in which the Doctor intruded, was done by Smith dancing in front of greenscreen.|$|E

5|$|Lacombe and Laughlin—along with a {{group of}} United Nations experts—continue to {{investigate}} increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses in Dharamshala, India report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers (104 44 30 40 36 10) repeated <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> until Laughlin, with his background in cartography, recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates, which point to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.|$|E
5|$|On Omega 3 {{they find}} several {{original}} sets from Star Trek, {{and most of}} the original cast with their bodies and eternal youth. An energy being named Melllvar appears and explains that he became an obsessed Star Trek fan after watching the dumped tapes <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again. Melllvar gives Nimoy a body, and orders the actors and the Planet Express crew to participate in a Star Trek convention until the end of time. Welshie is killed in a show of force to force their obedience. While Melllvar forces the cast to perform his fan script, Bender, Leela and Fry escape in the Planet Express Ship. Fry convinces the crew to attack Melllvar to save the actors, but Melllvar destroys the ship's engine as he drags it back to the planet.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over.</b> Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
