5|$|Bayern got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start under Ancelotti, {{defeating}} Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup. Despite being {{eliminated in}} the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Real Madrid and the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal by Borussia Dortmund, {{they managed to}} clinch a fifth consecutive Bundesliga title with three matches remaining following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg. Ancelotti was sacked by Bayern on 28 September 2017 and replaced by interim manager Willy Sagnol, following a 3–0 loss to PSG in the 2017–18 Champions League group stage and a slow start to the Bundesliga season that found them in third place.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start, completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E
5|$|Benzema got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{start for}} the 2008–09 season, scoring twice in Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse. The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As {{a result of his}} early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.|$|E

5|$|Miami got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> {{start doing}} just that as it raced out to four {{consecutive}} wins to begin the season, including a victory over nationally ranked rival No. 9 Florida State. On October 11, however, Miami traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to face the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and suffered its first loss of the season to the undefeated Irish, who {{would go on to}} be ranked No. 1 in the country. This defeat was followed in succession by two others, but the Hurricanes were able to stop the slide on November 8 with a homecoming win over East Carolina. Miami added two more wins {{before the end of the}} season, and brought the regular season to a close with an overall record of 83.|$|E
5|$|On March 25, 2010, Butler faced top-seeded Syracuse. The Bulldogs got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start, {{jumping out}} to a 12–1 lead and a 35–25 halftime advantage. Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession, {{stopping}} the run. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and re-focused the team. Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes, taking a 60–54 lead with 0:59 to go. Butler held on to win 63–59, advancing to the Elite Eight {{for the first time}} in school history.|$|E
5|$|United {{started the}} first leg the better of the two sides, and {{although}} Inter improved in the second half, neither side {{was able to find}} the net during the match, and United took a 0–0 draw back to Old Trafford. The draw was also United's 20th match since their last defeat in the UEFA Champions League, breaking Ajax's 19-match record that had stood for 13 years. The lack of an away goal at the San Siro meant that United could not afford to concede a goal {{in the event of a}} draw. A fourth-minute headed goal from Nemanja Vidić, however, got the home side <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start, and Cristiano Ronaldo doubled United's lead fourminutes into the second half. Shots from both Zlatan Ibrahimović and Adriano hit the frame of the Manchester United goal in either half of the match, but they were unable to find the back of the net, and the 2–0 result sent the English champions through to the next stage of the competition.|$|E
50|$|In the 2006-07 season Worcester didn't get <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> {{start and}} for the {{majority}} of the season they were positioned in 12th place, but <b>a</b> <b>good</b> run of form which involved beating some of the top sides in the Premiership, helping them to avoid relegation and send the former Heineken Cup champions Northampton Saints down into National Division One.|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Scotland's Home Championship win got Scotland <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start {{in their first}} attempt {{to qualify for the}} European Championships, with this and the {{following}} season's tourney doubling as qualifying matches for the 1968 finals.|$|E
50|$|Memelli's {{first season}} with GAIS got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> start as he scored 4 goals in 4 {{pre-season}} games. In the Allsvenskan he wasn't so lucky as he did not score any goals but he still played 16 games, and proved that he had other skills too. Another pre-season and 2 goals in 2 games, this might be his year. But the 2008 edition of Allsvenskan he was sidelined due to injury.|$|R
40|$|Farmers {{this spring}} season {{witnessed}} some stress [...] inducing weather, where open dates for planting {{were at a}} premium. Somehow, Iowans got the crops planted, and, in general, both corn and soybean are <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fairly <b>good</b> start, all things considered. As of mid-June, growing-season crop degree days are running about 15 percent above the long-term average accumulations statewide. This added heat may have helped crops compensate some for the less than perfect planting conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The Association had got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> start but, just as {{everything}} was going so well, the First World War broke out and the Association went {{into a state of}} suspension. The last entry in the Bulletin for August 1914 contained instructions for yachtsmen who might come across a few torpedoes, and ended with the words [...] "A reward of at least £5 is offered for a lost torpedo after it has been missing for a day." ...|$|R
25|$|As British forces swept west through Libya and Anglo-American forces {{closed in}} from Algeria, the Axis began to pour {{reinforcements}} into Tunisia. A new command under Colonel General Jurgen von Arnim was set up, von Arnim was a confirmed enemy of Rommel, and so German command relations {{did not get}} <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start.|$|E
25|$|When {{the show}} was relaunched on the BBC in 1998, the star guest on the first {{programme}} was Sir Anthony Hopkins, who demonstrated his talent for mimicry by telling several Tommy Cooper jokes.

25|$|The Heat won against London Capital on 10 January, {{meaning that}} they had got 2010 <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start with a three-game winning streak.

But the determined family refuses to give up and eventually finds its place in the poverty-stricken city.|$|R
25|$|Australia won the toss {{and chose}} to bat. The Australian batsmen got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> start, and they scored fluently, with David Boon (65 from 91 balls, 4 fours) top scoring, and making an 82 run second-wicket {{partnership}} with DM Jones. Australia {{were looking to}} reach 300 with strong batting before Imran Khan took 3 wickets for 17 runs in 5 overs. Australia lost 4/31, but {{a high number of}} extras (34) from the Pakistani bowlers, as well as the solid batting from earlier on, brought Australia to 267 (6 wickets, 50 overs).|$|R
25|$|The 1987 Cricket World Cup final {{was between}} England and Australia. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, sending in openers David Boon and Geoff Marsh. Australia got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> start thanks to Boon's batting. Boon {{was part of}} a 75 run stand with Marsh and a 76 run stand with Dean Jones and took Australia to 1/150. Boon was out for 75 with Australia at 4/168 before Border and Veletta took Australia to 253 in the 50 overs. Boon was the only batsman to cross 50.|$|R
25|$|In England's opening {{match of}} the ICC World cup 2011 against Netherlands, Andrew Strauss hit a better than run-a-ball 88 to get England <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start {{and help them}} clinch a 6 wicket victory. He {{maintained}} this good form the next game, scoring an impressive 158 off 145 chasing an imposing 339 which hosts India had set them. The match ended in a thrilling tie.|$|E
25|$|England {{signed for}} Isthmian League Premier Division promotion-challengers Tonbridge Angels in October 2010. His Angels career got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start, bagging a goal in a 7–1 rout of AFC Hornchurch on 2 October. England scored his second Tonbridge goal in a 2–2 draw with Sutton United on 26 October. A groin problem {{hindered}} his progress. He made 9 appearances {{for the club}} and scored two goals.|$|E

25|$|The {{match at}} Chelmsford {{was made into}} {{even more of a}} slog-effort by the English rain, as both sides were limited to 12 overs. Andy Flower made 46 off 29 balls, and 17 extras made the Essex Eagles run-rate exactly eleven an over. Defending 133, Essex got <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> start as Antonio Palladino took two wickets, which stopped the {{visitors}} from massive smashing, and Kent Spitfires finished on 103 for 4 - thirty runs short of their winning target.|$|E
25|$|The West Indies won the tost {{and decided}} to field.

Chris Gayle and Fidel Edwards were the West Indies best bowlers, with respective figures of 3-50 and 0-23, with each bowling 10 overs.|$|E
