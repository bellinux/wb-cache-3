30|$|Although shelf acetabuloplasty {{leads to}} {{improved}} femoral head coverage, the available literature {{does not support}} the use of this procedure to prevent late osteoarthritis and improve function long term [17]. Recently, a new labral support technique has been reported. This shelf arthroplasty technique includes a minimal-incision variant of labral <b>support</b> <b>shelf</b> arthroplasty, arthroscopic visualization, and an allograft buttress on the <b>shelf</b> <b>support</b> that has been proposed to maintain containment. This minimal-incision technique yielded similar results to those obtained using a Petrie cast, a femoral varus osteotomy, or an innominate (Salter) osteotomy. The authors concluded that the labral <b>support</b> <b>shelf</b> arthroplasty technique is simple to perform and does not induce a permanent deformity in the proximal femur or acetabulum [6]. An advantage compared to femoral varus osteotomy is that there is additional lateral growth of the true acetabulum to generate more coverage following surgery. In this way, the labral support technique can stimulate lateral acetabular growth, restore the shelf after femoral epiphyseal reossification, and prevent subluxation [10].|$|R

5000|$|The Bach Ice Shelf (...) is an {{ice shelf}} which is {{irregular}} {{in shape and}} 45 mi in extent, occupying an embayment in the south part of Alexander Island entered between Berlioz Point and Rossini Point. The ice <b>shelf</b> <b>supports</b> the south face of the Beethoven Peninsula, along with some minor extensive peninsulas and small inlets (Weber Inlet, Boccherini Inlet etc.) Bach ice <b>shelf</b> also <b>supports</b> {{the north side of}} the Monteverdi Peninsula. A minor embayment in this position first appeared on the charts of the US Antarctic Service, which explored the south part of Alexander Island by air and from the ground in 1940. The ice shelf was delineated by Derek J.H. Searle of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in 1960, from air photos obtained by the Ronne Antarctic Research Expedition in 1947 - 48. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee after the German composer Johann Sebastian Bach.|$|R

40|$|The {{southern}} Brazilian <b>shelf</b> <b>supports</b> {{the largest}} ﬁsh {{stocks in the}} country, and studies on physical–biological processes in the ecology of ichthyoplankton have been recommended to provide {{a better understanding of}} the variability of the recruitment of ﬁshing resources. This study is the ﬁrst to examine the inﬂuence of mesoscale physical processes on the distribution of early life stages of ﬁsh in this shelf-break region. Collections of ﬁsh eggs and larvae and measurements of temperature and salinity were made at 13 stations along cross-shelf transects in December 1997. Myctophidae, Bregmacerotidae, Clupeidae, Synodontidae and Engraulidae were the most abundant larvae in the northern region, while Engraulidae and Bregmacerotidae prevailed further south. In situ hydrographic data NOAA/AVHRR images and merged TOPEX/POSEIDON + ERS- 1 / 2 satellite altimetry taken during the cruise revealed an anticyclonic eddy dominating the shelf around 31 S. Larval ﬁsh abundance was lower at the centre of this feature, suggesting that the eddy advected poorer offshore waters of tropical origin towards the inner shelf-concentrating the larvae around the eddy...|$|R
40|$|The Newfoundland <b>Shelf</b> <b>supported</b> {{one of the}} world’s {{greatest}} fisheries {{until the}} main commercial species collapsed {{more than two decades}} ago. We calculated three ecological indices for individual populations and five for community from the data obtained in the research surveys conducted by Spain in NAFO Regulatory Area Divisions 3 NO between 2002 and 2013. We use data for 24 species to study the dynamics of major demersal fish assemblages (38 – 300, 301 – 600, and 601 – 1460 m depth) and evaluated how they have responded to different levels of exploitation. Trends and changes for individual populations (abundance and biomass, intrinsic population rate of growth, and mean length) and for all the community (ABC curves, indices of faunal diversity, proportion of non-commercial species, mean length in community and size spectra) were used to test ecological trends. Indices showed no homogeneous status and responded to different exploitation patterns, management, and environmental regimes in each assemblage. Our results show an improvement in the shallower and deeper assemblages and that fishing effort does not explain differences among each assemblage. Postprint 2, 277...|$|R
40|$|The eastern Bering Sea <b>shelf</b> <b>supports</b> a large biomass {{of several}} {{groundfish}} populations, particularly walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma). The main trophic interactions between dominant groundfish populations {{in this region}} involve walleye pollock as prey. A multispecies virtual population analysis model (MSVPA) covering the period 1979 – 1995 has been parameterized for the eastern Bering Sea {{in order to move}} closer to providing multispecies management advice for this region. The MSVPA model is based on extensive diet data from 70 predator/prey/year/quarter combinations and currently includes the following species as predators: walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), yellowfin sole (Pleuronectes asper), arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), and northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus). Arrowtooth flounder and northern fur seals are entered as ‘‘other predators’’, which means that population and mortality estimates are not directly made for these species. Estimates of their consumption rates, diet, and population abundance are input, however, so that their predation on prey species in the model can be calculated. Prey species are walley...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{measurement}} of ice core &# 948; 13 C-CH 4 and deconvolution {{of the global}} CH 4 budget during abrupt climate change events {{has led to a}} widespread speculation regarding the mechanisms behind observed rapid changes in atmospheric CH 4 concentrations. Using a paleoclimate scenario from an intermediate complexity climate model and a dynamic global vegetation model, we simulate changes in the magnitude and carbon isotope composition of CH 4 emitted from wetlands and fires. In a control scenario, global wetland CH 4 emissions are dominated by the tropics. During full glacial climate conditions of low sea level, tropical continental <b>shelves</b> <b>supported</b> wetland areas larger than those at present. Preliminary results indicate that any shift in the carbon isotope ratio of the CH 4 forming substrate due to changing vegetation composition may have been offset by the effect of warmer temperatures on the fractionation between substrate and CH 4. These results may partially explain why observed &# 948; 13 C-CH 4 appears stable even at times of rapidly changing atmospheric CH 4 concentrations, and help in ice-core based deconvolution of the atmospheric CH 4 record...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the 7 -dehydrocholesterol reductase (Dhcr 7) gene and identify signaling pathways involved in regulation of embryonic palatogenesis. The expression of Dhcr 7 and its protein product were examined during murine normal embryonic palatogenesis via a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot (WB). RNA interference (RNAi) technology was used to inhibit Dhcr 7 expression in a palatal shelf culture in vitro. The effects of Dhcr 7 on palatogenesis and palatal fusion were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The expression changes of Dhcr 7, Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), and bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (Bmp 2) were measured by RT-PCR and WB after Dhcr 7 gene silencing and the addition of exogenous cholesterol. The results showed that the palatal shelf failed to complete normal development and fusion when Dhcr 7 expression was inhibited. The inhibitory effect study of RNAi on the development of the palatal <b>shelf</b> <b>supported</b> that cholesterol supplementation did not alter the silencing of Dhcr 7. Shh and Bmp 2 expressions were reduced after Dhcr 7 gene silencing, and administration of exogenous cholesterol did not affect Dhcr 7 expression; however Shh and Bmp 2 expressions increased. We conclude that Dhcr 7 plays a role in growth of the palatal shelf and can regulate palatogenesis through alterations in the levels of Shh and Bmp 2...|$|R
