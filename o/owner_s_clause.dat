40|$|AbstractA {{method is}} {{proposed}} to transform automatically some satisfiable <b>clause</b> sets <b>S</b> into <b>clause</b> sets S′ having a unique Herbrand model (w. r. t. a given signature) which also satisfies <b>S.</b> These <b>clause</b> sets {{with only one}} model {{can be used as}} representations of (in general infinite) Herbrand models of the initial set of clauses. Existing theorem provers may be used to evaluate literals and clauses in the models thus represented (using the standard proof by consistency mechanism). We also prove that for some classes of clauses, the extracted model can also be represented by a tree automaton on tuples of finite trees. This entails in particular that the evaluation of arbitrary function-free formulae in the represented models is decidable...|$|R

40|$|The Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> recent Commerce <b>Clause</b> {{opinions}} {{reflect an}} apparent effort to rationalize and modernize the analytical framework for delineating the implied restraints that the Clause imposes on state legislation. In the state tax field, the Court has articulated a coherent set of criteria controlling {{the validity of}} state taxes on interstate commerce and has discarded doctrine inconsistent with these standards. In the state regulatory context, the Court has likewise enunciated meaningful decisional principles governing the constitutionality of state regulations affecting interstate commerce and has applied them without substantial concern for their impact on its precedents of an earlier era. To be sure, {{not all of the}} Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> contemporary Commerce <b>Clause</b> opinions fit easily into the suggested patterns, and what appears as a clear pattern may be only a haphazard arrangement.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Paramodulation {{can be used}} in {{conjunction}} with resolution for proving theoreIm in first-order logic with equality. Unit, input, and linear refutations using paramodulation and resolution are defined for theories with equality. It is proved that (a) if a set <b>S</b> of <b>clauses</b> has an input refutation, then S together with its unit factors and functionally reflexive axioms has a unit refutation; and (b) if C is a clause in an E-unsatisfiable set <b>S</b> of <b>clauses</b> including {x = x} and the functionally reflexive axioms and if (S- {C}) is E-satisfiable, then S has a linear re-futation with top clause C. (&quot;E-unsatisfiable &quot; is called &quot;R-unsatisfiable &quot; by some authors.) The refutation completeness theorem proved by Wos and Robinson for paramodulation with set of support is a corollary of our result (b). Our result (b) provides a link between heuristk programs and theorem-proving programs for first-order theories with equality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study {{a special}} class of binary trees. Our results have {{implications}} on Maker/Breaker games and SAT: We disprove a conjecture of Beck on positional games and construct an unsatisfiable k-CNF formula with few occurrences per variable, thereby improving a previous result by Hoory and Szeider and {{showing that the}} bound obtained from the Lovász Local Lemma is tight up to a constant factor. A (k, s) -CNF formula is a boolean formula in conjunctive normal form where every clause contains exactly k literals and every variable occurs in at most <b>s</b> <b>clauses.</b> The (k, <b>s)</b> -SAT problem is the satisfiability problem restricted to (k, s) -CNF formulas. Kratochvíl, Savick´y and Tuza showed that for every k ≥ 3 there is an integer f(k) such that every (k, f(k)) -formula is satisfiable, but (k, f(k) + 1) -SAT is already NP-complete (it is not known whether f(k) is computable).
