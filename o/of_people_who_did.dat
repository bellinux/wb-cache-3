A clear majority of them (127,350 {{according to the latest}} census in 2001) declare themselves to be ethnic Bulgarians of Islamic faith. However, a significant percentage, in particular in the Central and Eastern Rhodopes (the Smolyan and Kardzhali Province), are not religious or choose to disassociate themselves from Islam. Thus, the Smolyan Province, which is largely populated by Bulgarian Muslims (approximately 117,000 or 71% of the population according to the Ministry of Interior in 1989), has the highest number <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not declare any religion in the 2001 Census - 39,003 or 27.8% {{of the population of the}} province - compared to a national average of only 3.6%. Considering the insignificant change in the number of Bulgarian Christians (from approximately 47,000 in 1989 to 41,792 in 2001), the total number of ethnic Bulgarians in the province (122,806 or 87.7%) and that only 58,758 people or 41.9% of the population of the province declared to profess Islam in 2001, the vast majority of the undeclared must be of Bulgarian Muslim extraction.|$|E

They were intolerant <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not share their worldview.

Islamists believed that the established social and political order had tainted the ulama, who had come to represent stumbling blocks to the new Islamic order. In addition, Islamists condemned the orthodox as [...] "pulpit parrots" [...] committed to a formalist practice of Islam but not to its spirit.|$|E

When Saartje Specx, a girl whom he had been entrusted to care for, was found in Coen's private quarters in the arms of a soldier, Pieter Cortenhoeff, Coen showed no mercy in having Cortenhoeff beheaded.

[...] Giuliani argued in a court case that he aimed to introduce Nathan to his children on Father's Day 2001, and that Hanover had prevented this visit. Giuliani and Hanover finally settled their divorce case in July 2002 after his mayoralty had ended, with Giuliani paying Hanover a $6.8 million settlement and granting her custody of their children. Giuliani married Nathan on May 24, 2003, and gained a stepdaughter, Whitney. It was also Nathan's third marriage after two divorces.|$|E

2500|$|The aim of {{the scheme}} {{was to create a}} more [...] "consensual style of {{government}} where alternative views are heard and constructive dissent accommodated". NMPs could play a constructive role in contributing to good governance that the Opposition and MPs of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) could not provide. [...] While PAP MPs had been encouraged to air opposing views, they were after all Government MPs and were not allowed to vote against the Government unless the Whip was lifted. Moreover, there were very few Opposition MPs. According to Goh, the Opposition had not been constructive as their objective was to discredit the Government so that they could win office. In contrast, NMPs would not belong to any political party, and could therefore represent the views <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not identify themselves with the PAP or the Opposition. Thus, NMPs would be able to concentrate on the [...] "substance of the debate rather than form and rhetoric", and provide dissenting and constructive views that would contribute to good government.|$|E
2500|$|The indentureship {{contract}} was exploitative, such that historians including Hugh Tinker were {{to call it}} [...] "a new system of slavery". People were contracted {{for a period of}} five years, with a daily wage as low as 25 cents in the early 20th century, and they were guaranteed return passage to India {{at the end of their}} contract period. However, coercive means were often used to retain labourers, and the indentureship contracts were soon extended to 10 years after the planters complained that they were losing their labour too early. In lieu of the return passage, the British authorities soon began offering portions of land to encourage settlement; however, the numbers <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> receive land grants is unclear. East Indians entering the colony were also subject to particular crown laws which segregated them from the rest of Trinidad's population, such as the requirement that they carry a pass with them once off the plantations, and that if freed, they carry their [...] "Free Papers" [...] or certificate indicating completion of the indenture period.
