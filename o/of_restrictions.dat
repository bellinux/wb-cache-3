40|$|Objective: To {{construct}} an empirical classification {{of patients with}} shoulder complaints, and then to investigate {{the relationship between the}} empirical classification and the setting in which the patients were recruited, their demographic and clinical characteristics, and the original diagnostic categories. Study Design and Setting: A latent class analysis was performed on the combined data of two previous studies. Results: Four clusters of patients emerged, one with patients who have a small chance <b>of</b> any <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> the motion of the shoulder and a moderate chance <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> the motions of the neck, a second with patients who have a high chance <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> the motions of the shoulder and a moderate chance <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> motions of the neck, a third with patients who have a low to moderate chance <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> all motions, and a fourth with patients who have a high chance <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> all of the motions. Patients recruited from a clinic for rheumatology and rehabilitation and from the orthopedic clinic were more present in the second cluster. Patients in the third cluster were on average younger than those in the other clusters. There appeared to be little agreement between the clusters found and the classification of patients according to the original diagnostic categories. Conclusion: Patients experiencing shoulder pain can be classified in a simple way into four categories, reflecting the distinction between problems of the shoulder and those of the neck. A simple classification rule is proposed with which almost all patients can be classified into the four clusters. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Columbus Crew and Toronto FC have {{competed for}} the Trillium Cup since 2008. Although a {{manufactured}} rivalry, the meetings have since sparked bitterness. On March 28, 2009, approximately 1,700 Toronto FC supporters travelled to Columbus Crew Stadium and witnessed a 1–1 draw, {{during which they}} lit a number of flares and allegedly committed vandalism. Following the game some altercations broke out between the two supporter groups. Overwhelmed security called police who ended the melees and made arrests, at which time a TFC fan was tasered while being subdued.

5|$|Edward II's close {{relationship}} to Gaveston {{had been a}} source of conflict at court, and Gaveston's execution by a group of rebellious barons in 1312 had brought the country to the brink of civil war. As Edmund came of age, he became an important member of the circle around his brother. In 1318, the Treaty of Leake was drafted as an effort to reconcile the opposing parties, and Edmund – as his first public act – was among the witnesses to sign this treaty. Further official appointments followed. In the spring of 1320 he took part in an embassy to Pope John XXII in Avignon, where the mission was to absolve the king of his oath to uphold the Ordinances, a set <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> imposed on royal authority by the baronage. Later that year, he joined his brother the king in Amiens, where Edward was paying homage to the French king. In October 1320, Edmund attended his first parliament.|$|E
40|$|A novel DNA {{fingerprinting}} {{technique called}} AFLP is described. The AFLP technique {{is based on}} the selective PCR amplification <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments from a total digest of genomic DNA. The technique involves three steps: (i) <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> the DNA and ligation of oligonucleotide adapters, (ii) selective amplification <b>of</b> sets <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments, and (iii) gel analysis of the amplified fragments. PCR amplification <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments is achieved by using the adapter and restriction site sequence as target sites for primer annealing. The selective amplification is achieved by the use of primers that extend into the restriction fragments, amplifying only those fragments in which the primer extensions match the nucleotides flanking the restriction sites. Using this method, sets <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments may be visualized by PCR without knowledge of nucleotide sequence. The method allows the specific co-amplification of high numbers <b>of</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments. The number of fragments that can be analyzed simultaneously, however, is dependent on the resolution of the detection system. Typically 50 - 100 restriction fragments are amplified and detected on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The AFLP technique provides a novel and very powerful DNA fingerprinting technique for DNAs of any origin or complexity...|$|R

5|$|Founded in 1962, Tatsunoko Production {{celebrated their}} 40th year of {{animated}} film production by releasing Karas in 2005, their first production being Space Ace in 1965. Keiichi Sato {{joined the company}} as the project director after he pitched its concept of a life-sized dark hero to the management. He researched production and direction techniques from kabuki, a form of traditional Japanese theater; and Japanese staged sword fights as materials for the project. Choreographed sword fights rendered with 3D animation were rare at that time, and Sato felt this would help distinguish the show. The use of theatrical elements and movie shooting techniques in its presentation sets Karas apart from its contemporaries. Producer Kenji Nakamura felt the team's lack of experience in this area pushed them to ignore their previous animation work experience and break free <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> influenced by traditional animation production.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1726 Sheffield's Company of Cutlers sought {{parliamentary}} {{approval to}} make the river navigable from Holmstile in Doncaster to Tinsley, {{on the edge of}} Sheffield.

The Act of Parliament was passed on 6 May 1726 giving the Cutlers powers to make cuts and {{to make the}} river deeper and wider so that boats of 20 tonnes could reach Tinsley. There were a number <b>of</b> <b>restrictions,</b> intended to protect existing water-powered installations.

5|$|Rosenborg Ballklub is an {{association}} football club based in Trondheim, Norway. It is Norway's most successful club, having won the Norwegian Premier League twenty-two {{times and the}} Norwegian Football Cup nine times. Although founded in 1917, it was not permitted to play Football Association of Norway-sanctioned matches until 1928 because <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{on the number of}} teams allowed to join the regional football association. It then joined the regional Class B and went through several promotions and relegations until joining the inaugural eleven-conference top-tier League of Norway in 1937–38. After World War II, the club moved between the Third Division and the Regional League (second tier), seeing promotion or relegation more seasons than not. The club reached the Main League in 1960–61, but was subsequently relegated after the 1961–62 season.|$|E

After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics, Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia and Slovakia, Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. This was the only formal change that survived the end of Prague Spring, though the relative success of the nonviolent resistance undoubtedly prefigured and facilitated the peaceful transition to liberal democracy with the collapse of Soviet hegemony in 1989.|$|E
5|$|With the {{majority}} of the surplus lands still unsold, as the ten-year window expired the LNC successfully petitioned for a further five-year extension. The LNC was by this time in serious financial difficulties, and dependent on loans from its own directors to settle outstanding debts. The business had been established on the basis that the cemetery would handle between 10,000 and 50,000 burials per year, but the number never exceeded 4,100 and over its first 20 years of operations averaged just 3,200. As the five-year extension expired the financial difficulties remained, and under pressure from shareholders the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Amendment Act 1869 was passed. This removed all restrictions on land sales, other than within the existing cemetery and the adjacent reserve site. Despite the releasing <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> in the 1869 Act, land sales remained disappointing. By 1887 less than half the surplus land had been sold, much of it at very low prices.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{improvements}} in computing {{technology and the}} early development of relatively cheaper mainframe computers, which would later be termed minicomputers, led to the loosening <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> regarding programming access to the computers. At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), access to the TX-0 experimental computer was opened to students and employees of the university. This in turn {{led to the development}} of programs that in addition to highlighting the power of the computer also contained an entertainment aspect. The games created for the TX-0 by the small programming community at MIT included Tic-Tac-Toe, which used a light pen to play a simple game of noughts and crosses against the computer, and Mouse in the Maze, which let players set up a maze for a mouse to run through. When the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer was installed at MIT in 1961, the community built a video game to showcase its abilities, Spacewar, which then became the first known video game to spread beyond a single computer installation as it was copied and recreated on other PDP-1 systems and later on other mainframe computers.|$|E

5|$|Days {{after the}} 2011 {{parliamentary}} elections in early December 2011, {{it was suggested}} by Vesna Pusić– already recognized as the future Minister of Foreign and European Affairs– that the referendum should be postponed until March 2012 to allow better preparation for the poll. The suggestion was soon followed by a similar request made by GONG that the referendum be postponed until mid-February or later; its request was also supported by five major trade unions. GONG's request was made {{because of what they}} stated to be: poor information provided to citizens; undefined procedures for voter registration away from a voter's permanent residence; unclear directions for voting abroad; no legal provisions specifically defining the composition of ballot counting commissions; no provisions for referendum vote monitoring by partisan, non-partisan and foreign monitors; no legal provisions regarding referendum funding (since the 2011 state budget did not appropriate any funds to cover referendum expenses); no legal provisions funding the pro-referendum campaign or allowing the campaign itself; and the lack <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> against campaigning {{on the day of the}} referendum. The union support for this request was due to the government's ultimately not putting forward the other referendum (altering the conditions for referendums from citizens by changing the number of petitioners required and the time allowed to gather their signatures), which they had earlier agreed to do. Another request to postpone the election was made by more than a thousand signatories of a petition to the government, demanding that the referendum be postponed until after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) returned the final verdict in the case against generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač. They cited concerns over EU support for the ICTY, which they describe as biased; they therefore questioned if the EU favoured some nations over others.|$|E
5|$|Early {{computer}} games {{began to be}} created in the 1950s, and the steady {{increase in the number}} and abilities of computers over time led to the gradual loosening <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> on access to mainframe computers at academic and corporate institutions beginning in the 1960s. This in turn led to a modest proliferation of generally small, text-based games on mainframe computers, with increasing complexity {{towards the end of the}} decade. While games continued to be developed on mainframes and minicomputers through the 1970s, the rise of personal computers and the spread of high-level programming languages meant that later games were generally intended to or were capable of being run on personal computers, even when developed on a mainframe. These early games include Hamurabi, an antecedent of the strategy and city-building genres; Lunar Lander, which inspired numerous recreations in the 1970s and 1980s; Civil War, an early war simulation game; Star Trek, which was widely ported, expanded, and spread for decades after; Space Travel, which played a role in the creation of the Unix operating system; and Baseball, an early sports game and the first baseball game to allow player control during a game.|$|E
5|$|In response, on 29 March, the British Secretary of State for War Leslie Hore-Belisha {{announced}} plans to increase the Territorial Army (TA) from 130,000 men to 340,000 {{and in so doing}} double the number of territorial divisions. The intended plan of action was for the existing units to recruit over their allowed establishments (aided by an increase in pay for territorials, the removal <b>of</b> <b>restrictions</b> on promotion that had been a major hindrance to recruiting during the preceding years, the construction of better quality barracks, and an increase in supper-time rations) and then form 'second-line' divisions from small cadres that could be built upon. As a result, the 61st Infantry Division was to be created as a second-line unit, a duplicate of the first-line 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division. In April, limited conscription was introduced. At that time 34,500 'Militiamen', all of the age of 20, were conscripted into the regular army with the intent of being trained for six months before being deployed to the forming second line units. However, despite the intention for the army to grow in size, the programme was complicated by a lack of central guidance on the expansion and duplication process, and issues regarding the lack of facilities, equipment, and instructors.|$|E
