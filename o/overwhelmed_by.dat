5|$|By {{tradition}} dated {{back to the}} Byzantine era, {{the king}} was regarded by the Church {{as part of her}} head.

5|$|The Byzantine {{victory was}} {{ultimately}} a pyrrhic one, as the devastating {{impact of the}} war left the Byzantines in much weakened state. Within a few years both empires were <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the onslaught of the Arabs who had become newly united by Islam, ultimately leading to the Muslim conquest of Persia in 644 and {{the fall of the}} Sasanian dynasty in 651.|$|E

[...] She had solo exhibitions in Kyoto and Tokyo.|$|R
5|$|At this time, Ueno Hikoma and Horie Kuwajirō also {{received}} photographic instruction from Rossier. Apparently Ueno had {{originally intended to}} learn not only the practice of photography but also the manufacture of cameras. The encounter with Rossier seems to have convinced Ueno to pursue photography as a career, {{but he was so}} <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the technology of the camera that he quickly dropped the notion of making one himself. Within a few months, he and Horie had purchased a French camera and chemicals, thereafter launching their independent photographic careers.|$|E
5|$|Gen. Howard, {{witnessing}} this disaster, sent forward {{an artillery}} battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr's reserve force, under Col. Charles Coster. Coster's battle line {{just north of}} the town in Kuhn's brickyard was <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> Hays and Avery. He provided valuable cover for the retreating soldiers, but at a high price: of Coster's 800 men, 313 were captured, as were two of the four guns from the battery.|$|E
5|$|Hyperpolarized xenon {{can be used}} {{by surface}} chemists. Normally, it is {{difficult}} to characterize surfaces with NMR because signals from a surface are <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> signals from the atomic nuclei in the bulk of the sample, which are much more numerous than surface nuclei. However, nuclear spins on solid surfaces can be selectively polarized by transferring spin polarization to them from hyperpolarized xenon gas. This makes the surface signals strong enough to measure and distinguish from bulk signals.|$|E

5|$|King Stanisław August's {{acquiescence}} to the Russian intervention encountered some opposition. On February 29, 1768, several magnatesincluding Józef Pułaski and {{his young}} son Kazimierz Pułaski (Casimir Pulaski)vowing to oppose Russian influence, declared Stanisław August a lackey of Russia and Catherine, and formed a confederation at the town of Bar. The Bar Confederation focused on limiting the influence of foreigners in Commonwealth affairs, and being pro-Catholic was generally opposed to religious tolerance. It began a civil war to overthrow the King, but its irregular forces were <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> Russian intervention in 1772.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Macedonian phalanx on {{the left}} flank engaged the Spartan phalanx and mercenaries. During the initial assault, the Macedonian phalanx gave a {{considerable}} amount of ground before its weight drove back the Spartan phalanx. The Spartans, <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the deeper ranks of Macedonian phalanx, were routed, but Cleomenes managed to escape {{with a small group of}} men. The battle was very costly for the Spartans; most of their army was routed with only 200 of the 6,000 Spartans that fought surviving the battle.|$|E

5|$|The Gengshi Emperor (r.23–25 AD), a {{descendant}} of Emperor Jing (r.157–141 BC), attempted to restore the Han dynasty and occupied Chang'an as his capital.

They wanted {{a more secure}} location close to Sattar's house, as this {{would enable them to}} build a police station north of the Euphrates River in an area where many potential recruits lived. Having already had his father and three brothers killed by AQI, Sattar appreciated the idea.

5|$|After {{the three-year}} {{transition}} period ended with Nasser's official assumption of power, his domestic and independent foreign policies increasingly {{collided with the}} regional interests of the UK and France. The latter condemned his strong support for Algerian independence, and the UK's Eden government was agitated by Nasser's campaign against the Baghdad Pact. In addition, Nasser's adherence to neutralism regarding the Cold War, recognition of communist China, and arms deal with the Eastern bloc alienated the United States. On 19 July 1956, the US and UK abruptly withdrew their offer to finance construction of the Aswan Dam, citing concerns that Egypt's economy would be <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> the project.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Skopje was in ruins. Most of the {{official}} buildings were restored or rebuilt, but the city experienced new plague and cholera epidemics and many inhabitants emigrated. The Ottoman Turkish Empire as a whole entered in recession and political decline. Many rebellions and pillages occurred in Macedonia during the 18th century, either led by Turkish outlaws, Janissaries or Hajduks. An estimation conducted by French officers around 1836 revealed that at that time Skopje only had around 10,000 inhabitants. It was largely <b>overwhelmed</b> <b>by</b> two towns of the present-day Republic of Macedonia: Bitola (40,000) and Štip (15–20,000).|$|E

60|$|A controversy, {{which has}} never been cleared up, has long raged as {{to the death of}} Gustavus of Sweden; but the weight of {{evidence}} is strongly in favour of those who affirm that he received his fatal wound, that in the back, at the hand of Franz Albert of Lauenburg. The circumstantial evidence is, indeed, almost <b>overwhelming.</b> <b>By</b> birth the duke was the youngest of four sons of Franz II, Duke of Lauenburg. On his mother's side he was related to the Swedish royal family, and in his youth lived for some time at the court of Stockholm.|$|R
