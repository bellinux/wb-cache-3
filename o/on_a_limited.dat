5|$|Dwarf lemurs are {{the only}} {{primates}} known to hibernate for extended periods. Unlike other hibernating mammals from temperate regions, which have to awaken regularly for a few days, dwarf lemurs experience five months of continuous deep hibernation (May through September). Before and after this deep hibernation, there are two months (April and October) of transition, where they will forage <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> basis to reduce demands on their fat reserves. Unlike any other hibernating mammal, the body temperature of hibernating dwarf lemurs will fluctuate with the ambient temperature rather than remaining low and stable.|$|E
5|$|However, later {{experience}} with Soviet tactics, {{such as the}} Battle of Stalingrad where entire Russian units armed with submachine guns outgunned their German counterparts in short range urban combat, caused a shift in tactics, {{and by the end}} of the war the MP 40 and its derivatives were being issued to entire assault platoons <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> basis. Starting in 1943, the German Army moved to replace both the Karabiner 98k rifle and MP 40 with the new, revolutionary StG 44. By the end of World War II (which ended in 1945), an estimated 1.1 million MP 40s had been produced of all variants.|$|E

5|$|When {{approaching}} investors {{prior to}} filming, Six {{did not mention}} the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing it would put off potential backers.

The film received generally mixed reviews from mainstream film critics, but it won several accolades at international film festivals. The film was released in the United States <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> theatrical release on 30 April 2010.

5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for shredding the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> scale.|$|E

5|$|Artifact {{was made}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> budget {{provided}} by Leto and producing partner Emma Ludbrook through the production company Sisyphus Corporation. It was shot digitally and filmed {{in various parts}} of Los Angeles, California, beginning with the advent of Thirty Seconds to Mars' legal struggles in August 2008. Four camera operators taped more than 3,000 hours of raw footage involving the band, ending in 2009 with the lawsuit's resolution and the subsequent release of their new album. The footage included real-life recording sessions and legal meetings. The final film was produced by Ludbrook and Leto, who also made his directorial debut under his longtime pseudonym Bartholomew Cubbins. Shelby Siegel served as supervising editor. The film's soundtrack features songs by Thirty Seconds to Mars, with additional music provided by Cliff Martinez and Maya Arulpragasam.|$|E
5|$|By 2008, Lukather was {{the only}} remaining, {{original}} Toto member still performing with the band: Bobby Kimball {{was also in the}} band at the time, but earlier had been absent from it for some time – whereas Lukather has been with Toto since its formation. However, in June of the same year, Lukather himself decided to leave Toto. This decision directly led to the official dissolution of the band. In a 2011 interview discussing his career with Toto, Lukather indicated that the band had evolved too far from its original incarnation and that he was dealing with the physical and mental toll of recording and performing. In February 2010, the band announced that they would reunite to support Toto bassist Mike Porcaro, who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. They continued to tour <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> basis in 2011 and 2012.|$|E

Coleman was living at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> monthly stipend from the United States Olympic Committee and could not assist her. Powell rented Coleman's family a one-bedroom flat in London out of personal funds and the Oak Park High School wrestling program subsequently raised $14,000 to ensure that his mother, aunt and siblings could attend. Coleman dropped from the 66kg division to the 60kg division for the Olympics. Coleman lost {{in the first round of}} Olympic competition to Ivo Angelov of Bulgaria by a 31 score.|$|E

Officials urged residents to restrict water and fuel use, and alcohol sales were halted. The widespread flooding and the crippled infrastructure forced officials to rely <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> number of helicopters to operate {{search and rescue}} missions and deliver supplies. A helicopter carrying fourpeople, including Tegucigalpa mayor and potential presidential candidate César Castellanos, crashed on November1 while touring flood damage, killing everyone aboard. In some areas, residents did not receive assistance until November12, {{more than two weeks}} after Mitch's landfall. About 285,000people remained in 1,375shelters, many of them schools, by three weeks after the hurricane struck. Some sports stadiums and churches were also used as makeshift shelters. Overcrowding at shelters caused various diseases.|$|E
5|$|On 3 February 2000, Smith was {{appointed}} manager of Oxford {{for the second}} time in his career, with the club 21st in the Second Division. He re-signed striker Nigel Jemson from Ayr United, and kept Oxford in the division as they ended 1999–2000 in 20th place, one place and one point above the relegation zone. He signed a one-year contract extension in the summer of 2000, but fell out with chairman Firoz Kassam. He later admitted that the signings he made <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> budget, which included Ian McGuckin, Andy Scott and Rob Quinn, were not good enough. Smith resigned on 2 October 2000 after a terrible start to 2000–01, a season which ended in Oxford being relegated in last place.

5|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Elite Force, Wildstorm {{published}} a graphic novel based on Raven Software's story. The graphic novel was released in July 2000 as part of a Star Trek: Voyager graphic novel series produced by Wildstorm, written by British comic book authors Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. The book's artwork was produced by Jeffrey Moy and W.C. Carani. The book follows a broadly similar storyline to that of the game, predominantly focusing on USS Voyager being trapped by the Forge, which is controlled by an ancient race, the Tarlus, for the purpose of creating an army to conquer the galaxy. The Elite Force graphic novel focuses <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>limited</b> number of the Hazard Team, and does not expand on the plot points created by the Etherians and the scavengers in the game, instead using the Borg to fill in these roles.|$|E
