Overall, 36 out of 46 departments rated gained the top two ratings of 5 or 5*, and 76% of all the academic staff working in departments scored these top two levels. In terms of teaching strength, Bristol had an average Teaching Quality Assessment score of 22.05/24 before the TQA was abolished. Bristol's drop-out rate is also lower than the benchmark set by HEFCE <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 3.1%.|$|E

One road was blocked off to traffic during its passage as a precautionary measure, but was reopened soon thereafter. Gale-force winds downed some electricity lines in Saint Kitts and Nevis, causing two island-wide outages. The storm enhanced moisture to produce intermittent torrents over the Virgin Islands, with localized totals <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 1inch (25mm).

5|$|To the observatory's {{disappointment}} and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it {{appeared as a}} point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to perturb planets, they assumed that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that it reflected only 7% of the light that hit it); about as dark as asphalt and {{similar to that of}} Mercury, the least reflective planet known. This would give Pluto an estimated mass <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 70% that of Earth.

5|$|Excavations of {{the tomb}} of Nikau-Isesi under the {{direction}} of Naguib Kanawati at Saqqara have yielded evidence in support of a shorter reign. Nikau-Isesi was an official who started his career during the reign of Djedkare Isesi, lived through that of Unas and died as overseer of Upper-Egypt under Unas' successor Teti. Nikau-Isesi is known to have died on the year of the eleventh cattle count during Teti's reign, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom and every year during the later Middle Kingdom (c.2055–c.1650 BC). Thus Nikau-Isesi would have lived for 22 years after Teti took the throne and together with the 30 years of reign credited to Unas, would have died past 70 years old. However, forensic examination of his mummy yielded an age at death <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 45 years old. This suggests that the cattle count occurred more than once every two years during Unas and Teti's time, possibly irregularly. If so, Unas' 30-year figure on the Turin canon, understood to mean 15 cattle counts, could translate into as little as 15 years, which together with just 11 years during Teti's reign would account for Nikau-Isesi's death at around 40 to 45 years of age.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} ending the war, Macedon {{was made a}} member of the Amphictyonic council, and given the two votes which had been {{stripped}} from Phocis. This was an important moment for Philip, since membership of the Ampictyony meant that Macedon was now no longer a 'barbarian' state in Greek eyes. The terms imposed on Phocis were harsh, but realistically Philip {{had no choice but to}} impose such sanctions; he needed the support of the Thessalians (sworn enemies of Phocis), and could not risk losing the prestige that he had won for his pious conduct during the war. Aside from being expelled from the Amphictyonic council, all the Phocian cities were to be destroyed, and the Phocians settled in 'villages' <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> fifty houses; the money stolen from the temple was to be paid back at a rate of 60 talents per year; the Phocians were not, however, destroyed, and they retained their land. The Athenians, having made peace with Philip, were not penalised by the Amphictyonic council, and the Spartans also seem to have escaped lightly. Philip presided over the Amphictyonic festival in the autumn, and then much to the surprise of the Greeks, he went back to Macedon and did not return to Greece for seven years. He did however retain his access, by garrisoning the closest town to Thermopylae, Nicaea with Thessalian troops.|$|E

5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it {{does not necessarily mean that}} it was endothermic. Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E
5|$|The {{main part}} of the Confrontation is {{generally}} split into three distinct phases. In the first, Indonesia supported revolts against the Anglo-Malaysian rule in Northern Borneo, most notably the Brunei Revolt in December 1962. In the second, the guerrilla raids for which this conflict is most reputed for began in earnest, from April 1963 onwards. The fighting in this phase, while causing some damage and casualties, was relatively small in scale and the incursions were usually only made by small bands <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> platoon size crossing the Kalimantan border into Sarawak and Sabah. These operations were the essence of the initial strategy to improve the Indonesian negotiating position and continued alongside said negotiations throughout the summer of 1963. However, 16 September, the negotiations concluded with the formation of the Malaysian Federation, which included Malaya, Singapore, and most importantly, the two Borneo states (Sarawak and Sabah). In response, the raids were intensified into larger groups working with or consisting of Indonesian regular troops. This {{was the beginning of the}} escalation of the conflict into its third and most dangerous phase.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was {{embedded within a}} large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures <b>of</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 77°F (25°C), {{the organization of the}} system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18hours about 80miles (125km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.|$|E
