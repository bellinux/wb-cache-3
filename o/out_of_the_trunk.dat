5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> and branches and descend vertically into the mud. A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E

25|$|Laguna fired O'Brien {{at the end}} of the tour, {{and upon}} {{returning}} to the States, Jett, Ryan, and Ambel moved to Long Beach, New York. Auditions were set up and Lee Crystal, formerly of the Boyfriends and Sylvain Sylvain, became the new drummer. The band then toured throughout the US, slowly building a fan base but struggling to remain financially afloat. Throughout 1980, the band was able to keep touring solely due to Laguna drawing on advances from outside projects. Jett and Laguna used their personal savings to press copies of the Joan Jett album and set up their own system of distribution, sometimes selling the albums <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of Laguna's Cadillac {{at the end of}} each concert. Laguna was unable to keep up with demand for the album. Eventually, old friend and founder of Casablanca Records, Neil Bogart, made a joint venture with Laguna and signed Jett to his new label, Boardwalk Records and re-released the Joan Jett album as Bad Reputation.|$|E

Outside the chapel, the trio is attacked by gangsters saying they are looking for someone. They flee and visit Jade, discovering that she is the mother of the baby, whose real name is Tyler. They are then arrested by the police for stealing the police cruiser.

Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced {{into the trunk of}} a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> and scream at an active worker for help.

When the group encountered a small, steep gully, Clarkson tried to drive across, but failed and got his Rover stuck. May tried to winch him out, but ended up pulling his own vehicle into the gully, so Hammond had to winch both back to the starting point. Using the chainsaw and some rope, they made a bridge <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> four young trees to complete the crossing.

Hammond got through the river without problems, but Clarkson stalled, and May promptly got stuck after driving round. As Hammond was winching May out, Clarkson got his car started without any problems, which seriously annoyed May.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} trunk {{performance in}} non-acute and chronic stroke patients by means <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Control Test and Trunk Impairment Scale and to compare <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Control Test with <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Impairment Scale and its subscales {{in relation to}} balance, gait and functional ability after stroke. Subjects: Fifty-one stroke patients, attending a rehabilitation programme, participated in the study. Main measures: Subjects were evaluated with <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Control Test, Trunk Impairment Scale, Tinetti balance and gait subscales, Functional Ambulation Category, 10 -m walk test, Timed Up and Go Test and motor part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Functional Independence Measure. Results: Participants obtained a median score <b>of</b> 61 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 100 on <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Control Test and 11 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 23 for <b>the</b> <b>Trunk</b> Impairment Scale.
