25|$|In August, {{during the}} annual audit of Beznau 2, the 50 kV {{emergency}} power line was inactivated. Consequently, the diesel generator of Beznau 1 was switched on at low regime as prescribed {{by the security}} regulations. After the reconnection of the 50 kV line, the generator ran at higher load because of technical reasons, but it eventually failed due to a defective relay. It was therefore assumed that while the 50 kV line was not active the generator {{would not have been}} able to run at full loading. Since the unit 2 generator was also unavailable due to the planned audit, the emergency power could be provided only by the hydroelectric plant or backup generators activated in case of flood. The decrease in redundancy caused a deviation from the normal <b>operation</b> <b>parameters</b> and was therefore classified as a level 1 event (Swiss scale level B).|$|E

40|$|The {{method for}} {{determining}} the voltage security operation limits in a practical voltage security analysis (VSA) system based on VSAT software for large power systems is introduced in this paper. These operation limits include bus voltage limits, branch/corridor transfer power limits and P-load limit of the whole system. The voltage security operation limits {{are determined by the}} most critical contingency among the studied contingency set. The most critical contingency determines the P-load limit of the whole system, and all kinds of <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> limits are <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> values corresponding to this P-load limit under pre-contingency. An <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> limit is upper limit if the function relationship between this <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> and load power is an increasing curve, or lower limit if the function relationship between this <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> and load power is an decreasing curve.

COCO includes a LITE version of COSMOtherm, an activity coefficient model based on Ab initio quantum chemistry methods. The simulator entails a set of unit-operations such as stream splitters/mixers, heat-exchangers, compressors, pumps and reactors. COCO features a reaction numerics package to power its simple conversion, equilibrium, CSTR, Gibbs minimization and plug flow reactor models.|$|E
50|$|The type 1 {{from this}} grouping, have been divided here into two main groups: one {{concerning}} the uncertainty due to climate change; {{and the other}} concerning uncertainties due {{to the use of}} synthetic weather data files. Concerning the uncertainties due to climate change: buildings have long life spans, for example, in England and Wales, around 40% of the office blocks existing in 2004 were built before 1940 (30% if considered by floor area). and, 38.9% of English dwellings in 2007 were built before 1944. This long life span makes buildings likely to operate with climates that might change due to global warming. De Wilde and Coley showed how important is to design buildings that take into consideration climate change and that are able to perform well in future weathers.Concerning the uncertainties due to the use of synthetic weather data files: Wang et al. showed the impact that uncertainties in weather data (among others) may cause in energy demand calculations. The deviation in calculated energy use due to variability in the weather data were found to be different in different locations from a range of (-0.5% - 3%) in San Francisco to a range of (-4% to 6%) in Washington D.C. The ranges were calculated using TMY as the reference. These deviations on the demand were smaller than the ones due to operational parameters. For those, the ranges were (-29% - 79%) for San Francisco and (-28% - 57%) for Washington D.C. The <b>operation</b> <b>parameters</b> were those linked with occupants’ behaviour. The conclusion of this paper is that occupants will have a larger impact in energy calculations than the variability between synthetically generated weather data files.The spatial resolution of weather data files was the concern covered by Eames et al. Eames showed how a low spatial resolution of weather data files can be the cause of disparities of up to 40% in the heating demand.|$|E

30|$|One <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> {{and three}} {{controlled}} design parameters were selected as input variables: mud pressure, elastic modulus, Poisson ratio and void ratio. Mud pressure {{is a well}} <b>operation</b> <b>parameter</b> that represents the mud weight commonly applied to maintain well integrity during drilling and extraction process. It is {{also referred to as}} the bottom-hole pressure. The magnitude and gradient of this pressure must exceed the formation pressure gradient to avert the inflow of formation fluid to the wellbore and well breakout; however, excessive mud pressure increases the potential for tensile fracturing and fluid loss. The elastic modulus and Poisson ratio are deformation parameters that dominate control of the rock strain characteristics, particularly at the elastic range. The void ratio is a measure of consistency and packing of the rock grains and can be used to estimate porosity, specific gravity, density and saturation.|$|R

At present, however, the practical utility of such annotations {{is limited by the}} small number of service annotations available for general use. Manual annotation of services is a time consuming and thus expensive task, so some means are required by which services can be automatically (or semi-automatically) annotated. In this paper, we show how information can be inferred about the semantics of <b>operation</b> <b>parameters</b> based on their connections to other (annotated) <b>operation</b> <b>parameters</b> within tried-and-tested workflows. Because the data links in the workflows do not necessarily contain every possible connection of compatible parameters, we can infer only constraints on the semantics of parameters. We show that despite their imprecise nature these so-called loose annotations are still of value in supporting the manual annotation task, inspecting workflows and discovering services. We also show that derived annotations for already annotated parameters are useful. By comparing existing and newly derived annotations of <b>operation</b> <b>parameters,</b> we can support the detection of errors in existing annotations, the ontology used for annotation and in workflows. The derivation mechanism has been implemented, and its practical applicability for inferring new annotations has been established through an experimental evaluation.
