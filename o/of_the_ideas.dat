5|$|For {{the design}} of the Festspielhaus, Wagner {{appropriated}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of his former colleague, Gottfried Semper, which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house at Munich.

5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> in The Satanic Bible {{are shaped}} around a secular, {{scientific}} {{view of the}} world. However, some of these ideas continue beyond present-day secularism by implying that various occult forces are not supernatural, but rather thus far undiscovered by science.

5|$|As {{the first}} new high school built in several years, many unorthodox ideas were suggested.

School officials wished to create a balance of college prep classes and vocational programs. The school was planned as and is now a citywide magnet school with no attendance boundary. An emphasis on technology was integrated into the plans for the school.|$|E
5|$|Henri IV was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy {{built to}} test some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of the prominent naval architect Louis-Émile Bertin. She began World War I as guardship at Bizerte. She {{was sent to}} reinforce the Allied naval force in the Dardanelles campaign of 1915, although some of her secondary armament had been removed for transfer to Serbia in 1914. Afterwards, she was relegated to second-line roles before being sent to Taranto as a depot ship in 1918. She was struck from the navy list in 1920 and scrapped the following year.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Alma Books, Whitehead states {{that the concept of}} the book originated from an article about the naming process for new pharmaceuticals such as Prozac. The article made Whitehead question how a similar process is used to assert a certain control over one's environment (his example is a boulevard named after a particular person), and yoking the two concepts was the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> that led to his composition of the novel.|$|E
5|$|In later {{editions of}} the book, Darwin traced {{evolutionary}} ideas {{as far back as}} Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with a study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main character's, Colonel Jacque's, misconception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being a complete gentleman in Daniel Defoe's <b>The</b> History <b>of</b> Colonel Jacque. In this thesis, the thesis writer needs to know the factor that causes Colonel Jacque's misconception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being a complete gentleman, and his idea about what a gentleman is. To analyze the novel, the thesis writer uses library research, consists <b>of</b> critics' opinions, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being a gentleman and also some data about the novel and the author; and literary approach concerning characterization. In the analysis, the thesis writer assumes that Colonel Jacque's innocence is the factor that leads him to his misconception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being a complete gentleman. Because of his innocence, he knows nothing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being a gentleman. His misconception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> being a complete gentleman is shaped as {{he wants to be}} a gentleman; while on the other hand, he does not know the proper manners owned by a complete gentleman. His innocence makes him take every action he considers as the attitude possessed by a gentleman. He does not know whether the action is really not the proper attitude possessed by a true gentleman...|$|R

5|$|In the October 1917 elections, the Social Democrats {{lost their}} {{absolute}} majority, which radicalized {{the labor movement}} and decreased support for moderate politics. The crisis of July 1917 did not bring about the Red Revolution in January 1918 on their own, but together with political development based on the commoners' interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> of Fennomania and socialism, the events were decisive for the goals of a Finnish revolution. In order to win power, the socialists had to overcome the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> for {{the series}} {{originated}} in an unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in 1989. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life, and turned to Tom Kenny, {{who had worked with}} him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy!, but both of these were changed, as the name was already trademarked.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob SquarePants is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon.

5|$|Written by Douglas Adams, {{this was}} one of several ideas that Adams {{proposed}} to the production office around 1976. It was rejected by script editor Robert Holmes, who nonetheless encouraged Adams to continue submitting material; this ultimately led to his commission for The Pirate Planet. In 1980, Adams revised The Krikkitmen for use by Paramount Pictures as a potential Doctor Who feature film, although nothing came of this project. Finally, Adams included many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> from The Krikkitmen in his novel Life, the Universe and Everything, the second sequel to his The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Mired in this {{theoretical}} crisis, the Modern Benoni remained unpopular in the 1990s. Veselin Topalov was {{the only}} top-level player to play it regularly, and he too generally preferred the 2...e6 3.Nf3 c5 move order. At {{the beginning of the}} new millennium, the theoretician John Watson published a well-regarded survey of the opening that {{may have contributed to the}} opening's revival. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> he recommended, such as 9...Qh4+ versus the Taimanov Attack and 9...Nh5 in the Modern Main Line, grew in popularity after its publication. The opening regained some more of its former respectability when Vladimir Kramnik, needing a win with Black against Peter Leko, played it in the second to last game of the 2004 World Championship. While he did achieve a winning position at one point, the game ended in a draw. Nevertheless, Étienne Bacrot, Boris Gelfand and Vassily Ivanchuk have all since used the Modern Benoni at the highest levels of competition, while Vugar Gashimov became the opening's most notable proponent. He was the strongest player willing to use the original 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 c5 3.d5 e6 move order and defend Black's cause in both the Taimanov Attack and the Modern Main Line.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the closure}} of the chapel in the 1980s, the size of the {{congregation}} had declined and the fabric of the building was deteriorating. In 1978 the decorative plaster ceiling was replaced with a suspended ceiling of acoustic tiles, with further repairs carried out under the Manpower Services Commission. During the course of these repairs, discussions took place {{about the future of the}} building and its dwindling congregation. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> for developing the building came to fruition, and worship in the chapel ended in December 1985. Permission to demolish the building was refused because of its listed status. It was bought by a private individual in 1987, but the plan to convert it into a nightclub was declined. The building was acquired by the Bethesda Heritage Trust in 2000. After the Bethesda Heritage Trust failed to raise sufficient finance to continue worship, in 2002 it passed into the ownership of the Historic Chapels Trust, an organisation which aims to find community uses for the buildings in its care.|$|E

5|$|The cover art was {{conceived}} by Weymouth and Frantz {{with the help}} of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his MIT Media Lab team. Using Melody Attack as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The planes are an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas.</b> The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with TalkingHeads—but decided against it in the end.|$|E
5|$|The expeditions and {{the making}} of the {{attraction}} were chronicled in three documentaries broadcast on Discovery's cable television channels in April 2006. The first was Expedition Everest: Journey to Sacred Lands, broadcast on the Travel Channel on April 9 to coincide with the attraction's grand opening. The second, Building A Thrill Ride: Expedition Everest, was aired on April 10 and detailed the planning and construction of the ride, along with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> that made it possible. (During construction, for example, instead of traditional scaffolding the Imagineers used interior poles that poked through the outside of the mountain and were connected by wooden platforms.) This documentary also featured survival tips from Les Stroud. The third, , was broadcast on Animal Planet on April 15 and featured American animal and nature conservationist Jeff Corwin.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of San Martín repeated some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> {{outlined in the}} Operations plan, drafted by Mariano Moreno {{at the beginning of}} the war. A combination of incentives, confiscations and planned economy allowed the country to provision the army: gunpowder, pieces of artillery, mules and horses, food, military clothing, etc. Mining increased, with increased extraction of lead, copper, saltpeter, sulfur and borax, which had several usages and improved local finances. Hundreds of women wove clothing used by the soldiers. Father José Luis Beltrán headed a military factory of 700 men, which produced rifles and horseshoes. San Martín stayed on good terms with both the {{government of}} Buenos Aires and the provincial caudillos, without fully allying with either one. He was able to receive provisions from both. He considered that the war of independence took priority over the civil wars.|$|E
