(On the American version of that compilation, the original four-minute studio version of [...] "Astronomy Domine" [...] was replaced with the eight-minute live version found on Ummagumma.)

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1977, bassist Mark Evans was fired; purportedly to {{find someone}} who could sing backup vocals. Evans {{described}} disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor. He was replaced by Cliff Williams. Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of Epic Records and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, [...] "You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was just too much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> guy." [...] Mark Evans' autobiography, DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the actors}} {{went before the}} cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied {{directly}} to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. Welles was allergic to Max Factor's gum, so Seiderman invented an alternative that also photographed more realistically. The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound; Cotten recalled being instructed to puff out his cheeks during this process. Later, seeing the results in the mirror, Cotten told Seiderman, [...] "I am acting the part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> old gentleman, not a relief map of the Rocky Mountains." [...] Seiderman replied, [...] "You'd be surprised at what the camera doesn't see unless we place it within its view. How about some more coffee?" ...|$|E
500|$|After signing for Sheffield United, Evans {{moved to}} Millhouse Green, Penistone, {{in the nearby}} Barnsley area. After the death of former Wales boss and Sheffield United player, coach and manager Gary Speed, Evans {{revealed}} a message under his shirt after scoring his first goal in the FA Cup win over Torquay United, which read: [...] "Rest in peace Speedo." [...] Evans stated regarding the death of Gary Speed that [...] "I was {{a man on a}} mission. I had a message on my top for Gary Speed which I wanted to show. I'm thankful I got the goal... the crowd started singing – it gave me goose pimples... not one person has a bad word to say about him, he was a gentleman... even people who haven't met him know how much <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> man he was... it still hasn't hit home, it still feels surreal." ...|$|E

500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's kind <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> thing to have achieved." ...|$|E
500|$|Oxbow drew post {{position}} {{five for}} the Haskell, carried the highest weight at 122 pounds, {{and was the}} second favorite in the race behind Verrazano. [...] Leading for {{the early part of}} the race, Oxbow was challenged for the lead by Verrazano at the three-quarter-mile marker, then weakened and finished fourth, earning another $60,000. Stevens felt something was wrong with Oxbow at the half-mile pole, later saying the horse [...] "didn’t feel like he did in any of the Triple Crown races", and Lukas stated the jockey [...] "kind of held" [...] Oxbow from that point on. Oxbow was pulled up soon after crossing the finish line, then his rider jumped off and removed the saddle when Oxbow failed to jog sound on the track. [...] The horse walked back to the barn without obvious sign of injury, and radiographs of his right front ankle revealed no fracture, but he did have a soft tissue injury to the area, described as a [...] "sprain". Of Oxbow's overall health, Lukas commented, [...] "he had a pretty set of X-rays. It's amazing. For a horse with that many , they were really clean." [...] Nonetheless, as a result of the soft tissue injury, Oxbow was taken out of races for the duration of the summer, and after three weeks of hand-walking at Saratoga was shipped home to Calumet in mid-August, with an announcement that he was not anticipated to run again in 2013. Lukas said: [...] "He's been a warrior and a hell <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> horse for us and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize his future down the line." [...] On October 25, 2013, Calumet Farm announced the decision to retire Oxbow. Combined with his winnings in his two-year-old season, his lifetime race earnings were $1,243,500. [...] He stood at stud for the 2014 breeding season at [...] Taylor Made Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, for an introductory stud fee of $20,000. He closed out the year ranked 17th in earnings with $1,146,000 won in 2013. For the 2015 season he moves to Calumet Farms, where he joins seven other stallions, including English Channel, who sired 2014 Travers Stakes winner V.E. Day.|$|E

2500|$|Ferris gave {{a number}} of well-regarded performances, {{but she did not}} become a big star.

For a while, after Catch Us If You Can, she acquired a certain [...] "pin-up" [...] status [...] The New York Times review <b>of</b> <b>A</b> <b>Nice</b> Girl Like You by Roger Greenspun contained a vignette of Ferris in the late 1960s:"Barbara Ferris is a strong-featured girl with an odd facial resemblance to Noël Coward. Despite her winsome smile, flaxen hair and peaches-and-cream complexion, she plays innocence {{as if it were an}} allegory of experience and lines of calculation enmesh the cornflowers." ...|$|E

But the thing that killed the Tarpon was the fact that we didn't have a V-8 for it at that time.... Roy Abernethy didn't like little cars. Never did. He liked big cars, because he was a big guy -- hell <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>nice</b> guy. And he felt that this car was too small, so he said, [...] "Well, heck, Teague, why don't you just put it on the Rambler Classic wheel-base?
