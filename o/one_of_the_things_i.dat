500|$|Chosen to play female lead Sadie Hermann, Dorothy Mackaill {{opined that}} the film would appeal to [...] "every girl in America". She {{believed}} that [...] "there is not a situation in this picture which could not happen to any girl. That is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> like about it. There is nothing in it {{that could not be}} true." [...] The rest of the cast includes Charles Murray as a driver, Peggy Shaw as Ethel, Gaston Glass as Fred Perry, and Bernard Randall portraying Brown.|$|E
500|$|Director Kim Manners, {{realizing the}} monotony {{of some of the}} scenes, such as Mulder waking up after each {{successive}} explosion, attempted to make each camera angle interesting. He diagrammed every camera angle and move to make the scenes visually appealing and hold the viewers' attention. First assistant director Bruce Carter examined the script and created a complex timeline to make shooting easier. It took him two weeks to break all the episode's elements into their exact timings, but Carter considered it a success: [...] "It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> was proudest of all year." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we pride {{ourselves}} in with Lost Girl is, it's not about this heterosexual couple, this homosexual couple - it's {{just about the}} relationship; about two people who love each other, and I think that is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that makes our show really special.|$|R

2500|$|However, when {{invited to}} extend his contract, Garðar declined. [...] "I {{took a couple of}} days to think it over but it wasn't a {{difficult}} decision. I knew I wanted to move on. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> had to do on my journey but I loved opera more." [...] He won a scholarship to the opera course at the Royal Academy of Music, where both his sister Nanna and mezzo-soprano Katherine Jenkins were at the time. At the Academy, roles he sang included Florville in Il signor Bruschino and Fenton in Verdi's Falstaff.|$|E
2500|$|Webb {{also stated}} that Deschanel's {{character}}, Summer, {{is based on a}} stock character type; [...] "Yes, Summer is an immature view of a woman. She's Tom's view of a woman. He doesn't see her complexity and the consequence for him is heartbreak. In Tom's eyes, Summer is perfection, but perfection has no depth. Summer's not a girl, she's a phase." [...] Gordon-Levitt explained that he was drawn to the role of Tom because of his relatability to the character. [...] "I've had my heart broken before. Truly, truly broken. But when I look back at me in my heartbroken phase, it's pretty hilarious, because it felt so much more extreme than it really was. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> love about 500 Days of Summer is that it doesn't make light of what we go through in romances, but it is honest about it and shows it for what it is, which is often profoundly funny".|$|E
2500|$|Gingrich has {{described}} Sharia (Islamic law) as a [...] "mortal threat" [...] {{and called for}} federal legislation that would ban its use throughout the United States. In November 2010, voters in Oklahoma considered a ballot measure banning Sharia from state courts. In a speech on July 29, 2010, at the American Enterprise Institute, he stated: [...] "The fight against sharia and the maddrassas and mosques which teach hatred and fanaticism {{is the heart of}} the enemy movement from which the terrorists spring forth. ... <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> am going to suggest today is a federal law which says no court anywhere in the United States under any circumstance is allowed to consider Sharia as a replacement for American law." [...] During a town hall meeting in South Carolina, after being asked whether he would endorse a Muslim for president, he replied that he would only do so if the person denounced sharia law or refused to impose it on others.|$|E

2500|$|Cage is seen {{wearing a}} black hoodie {{throughout}} the series, which, beyond being practical for a character trying to lie low, was a nod to Trayvon Martin and Black Lives Matter. Colter said {{it was meant to}} invoke [...] "the idea that a black man in a hoodie isn’t necessarily a threat. He might just be a hero." [...] The series also features a political campaign with the slogan [...] "Keep Harlem Black", [...] "in the face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize Harlem’s cultural history." [...] Discussing these racial undertones, Coker asked, [...] "how does the presence of a bulletproof black man change the ecosystem of a neighborhood? Not just in terms of the street-level crime. How do the cops react to someone like that? What are the ripple effects of doing that? That’s <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> wanted to explore on the show". He added that [...] "when you’re a black superhero you can’t erase the notion that you’re black. If you’re black living in the community and you want to change things, {{there are going to be}} things that happen." [...] He did caution comparisons to recent headlines involving racial tension given when they had begun working on the show, stating that his focus had been on [...] "identity", which he saw as a common element in all black art.|$|E
2500|$|Denisof {{had earlier}} {{stated that he}} thought [...] "it's better for the father [...] {{to be kept in}} the {{background}} and not become part of the story." [...] When Wesley's father finally did appear in Angel season five, he said:I had mixed feelings [...] It was {{a lot of pressure to}} have to define something that had been speculated about for many years. I was worried that by making it specific, it would lose its power, both in the mind of the character and in the minds of the audience. All my concerns disappeared as soon as I read it. There are responses to powerful figures in your life, like your parents, that you can't necessarily control. Wesley's a very controlled person on the exterior and presents a very collected persona to the people around him, being with his father he would no longer be able to control his responses. That's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> wanted to explore with this, the subtle ways in which you respond to the conditioning of your parents. Wesley has difficulty around his father on a physical level, on an emotional scale, and on an intellectual scale. He is extremely intimidated by his father, and at the same time, still seeking the approval that we all essentially want from our parents when we're children. The shooting [...] was an exhilarating moment in which there was the most dangerous person in his life on every level, and there is a woman he is obsessed with. And to have the woman jeopardized by something as dangerous as his father [...] I played that moment as a moment of pure instinct. Wesley is centered in his intellect and is more uncertain in his emotional life, but in that moment, he becomes pure instinct because he has to choose between the woman he loves and his father.|$|E

That is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> love you for. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> loved my dear Dr. McQueen for." [...] She looked up suddenly. [...] "I have told him also about you." ...|$|E
