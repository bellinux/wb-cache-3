40|$|Angular {{displacement}} from linear overlap of but a {{few degrees}} in the transition state of the enzyme-substrate complex has been postulated to be of great kinetic significance (“orbital steering”). The concept of <b>orbital</b> <b>steering</b> is shown to have evolved from the orientation parameters of an equation previously proposed to evaluate the kinetic importance of propinquity. This equation is shown to be naive. Arguments provided against the concept of <b>orbital</b> <b>steering</b> include: (a) force constants predicted from <b>orbital</b> <b>steering</b> are about 100 times those experimentally determined from displacement of nuclei in a direction normal to the axis of a covalent bond (for example, at room temperature vibrational bending amplitudes of + 5 ° or more are common); (b) because of the lessened directionality of orbitals containing nonbonded electron pairs, the force constants in transition states should be even smaller than {{in the case of}} a covalent bond; and (c) molecular orbital calculations predict shallow total energy minima for orbital alignment. The experimental rate data offered as a basis for the concept of <b>orbital</b> <b>steering</b> are shown to find rationalization in the previously observed dependence of ΔS‡ on kinetic order and the energy requirements for the freezing-out of single bonds in the transition state leading to the formation of medium-size ring compounds from extended ground states. It is concluded that if <b>orbital</b> <b>steering</b> does exist, experimental and theoretical evidence to support this concept have yet to be presented...|$|E
40|$|<b>Orbital</b> <b>steering</b> is invoked {{to explain}} how the {{three-dimensional}} structure of a small self-cleaving RNA, the hammerhead ribozyme, both prevents and enhances RNA autocatalysis. Within the conserved catalytic core of the ribozyme, the position of the 2 ′ oxygen atom of the G 8 ribose is observed to be aligned almost perfectly with the phosphorus atom and the 5 ′ oxygen atom of the adjacent A 9 phosphate group for self-cleavage via an in-line attack mechanism. Despite this apparent near-perfect atomic positioning, no cleavage takes place. The explanation proposed is that a network of hydrogen bonds in the ribozyme core orients or steers the orbitals containing the electron lone pairs of the attacking nucleophile (the 2 ′ oxygen atom) away from the A 9 phosphorus atom, eliminating overlap with the vacant phosphorus d-orbitals despite the near-perfect in-line positioning of the oxygen atom, thus preventing catalysis. Because of the near-perfect atomic positioning of the 2 ′ oxygen atom relative to the phosphate group, <b>orbital</b> <b>steering</b> effects in this case are fortuitously uncoupled from conformational, distance and orientation effects, allowing an assessment of the catalytic power due purely to <b>orbital</b> <b>steering.</b> In contrast, a conformational change at the cleavage site is required to bring the 2 ′ oxygen atom and the scissile phosphate group into atomic positions amenable to an in-line attack mechanism. In addition, the conformationally changed structure must then steer the lone-pair orbitals of the correctly positioned 2 ′ oxygen atom toward the scissile phosphorus atom in order for cleavage to take place. We estimate that fulfillment of each of these two required changes may contribute separately an approximately 1000 -fold rate enhancement, potentially accounting for a significant fraction of the catalytic power of this ribozyme. <b>Orbital</b> <b>steering</b> therefore appears to be a general phenomenon that may help to explain catalysis in both ribozymes and protein enzymes in a unified manner. © 2001 Academic Press...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{examines}} regio-and stereo-specificity for {{reactions of}} coordinated organic substrates. The reactions involve addition of coordinated nucleophiles where the specificity arises from non-bonded interactions, substituent {{effects on the}} metal, <b>orbital</b> <b>steering</b> directed by the chelates and electronic effects imparted by the geometry required for chelation. The reactions examined include hydration of olefins, addition of nucleophiles at coordinated imines, oxidation and alkylation of coordinated mercaptide ions, stereospecific deuteration for chelated N-benzyl glycine and amine synthesis organised by the metal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{begins with}} {{a brief review of}} {{theories}} and concepts that have influenced today’s view of enzyme catalysis: transition-state stabilization, entropy, <b>orbital</b> <b>steering,</b> proximity, and intramolecularity. The discussion then launches into the “spatiotemporal” model of enzyme catalysis in which fast intramolecular and enzymatic rates are ascribed to short distances that are imposed rigidly upon the reacting entities. An equation relating rate and distance is set forth, as are experimental and computational data supporting this rela-tionship. Finally, enzyme systems themselves are analyzed in terms of the distance parame-ter and the so-called “split-site ” model in which ground-state geometries play a crucial role. Among the many surprising conclusions is a transition-state stabilization by noncovalent forces (e. g., hydrogen-bonding) that are positioned far away from the actual transition-state chemistry. The model also confronts and dismisses the claim in classical enzymology that the ubiquitous enzyme-substrate complex is either inconsequential or inhibitory to the overall re-action rate...|$|E
40|$|Arginine kinase {{belongs to}} the family of enzymes, {{including}} creatine kinase, that catalyze the buffering of ATP in cells with fluctuating energy requirements and that has been a paradigm for classical enzymological studies. The 1. 86 -Å resolution structure of its transition-state analog complex, reported here, reveals its active site and offers direct evidence for the importance of precise substrate alignment in the catalysis of bimolecular reactions, in contrast to the unimolecular reactions studied previously. In the transition-state analog complex studied here, a nitrate mimics the planar γ-phosphoryl during associative in-line transfer between ATP and arginine. The active site is unperturbed, and the reactants are not constrained covalently as in a bisubstrate complex, so it is possible to measure how precisely they are pre-aligned by the enzyme. Alignment is exquisite. Entropic effects may contribute to catalysis, but the lone-pair orbitals are also aligned close enough to their optimal trajectories for <b>orbital</b> <b>steering</b> to be a factor during nucleophilic attack. The structure suggests that polarization, strain toward the transition state, and acid-base catalysis also contribute, but, in contrast to unimolecular enzyme reactions, their role appears to be secondary to substrate alignment in this bimolecular reaction...|$|E
40|$|Complex II {{superfamily}} members catalyze the kinetically difficult interconversion of succinate and fumarate. Due to {{the relative}} simplicity of complex II substrates and their similarity to other biologically abundant small molecules, substrate specificity presents a challenge in this system. In order to identify determinants for on-pathway catalysis, off-pathway catalysis, and enzyme inhibition, crystal structures of Escherichia coli menaquinol:fumarate reductase (QFR), a complex II superfamily member, were determined bound to the substrate, fumarate, and the inhibitors oxaloacetate, glutarate, and 3 -nitropropionate. Optical difference spectroscopy and computational modeling support a model where QFR twists the dicarboxylate, activating it for catalysis. Orientation of the C 2 –C 3 double bond of activated fumarate parallel to the C(4 a) –N 5 bond of FAD allows orbital overlap between the substrate and the cofactor, priming the substrate for nucleophilic attack. Off-pathway catalysis, such as the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate or the activation of the toxin 3 -nitropropionate may occur when inhibitors bind with a similarly activated bond in the same position. Conversely, inhibitors that do not orient an activatable bond in this manner, such as glutarate and citrate, are excluded from catalysis and act as inhibitors of substrate binding. These results support a model where electronic interactions via geometric constraint and <b>orbital</b> <b>steering</b> underlie catalysis by QFR...|$|E
