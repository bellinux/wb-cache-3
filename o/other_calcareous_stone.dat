40|$|Transition-metal-mediated {{sulphation}} of <b>calcareous</b> <b>stone</b> is investigated. Mixes of {{iron and}} manganese compounds with precipitated or ground calcite are employed to model natural <b>calcareous</b> <b>stones</b> containing these metals in trace concentrations. The products are characterized by Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform spectrometry. Sulphation is shown to depend strongly on the amounts of transition metals in the mixture, and calibration curves are constructed. Sulphate formations at natural <b>calcareous</b> <b>stone</b> surfaces are discussed {{within the framework of}} the assumed model...|$|R

30|$|Light <b>calcareous</b> <b>stone</b> {{materials}} used in connection with cultural heritage objects, such as pedestals, or used as wall facings in connection with bronze statues or joints often show green staining due to the corrosion products from the bronze elements. The green stains alter {{the appearance of the}} monument and thus disrupt the original intention. Due to this, several cleaning methods, often involving ammonia, have been developed for removal of copper stains from stone surfaces. This paper describes a new, highly efficient method for cleaning copper stains from <b>calcareous</b> <b>stone</b> by introducing the chelating agent ethylenediamine in a poultice consisting of Laponite® RD, Arbocel® BC 1000 and CMC.|$|R

30|$|The {{exposure}} of fresh stone allows {{the study of}} decay under real-world environmental conditions, without compromising the integrity of historic monuments. Short-term exposure trials using stone samples {{have been used in}} many scientific studies for understanding decay patterns and thus predicting future behaviour [9 – 11]. Most trials have been conducted to investigate pollution effects and have often focused on <b>calcareous</b> <b>stone</b> [12 – 14].|$|R
30|$|Rust {{discolouration}} {{of marble}} {{is characterized by}} areas or stains having an orange to brownish colour, which alters {{the appearance of the}} stone. From an aesthetic point of view, the discolouration is undesirable and stone conservators and conservation scientists have therefore worked for several decades with various cleaning methods in attempts to remove rust stains from marble and <b>calcareous</b> <b>stone</b> materials [3, 10 – 12].|$|R
50|$|The {{behavior}} of vicuñas {{is similar to}} that of the guanacos. They are very shy animals, and are easily aroused by intruders, due, among other things, to their extraordinary hearing. Like the guanacos, they frequently lick <b>calcareous</b> <b>stones</b> and rocks, which are rich in salt, and also drink salt water. Their diets consist mainly of low grasses which grow in clumps on the ground.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of nanomaterials is growing exponentially {{in the last}} decade. New discoveries and their applications {{have taken place in}} different fields, such as electronics, chemistry, biology and physics. Some innovative nanoproducts have become available also for the conservation of cultural heritage (e. g. nano-Ca(OH) 2, nano-SiO 2, nano-TiO 2, CNTs, etc.), showing interesting potentialities and advantages. However, there are also drawbacks. Extensive literature is available on nanolimes, i. e. colloidal alcoholic dispersions of Ca(OH) 2 nanoparticles, which are promising materials for the consolidation of lime-based plasters and <b>calcareous</b> <b>stone,</b> often present in ancient masonry structures. Nanolimes have several advantages such as high stability, fast carbonation rate and good chemical and physical compatibility with <b>calcareous</b> <b>stone</b> and lime-based plasters. However, in comparison to other existing consolidant products, like TEOS-based (Tetraethylorthosilicate), the penetration depth of nanolime is often limited, which may consequently result in a low effectiveness. The research presented in this paper aimed at understanding the penetration and deposition process of nanolime when applied in Maastricht limestone, a soft, highly porous substrate, widely used in the Dutch and Belgian provinces of Limburg. This research focused on the nanolime transport process to clarify whether nanolime is able to penetrate and deposit in depth in the material or if it simply accumulates near the surface. In order to investigate the distributio...|$|R
30|$|Summarising the {{colorimetric}} data {{concerning the}} Cu-NPs/Estel 1100 coatings applied on three types of <b>calcareous</b> <b>stone</b> [14], {{it was observed that}} the ΔE values significantly decrease with the curing of the matrix. Moreover, the chromatic changes vary considerably with the amount of loaded Cu-NPs (ranging from ca. 2 to 23 for 0.02  % w/w to 0.14  % w/w, respectively). In particular, the ΔE value of the lowest concentration is very similar to that of pure Estel 1100. Furthermore, the chromatic changes seem {{to be related to the}} porosity of the stone substrate, being more significant on the compact samples.|$|R
