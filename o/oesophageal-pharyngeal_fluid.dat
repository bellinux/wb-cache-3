40|$|Abstract Background Foot-and mouth disease (FMD) is an acute, febrile, and {{contagious}} vesicular disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals. Some animals {{may become}} persistent infected carriers when they contact FMD virus (FMDV), and persistent infected animals are a dangerous factor to cause FMD outbreak. Findings 300 OP (<b>oesophageal-pharyngeal)</b> <b>fluid</b> {{samples were collected}} from cattle without clinic symptom after one month FMD circulated in 2010 in China. A FMDV strain was isolated when a positive OP sample was passed in BHK 21 cell line. The strain, named O/CHN/ 2010 / 33 -OP, was detected to be O/Myanmar/ 1998 lineage with VP 1 DNA sequence comparison. In order to testify its infectivity, two cattle were challenged with OP fluid and three pigs were put into the same pen for direct contact infection. The result showed {{that one of the}} cattle and one of the pigs appeared FMD clinic symptoms respectively. Furthermore, two cattle (three pigs were also put into the same pen for direct contact infection) and three pigs were inoculated with O/CHN/ 2010 / 33 -OP cell passaged strain. The result showed that one of the challenged pigs appeared FMD clinic symptoms. Two cattle and three pigs in the same pen did not appeared FMD clinic symptoms, but the sera antibody and their OP fluid of two cattle were positive. Meanwhile, the spinal cords of three pigs in the same pen with two cattle were positive detected with multiplex- RT-PCR. Conclusion The persistent infection strain O/CHN/ 2010 / 33 -OP has infectivity and pathogenicity to cattle and pigs, and infected cattle may transmit the virus to pigs although its virulence was lower than the circulated strain O/CHN/Mya 98 / 2010. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} for prompt diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) during outbreaks, {{and the need}} to establish robust laboratory testing capacity within FMD-endemic countries, have motivated the development of point-of-care tests (POCTs) to support current diagnostic strategies. Despite numerous publications detailing the design of platforms and assays for this purpose, the majority have only been evaluated in laboratory settings, using protocols incompatible for use in challenging environments. To address this gap, this thesis describes the development of an end-to-end molecular toolbox for the detection and characterisation of FMD virus (FMDV) RNA in decentralised settings. A critical review and multiway comparison of seven assay formats and 11 sample preparation methods revealed that reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) POCT-formats exhibited comparable analytical and diagnostic sensitivity to their laboratory-based equivalents. Additionally, reagent lyophilisation provided a solution for cold chain and storage considerations, whilst not compromising assay performance. Both assays were compatible with simple sample preparation methods, removing the requirement for nucleic acid extraction. For example, dilution of samples in nuclease-free water enabled FMDV RNA to be detected in multiple sample types (epithelial tissue suspensions, serum, <b>oesophageal-pharyngeal</b> <b>fluid</b> and lesion swabs), from as early as one day post infection. Notably, when the robust field-ready protocols were deployed into challenging low-resource laboratory and field-settings within East Africa, POCT results (rRT-PCR = 144; RT-LAMP = 145) were consistent with clinical observations and a reference rRT-PCR, with FMDV detected from acutely infected as well as convalescent cattle. Furthermore, transitioning of East Africa-specific FMDV-typing rRT-PCR assays (for serotypes O, A, Southern African Territories [SAT] 1 and SAT 2) into a multiplex POCT-format enabled rapid identification of FMDV serotype in situ, confirming active outbreaks of both O and A. This thesis also describes the development of GoPrime, a novel real-time PCR (rPCR) primer/probe validation tool. By parameterising GoPrime with experimental data, collected to investigate the effects of primer/probe-template mismatches on cycle threshold and limit of detection, it was possible to quantitatively predict the performance of rPCR assays in silico. The work of this thesis supports the deployment of molecular POCTs into non-specialised, resource-limited and challenging settings for simple, highly sensitive and rapid detection and/or characterisation of FMDV...|$|E
40|$|A {{serological}} technique using {{electron microscope}} grids coated with protein A and antiserum {{was able to}} detect foot-and- mouth disease virus particles in <b>oesophageal-pharyngeal</b> <b>fluids</b> from infected cattle {{without the need for}} prior concentration of the sample. The technique was adapted to differentiate serologically among foot-and-mouth disease virus types A, O and C with antigen-adsorbed sera. When grids were coated with heterotypic antigenadsorbed antisera, the homotypic antigen could be observed in viral specimens containing 10 (5) PFU/mL, but the heterotypic antigen was not visualized until its concentration was about tenfold higher. Grids coated with the appropriate antigen-adsorbed antiserum can thus be used to indicate foot-and-mouth disease viral serotypes in specimens containing less than 10 (6) PFU/mL...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} {{indicated}} that rRT-PCR could be provided {{for the detection of}} FMDV in infected, contact and carrier cattle and also provide a rapid sensitive tool aiming to aid in rapid disease detection and control. Foot and Mouth disease virus serotypes O 1 and A still existing in Egypt. In January 2012, sever outbreaks struck the animal population in most Egyptian governorates. The causative virus was identified as FMDV SAT 2. Material and Methods: Five samples of tongue epithelium (ET) and five <b>oesophageal-pharyngeal</b> (OP) <b>fluid</b> samples were collected from FMD suspected cattle in infected farm at El-Fayoum and 20 OP samples from in-contact cattle at the same farm in addition to 30 OP samples from apparently healthy cattle at three different localities in El-Fayoum governorate (12 from Fayoum; 9 from Sinoras and 9 from Edsa) in order to detect carrier cattle. All of these samples were collected durin...|$|R
40|$|Non-immunized, vaccinated, and {{recovered}} cattle were inoculated intranasally with various doses of foot-and-mouth disease virus. Samples of <b>oesophageal-pharyngeal</b> (OP) <b>fluid</b> were taken periodically {{for up to}} 7 days after inoculation and virus titres of these samples were plotted as pharyngeal virus growth curves. In non-immunized cattle, {{the length of the}} lag period and of the growth period were inversely proportional to the dose of virus given. Maximum titres were observed when clinical signs were first detected. Three of the 10 cattle studied had virus growth rates that were lower than rates of others given the same dose of virus, and clinical signs appeared later than expected in these three cattle. Cattle vaccinated with an inactivated virus oil-adjuvant vaccine had pharyngeal virus growth curves that were similar to those obtained from non-immunized cattle for 30 h. after inoculation. Titres of virus in OP fluid samples taken 2 - 7 days after inoculation were substantially lower in cattle with a high pre-exposure serum mouse protection index than titres from partly-immunized or non-immunized cattle. Nine of 14 cattle had detectable but reduced virus growth after intranasal inoculation with homologous virus. Five recovered cattle inoculated with heterologous virus reacted similarly to non-immunized animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} {{experiments}} to investigate antibody to 'virus infection associated' (VIA) antigen in cattle repeatedly vaccinated with formalin- or acetylethyleneimine- (AEI) inactivated foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccines under laboratory conditions are reported. Results are also presented from some vaccinated animals subsequently exposed to FMD infection. Antibody against VIA was not detected {{before and after}} the first vaccination with formalin or AEI-inactivated vaccine but did develop in all animals after the second formalin vaccination and persisted throughout the experiment. After the second AEI vaccination, 4 of 12 animals developed antibody which persisted for at least 37 days. This transient response in some cattle was repeated after successive vaccinations but, in general, more animals responded as the number of vaccinations increased. After exposure to infection a transient VIA antibody response was occasionally observed in immune AEI-vaccinated animals. Some immune repeatedly AEI-vaccinated cattle did not develop detectable VIA antibody after challenge despite the persistence of virus in <b>oesophageal-pharyngeal</b> (O/P) <b>fluid.</b> The presence of antibody to VIA antigen is not conclusive proof that vaccinated animals have been exposed to infection and field data must be interpreted with caution...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{control and}} {{monitoring}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) relies upon rapid and accurate disease confirmation. Currently, clinical samples are usually tested in reference laboratories using standardized assays recommended by The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). However, {{the requirements for}} prompt and serotype-specific diagnosis during FMD outbreaks, {{and the need to}} establish robust laboratory testing capacity in FMD-endemic countries have motivated the development of simple diagnostic platforms to support local decision-making. Using a portable thermocycler, the T-CORâ„¢ 8, this study describes the laboratory and field evaluation of a commercially available, lyophilized pan-serotype-specific real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay and a newly available FMD virus (FMDV) typing assay (East Africa-specific for serotypes: O, A, Southern African Territories [SAT] 1 and 2). Analytical sensitivity, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the pan-serotype-specific lyophilized assay were comparable to that of an OIE-recommended laboratory-based rRT-PCR (determined using a panel of 57 FMDV-positive samples and six non-FMDV vesicular disease samples for differential diagnosis). The FMDV-typing assay was able to correctly identify the serotype of 33 / 36 FMDV-positive samples (no cross-reactivity between serotypes was evident). Furthermore, the assays were able to accurately detect and type FMDV RNA in multiple sample types, including epithelial tissue suspensions, serum, <b>oesophagealâ€“pharyngeal</b> (OP) <b>fluid</b> and oral swabs, both with and without the use of nucleic acid extraction. When deployed in laboratory and field settings in Tanzania, Kenya and Ethiopia, both assays reliably detected and serotyped FMDV RNA in samples (n = 144) collected from pre-clinical, clinical and clinically recovered cattle. These data support the use of field-ready rRT-PCR platforms in endemic settings for simple, highly sensitive and rapid detection and/or characterization of FMDV...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the first multiway comparison of portable isothermal assays {{for the detection}} of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), benchmarked against real-time reverse transcription RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). The selected isothermal chemistries included reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA). The analytical sensitivity of RT-LAMP was comparable to rRT-PCR (10 (1) RNA copies), while RT-RPA was one log 10 less sensitive (10 (2) RNA copies). Diagnostic performance was evaluated using a panel of 35 samples from FMDV-positive cattle and eight samples from cattle infected with other vesicular viruses. Assay concordance for RT-LAMP and RT-RPA was 86 - 98 % and 67 - 77 %, respectively, when compared to rRT-PCR, with discordant samples consistently having high rRT-PCR CT values (no false-positives were detected for any assay). In addition, a hierarchy of sample preparation methods, from robotic extraction to simple dilution of samples, for epithelial suspensions, serum and <b>oesophageal-pharyngeal</b> (OP) <b>fluid</b> were evaluated. Results obtained for RT-LAMP confirmed that FMDV RNA can be detected in the absence of RNA extraction. However, simple sample preparation methods were less encouraging for RT-RPA, with accurate results only obtained when using RNA extraction. Although the evaluation of assay performance is specific to the conditions tested in this study, the compatibility of RT-LAMP chemistry with multiple sample types, both in the presence and absence of nucleic acid extraction, provides advantages over alternative isothermal chemistries and alternative pen-side diagnostics such as antigen lateral-flow devices. These characteristics of RT-LAMP enable the assay to be performed over a large diagnostic detection window, providing a realistic means to rapidly confirm positive FMD cases close to the point of sampling...|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four {{specific}} pathogen free pigs were inoculated intradermally at the front-right heel bulb with 0. 5 ml of viral suspension containing 10 (6. 0) {{tissue culture}} infectious dose (TCID(50)) with the porcinophillic strain (O/Taiwan/ 97) of {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} (FMDV) isolated from the epizootic of FMD in Taiwan in 1997. Two pigs were euthanatized at 8 h, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 15, 21, 26 and 63 days post-inoculation (DPI), and two pigs remained for long-term observation and terminated at 400 DPI. Typical symptoms of depression and inappetence appeared in the inoculated pigs at 1 DPI and subsided by 7 DPI. Vesicles developed in the epidermis over non-inoculated metacarpals joints at 1 DPI and vesicles in the mouth and on the snout were noticed at 2 DPI. Lesions in the feet were characterized by necrosis in the stratum spinosum, intercellular oedema, and vesicle formation accompanied by neutrophilic and mononuclear cells infiltration. Baby hamster kidney- 21 cell cultures were used for virus isolation and viraemia was detected beginning at 1 DPI and persisted till 3 DPI and was no longer detectable when neutralizing antibody (NA) developed at 4 DPI. However, virus was isolated from skin samples from 1 to 12 DPI, from faeces from 2 to 8 DPI, and from 95 % <b>oesophageal-pharyngeal</b> (OP) <b>fluid</b> samples at 8 HPI. Among the samples tested in this study, skin vesicles had the highest virus titre, 10 (8. 63) TCID(50). No virus was isolated from the skin or visceral organs obtained from post-mortem at day 15 after infection and the virus was not detectable from the OP fluid from 12 DPI {{till the end of}} this study (400 DPI). By using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, viral RNA was detected first from the tissues at the inoculation site at 1 DPI, and still detectable at 21 DPI. Neutralizing antibody emerged at 4 DPI and the geometric mean NA titre reached to 1 : 861 and 1 : 1097 at 21 and 301 DPI respectively. The re-growth of hoof began at 21 DPI; however, minimal lesions including remnants of the old hoof were still presented {{at the end of this}} study. These results suggest that monitoring pig's hooves for residual lesions should be part of the FMD diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} {{indicated}} that rRT-PCR could be provided {{for the detection of}} FMDV in infected, contact and carrier cattle and also provide a rapid sensitive tool aiming to aid in rapid disease detection and control. Foot and Mouth disease virus serotypes O and A still existing in Egypt. In January 2012, sever outbreaks struck the animal population in most Egyptian 1 governorates. The causative virus was identified as FMDV SAT 2. Material and Methods: Five samples of tongue epithelium (ET) and five <b>oesophageal-pharyngeal</b> (OP) <b>fluid</b> samples were collected from FMD suspected cattle in infected farm at El-Fayoum and 20 OP samples from in-contact cattle at the same farm in addition to 30 OP samples from apparently healthy cattle at three different localities in El-Fayoum governorate (12 from Fayoum; 9 from Sinoras and 9 from Edsa) in order to detect carrier cattle. All of these samples were collected during November and December 2011 and January 2012. Results: All the ET and OP samples were inoculated on BHK cell culture and baby mice. The obtained results were identified using complement fixation test in addition to real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). In the infected farm at El-Fayoum FMDV type SAT 2 was detected in cattle which are considered as the first introduction of this type while FMDV type O and SAT 2 were detected in the in-contact cattle in the same farm. The sensitivity of rRT-PCR was cleared in the in-contact cattle as 13 out of 20 OP samples were positive to FMDV by rRT-PCR while 11 out of 20 OP samples were positive to FMDV by CFT. The OP samples collected from apparently healthy cattle from Fayoum, Sinoras and Edsa localities in Fayoum governorate demonstrate the circulation of the FMDV type A, O and the recent SAT 2 in carrier cattle which threaten cattle population in Fayoum governorate. Also the sensitivity of real time RT-PCR over the CFT in detection of FMDV carrier cattle was clearly noticed in these localities as 19 out of 30 OP samples were positive by rRT-PCR while in contrast there were only 16 out of 30 samples positive by CFT. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that real-time RT-PCR currently used at the WRL for FMD provides an extremely sensitive and rapid additional procedure for improved laboratory diagnosis of FMD especially in-contact and carrier cases. The rRT-PCR generated results in less than one day from test commencement, in contrast to up to four days to define some positive and all negative samples by combined use of CFT and virus isolation. This is an important feature when definitive diagnostic results are required in a short timescale during emergencies. Also this study demonstrates the current situation of FMDV circulating in EL-Fayoum governorate and the introduction of new SAT 2 serotype beside type A and O.
