5|$|The moral {{systems of}} religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our {{kids in a}} {{religious}} way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of this court. No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion. I submitted in silent deference to the decision of my brethren.|$|E

His comments were widely trumpeted in Catholic newspapers, which cited it as the reason why he was able to stop a communist takeover of South Vietnam.|$|E

At approximately 10:00 pm (EDT) that night, Comer told his supporters, [...] "I <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to our supporters {{to ask for}} a canvass to this election." [...] The recanvass showed that Bevin remained 83 votes ahead, and Comer conceded the nomination to Bevin, foregoing a full recount.|$|E
500|$|On the signing, Governor Henry said [...] "Although {{the events}} of April 19, 1995 may be etched in our minds and {{in the minds of}} Oklahomans who {{remember}} that day, we have a generation of Oklahomans that has little to no memory of {{the events of}} that day ...

500|$|Film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper {{gave the}} film [...] "two thumbs up". Ebert said, [...] "In 39 years, I have never written these {{words in a}} movie review, but here they are: You <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to {{yourself}} to see this film. If you do not, and you have grandchildren, you should explain to them why you decided not to," [...] calling the film [...] "horrifying, enthralling and [...] the potential, I believe, to actually change public policy and begin a process which could save the Earth." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, French {{landscape}} painter Eugène Boudin (18241898) introduced Monet (18401926) {{to the art}} of painting en plein air—"in the open air", using natural light. The invention of the collapsible metal paint tube (1841) and portable easel brought painting, formerly confined to studios, into the outdoors. Boudin and Monet spent the summer of 1858 painting nature together. Like Boudin, Monet came to prefer painting outdoors rather than in a studio, the convention of the time. [...] "If I have become a painter," [...] Monet said, [...] "I <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to Boudin." ...|$|E

After reconsidering several times, the administrator decided to keep maintaining the page, and thanked the media and his followers for supporting him.

On another note, I confess {{that it has been}} an honor and pleasure to continue collaborating and working as a team with all of you. Thank you, people of goodwill from Tamaulipas.

500|$|Mark Edwards of Stylus Magazine {{opined that}} [...] "The Holy Bible is easily {{one of the}} best albums of the 90s—ignored by many, but loved {{intensely}} by the few who've lived with it over the years [...] It puts everything the Manics have done since to shame, not to mention nearly everything else [...] ". Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic dubbed it a [...] "classic" [...] and concluded: [...] "Punk, hard rock, indie, and even metal fans <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to themselves to hear this. Anyone else may be scared off, but may just find they never look at life the same way again. I certainly haven't." ...|$|E

[...] Kieron Gillen from Rock Paper Shotgun considered Gravity Bone to be an intellectual mix of Hitman, , and Team Fortress 2, stating {{that it is the}} [...] "wittiest game" [...] he has played since World of Goo. Gillen applauded every aspect of the game, stating that Gravity Bone was an [...] "indie art game whose main effect is to delight you at every turn." [...] It received the [...] "Best Arthouse Game" [...] award in Game Tunnel's Special Awards of 2008.|$|E

The play opened January 17, 1968, {{and ran for}} 177 performances; it was staged in a double bill with Horovitz's It's Called the Sugar Plum, {{starring}} Clayburgh. Pacino won an Obie Award for Best Actor for his role, with John Cazale winning for Best Supporting actor and Horowitz for Best New Play. Martin Bregman saw the play and became Pacino's manager, a partnership that became fruitful {{in the years to}} come, as Bregman encouraged Pacino to do The Godfather, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon. [...] "Martin Bregman discovered me off Broadway. I was 26, 25. And he discovered me and became my manager. And that's why I'm here. I <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to Marty, I really do," [...] Pacino himself has stated about his own career.|$|E

In March 2013 at the PAX East gaming convention, Bastion's creative director Greg Kasavin stated that the game had sold more than 1.7 million copies combined across all platforms.

Bob Mackey of 1UP.com called it [...] "the perfect mesh of game and story", and McKinley Noble of GamePro said that it [...] "raises the visual and narrative bar for downloadable titles". Maxwell McGee of GameSpot called it [...] "wonderfully crafted" [...] and [...] "an amazingly good time", and Greg Miller of IGN concluded that Bastion [...] "is amazing and you <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to yourself to download it".|$|E
500|$|The Catechism of the Catholic Church {{encourages}} meditation {{as a form}} of prayer: [...] "Meditation {{is above}} all a quest. The mind seeks to understand the why and how of the Christian life, in order to adhere and respond to what the Lord is asking" [...] (Catechism section # 2705) and that Christians <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to themselves to develop the desire to meditate regularly (# 2707). Emphasizing union with God, it states: [...] "Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to union with him" [...] (#2708). Meditative prayer is different from contemplative prayer (See CCC 2709-2724).|$|E
500|$|Featured music {{includes}} The Dixie Chicks' [...] "Lullaby", Tegan and Sara's [...] "Take Me Anywhere", Sleeping at Last's [...] "Quicksand", Emilíana Torrini's [...] "Nothing Brings Me Down", Gnarls Barkley's [...] "Gone Daddy Gone", Grant Lee Phillips's [...] "Under the Milky Way" [...] and Matt Kearney's [...] "All I Need". Rhimes {{disclosed that}} the main concept for the episode was to [...] "go in places the audience can imagine, but doesn't expect", {{in an attempt to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] the series for the new season. Rhimes stated that she originally planned to move the timeline three months after the conclusion of the second season, but the process did not occur, due to her not wanting the audience to miss significant moments from the character's complex lives. [...] "I feel like so much happened {{at the end of last}} season that I <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to the characters to have them deal with the aftermath. And I <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to the audience to let them watch the aftermath", stated Rhimes, in response to her decision to continue the storyline from where the previous season left off. Rhimes also described the prominence which Grey's underwear has in the first episode of the season, noting how they are [...] "a key element" [...] in the development of her character: [...] "Meredith never put them back on. She rushed out to deal with Izzie and left Derek who was asking what that meant, and she never had a chance to put those panties back on." [...] Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rhimes described it as achieving a balance between the aftermath of the recent events and the past experiences that define each character. In addition, she noted how the episode marked the transition to a new chapter in the personal backgrounds of the protagonists, stating: [...] "It was mean to bring us to a place where we can say goodbye to Denny, as well as deal with Meredith's love triangle. Just remember that nothing is ever wrapped up easily on this show. Because things aren't neat and clean in real life." ...|$|E

500|$|Hurley was by now {{aware that}} his forward was using drugs, and {{attempted}} to keep his player's habit a secret while he patiently worked {{to bring him back}} around. However, Friday began to regularly miss training and Hurley's subtlety was misinterpreted as inaction by the other Reading players, who became unsettled and complained about Friday's conduct. The club became increasingly minded to sell him, but although top-flight clubs Queens Park Rangers and West Ham United were interested, they were reluctant to buy because of Friday's temperament; in Downs's words, [...] "They weren't sure they could handle him". By the end of October 1976, Hurley had given up on attempting to rehabilitate his player, believing that the only solution was to sell him to a bigger team. [...] "The squad needs you but I <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to the club because I can't have you using drugs," [...] Hurley told Friday. [...] "If I know you're using drugs it won't take them [...] long to find out. You have got to get your act together." [...] Friday was made available for transfer, at his own request, on 28 October.|$|E
500|$|The storyline was criticised by {{some former}} Coronation Street cast members, who {{believed}} the producers {{were using the}} subject of rape to gain higher ratings than rival soap opera EastEnders. Taylor defended the storyline and hoped that it would help other {{women who had been}} attacked to seek help. She stated [...] "The main focus of the storyline is the psychological effect that the attack has on Toyah. There are many women out there who have been raped or sexually assaulted and we <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to them {{to make sure that the}} story-line is handled sensitively and accurately. There is no denying that rape is a sensitive and controversial storyline. But I have put my heart and soul into it trying to portray it accurately and I only hope that women who have experienced it will think I have given it justice." [...] A show spokesperson commented that the storyline would be [...] "handled sensitively" [...] and that it would not become [...] "a whodunnit". Some of the male residents came under suspicion and were forced to give DNA samples. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) briefly became the prime suspect, but DNA soon eliminated him from enquires.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, {{speculation}} arose that Walton {{had taken}} a medical leave; however, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported {{that she had been}} asked to accept a salary cut and had decided to leave. The soap opera issued a casting call for Jill, describing her as [...] "late '50s, Caucasian, female. This [...] woman is a smart and confident CEO of a successful company. She is a mother and grandmother who wants what is best for her family." [...] However, soon after, Walton was able to sign a new contract to continue her portrayal of Jill. She later clarified her departure as having to do with [...] "family and this economy". She stated: [...] "I felt so bad that so many people have lost their jobs, that, all of a sudden, I thought: 'This is really silly. I have a wonderful job and I really think I <b>owe</b> <b>it</b> to myself and my family to continue on.'" [...] In February 2012, Walton signed a new contract with the soap opera, which would continue her portrayal of the role for an unspecified amount of time. The actress was then announced to be taking a leave of absence beginning that April, slated to last six months. [...] She made her return on November 2, 2012. After her return, Walton confirmed in an interview with Soap Opera Digest that she had voluntarily dropped to recurring status to allow for more time with her family.|$|E
