5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>permanent</b> tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if the roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>permanent</b> tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>permanent</b> tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the figures}} from 2012 show that 34.7% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>permanent</b> {{resident}} population aged 15 or over in Switzerland (around 2.33 million), had an immigrant background. A third {{of this population}} (853,000) held Swiss citizenship. Four fifths of persons with an immigration background were themselves immigrants (first generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens), whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland (second generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens).|$|E

Fourth-eight plaster casts of 16 patients from ages 6 - 13 years were appraised longitudinally. It was found that the overjet remains constant, starting at <b>the</b> eruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>permanent</b> central incisors until eruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>permanent</b> canine teeth, while the overbite increases after eruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper <b>permanent</b> lateral incisors and remains constant with <b>the</b> eruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> canine teeth...|$|R

His activities resulted in the distribution of a platinum and iridium prototype of the metre to all States parties to the Metre Convention during the first meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1889. Theses prototypes defined the metre right up until 1960.|$|E

Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice, which introduced the concepts of permanent and transitory income, a major component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Permanent</b> Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s.

5|$|Fort Yellowstone was a U.S. Army fort, {{established}} in 1891 at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone was designated in 1872 but the Interior Department {{was unable to}} effectively manage the park. Administration {{was transferred to the}} War Department in August 1886 and General Philip Sheridan sent a company of cavalry to Mammoth Hot Springs to build a cavalry post. The army originally called the post Camp Sheridan in honor of General Sheridan but the name was changed to Fort Yellowstone in 1891 when construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>permanent</b> fort commenced. The army administered the park until 1918 when it was transferred to the newly created National Park Service. The facilities of Fort Yellowstone now comprise the Yellowstone National Park headquarters, the Horace Albright Visitor Center and staff accommodations.|$|E

5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall found that people will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>permanent</b> income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E
