5|$|Balzac was a legitimist; in many ways, {{his views}} are the antithesis <b>of</b> <b>Victor</b> Hugo's {{democratic}} republicanism. Nevertheless, his keen insight regarding working-class conditions {{earned him the}} esteem of many Socialists and Marxists. Engels declared that Balzac was his favorite writer. Marx's work Das Kapital also makes constant reference to the works of Balzac and urged Engels to read Balzac's work The Unknown Masterpiece.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} northwestward to Rochester, NY96 passes through {{substantially}} more developed areas. The {{first of these}} is the nearby village <b>of</b> <b>Victor,</b> which NY96 enters by way of an overpass carrying it over the Ontario Central Railroad. In the village itself, the route meets the northern terminus of NY444, which travels north–south between Victor and Bloomfield. West of the village in the town <b>of</b> <b>Victor,</b> NY96 runs along the base of a valley separating it from the Thruway, where it intersects the eastern terminus of NY251. The route continues on a northwesterly track for another mile (1.6km) before curving to the north and widening from two to four lanes as it passes under the Thruway near exit45. I-490, which begins at Thruway exit45, is accessible from NY96 by way of exit29, the eastern-most exit on I-490.|$|E

Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to remove him from Eton a term early for a crammer course to gain entry to the Royal Military College at Sandhurst.

A few moments later, the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.|$|E
5|$|The {{unity of}} the Church had been {{restored}} only after eighteen years, when Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and Pope Alexander III signed a Treaty of Venice (1 August 1177); shortly thereafter the pro-imperial pope Callistus III (successor <b>of</b> <b>Victor</b> IV) abandoned his claims to the papacy and submitted to Alexander III (29 August 1178). Victor IV and his successors Paschal III (1164–68) and Callistus III (1168–78) are now regarded as antipopes by the Catholic Church, while Alexander III is recognized as legitimate successor of St. Peter the Apostle.|$|E

5|$|Verville {{was born}} in Atlantic Mine, {{a small town in}} Michigan's Upper Peninsula, on November 16, 1890, as the son <b>of</b> <b>Victor</b> Verville and Fabianna Miron.

Verville also began reading stories about the Wright Brothers in newspapers and magazines with great interest. Later he even wrote to the Wrights and Glenn Curtiss and received responses.|$|E
5|$|Both popes {{sent their}} legates {{to the catholic}} kingdoms {{in order to secure}} their recognition. At the council of Pavia in February 1160 Emperor Frederick I {{declared}} himself in favour <b>of</b> <b>Victor</b> IV, and the episcopate of the Empire followed him, with the significant exception of archbishop of Salzburg Eberhard I von Hilpolstein-Biburg and his suffragans. King Valdemar I of Denmark also gave his support to Victor IV, but the primate of Denmark archbishop Eskil of Lund became partisan of Alexander III. It seems that Poland also supported Victor IV. The rest of Europe, namely France, England, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Hungary, Sicily and the Latin territories in Outremer, recognized Alexander III as true Pope, even if in some of these countries there were a significant Victorine minorities in episcopates or among feudal rulers. The papal schism in Europe was now a fact.|$|E
5|$|Both rivals {{together}} with their adherents defended the legality of their elections. In October 1159 cardinals of both obediences produced the manifests to the Emperor Frederick in favour of their elects. The “Alexandrine” manifest was subscribed by twenty three cardinals, while that of Victorine faction only by five. Supporters <b>of</b> <b>Victor</b> IV, admitting {{that they were in}} minority, justified their action {{by the fact that the}} opposite faction broke the rule of unanimity and – in consequence – the election of Rolando was invalid. The opposite party claimed that the principle of unanimity had been breached by the obstructive conduct of merely three cardinals of the Imperial faction, who stubbornly refused to recognize the candidate desired by the rest of the Sacred College.|$|E

5|$|Corpse Bride is a 2005 British-American stop-motion-animated musical fantasy film {{directed}} by Mike Johnson and Tim Burton with a screenplay by John August, Caroline Thompson and Pamela Pettler based on characters created by Burton and Carlos Grangel.

Corpse Bride is the third stop-motion feature film produced by Burton and the first {{directed by}} him (the previous two films, The Nightmare Before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach, were directed by Henry Selick).

5|$|During the 19th century, Paris was {{the home}} and subject for some of France's {{greatest}} writers, including Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé, Mérimée, Alfred de Musset, Marcel Proust, Émile Zola, Alexandre Dumas, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant and Honoré de Balzac. Victor Hugo's The Hunchback of Notre Dame inspired the renovation of its setting, the Notre-Dame de Paris. Another <b>of</b> <b>Victor</b> Hugo's works, Les Misérables, written {{while he was in}} exile outside France during the Second Empire, described the social change and political turmoil in Paris in the early 1830s. One of the most popular of all French writers, Jules Verne, worked at the Theatre Lyrique and the Paris stock exchange, while he did research for his stories at the National Library.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of fatigue cracks, developing due to their low-altitude usage, the B.2R strategic bombers were retired and placed in storage {{by the end of}} 1968. The RAF had experienced intense demand on its existing aerial refuelling tanker fleet, and its existing fleet <b>of</b> <b>Victor</b> B.1 tankers that had been converted earlier were due to be retired in the 1970s, so it was decided that the stored Victor B.2Rs would be converted to tankers also. Handley Page prepared a modification scheme that would see the Victors fitted with tip tanks, the structure modified to limit further fatigue cracking in the wings, and ejection seats provided for all six crewmembers. The Ministry of Defence delayed signing the order for conversion of the B2s until after Handley Page went into liquidation. The contract for conversion was instead awarded to Hawker Siddeley, who produced a much simpler conversion than that planned by Handley Page, with the wingspan shortened to reduce wing bending stress and hence extend airframe life.|$|E
