2500|$|Fluorescent {{compounds}} {{are often}} used to enhance the appearance of fabric and paper, causing a [...] "whitening" [...] effect. A white surface treated with an optical brightener can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter.

2500|$|The [...] "Architecture and Archaeology" [...] series also {{included}} a number of larger format airmail stamps (1950–1976) with common design, although some specialists treat the two series separately.

[...] Pulver has stated that this issue [...] "is made to order for a modern specialist, with collecting challenge comparable to a 19th-century classic issue." [...] Some of the later issues in this series were printed on light-active paper, [...] coated with <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners</b> causing it to fluoresce under ultraviolet light, or which had phosphorescent tagging added.

50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>brightener</b> {{is used to}} make paper appear whiter. Optical-brightening agents use {{fluorescence}} {{to absorb}} invisible radiation from the ultraviolet part of the light spectrum and re-emit the radiation as light in the visible blue range. The optical-brightening agent thus generates blue light that {{is added to the}} reflected light. The additional blue light offsets the yellowish tinge that would otherwise exist in the reflected light characteristics. It thus increases the brightness of the material (when the illumination includes ultraviolet radiation).|$|R
5000|$|Some {{materials}} {{can be made}} to look [...] "whiter than white", this is achieved using <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> agents (OBA). These are chemical compounds that absorb light in the ultraviolet and violet region (usually 340-370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420-470 nm). OBAs are often used in paper and clothing to create an impression of very bright white. This {{is due to the fact}} that the materials actually send out more visible light than they receive.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} classes of {{compounds}} with this property are the stilbenes, e.g., 4,4′-diamino-2,2′-stilbenedisulfonic acid. Older, non-commercial fluorescent chemicals include as umbelliferone, which absorbs in the UV {{portion of the}} spectrum and re-emit it in the blue portion of the visible spectrum. A white surface treated with an <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> can emit more visible light than that which shines on it, making it appear brighter. The blue light emitted by the brightener compensates for the diminishing blue of the treated material and changes the hue away from yellow or brown and toward white.|$|R

The mortality of the formula-tion was higher and rapid than that of the un-formu-lated.

30|$|XRF {{showed the}} {{presence}} of potassium, calcium, iron, cobalt, and arsenic in all samples, including the book’s paper. Hence, arsenic detected in all textiles is more likely related to the book’s fumigation at some point, rather than the use of sulphuret of arsenic, or orpiment, used as mordant [34]. Cobalt and (partially) potassium {{can be related to}} smalt, a potassium cobalt-containing glass pigment, which could be used as an <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> in paper [35]. Relative ratios of these elements were different amongst fabrics. In general, relatively higher quantities of iron were present in two of the three brown samples; relatively higher ratios of copper in most of the greens; relatively higher ratios of calcium and tin in pinks and reds; and relatively higher ratios of zinc in purples.|$|R
25|$|Black {{light is}} used {{extensively}} in non-destructive testing. Fluorescing fluids {{are applied to}} metal structures and illuminated with a black light which allows cracks and other weaknesses in the material to be easily detected. It {{is also used to}} illuminate pictures painted with fluorescent colors, particularly on black velvet, which intensifies the illusion of self-illumination. The use of such materials, often in the form of tiles viewed in a sensory room under UV light, is common in the United Kingdom for the education of students with profound and multiple learning difficulties. Such fluorescence from certain textile fibers, especially those bearing <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> residues, can also be used for recreational effect, as seen, for example, in the opening credits of the James Bond film A View to a Kill. Black light puppetry is also performed in a black light theater.|$|R

5000|$|It {{must not}} be {{confused}} with the [...] "whitening" [...] of paper which is achieved by adding <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners</b> that usually re-emit light in the blue region of the spectrum, making the paper appear whiter by compensating a perceived deficit in reflected colours of these wavelengths.|$|E
50|$|Brighteners {{are used}} in many papers, {{especially}} high brightness papers, resulting in their strongly fluorescent appearance under UV illumination. Paper brightness is typically measured at 457 nm, well within the fluorescent activity range of brighteners. Paper used for banknotes does not contain <b>optical</b> <b>brighteners,</b> so a common method for detecting counterfeit notes is to check for fluorescence.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Stable water dispersions {{of single}} wall carbon {{nanotubes}} (SWCNTs) {{have important implications}} for their applications in biomedical and composites field. In this work, a water-soluble <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> bearing benzene ring and sodium sulfonate groups was employed as surfactant for SWCNTs in water.

For this purpose, 4, 4 ´-diamino- 2, 2 ´ stilbendissulfonic acid, an important precursor for the synthesis of fluorescent whitening agents and C. I. Fluorescent Brightener 252 dye, a derivative of stilbene dissulfonic acid widely used as <b>optical</b> <b>brightener</b> for textiles, were chosen as model compounds. All samples were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry.

The washing fastness remained unchanged...|$|R
