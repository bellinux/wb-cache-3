The spirits lead {{her to the door}} of a hidden underground room. Inside is Simón's corpse, wearing Tomás's mask. Laura finally realizes what happened: while searching for Simón the night he disappeared, Laura moved pieces of construction scaffolding, blocking the entrance to the secret room. The crashes that night were caused by Simón trying to get out. He fell and broke his neck.|$|E
5000|$|Middle Child: Middle {{children}} are sometimes diverse {{in that they}} are [...] "guaranteed to be opposite <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>older</b> sibling" [...] and often have the feeling that they are ignored in favor <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>older</b> and younger siblings. They are also described as having personalities that lean towards being secretive and can often serve as peacemakers between <b>their</b> <b>older</b> and younger siblings.|$|R

5|$|Following the Walpole sale many artists, {{including}} James Barry and John Flaxman, {{had made}} renewed {{calls for the}} establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. The British Institution, founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre, some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>Old</b> Master paintings. One of the Institution's founding members, Sir George Beaumont, Bt, would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.|$|E
5|$|In 1291 Pope Nicholas IV sent {{a letter}} to Joachim III, dated 23 March, {{reminding}} the Bulgarian Patriarch <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> friendship and urging him to join the Roman Church. The Pope also {{sent a letter}} to George Terter I expressing his hope to see Bulgaria return to the authority of Rome, alluding to the union between Bulgaria and Rome concluded in 1205 during the reign of emperor Kaloyan. Despite some hesitations Joachim III maintained the firm position of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church on the matter and the papal initiative failed to produce any tangible results.|$|E
5|$|Macaroni {{penguins}} moult once a year, {{a process}} in which they replace all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> feathers. They spend around two weeks accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult, as they cannot enter the water to forage for food without feathers. The process typically takes three to four weeks, which they spend sitting ashore. Once finished, they go back to sea and return to their colonies to mate in the spring. Overall survival rates are poorly known; the successful return of breeding adults at South Georgia Island varied between 49% and 78% over three years, and around 10% of those that did return did not breed the following year.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{implemented}} his own form of Presidential Reconstruction– {{a series}} of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to re-form their civil governments. When Southern states returned many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> leaders, and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern {{for the remainder of}} his presidency. Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment, which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, Johnson went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to destroy his Republican opponents. As the conflict between the branches of government grew, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. When he persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate and removal from office. After failing to win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination, Johnson left office in 1869.|$|E

25|$|The Polish–Lithuanian magnates were {{preoccupied with}} the issue of {{recovery}} <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> feudal lands in the east, lost to the Cossacks and Russia. There was one more and the most significant, even if belated and in the end botched, attempt to resolve the Cossack conflict in an amicable way, by including Ukraine as a partner in the Commonwealth federation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1878, word reached the Swilling's that Colonel Jacob Snively, a family friend, {{had been killed by}} the Apaches in the Wickenburg Mountains near the peak called White Picacho. Mrs. Swilling {{suggested}} that Mr, Swilling and two companions, which included Andrew Kirby and George Monroe, founder of Castle Hot Springs, go on a trip to recover and rebury the remains <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> friend.|$|E
25|$|Once {{pushed out}} of their territory, the Edomites settled during the Persian period in an area {{comprising}} the southern hills of Judea down to the area north of Be'er Sheva. The people appear under a Greek form <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> name, as Idumeans or Idumaeans, and their new territory was called Idumea or Idumaea (Greek: Ἰδουμαία, Idoumaía; Latin: Idūmaea), a term {{that was used in}} New Testament times.|$|E

50|$|III {{marked a}} turning point for Download. Their sound became more melodic and {{accessible}} while still retaining the experimental quirks <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>older</b> material. <b>Their</b> next album Effector continued this direction.|$|R

25|$|Their {{ultimate}} stunt is {{arranging for}} nearly 1000 women in Rothwell, Northamptonshire {{to have their}} bust measured professionally, complemented by receiving free correctly-fitting bras. Trinny, Susannah and the 1000 participants then take off their tops in public, revealing their new bras and ultimately disposing <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> bras in public, emphasizing the importance of wearing the correct bra size. The results find that 976 out of the 1000 women, averaging at about 90%, actually had the wrong size bra.|$|E
25|$|The game's first cover {{depicted}} a robot fighting a monster plant in Enoch. The robot resembled {{a comic book}} character, so to avoid legal troubles, Level 9 commissioned Godfrey Dowson to do a new cover. Dowson's illustration {{depicted a}}nother robot in the jungle looking towards Enoch. Level 9 was {{not satisfied with the}} result and asked Dowson to do it again. They liked the third cover so much, they hired Dowson to do artwork for the re-release <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> games as well as for their future titles.|$|E
50|$|Come Clarity {{features}} {{the return of}} the guitar harmonies and the solos to the band, and can be described as a combination <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>older</b> melodic death metal sound with their newer alternative sound.|$|R

5000|$|The {{near-infrared}} spectral energy {{distributions of}} galaxies {{are dominated by}} the light <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>oldest</b> stellar populations, and hence, the bulk <b>of</b> <b>their</b> stellar mass.

25|$|Coronelas: Up {{until the}} early years of the 20th century, some Spanish regiments had a coronela, or King's Colour in {{addition}} to their Regimental Colour based on the national flag. Although officially the only colour is the standard one, some older regiments continue to carry a copy <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> coronela which are used on some occasions to maintain regimental traditions. However, the coronelas no longer have any official standing and are not used on official occasions. The design of such colours are white with the royal arms at the centre and the unit insignia and honours at the sides.|$|E
25|$|The name Småland ("small lands") {{comes from}} the fact that it was a {{combination}} of several independent lands, Kinda (today a part of Östergötland), Tveta, Vista, Vedbo, Tjust, Sevede, Aspeland, Handbörd, Möre, Värend, Finnveden and Njudung. Every small land had its own law in the Viking age and early middle age and could declare themselves neutral in wars Sweden was involved in, at least if the King had no army present at the parliamentary debate. Around 1350, in the reign of king Magnus Eriksson, the first national law code was introduced in Sweden, and the historic provinces lost much <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> autonomy.|$|E
25|$|The Svans, the {{indigenous}} population of Svanetia, are ethnic subgroup of the Georgians. Until the 1930s, Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian thereafter. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th-6th centuries. However, some remnants of old paganism have been maintained. Saint George (known as Jgëræg to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>old</b> traditions, including blood revenge. Their families are small, and the husband {{is the head of}} his family. The Svan really respect the older women in families.|$|E
