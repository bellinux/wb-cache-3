5|$|Most zircon is used {{directly}} in high-temperature applications. This material is refractory, hard, and resistant to chemical attack. Because of these properties, zircon finds many applications, few {{of which are}} highly publicized. Its main use is as an <b>opacifier,</b> conferring a white, opaque appearance to ceramic materials. Because of its chemical resistance, zircon is also used in aggressive environments, such as moulds for molten metals.|$|E

40|$|This study {{characterizes the}} <b>opacifiers</b> and {{colouring}} agents {{used in the}} glazed bricks of Persepolis (mid-first millennium BC) and the Mannean site of Tepe Rabat in north-western Iran (eighth to seventh centuries BC). Various analytical studies show that lead antimonate and brizziite (NaSbO 3) were used as the yellow and white <b>opacifiers</b> in the glazes of Persepolis and Tepe Rabat. Brizziite is shown to be incorporated in the white, green and turquoise glazes, and is also associated with lead antimonate and CaSb 2 O 6 in some yellow and white <b>opacifiers.</b> The simultaneous formation of these <b>opacifiers</b> in one glaze might have been accidental. A possible connection between the Achaemenid glaze industry and the Mannean glaze production at Tepe Rabat is discussed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of different <b>opacifiers</b> on the translucency of experimental dental composite-resins.

25|$|The {{printing}} process involves the substrate passing through presses for lithographic printing, intaglio printing, numbering printing, and varnish printing. The inks are transferred using the prepared plates, which are replaced when worn. The <b>opacifier</b> layers enable the inks of the offset and intaglio printing {{to adhere to}} the substrate. The varnish printing stage applies a required protective varnish to the polymer substrate. Offset printing deposits a 1.5µm layer, intaglio about 24µm, and the protective varnish is about 2µm thick.|$|E
25|$|A {{colourant}} or <b>opacifier</b> – These can be naturally {{present in}} the glass due to impurities in the raw materials or can be deliberately added to the melted glass as minerals or as slag from metalworking processes. The most important contributions are from iron, copper, cobalt, manganese, tin, antimony, and lead. Opacity can be due to bubbles in the glass or the inclusion of opacifying agents such as tin and antimony. The resulting colour and opacity from a given composition also may be controlled by the temperature and redox conditions inside the furnace.|$|E
500|$|About 95% of all {{titanium}} ore {{is destined}} for refinement into titanium dioxide (...) , an intensely white permanent pigment used in paints, paper, toothpaste, and plastics. It {{is also used}} in cement, in gemstones, as an optical <b>opacifier</b> in paper, and a strengthening agent in graphite composite fishing rods and golf clubs.|$|E
50|$|The {{particles}} are produced via addition of <b>opacifiers</b> to the melt. Some <b>opacifiers</b> can be insoluble and only dispersed in the melt. Others are added as precursors and react in the melt, or dissolve in the molten glass and then precipitate as crystals on cooling; {{this is similar}} to color production in striking glasses, but the {{particles are}} much bigger.|$|R
50|$|In {{context of}} x-rays, <b>opacifiers</b> are {{additives}} with high absorption of x-rays; typically these are particles or compounds of lead, barium (often barium sulfide), tungsten, or other high atomic weight elements. Sometimes <b>opacifiers</b> {{are added to}} medical implants to make them visible under X-ray imaging. This {{is especially true in}} the case of most polymers which are often unrecognizable in the body when viewed using X-rays.|$|R

500|$|Zirconium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Zr and atomic number 40. The name zirconium {{is taken from}} {{the name of the}} mineral zircon, the most important source of zirconium. [...] The word zircon comes from the Persian word zargun زرگون, meaning [...] "gold-colored". It is a lustrous, grey-white, strong transition metal that resembles hafnium and, to a lesser extent, titanium. Zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and <b>opacifier,</b> although small amounts are used as an alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion. Zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride, respectively. Five isotopes occur naturally, three of which are stable. Zirconium compounds have no known biological role.|$|E
2500|$|Zircon {{is mainly}} {{consumed}} as an <b>opacifier,</b> {{and has been}} known {{to be used in the}} decorative ceramics industry. [...] It is also the principal precursor not only to metallic zirconium, although this application is small, but also to all compounds of zirconium including zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), one of the most refractory materials known.|$|E
2500|$|This pigment is used {{extensively}} in plastics and other applications {{not only as}} a white pigment or an <b>opacifier</b> but also for its UV resistant properties where the powder disperses the light – unlike organic UV absorbers – and reduces UV damage, due mostly to the extremely high refractive index of the particles.], DuPont, pp. 1–2 Certain polymers used in coatings for concrete or those used to impregnate concrete as a reinforcement are sometimes charged with titanium white pigment for UV shielding in the construction industry, but it only delays the oxidative photodegradation of the polymer in question, which is said to [...] "chalk" [...] as it flakes off due to lowered impact strength and may crumble after years of exposure in direct sunlight if UV stabilizers have not been included.|$|E
50|$|<b>Opacifiers</b> {{must have}} a {{refractive}} index (RI) substantially different from the system. Conversely, clarity may be achieved in a system by choosing components with very similar refractive indices.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Opacifiers.</b> Some {{solid rocket}} {{propellants}} {{have problems with}} radiative heat transfer through the material, which may lead to explosion. Carbon black and graphite are often used to inhibit this effect.|$|R
50|$|The <b>opacifiers</b> can be e.g. bone ash, or {{tin dioxide}} and arsenic and {{antimony}} compounds. They are also added to ceramic glazes, {{which can be}} chemically {{considered to be a}} specific kind of milk glass.|$|R
2500|$|The cost of {{tin oxide}} rose {{considerably}} during the 1918-1918 war {{and resulted in}} a search for cheaper alternatives. The first successful replacement was zirconia and later zircon. Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective opacifiers as tin oxide, their relatively low price has led to a gradual increase in their use, with an associated reduction in the use of tin oxide. The whiteness resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more [...] "clinical" [...] than that from tin oxide and is preferred in some applications. [...] Nevertheless, tin oxide still finds use in ceramic manufacture and has been widely used as the <b>opacifier</b> in sanitaryware, with up to 6% used in glazes. Otherwise, tin oxide in glazes, often in conjunction with zircon compounds, is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.|$|E
2500|$|Titanium dioxide is {{the most}} widely used white pigment because of its {{brightness}} and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. Approximately 4.6 million tons of pigmentary TiO2 are used annually worldwide, and this number is expected to increase as utilization continues to rise. When deposited as a thin film, its refractive index and colour make it an excellent reflective optical coating for dielectric mirrors and some gemstones like [...] "mystic fire topaz". TiO2 is also an effective <b>opacifier</b> in powder form, where it is employed as a pigment to provide whiteness and opacity to products such as paints, coatings, plastics, papers, inks, foods, medicines (i.e. pills and tablets) as well as most toothpastes. In paint, it is often referred to offhandedly as [...] "the perfect white", [...] "the whitest white", or other similar terms. Opacity is improved by optimal sizing of the titanium dioxide particles.|$|E
50|$|An <b>opacifier</b> is a {{substance}} {{added to a}} material {{in order to make}} the ensuing system opaque. An example of a chemical <b>opacifier</b> is titanium dioxide (TiO2), which is used to opacify ceramic glazes and milk glass; bone ash is also used.|$|E

5000|$|In {{solid rocket}} {{propellants}} and some translucent smokeless powders, the primary method of heat transfer into the propellant grain from the combustion process is by radiation, and <b>opacifiers</b> such as [...] "lamp black" [...] may {{be added to}} the propellant mixture to ensure the heat does not penetrate far {{below the surface of the}} grain, which could cause detonation. The <b>opacifiers</b> also prevent sub-surface overheating and localized premature ignition in the grains where imperfections absorbing the thermal radiation are present. Carbon black is commonly used for this purpose; other possible additives are nigrosin, Prussian blue, methylene blue, etc. in amounts ranging commonly between 0.1-0.5%.|$|R
