A typical patrol would last two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> and would involve the manual labour of hoisting a seaplane {{in and out of}} the water by means of a deck-mounted derrick.|$|E
5|$|Ongoing {{efforts are}} being made by the {{government}} at various levels (especially of Campania) to reduce the population living in the red zone, by demolishing illegally constructed buildings, establishing a national park around the whole volcano to prevent the future construction of buildings and by offering sufficient financial incentives to people for moving away. One of the underlying goals {{is to reduce the}} time needed to evacuate the area, over the next 20 or 30years, to two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> further diagnostic testing may be needed. Phenazopyridine may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E

5|$|Pyelonephritis {{is treated}} more aggressively {{than a simple}} bladder {{infection}} using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used {{in areas where the}} resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option. In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed. Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> of treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{young of}} a clutch hatch over two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> and are brooded until their {{feathers}} develop and eyes open {{five days after}} hatching. The young are fed on insects until they fledge 16 to 25, typically 17, days after hatching. After this they are fed {{for one or two}} weeks. While feeding nestlings, the female is dominant over the male. Cape sparrows are among the main hosts of brood parasitism by the dideric cuckoo in southern Africa, and sometimes parasitise nests of their own species.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{has some}} special {{considerations}} that affect tropical cyclone-related rainfall. Mountains {{to the west}} act as a perfect mechanism for upward motion during sustained east winds, {{which can lead to}} flash flooding and landslides in that region (e.g. Hurricane Camille). As a tropical system approaches from the south, a frontal zone sets up between the moist Atlantic Ocean and the drier landmass to the west. This boundary can set up two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> in advance of a tropical storm, and can lead up to prolonged heavy rains across coastal sections (e.g. Hurricane Floyd). As the cyclone advances north, the boundary will slowly shift west, but progresses west of a Richmond/Washington, D.C. line.|$|E

5|$|For two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> Rome {{remained}} {{without an}} emperor. By April 11, Macrinus had proclaimed himself emperor and assumed {{all of the}} imperial titles and powers, without waiting for the Senate. The army backed his claim as emperor and the Senate, so far away, was powerless to intervene. Macrinus never returned to Rome as emperor and remained based in Antioch {{for the duration of}} his reign. Macrinus was the first emperor to hail from the equestrian class, rather than the senatorial and also the first emperor of Mauretanian descent. He adopted the name of Severus, in honor of the Severan dynasty, and conferred the imperial title of Augusta to his wife Nonia Celsa and the title of Caesar and name of Antoninus to his son Diadumenianus in honor of the Antonine dynasty, thus making him second in command. At the time of Diadumenian's accession he was eight years old.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{telephone}} service onto {{the island was}} disrupted, and the only method of outside contact was by radio to the University of Guam. The Guam Memorial Hospital dropped a package of medical supplies to Yap, although planes containing aid flying onto the island were disrupted by the damaged runway. About a day after Sudal's passage, the runway was cleared and repaired, which allowed a United States Coast Guard plane to provide relief supplies, including building materials. By April12, <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after the typhoon, communication links to the island began to be restored. By four days later, the water treatment plant was repaired. One power station on the island was repaired, but since the strong winds damaged most of the power lines, about 85% of the population remained without electricity. Primary roadways were largely cleared, and all bridges were reopened.|$|E
5|$|The Navy {{established}} five separation {{centers for}} the demobilization of the WAVES and Navy nurses, one in Washington, D.C., Memphis, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York. The separation process began on 1 October 1945, {{and within a}} month about 9,000 WAVES had been separated. By the end of 1946, almost 21,000 more had been discharged. It soon became apparent that more centers were needed and ten additional centers were soon opened. By September 1946, demobilization of the WAVES was all but completed. Most women spent two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> at separation centers before being discharged, having physical exams; orientation on rights as veterans; final settlement of pay, and then {{the price of a}} ticket home. At the time, it was not clear whether demobilization meant phasing women out of the military services altogether.|$|E

5|$|The period {{also saw}} the {{development}} of charter fairs in England, which reached their heyday in the 13th century. From the 12th century onwards, many English towns acquired a charter from the Crown allowing them to hold an annual fair, usually serving a regional or local customer base and lasting for two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days.</b> The practice increased {{in the next century}} and over 2,200 charters were issued to markets and fairs by English kings between 1200 and 1270. Fairs grew in popularity as the international wool trade increased: the fairs allowed English wool producers and ports on the east coast to engage with visiting foreign merchants, circumnavigating those English merchants in London keen to make a profit as middlemen. At the same time, wealthy magnate consumers in England began to use the new fairs as a way to buy goods like spices, wax, preserved fish and foreign cloth in bulk from the international merchants at the fairs, again bypassing the usual London merchants.|$|E

25|$|The {{woodlouse}} has a shell-like exoskeleton, {{which it}} must progressively shed as it grows.

25|$|On the South Col, climbers {{enter the}} death zone. Climbers making summit bids {{typically}} can endure {{no more than}} two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> at this altitude.

If weather does not cooperate within these short few days, climbers are forced to descend, many all the way back down to Base Camp.|$|E

25|$|The {{result of}} these {{combined}} causes {{is shown in the}} character of the seasons. Fogs are frequent, especially during the summer; frosts do not occur until the middle of October; ice forms on raised surfaces at least once a winter; snows are frequently light, seldom remaining on the ground more than two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> except in the higher elevations. The average rainfall is about fifty-three inches, which is pretty uniformly distributed throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|Patch {{testing is}} a method used to {{determine}} if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. It tests for delayed reactions. It is used to help ascertain the cause of skin contact allergy, or contact dermatitis. Adhesive patches, usually treated with a number of common allergic chemicals or skin sensitizers, are applied to the back. The skin is then examined for possible local reactions at least twice, usually at 48 hours after application of the patch, and again two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> later.|$|E
