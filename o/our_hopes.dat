500|$|United manager Ferguson also praised Dudek's {{performance}} in the match: [...] "Their goalkeeper has won them the game, sometimes {{you just have to}} put your hands up on these occasions. Dudek has won them the cup. He deserved to be man of the match. We didn't get a break. Dudek's performance encouraged them to stay near their penalty box. In tough games like that the first goal is very important. It's a test for us. We can either accept defeat or we can fight back." [...] Captain Keane was disappointed with the defeat: [...] "The players, managers, staff are all upset but I suppose nowhere near as bad as the fans, if you don't win a match in football you feel as though you have let the fans down." [...] His focus turned to United's participation in the UEFA Champions League, as they looked to end the season with a trophy: [...] "It would have been nice {{to get a piece of}} silverware in the cabinet, especially with the opposition being Liverpool, we've just got to lick our wounds. We've got a game against Leeds on Wednesday and we'll get on with training for Wednesday. The players know we'll have to get together, get ready and try to keep the pressure on Arsenal. But we are eight points behind them, which puts them in a very strong position and again we are pinning <b>our</b> <b>hopes</b> on the European Cup, which is a dangerous game to play as we saw last season." ...|$|E
2500|$|Innocence {{contains}} many references to fantasy, philosophy and Zen, and addresses aesthetic and moral questions.

[...] Other numerous quotations in the film come from Buddha, Confucius, Descartes, the Old Testament, Meiji-era critic Saitō Ryokuu, Richard Dawkins, Max Weber, Jacob Grimm, Plato, John Milton, 14th century playwright Zeami Motokiyo, the Tridentine Mass, and Julien Offray de La Mettrie, French Enlightenment philosopher and author of [...] "Man a Machine".|$|E

Sir, you have led over 100,000 men to join Jiangdong. Quan Yi, myself and the others from Jiangdong are trapped here too with you. Our families are still in Jiangdong. Even if Sun Chen doesn't want to save us, do you think our Emperor and his relatives will abandon us? There were {{times in the past}} when our enemy unexpectedly suffered a plague. Now that we have been stuck here for almost a year, if we stir up any feelings of divisiveness, a mutiny might happen. We should continue to hold out and maintain <b>our</b> <b>hopes</b> that help will arrive soon." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "By {{the second}} Test at Eden Park, Auckland, we had {{improved}} a lot. It was a Test match {{we could have}} won, rather than should have won. Had our wing from Randwick, John Flett, touched the ball down {{when he reached the}} New Zealand line, we could have made 20-17 with the kick to come – considering we had come back from the dead, we were on a roll. But John lost the ball over the line and <b>our</b> <b>hopes</b> disappeared with that lost, bouncing ball. The Blacks, typically, made good their fortune by getting down to the other end and scoring the points which made such they clinced not only the Test but also the series. Another series against New Zealand had gone west; we were plunged into the ultimate depression." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was at {{this point}} that Westminster College stepped in to save the church from {{destruction}} and to reconstruct it in order to honor one of Britain's most famous citizens—Winston Churchill. [...] Churchill's inspiration for the British people during the Blitz made the reconstruction of St. Mary, Aldermanbury, itself a victim of the Blitz, a fitting memorial to the man. [...] "I am honored…," [...] Churchill said.…." [...] "The removal of a ruined Christopher Wren Church, largely destroyed by enemy action in London in 1941 , and its reconstruction and re-dedication at Fulton, is an imaginative concept…." [...] "It may symbolize {{in the eyes of the}} English-speaking peoples," [...] he continued, [...] "the ideals of Anglo-American association on which rest, now as before, so many of <b>our</b> <b>hopes</b> for peace and the future of mankind." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2001, {{six months}} after the album's release, Skunkhour disbanded, {{frustrated}} by a lack of support from Universal, which was experiencing upheavals in Australia. Aya told Ritchie Yorke of The Sunday Mail that the difficulties with the label meant the band was unable to maximise its opportunities. He said: [...] "We decided that we'd rather move on now and look at some other possibilities while we're still drawing big crowds ... Unfortunately, the last album was only heard on Triple J and some community stations, so we didn't really reach the mainstream with it. This was despite <b>our</b> <b>hopes</b> that the album might have taken us to another level. It was given great reviews and we really thought the music got us back in touch with the fans. But overall, we just wanted {{to go out on a}} high. We didn't want to overstay our welcome".|$|E

2500|$|Obama has {{encouraged}} Democrats {{to reach out}} to evangelicals and other church-going people, saying, [...] "if we truly hope to speak to people where they’re at – to communicate <b>our</b> <b>hopes</b> and values in a way that’s relevant to their own – we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse." [...] He supports {{separation of church and state}} and contends that: [...] "I also think that we are under obligation in public life to translate our religious values into moral terms that all people can share, including those who are not believers. And that is how our democracy’s functioning, will continue to function. That’s what the founding fathers intended." [...] In July 2008, Obama said that if elected president he would expand the delivery of social services through churches and other religious organizations, vowing to achieve what he said President Bush had fallen short on.|$|E
2500|$|Breault and I {{separated}} {{to pound}} {{on each of}} the boat’s sides. In this way, the rescuers would know that there were two of us. Breault played a kind of tune with his hammer, indicating to the diver that we were in good shape and cheerful. Neither of us knew Morse Code. We [...] had no food or water, and only a flashlight. We were confident we could stay alive for forty-eight hours. The high pressure and foul air gave us severe headaches. We did very little moving or talking; it excited our hearts too much. We heard scraping on the hull for hours. A couple of times we felt the O-5 being lifted, and then we got tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed <b>our</b> <b>hopes</b> [...] for rescue tremendously. Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly. We felt we would escape this time, but it seemed like forever. The last 20 minutes were unbearable. We heard our comrades walking on deck. Breault opened the hatch and we could see daylight. [...] We were saved!!! ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Now Judas {{celebrated the}} festival of the {{restoration}} of the sacrifices of the temple for eight days, and omitted no sort of pleasures thereon; but he feasted them upon very rich and splendid sacrifices; and he honored God, and delighted them by hymns and psalms. Nay, they were so very glad at the revival of their customs, when, after a long time of intermission, they unexpectedly had regained the freedom of their worship, that they made it a law for their posterity, that they should keep a festival, on account of {{the restoration of}} their temple worship, for eight days. And from that time to this we celebrate this festival, and call it Lights. I suppose the reason was because this liberty beyond <b>our</b> <b>hopes</b> appeared to us; and that thence was the name given to that festival. Judas also rebuilt the walls round about the city, and reared towers of great height against the incursions of enemies, and set guards therein. He also fortified the city Bethsura, that it might serve as a citadel against any distresses that might come from our enemies." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 31, 1968, {{following}} the New Hampshire primary and Kennedy's {{entry into the}} election, the president announced to the nation in a televised speech that he was suspending all bombing of North Vietnam in favor of peace talks. Johnson concluded his speech and startled the nation by announcing [...] "With America's sons in the fields far away, with America's future under challenge right here at home, with <b>our</b> <b>hopes</b> and the world's hopes {{for peace in the}} balance every day, I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office—the presidency of your country. Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President." [...] Not discussed publicly at the time was Johnson's concern he might not survive another term—Johnson's health was poor, and he had suffered a serious heart attack in 1955 while serving in the U.S. Senate. Indeed, he died on January 22, 1973, only two days after the new presidential term concluded. Bleak political forecasts also contributed to Johnson's withdrawal; internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary election, showed the President trailing badly.|$|E
