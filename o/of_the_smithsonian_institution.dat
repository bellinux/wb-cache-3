In 1838, Smithson's legacy, which totaled more than $500,000, was delivered to the United States Mint and entered the Treasury. After eight years, in 1846, the Smithsonian Institution was established.|$|E

5|$|It {{was hoped}} that the Air Force would guard the plane, but, lacking hangar space, it was left {{outdoors}} on a remote part of the air base, exposed to the elements. Souvenir hunters broke in and removed parts. Insects and birds then gained access to the aircraft. Paul E. Garber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution,</b> became concerned about the Enola Gays condition, and on 10 August 1960, Smithsonian staff began dismantling the aircraft. The components were transported to the Smithsonian storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, on 21 July 1961.|$|E

5|$|Curator of Birds Gary R. Graves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> spent 18 years {{scouring}} {{the island for}} evidence of the taxon without success. He is doubtful of its survival as it is diurnal and Jamaica is a popular destination for birdwatchers. The exact cause of the likely extinction is unknown, but predation by introduced mammals, especially the black rat but possibly also the Indian mongoose, {{is thought to be}} a factor. Graves points out that {{there is little evidence that}} habitat loss has played a role. It is noted that this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. Graves also added that the swallows adapted to nesting in man-made structures. In general, this swallow is not affected by being near human disturbance. It is proposed that nest boxes be used to counter habitat loss and predation.|$|E

After graduating from West Point as a second lieutenant in the Class of 1842, he served in the Mexican-American War, building fortifications to protect American supply lines in the advance on Mexico City. After the end of the war, he was stationed in Washington, D.C., where he served as architect for the Scott Building and Quarters Buildings at the U.S. Soldiers' Home and took over the completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> Building after dissatisfaction with the pace of the first architect caused him to be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|From 1947 to 1962, Bush was on {{the board}} of {{directors}} for American Telephone and Telegraph. He retired as president of the Carnegie Institution and returned to Massachusetts in 1955, but remained a director of Metals and Controls Corporation from 1952 to 1959, and of Merck & Co. from 1949 to 1962. Bush became chairman of the board at Merck following the death of George W. Merck, serving until 1962. He worked closely with the company's president, Max Tishler, although Bush was concerned about Tishler's reluctance to delegate responsibility. Bush distrusted the company's sales organization, but supported Tishler's research and development efforts. He was a trustee of Tufts College from 1943 to 1962, of Johns Hopkins University from 1943 to 1955, of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 1939 to 1950, the Carnegie Institution of Washington from 1958 to 1974, and the George Putnam Fund of Boston from 1956 to 1972, and was a regent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> from 1943 to 1955.|$|E
5|$|On {{environmental}} issues, Mathias {{established a}} {{record as a}} strong advocate of the Chesapeake Bay. After touring the bay shoreline in 1973, he sponsored legislation {{that led to a}} study by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) two years later, which was one of the first reports that made the public aware of harmful levels of nutrients and toxins in the waters. As a result, the report was one of the catalysts for cleanup efforts, and evolved into the Chesapeake Bay Program. In recognition, the Charles Mathias Laboratory, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution,</b> was established in 1988 as a research facility to analyze human impact on the bay. In 1990, the Mathias Medal was established by Maryland Sea Grant at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science as further acknowledgment of Mathias' environmental record. In 2003, thirty years after he launched a study of the Chesapeake, Mathias was recognized by the Army Corps of Engineers for the influential role he played initiating restoration efforts.|$|E
