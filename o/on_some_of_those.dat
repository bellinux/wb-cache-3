500|$|In general, the {{criteria}} for acceptance to the National Register are applied consistently, but there are considerations for exceptions to {{the criteria}} and historic districts have influence <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> exceptions. Usually, the National Register does not list religious structures, moved structures, reconstructed structures, or properties that have achieved significance within the last 50 years. However, if a property falls {{into one of those}} categories and are [...] "integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria" [...] then an exception allowing their listing will be made. Historic district listings, like all National Register nominations, can be rejected on the basis of owner disapproval. In the case of historic districts, a majority of owners must object in order to nullify a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. If such an objection occurred, then the nomination would become a determination of National Register eligibility only.|$|E

500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. We went into a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
500|$|Describing {{his sixth}} studio album Yeezus (2013) as [...] "a protest to music," [...] West embraced an {{abrasive}} style that incorporated {{a variety of}} unconventional influences. Music critic Greg Kot described it as [...] "a hostile, abrasive and intentionally off-putting" [...] album that combines [...] "the worlds of" [...] 1980s acid-house and contemporary Chicago drill music, 1990s industrial music, and the [...] "avant-rap" [...] of Saul Williams, Death Grips and Odd Future. The album also incorporates elements of trap music, as well as dancehall, punk, and electro. Inspired by the minimalist design of Le Corbusier and primarily electronic in nature, and continues West's practice of eclectic and unusual samples. Rolling Stone called the album a [...] "brilliant, obsessive-compulsive career auto-correct". West's seventh album The Life of Pablo was noted for its [...] "raw, occasionally even intentionally messy, composition" [...] in distinction to West's previous album. Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "It's designed {{to sound like a}} work in progress." [...] Carl Wilson of Slate characterized the album as creating [...] "strange links between Kanye's many iterations—soul-sample enthusiast, heartbroken Auto-Tune crooner, hedonistic avant-pop composer, industrial-rap shit-talker." [...] West initially characterized the release as [...] "a gospel album." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune wrote in his review of The Life of Pablo, [...] "West's version of gospel touches <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> sonic cues — heavy organ, soaring choirs — but seems more preoccupied with gospel text and the notion of redemption." ...|$|E

I happen to believe that we need to continue to do all that we can to discourage drug use, especially with our youth.
