5|$|Nine <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> Avenue's houses {{had to be}} {{destroyed}} due to their decrepit conditions and a tenth was moved elsewhere. In the spaces where these houses once stood, townhomes were built, mirroring {{the style of the}} original houses. The rest of the houses got indoor plumbing, new basements, improved woodwork and porches added on. Additionally, a pedestrian mall was built down the center <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> Avenue to replace a one-way street. The Avenue is now bike and pedestrian friendly, and cars are prohibited.|$|E
5|$|The {{houses were}} {{featured}} on local CBS station WCCO-TV's Finding Minnesota series in 2005.

5|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers {{acquired}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVP's by that time. Abdul-Jabbar wanted out <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee,</b> demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles. He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played. The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.|$|E

The plan would be the largest new railroad construction in the United States since the completion <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> Road's Pacific extension to Seattle, Washington, in 1909.|$|E

5|$|However, {{with the}} {{increase}} in paved roads and the increasing size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant slippery surfaces posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest patents for snowplows date back to 1840, but there are no records of their actual use until 1862, when the city <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with snowplows. The horse-drawn snowplow quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.|$|E

5|$|The {{residents}} <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> Avenue and {{the surrounding}} Seward neighborhood formed the Seward West Project Area Committee (PAC) {{in order to try}} to save the Milwaukee Avenue homes. They argued that the houses had significant historic value and needed to be preserved. The City argued that the houses were legally nonconforming, and rehabilitating them would cost more than just building new houses.|$|E

5000|$|The Knickerbocker's {{neighborhood}} was called Yankee Hill because many <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee's</b> early leaders living {{there in the}} 1800s were Yankees from New England. They liked the neighborhood because {{it was close to}} the downtown and had nice views along Lake Michigan. It was also part <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee's</b> [...] "Gold Coast".

5|$|Homer buys a book {{on world}} records {{published}} by Duff at a library sale. After boring everyone with world record trivia, Homer decides to break a record himself. He gathers the whole town to build the world's tallest human pyramid. After Jimbo and Kearney move their hands just before the record is claimed, the pyramid collapses into a giant sphere that rolls through town, taking in Agnes Skinner, Hans Moleman, and a suicidal man about to jump from a ledge onto the street. The entire town rolls to a truck weighing station and the Duff record book officials say that Springfield is the world's fattest town, ahead <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee.</b>|$|E
5|$|US31 runs due north through Northwest Michigan {{forest land}} {{bypassing}} Freesoil to the west. Northwest of that town, the highway crosses the Big Sable River before entering Manistee County. Across the county line, the trunkline runs northwesterly parallel to Manistee Lake as US31 enters Manistee. The highway follows Cypress Street to a drawbridge over the Manistee River and then Cleveland Street {{on the northern}} side. As the trunkline rounds the northern shore of Manistee Lake, it passes the SS City <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee,</b> a car ferry preserved as a museum. From there, the highway runs northeasterly, intersecting {{the western end of}} M-55 (Caberfae Highway). Next to the Little River Casino, the highway intersects the southern end of M-22 (Orchard Highway), and the LMCT separates from US31.|$|E
5|$|Following their four-game sweep <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> in the {{beginning}} of September, the Phillies recorded their first playoff win since their 1993 World Series appearance on October 1, defeating the Brewers in Game 1. Cole Hamels was the victor, earning his first career playoff win. Hamels allowed no runs and two hits over his eight innings of work. Chase Utley batted in two runs, while Ryan Howard walked three times in the game. In Game 2, Shane Victorino's grand slam was all the run support starter Brett Myers needed, as he pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs. The Phillies' second consecutive victory was also supported by a pair of doubles from Victorino and from Jayson Werth. In a reversal of fortune, the Brewers scored two runs in the first inning of Game 3, and it proved to be enough to win the game. Brewers starter Dave Bush and closer Salomón Torres were able to hold off the Phillies despite a rally {{in the top of the}} ninth inning, keeping the Brewers alive for Game 4. However, the Phillies defeated the Brewers in Game 4 at Miller Park to win the series, 31. Jimmy Rollins, Jayson Werth and Pat Burrell all hit solo home runs, and Burrell contributed a three-run homer as well. Joe Blanton struck out seven Brewers, holding the team to one run on five hits through six innings.|$|E
50|$|It was started, {{typically}} {{of frontier}} papers, {{as a vehicle}} to promote the real-estate and community development efforts of the founder. The Advertiser paper initially concerned itself with the land development and new town growing at the mouth <b>of</b> the <b>Milwaukee</b> River. Soon it became linked to politics, and the paper became the mouthpiece of Kilbourn, promoter <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee's</b> West Side, who was locked in political combat with Solomon Juneau, promoter <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee's</b> East Side. This feud resulted in another paper, Wisconsin's fourth, the Milwaukee Sentinel being established by Juneau in 1837.|$|R

5|$|Wisconsin {{proposed}} {{an addition to}} the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s to connect Green Bay, the state's third-largest city, to the system. Variations on this proposal included using either the US41 or US141 corridors, or a new corridor in between. This request was rejected in the 1950s, but it was approved in the 1960s. After approval, the state started the process to convert US141 between Milwaukee and Abrams into a freeway. The first segments of freeway were opened in the Milwaukee area, starting in 1963 between Locust Street and Good Hope Road. The following year, {{an extension of the}} freeway opened southward from Locust to North Avenue. By 1965, the bypass of Sheboygan was opened; the Milwaukee area freeway was extended northward to Brown Deer Road the following year. Another freeway segment in the Milwaukee area opened in 1967, extending northward to Grafton in Ozaukee County. The last section of US141 in the city <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> to open as a freeway was completed in 1968 when I-94 was finished through downtown; at the same time, US141 was extended southward from North Avenue to meet I-94.|$|E
5|$|Yi chose Dan Fegan as {{his agent}} to {{represent}} {{him in the}} NBA draft and flew to Los Angeles to participate in pre-NBA draft camps. Before the draft, Yi was predicted {{by many to be}} picked anywhere from third to twelfth. On 28 June 2007, Yi was selected by the Milwaukee Bucks with the sixth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft, despite Fegan warning the Milwaukee Bucks not to pick Yi and not allowing them {{to be one of the}} teams invited to Yi's pre-draft private workouts in Los Angeles. Fegan did not want Milwaukee to select Yi because the city <b>of</b> <b>Milwaukee</b> did not have a large Asian-American community. However, Milwaukee's general manager Larry Harris said they had only drafted the best player available to them. Yi and Sun Yue together marked the first time in NBA draft history where two Chinese born players were selected in the same draft, which was a feat that would not be repeated again until 2016.|$|E
