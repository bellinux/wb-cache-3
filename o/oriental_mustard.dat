40|$|Mustard (Brassica spp.), {{a native}} to {{temperate}} regions of Europe, {{was one of}} the first domesticated crops. This crop's economic value resulted in its wide dispersal and it has been grown as a herb in Asia, North Africa, and Europe for thousands of years. Ancient Greeks and Romans enjoyed mustard (sinapis) seed as a paste and powder. In about 1300, the name "mustard " was given to the condiment made by mixing mustum, which is the Latin word for unfermented grape juice, with ground mustard seeds. Mustard has been a major specialty crop in North America since supplies from western Europe were interrupted by World War II. California and Montana were the major production areas until the early 1950 s. Production of mustard in the Upper Midwest began in the early 1960 s. Mustard is currently grown on approximately 250, 000 acres annually in the United States. North Dakota has the largest share of domestic production. Canadian mustard production increased for twenty years until it peaked in the mid- 1980 s. Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan currently grow a large share of the world's mustard crop. The French people are the largest consumers of mustard (1. 5 lbs/person/year), and buy approximately 70 % of the annual Canadian production. Three types of mustard, yellow, brown, and oriental, are grown in North America. Yellow mustard (Brassica hirta) comprises about 90 % of the crop in Montana. In Europe, yellow mustard is also known as white mustard (Sinapis alba- an older botanical name). The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA. Brown and <b>oriental</b> <b>mustards</b> (Brassica juncea) are grown on limited acres. This crop is commonly produced in a rotation with small grains...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere is {{a growing}} concern about the {{presence}} of mycotoxins in foods, since up to 25 % of cereals and cereal foods are contaminated with these compounds. Moreover, the general public is against the use of synthetic preservatives in foods and the use of natural antimicrobials in foods is a current trend. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is a volatile antimicrobial derived from <b>oriental</b> and black <b>mustard.</b> The objective of this work was to evaluate the capacity of gaseous AITC in inhibiting the production of mycotoxins by Aspergillus parasiticus (aflatoxin producer) and Fusarium poae (beauvercin and enniatin producer) in wheat flour. Petri dish lids filled with 2  g of wheat flour were inoculated with 104 conidia/g of A.  parasiticus or F.  poae and placed in a 1  L mason jar. AITC was added at 0. 1, 1 or 10  µL/L in the gaseous phase. Jars were hermetically closed and kept at 23  °C for 30 d. Mycotoxins were identified and quantified by LC-MS/MS. Even 0. 1  µL/L of AITC was able to produce 6. 9 – 23 % reduction of mycotoxin production. In general, synthesis of aflatoxins and beauvericin was more affected than enniatins. The use of AITC at 10  µL/L completely inhibited the production of all mycotoxins for 30 d. AITC at low doses could be added to flour packages in order to inhibit the production of potentially dangerous mycotoxins...|$|R
40|$|Brassica juncea, (B. juncea) {{also known}} as Indian <b>Oriental</b> or Brown <b>Mustard</b> is widely used as a {{medicinal}} crop, oil seed, condiment and vegetable and much hematological effects have not been recorded on B. juncea. Thirty (30) male wistar rats aged 2 - 3 months, weighing 100 - 200 g were obtained and housed at the Animal House of College of Medicine, University of Nigeria Enugu Campus for this study. The rats were divided into five (5) groups of six (6) rats per group, labeled A to E and were acclimatized for two (2) weeks and were fed with commercially available rat feed. They had access to water and feed ad libitum. Groups A to D were orally administered with graded doses of the crude seed extract (50, 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg body weight respectively) daily for 30 days while group E which served as control received no extract. Blood samples (2. 0 mL) were collected from each rat through the retro orbital plexus of the median canthus into K 3 - EDTA containers for analysis using standard operative procedures. The results obtained, revealed that the mean Hemoglobin (Hb) values of groups C and D (C = 12. 6 ± 0. 57 and D = 11. 1 ± 1. 4 g/dL) were significantly decreased (p< 0. 05) when compared with control (E = 14. 2 ± 0. 74 g/dL. The mean Hematocrit (PCV) values of groups C and D (C = 0. 38 ± 0. 02, and D = 0. 34 ± 0. 04 L/L) were also significantly decreased (p< 0. 05) compared with control (E = 0. 43 ± 0. 02 L/L). The mean Total WBC values of all the treated groups were significantly increased (A = 6. 45 ± 0. 3, B = 6. 23 ± 0. 83, C = 6. 0 ± 0. 34, and D = 6. 05 ± 0. 41 x 109 /L) when compared with control E = 4. 28 ± 0. 17 × 109 /L (p< 0. 05).

50|$|Mild {{white mustard}} (Sinapis hirta) grows wild in North Africa, the Middle East, and Mediterranean Europe, and has spread farther by long cultivation; <b>oriental</b> <b>mustard</b> (Brassica juncea), {{originally}} from {{the foothills of}} the Himalaya, is grown commercially in India, Canada, the UK, Denmark, and the US; black mustard (Brassica nigra) is grown in Argentina, Chile, the US and some European countries. Canada and Nepal are the world's major producers of mustard seed, between them accounting for around 57% of world production in 2010. White mustard (Sinapis alba) is commonly used as a cover crop in Europe (between UK and Ukraine). A large number of varieties exist, e.g. in Germany, Netherlands, mainly differing in lateness of flowering and resistance against white beet-cyst nematode (Heterodera schachtii). Farmers prefer late flowering varieties, which do not produce seeds, they may become weeds in the subsequent year. Early vigour is important to cover the soil quickly and suppress weeds and protect the soil against erosion. In rotations with sugar beets, suppression of the white beet-cyst nematode is an important trait. Resistant white mustard varieties decline nematode populations by 70-90%.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Allergy to mustard {{has been}} {{reported}} for many years, in some cases as severe anaphylactic reactions. Recent studies imply that this allergy is increasing. Three major allergens have been isolated and characterised; Sin a 1 and Sin a 2 in yellow mustard (Sinapis alba), and Bra j 1 in <b>oriental</b> <b>mustard</b> (Brassica juncea). Yellow mustard and black mustard (Brassica nigra) {{are the most common}} species in Europe, whereas <b>oriental</b> <b>mustard</b> is more frequent outside Europe. Mustard plants belong to the Brassicaceae/Cruciferae family. Mustard is present as an ingredient in different foods, sauces and spices, often in small amounts. According to the European labelling directives, mustard and products thereof must always be declared. To monitor this regulation, methods need to be developed to detect mustard. Polyclonal antibodies, produced in rabbits, against yellow and black mustard were characterised with immunodiffusion, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions, and immunoblotting. Rocket-immunoelectrophoresis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were developed for the detection and quantification of mustard protein. With indirect competitive ELISA a concentration of 156 ng mustard protein per ml food extract was detected, which is more than enough to cover the lowest reported reactive doses...|$|E

Pest management in turf involves the use of fumigants such as methyl bromide, as well as selective pesticides. However, the loss of methyl bromide and development of disease resistance to fungicides suggests that more integrated practices are needed. Residual material from the extraction of oils of <b>oriental</b> <b>mustard</b> seed may provide an integrated approach. Research was conducted comparing the effects of MSM to dazomet on the germination of different weeds and turfgrasses. Comparisons were also conducted with MSM to iprodione to determine effectiveness for control of dollar spot. Finally, plant-back intervals with cool-season turfgrasses were identified following applications of MSM. Results indicate that plant counts and plant biomass were reduced from 19 to 81 % and 10 to 99 % for all weed and turfgrass species tested in both field and greenhouse experiments, respectively. Rates of MSM [lesser than] 840 kg/ha reduced dollar spot counts from 50 to 74 % compared to the untreated control and also increased overall turfgrass quality and color over time. Reductions in plant counts and biomass were observed for all cool-season turfgrasses tested when planted the same day following MSM applications. Tall fescue and perennial ryegrass were least sensitive to <b>oriental</b> <b>mustard</b> seed meal with no phytotoxic affects present when seeded 7 days after application of <b>oriental</b> <b>mustard</b> seed meal. From these results, MSM suppresses a number of weed and turfgrass species as well as dollar spot as rates of MSM increases.

40|$|Differences in {{periodicity}} {{and depth}} of weed seedling recruitment due to agronomic management practices, such as reduced tillage, have implications for weed competitive ability and management strategies. Periodicity {{and depth of}} seedling recruitment of 10 different weed species was measured {{in the field in}} 2004 and 2005. The seedling recruitment of rigid ryegrass, threehorn bedstraw, and wild radish seedlings was higher under minimum tillage than under no-till scenarios. In contrast, the seedling recruitment of <b>Oriental</b> <b>mustard,</b> annual sowthistle, squirreltail fescue, little mallow, and turnipweed was higher under the no-till system. The seedling recruitment of wild oat and African mustard was not influenced by the tillage system. The mean seedling recruitment depth of wild oat, rigid ryegrass, threehorn bedstraw, wild radish, and turnipweed was greater under minimum tillage than under the no-till system. These weeds are able to emerge from deeper in the soil profile. In contrast, the seedling recruitment depth under minimum-tillage and no-till systems was similar for African mustard, <b>Oriental</b> <b>mustard,</b> annual sowthistle, little mallow, and squirreltail fescue. These are all small-seeded species, which failed to emerge from deeper depths under either tillage system. In addition, all of these species except African mustard showed higher total seedling recruitment under the no-till system. Results of this study will facilitate weed-control timing decisions and provide validation data for weed seedling recruitment models. Bhagirath S. Chauhan, Gurjeet Gill, and Christopher Presto...|$|E

Napin and cruciferin were the most prevalent proteins in the isolate. The isolate exhibited high in vitro digestibility (74.9 ± 0.80 %) and lysine content (5.2 ± 0.2 g/ 100 g of protein). No differences in the efficiency of extraction, SDS-PAGE profile, digestibility, lysine availability, or amino acid composition were observed between protein extracted with thin stillage and that extracted with NaCl solution. The use of thin stillage, in lieu of water, for protein extraction would decrease the energy requirements and waste disposal costs of the protein isolation and biofuel production processes.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if the presence of two ALS inhibiting herbicide residues in three Saskatchewan soils would result in an additive, synergistic, or antagonistic interaction. This was determined through field trials where herbicides were applied sequentially over the course of two years and through dose-response modelling. The herbicides examined in these experiments were imazamethabenz, flucarbazone-sodium, sulfosulfuron, and florasulam, each in combination with imazamox/imazethapyr. The phytotoxicity and persistence of the herbicides in soil was assessed using an <b>Oriental</b> <b>mustard</b> root inhibition bioassay. The determination of herbicide interaction was made through the comparison of the experimentally observed values to theoretically expected values derived from a mathematical equation. The dose response curves created by placing incremental concentrations of these herbicides in soil were compared using the I 50 parameter, which is the concentration resulting in a 50 % reduction in root length. It appeared that soil organic matter followed by soil pH had the greatest effect in reducing herbicide residue phytotoxicity in the tested soils. Based on the bioassay analysis of sequentially applied ALS inhibiting herbicides, it is proposed that the phytotoxic effect of herbicide residues in soil result in additive injury effects rather than synergistic or antagonistic interactions...|$|E
40|$|The napin from Brassica juncea, <b>oriental</b> <b>mustard,</b> {{is highly}} thermostable, {{proteolysis}} resistant and allergenic in nature. It {{consists of two}} subunits – one small (29 amino acid residues) and one large (86 amino acids residues) – held together by disulfide bonds. The thermal unfolding of napin has been followed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) measurements. The thermal unfolding {{is characterized by a}} three state transition with T_M 1 and T_M 2 at 323. 5 K and 335. 8 K, respectively; Δ C_P 1 and Δ C_P 2 are 2. 05 kcal mol^- 1 K^- 1 and 1. 40 kcal mol^− 1 K^− 1, respectively. In the temperature range 310 – 318 K, the molecule undergoes dimerisation. Isothermal equilibrium unfolding by guanidinium hydrochloride also follows a three state transition, N⇆I⇆U with Δ G_ 1 H 2 O and Δ G_ 2 H 2 O values of 5. 2 kcal mol^− 1 and 5. 1 kcal mol^− 1 at 300 K, respectively.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition andAllergies (NDA) was asked to deliver a scientiﬁc opinion related to a notiﬁcation from DuPont NutritionBiosciences Aps on behenic acid from mustard seeds {{to be used in}} the {{manufacturing}} of certainemulsiﬁers pursuant to Article 21 (2) of Regulation (EU) No 1169 / 2011 – for permanent exemptionfrom labelling. Behenic acid is produced from rapeseed–mustard seed variants prevalent in India,namely Brassica juncea (L.) Czern. (<b>oriental</b> <b>mustard),</b> Brassica rapa (L.) (brown/yellow Sarson orToria), Brassica napus (L.) (rapeseed) and Brassica nigra (L.) W. D. J. Koch (black mustard). No humanor animal allergenicity data were provided by the applic ant for either behenic acid or the emulsiﬁersmanufactured from beheni c acid. Based on enzyme-linke d immunosorbent assay (ELISA) data, thePanel considers that proteins and peptides may not be carried over into behenic acid after the twodistillation steps reported in the manufacturing process in amounts beyond 1 mg/kg. The Panel notesthat the maximum amount of mustard protein that could be consumed from emulsiﬁers manufacturedfrom behenic acid (E 470 a, E 471 and E 477) on a single occasion by an adult under the proposedconditions of use would be around 0. 00119 mg, which is about 1, 000 times lower than the proteindoses repo rted to trigger allergic reactions in mustard-allergic individuals (around 1 mg). On the basisof the data presented, the Panel concludes that oral consumption of emulsiﬁers manufactured usingbehenic acid from mustard seeds (E 470 a, E 471 and E 477) are unli kely to trigger an allergic reactionin susceptible individuals (i. e. mustard-allergic individuals) under the proposed conditions of use...|$|E
40|$|Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV, family Potyviridae, genus Potyvirus) has {{the widest}} host range amongst potyviruses. Globally {{it was said}} to be the second most {{important}} virus infecting field vegetables. Brassica juncea (<b>Oriental</b> <b>mustard,</b> family Brassicaceae), is an amphidiploid plant species with the genome AABB, comprising the genomes of the two diploid species, Brassica rapa (AA) and Brassica nigra (BB). It is widely grown and has various uses including as a leaf, stem, or root vegetable, oilseed crop, forage crop, condiment and biofumigant. Most B. juncea cultivars are very susceptible to TuMV, resulting in severe losses. Research on TuMV resistance and the mapping and identification of natural resistance genes would be very useful in order to speed up breeding resistant crops through marker-assisted selection. Sources of resistance to TuMV have been identified in B. juncea. The specificity of the resistances has been determined. A B. juncea DH line for which there is genomic information has been challenged with TuMV and found to be susceptible. This line {{has been used as a}} susceptible parent in crosses with resistant plants derived from different sources to develop segregating populations for mapping the resistance gene(s). Two BC 1 populations (222 plants and 205 plants) and one F 2 population (159 plants) have been phenotyped and segregation ratios were not significantly different from a Mendelian model based on the action of two recessive genes. Parental lines and selected plants in the two BC 1 populations have been analysed by SNPs genotyping using the Illumina Infinium Chip. Genetic linkage maps have been constructed and QTLs have been mapped. Additionally, attempts are being made to identify a dominant TuMV resistance gene present in both Brassica napus and B. rapa. Inter-specific crosses have been made in order to introgress this gene into B. juncea. Resynthesised B. juncea plants possessing this dominant resistance have been produced through embryo rescue and polyploidy induction of F 1 plants from crosses between resistant B. rapa and susceptible B. nigra plants.
