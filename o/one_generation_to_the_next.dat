5|$|The Hardy–Weinberg {{principle}} {{states that}} within sufficiently large populations, the allele frequencies remain constant from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> unless the equilibrium is disturbed by migration, genetic mutations, or selection.|$|E
5|$|Repeat {{this process}} {{a number of}} times, {{randomly}} reproducing each generation of marbles to form the next. The numbers of red and blue marbles picked each generation fluctuates; sometimes more red and sometimes more blue. This fluctuation is analogous to genetic drift– {{a change in the}} population's allele frequency resulting from a random variation in the distribution of alleles from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} {{column for the}} Detroit Free Press, Marta Salij said that Cal's {{identity}} crisis resembles Odysseus's fate. Whereas the mythical hero is troubled by Poseidon and succored by Athena, the intersex protagonist is affected by his chromosomes in a similar manner. John Sykes, professor of English and religion education, noted another Greek-hero reference. In {{a manner similar to}} Oedipus's fulfillment of Pythia's prophecy to slay his father and marry his mother, Callie validates the prediction her grandmother made before her birth by adopting a male identity. Eugenides also used the allusions to Greek mythology and modern pop music to show the passing of familial traits and idiosyncrasies from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nomadic {{hunter-gatherer}} societies passed on, by oral tradition, {{what they}} knew (their empirical observations) about {{the different kinds of}} plants that they used for food, shelter, poisons, medicines, for ceremonies and rituals etc. The uses of plants by these pre-literate societies influenced the way the plants were named and classifiedtheir uses were embedded in folk-taxonomies, the way they were grouped according to use in everyday communication. The nomadic life-style was drastically changed when settled communities were established in about twelve centres around the world during the Neolithic Revolution which extended from about 10,000 to 2500 years ago depending on the region. With these communities came the development of the technology and skills needed for the domestication of plants and animals and the emergence of the written word provided evidence for the passing of systematic knowledge and culture from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced by families with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> via DNA, a {{molecule}} that encodes genetic information. DNA {{is a long}} biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, {{in a manner similar}} to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E
30|$|Adaptation: The {{pattern is}} {{isolation}} at some initial time but moves toward indifference from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next—say linearly, for example—as society adapts and {{the integration of}} immigrants and non-immigrants comes to be fully accepted.|$|R
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{tribes of}} Sarawak traditionally used oratory {{to pass on}} their culture from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next; examples of these traditional practices include the Iban's Ngajat dances, Renong (Iban vocal repertory), Ensera (Iban oral narratives), and epic storytelling by the Kayan and Kenyah.|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sustainable}} ecological-social-economic development is considered proceeding from {{the condition of}} obligatory coordination of economic, ecological, and human dimensions {{in such a way}} that from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other, the quality and safety of life should not decrease, the environmental conditions should not worsen, and social progress should meet the needs of every person.

25|$|Studies of Paramecium {{have contributed}} to our {{understanding}} of the function of meiosis. Like all ciliates, Paramecium has a polyploid macronucleus, and one or more diploid micronuclei. The macronucleus controls non-reproductive cell functions, expressing the genes needed for daily functioning. The micronucleus is the generative, or germline nucleus, containing the genetic material that is passed along from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
25|$|Kathakali has {{lineages}} or distinctive {{schools of}} play interpretation and dance performance called Sampradayam.

50|$|These Naadi {{leaves were}} {{initially}} {{stored in the}} premises of Thanjavur's Saraswati Mahal Library in Tamil Nadu. The British colonialists later showed interest in the Naadi leaves concerned with herbs and medicine, future prediction, etc. Some leaves got destroyed, and the remaining were auctioned during the British Raj (rule).

50|$|There {{were two}} {{main reasons for}} this limited selection: first, it was {{traditional}} to pass down family names from <b>one</b> <b>generation</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next; such names were always preferred. Second, most patrician families limited themselves to {{a small number of}} names as a way of distinguishing themselves from the plebeians, who often employed a wider variety of names, including some that were seldom used by the patricians. However, several of the oldest and most noble patrician houses frequently used rare and unusual praenomina.|$|R
