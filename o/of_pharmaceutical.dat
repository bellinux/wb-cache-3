40|$|Degradation {{is one of}} the key {{processes}} {{governing the}} impact <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> in the aquatic environment. Most studies on the degradation <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> have focused on soil and sludge with fewer exploring persistence in aquatic sediments. Here we investigate the dissipation <b>of</b> six <b>pharmaceuticals</b> from different therapeutic classes in a range of sediment types. Dissipation <b>of</b> each <b>pharmaceutical</b> was found to follow first-order exponential decay. Half-lives in the sediments ranged from 9. 5 d (atenolol) to 78. 8 d (amitriptyline). Under sterile conditions, the persistence <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> was considerably longer. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the relationships between half-lives <b>of</b> the <b>pharmaceuticals,</b> sediment physicochemical properties and the sorption coefficients for the compounds. Sediment clay, silt and organic carbon content and microbial activity were the predominant factors related to the degradation rates of diltiazem, cimetidine and ranitidine. Regression analysis failed to highlight a key property which may be responsible for observed differences in the degradation <b>of</b> the other <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> The present study results suggest degradation rate <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals</b> in sediments is determined by different factors and processes and does not exclusively depend on a single sediment parameter.

5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> intervention for AS is limited, {{it is essential to}} diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can make it difficult for individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E

5|$|One {{source of}} {{tensions}} in the western and southwestern states was the influx of Mexicans to the U.S. following the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields. It was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to Prohibition (which went into effect nationally in 1920). Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. Because of that, {{the passage of the}} initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet use of hashish by near eastern immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).|$|E
5|$|Polymorphism, or {{the ability}} of a {{substance}} to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005, and fine structural details were given by Bond et al. A new crystal type was found after attempted cocrystallization of aspirin and levetiracetam from hot acetonitrile. The form II is only stable at 100K and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric dimers through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) methyl proton to carbonyl hydrogen bonds, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the carboxylic acid groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.|$|E
5|$|The {{human use}} of fungi for food {{preparation}} or preservation and other purposes is extensive {{and has a}} long history. Mushroom farming and mushroom gathering are large industries in many countries. The study of the historical uses and sociological impact of fungi is known as ethnomycology.

More recently, methods {{have been developed for}} genetic engineering of fungi, enabling metabolic engineering of fungal species. For example, genetic modification of yeast species—which are easy to grow at fast rates in large fermentation vessels—has opened up ways <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> production that are potentially more efficient than production by the original source organisms.|$|E

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry {{is one of}} the most competitive sectors in the European Union. With its substantial investments in research and development, this industry represents a key asset for the European economy and a major source of growth and employment. However, despite the importance <b>of</b> the <b>pharmaceutical</b> sector for the European Union, few researchers have attempted to assess the determinants of the EU exports <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> This paper aims at filling the aforementioned gap by examining what drives EU exports <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> In order to tackle this question, this paper has derived hypotheses from the Gravity Model of Trade and the relevant academic literature on pharmaceuticals. Based on an econometric analysis, the research sheds light on the complex interaction of factors influencing the EU exports <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> The paper finds that the protection of intellectual property in the receiving countries, their economic size, the importance of their health sector, and the quality of infrastructures constitute major drivers to the EU exports <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals.</b> On the contrary, the research shows that transports costs as well as tariff barriers and non-tariff barriers tend to hinder the EU exports <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceuticals...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of aspirin's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties was unknown through the drug's heyday in the early- to mid-twentieth century; Heinrich Dreser's explanation, widely accepted since {{the drug was}} first brought to market, was that aspirin relieved pain by acting on the central nervous system. In 1958 Harry Collier, a biochemist in the London laboratory <b>of</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> company Parke Davis, began investigating the relationship between kinins {{and the effects of}} aspirin. In tests on guinea pigs, Collier found that aspirin, if given beforehand, inhibited the bronchoconstriction effects of bradykinin. He found that cutting the guinea pigs' vagus nerve did not affect the action of bradykinin or the inhibitory effect of aspirin—evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation, rather than on the central nervous system. In 1963, Collier began working with University of London pharmacology graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise {{mechanism of}} aspirin's effects. However, it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings-on in live research animals, and in vitro tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like in vivo tests.|$|E

Clark refused a takeover by Merrill Lynch, but after deregulation in 1986 he was convinced that Hill Samuel was not large enough to compete and, facing hostile takeovers from Kerry Packer and FAI Insurances, arranged takeover talks first with UBS and then with TSB. TSB acquired Hill Samuel in 1988, and Clark became a director in 1987 and then deputy chairman in 1989 for two years. He was on the boards of many other companies, holding directorships at Eagle Star (1976 to 1987) Royal Dutch Shell (1982 to 1994), Vodafone (1988 to 1998), IMI (1981 to 1989) and Marley (1985 to 1989) – he later became the first non-family chairman of the latter. He served on the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration from 1979 to 1986 and was a trustee of the Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School from 1981 to 1995.

He wrote of the subconchoidal fracture of native cinnabar, signs of ore beds, and provided description on crystal form. Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by the later German scientist Georgius Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate, as did the earlier Rihua Bencao of 970 with copper sulphate. Su's book was also the first pharmaceutical treatise written in China to describe the flax, Urtica thunbergiana, and Corchoropsis tomentosa (crenata) plants. According to Edward H. Schafer, Su accurately described the translucent quality of fine realgar, its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges, its matrix being pitted with holes and having a deep red, almost purple color, and that the mineral varied in sizes ranging from the size of a pea to a walnut.|$|E
