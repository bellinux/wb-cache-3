He says that “while Chinese entrepreneurs may avoid bank loans, they are, by and large, scrupulous in paying their taxes and playing by the rules.” The help they do get, however, is from their family: “many Chinese families have 40 members in Barcelona, all working together.

40|$|We {{model the}} {{hierarchical}} evolution of an <b>organized</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>network</b> via antagonistic recruitment and pursuit processes. Within the recruitment phase, a criminal kingpin enlists new members into the network, {{who in turn}} seek out other affiliates. New recruits are linked to established criminals according to a probability distribution {{that depends on the}} current network structure. At the same time, law enforcement agents attempt to dismantle the growing organization using pursuit strategies that initiate on the lower level nodes and that unfold as self-avoiding random walks. The global details of the organization are unknown to law enforcement, who must explore the hierarchy node by node. We halt the pursuit when certain local criteria of the network are uncovered, encoding if and when an arrest is made; the criminal network is assumed to be eradicated if the kingpin is arrested. We first analyze recruitment and study the large scale properties of the growing network; later we add pursuit and use numerical simulations to study the eradication probability in the case of three pursuit strategies, the time to first eradication and related costs. Within the context of this model, we find that eradication becomes increasingly costly as the network increases in size and that the optimal way of arresting the kingpin is to intervene at the early stages of network formation. We discuss our results in the context of dark network disruption and their implications on possible law enforcement strategies.

40|$|Migration {{has become}} {{business}}, big business. Over {{the last few}} decades a host of new business opportunities have emerged that capitalize both on the migrants’ desires to migrate and the struggle by governments to manage migration. From the rapid growth of specialized transportation and labour immigration companies, to multinational companies managing detention centres or establishing border security, to the <b>organized</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> profiting from human smuggling and trafficking, we are currently witnessing a growing commercialization of international migration. This volume claims that today {{it is almost impossible to}} speak of migration without also speaking of the migration industry. Yet, acknowledging the role the migration industry plays prompts a number of questions that have so far received only limited attention among scholars and policy makers. The book offers new concepts and theory for the study of international migration by bringing together cross-disciplinary theoretical explorations and original case studies. It also provides a global coverage of the phenomena under study, covering migrant destinations in Europe, the United States and Asia, and migrant sending regions in Africa, Asia and Latin America...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAt {{the end of}} the 1990 s, {{prostitution}} {{became a}} renewed political issue in France with the arrival of migrant women supposedly under the grip of <b>organized</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks.</b> Neighbors of new prostitution zones expressed ambivalent feelings, mixing compassion towards victims of human trafficking with fear of the threat created by people belonging to a criminal underworld. Authorities have adopted ambiguous policies as well, first and foremost with a law that pretends to rescue prostitutes while making soliciting an offense. These policies aim to make prostitutes disappear from the urban space by forcing them to return underground. Since then, prostitutes live in fear of being assaulted, harassed, and, for those who are illegal migrants, expelled from France. Mobilizations have been unable to challenge these policies, as prostitutes' supporters are divided between those who define prostitution as sex work and those who think it is modern slavery. Prostitutes' fears is the price they are paying for responding to neighbors' anxieties, and the political use of these feelings is based on class, ethnic and gender inequalities...|$|R

The emerging field of green criminology considers harms, but mostly in a speciesist manner. Using two case studies of wildlife trafficking in Russia Far East (fur and falcon), this research moves beyond these limits. This is accomplished by adopting an ecocentric stance that recognizes the intrinsic value of all species and their right to humane treatment and a life free from suffering. Additionally, this book presents three structural harms that are problematic in regards to wildlife trafficking; danger to the environment; cruelty to animals; and threat to national and human security through the connection to corruption, transnational crime, <b>organized</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks,</b> and terrorism. By exploring who is involved, how it occurs, and where it takes place, distinct typologies are created that provide a basis for further examination.

Although SEZs attract foreign direct investment, fuel jobs, and grow linkages in local economies, they are also extremely vulnerable to crime and corruption.

This book seeks to deepen understanding of the group processes involved in crime and the treatment of offenders’ thoughts and behaviour. Together, the chapters in this volume address the following questions: Are people more likely to commit crime because {{of the influence of}} their group? Does group membership cause people to become criminals, or does the group merely foster people’s pre-existing criminal inclinations? How does group membership exert such a strong hold on people so that some risk imprisonment or even death, rather than relinquish their membership? The contributors to Crime and Crime Reduction consider the social psychological influences of groups and specific forms of group crime such as street and prison gangs, terrorism, <b>organized</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks,</b> and group sexual offending. The book also addresses important questions about the role of groups in treating offenders, and why existing group membership should be considered when treating offenders. Group criminal activity is a key area of study for researchers and for students of Forensic Psychology and Criminology courses. This book will therefore be of interest to students, scholars, and law enforcement practitioners who want to understand the group processes involved in crime and its reduction...|$|R

50|$|The {{country of}} Colombia {{is a major}} source country for women and girls {{subjected}} to trafficking in persons, specifically forced prostitution in Latin America, the Caribbean, Western Europe, Asia, and North America, including the United States. Within Colombia, some men are found in conditions of forced labor, but the forced prostitution {{of women and children}} from rural areas in urban areas remains a larger problem. Individual cases of forced marriage - a risk factor for trafficking - involuntary domestic servitude, and forced begging have been reported. Some children are subjected to forced labor in mines and quarries, in the agricultural sector or as domestic servants. Groups at high risk for internal trafficking include displaced persons, poor women in rural areas, and relatives of members of criminal organizations. Continued armed violence in Colombia has displaced many communities, making them vulnerable to human trafficking. Guerillas and new illegal armed groups forcibly recruit children to join their ranks; the government estimates thousands of children are exploited under such conditions. Members of gangs and <b>organized</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> force their relatives and acquaintances, and displaced persons - typically women and children - into conditions of forced prostitution and forced labor, including forced work in the illegal drug trade.

40|$|<b>Criminals</b> <b>organized</b> in <b>networks</b> {{generate}} an estimated € 900 {{billion a year}} worldwide, which is obtained {{at the cost of}} numerous human lives, economic development, social stability and democratic peace. The root of this global problem is retraceable to local social settings (e. g. neighborhoods, schools, pubs) in which different generations of (potential) criminals from various backgrounds find mutual trust to converge into networks. As compared to legitimate <b>networks,</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> deliberately operate under covert conditions and outside the boundaries of law. Detecting and disrupting them is therefore considered {{one of the biggest challenges}} for law enforcement agencies across the globe. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to a better understanding of this complex reality by introducing a data-driven approach to the empirical study of organized crime. The various studies in this thesis show that <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> operate as complex adaptive systems. A typical feature of such systems is that every individual actor can operate autonomously and interact with others at the same time, resulting in highly unpredictable outcomes. This thesis contributes to unraveling this complexity by introducing new methods to integrate different levels of data, to infer networks, and to make relevant selections of data in support of a data-driven approach. Based on our findings we can conclude that <b>criminal</b> <b>network</b> structures cannot be presumed but emerge. Quantitative analyses of these emerging networks can drive qualitative interpretations and assessment in order to seek rather than assume structure. As such we can consider this to be a paradigm shift in law enforcement practice as well as in organized crime research...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{the demand}} for organs {{available}} for transplantation is far outpacing the supply, with kidney transplant waiting lists growing most prominently. Although the buying and selling of organs is prohibited worldwide {{with the exception of}} Iran, the organ shortage has driven patients from industrialized countries in need of a kidney transplantation to developing countries where poor individuals are willing to ‘donate’ a kidney in exchange for money. The organ scarcity has generated a highly profitable black market where illicit acts and means are applied for the purpose of exploitation; i. e. human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal. Due to the complex nature of the criminal activities, which require compatible patients and donors, transplant surgeons and an operating theatre, the organ trade is said to involve globally active and well-organized <b>criminal</b> <b>networks.</b> However, literature supporting this claim is scarce; there is a critical lack of evidence-based research regarding the crime’s organizational model. The aim {{of this study was to}} contribute to criminological research by addressing this knowledge gap through a close examination of relevant criminal cases, which are limited in number worldwide but shed a light on the entire human trafficking process, in order to provide an answer to the following central research question: How does the interaction between the prohibition and the demand and supply of human organs for transplantation shape the mechanisms and organizational model of human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal? With support of QSR*NVIVO software three criminal cases have been analysed by studying 31 court documents and interviewing 45 respondents, mainly law enforcement officials and defense lawyers in South Africa, the United States, Kosovo and Israel. As secondary sources, four documentaries which disclose valuable information about the cases have been included, as well as the recordings of two expert meetings on human trafficking for the purpose of organ removal. The results show that recipients and donors have been exploited using illicit acts and means with the purpose of organ removal by loose, flexible combinations of numerous <b>organized</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> and actors that have joined forces to facilitate illegal kidney transplants on a global level in an extremely well-organized manner. Although the prohibition of the organ trade have been enacted to inhibit profiteering and human trafficking, the rising demand of organs since has generated a highly profitable and exploitative underground transplant industry, which indicates that criminalization is more likely to have reinforced trafficking. The organization of the crime is a dynamic process, resulting from the interaction of illegal market dynamics, skills and networks of the offenders and legal control efforts. Due to local inadequate existing legal frameworks and a lack of knowledge and experience regarding the offence on the judicial level, enforcement is practically non-existent or has led to tactical and spatial crime displacement. A continuing high demand for transplantable organs will make it difficult to restrain the underground market by means of repressive action, whereas some form of regulation may result in lower crime and victimization rates by tackling the organ scarcity...|$|R
40|$|Illegal {{impact on}} victims and {{witnesses}} has acquired “epidemic” character {{and is the}} most dangerous form of counteraction to crimes investigation and solution. Based on his own experience of ensuring the safety of persons being the subject to state protection, the author proves the relevance and usefulness of such security measures when investigating the crimes committed by <b>organized</b> <b>criminal</b> groups (particularly grave and especially grave crimes). The problem of lack of confidence of participants in criminal proceedings in their own safety and their close persons’ safety is considered. Often the police officers themselves negatively affect this situation in case they don’t know how to implement the professional solutions in ensuring these persons’ security. A direct connection of public trust in the police with their ability to provide security of criminal proceedings participants is proved. The most effective security measures are: temporary placement in a safe place, personal protection (bodyguard), home and property protection. The mass media role in covering the positive results of law enforcement agencies activities on applying security measures for criminal proceedings participants and their close relatives is shown. The expediency of applying appropriate security measures for crimes committed by <b>organized</b> groups and <b>criminal</b> <b>networks</b> is emphasized: 1) it contributes to the realization of the criminal law objectives and principles, minimizes the possibility of avoiding criminal liability by criminals by unlawful impact on participants in criminal proceedings; 2) confidence in one’s own and close people’s safety favorably affects criminal investigations and excludes refusals to participate in criminal proceedings...|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis investigates {{the intersection of}} Norwegian criminal law and international anti-trafficking policies by examining the institutional activities it generates in two Norwegian police districts, Hordaland and Oslo. The project interrogates why and how law matters in the regulation of prostitution and looks at this through ethnographic approach rooted at multiple sites. Drawing on fieldwork observations, interviews and analysis of policy-documents and media reports the thesis documents how Norway’s anti-prostitution and international anti-trafficking efforts intersect and are implemented at a local level. Theoretically, the thesis approach the empirical research field informed by insights from Michel Foucault and governmentality perspectives on {{the rule of law}} as a site to investigate issues of social control. Through this approach the thesis rejects more common approaches to the question of legal regulation of prostitution markets by arguing that traditional “model-thinking” stultifies researchers access to a more comprehensive understanding of why and how law matters. The thesis shows how a variety of strategies and institutional perspectives are engaged when local actors are left to interpret ambiguous policy instruments and must implement critical concepts within international anti-trafficking policies, such as prevention, protection and prosecution. At the local level, former policies that address “the problem of prostitution” through harm reducing outreach work seems at odds with the strategies and methods used by special police units seeking to eliminating the market for the transaction of sexual services via disrupting <b>organized</b> <b>criminal</b> <b>networks.</b> The analysis is accomplished by describing how and why the implementation of antitrafficking and prostitution policies leads to conflicts between actors who are meant to work coordinated in common efforts to abolish exploitation in prostitution. The analysis is situated at two seemingly diverging police districts where the thesis investigates and contrasts the relationship between proactive and reactive police strategies to address prostitution as a criminal problem. The analysis also shows that a high level of discrepancy exists between the rhetoric of officially stated policies and the local and institutional realities that are reported by those whose profession it is to implement prostitution policies. By using fieldwork conducted at multiple sites, the analysis shows how local and national actors report diverging views in terms of what “success” means in the field of prostitution and anti-trafficking. The thesis gives a glimpse into the worldviews of the informants and participants in the research project by describing what a good and a bad day at work signifies for them. The question that arises through the analysis is intrinsically linked to the issue of national borders as recent changes in prostitution policy in Norway can both be seen as a step forward for a liberal society based on principles of inclusion and gender equality, as well as understood as part of larger societal transformations in Western liberal democracies. In these democracies an increasing number of individuals are excluded from the benefits of a welfare state, certain territories and spaces, yet rhetorically deemed to be objects of “rescue-missions”, “rehabilitation-processes” and “exit-programs” into particular ways of living and consuming, “here” or “there”. As a Western liberal democracy, Norway is no exception as anti-immigration policies increasingly dictates how and why prostitution is seen as a problem. </p...|$|R
