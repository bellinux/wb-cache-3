5|$|In the skull, {{it has a}} {{significantly}} longer rostrum (the front part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull)</b> and diastema (the gap between the incisors and the molars). Furthermore, it has shorter molar rows in both {{the upper and lower}} jaws. The back end of the incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate), which is located in front of the first molars, is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The sutures of the maxillary and palatine bones (the line where the two bones, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> join) are straight and parallel to each other, the toothrows, and the midline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> in eastern voalavo. Northern voalavo, in contrast, are more curved. Statistical analysis of measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and teeth clearly separates the two species of Voalavo.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} phylogenetic analyses of the group, Gardiner (1983) recognized five characteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade: a bone at the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> the parasphenoid, is connected to another bone on the underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> the pterygoid; large openings called interpterygoid vacuities are present between the pterygoids; the stapes (a bone involved in hearing) is connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward; the cleithrum, a bone in the pectoral girdle, is thin; and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch. Additional features were given by Godfrey et al. (1987), including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital at the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> small projections (uncinate processes) on the ribs, and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single iliac blade. These shared characteristics are called synapomorphies.|$|E

5|$|Other {{features}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> {{distinguish the}} two genera. The tegmen tympani, {{the roof of}} the tympanic cavity, is much reduced in Voalavo relative to Eliurus. The subsquamosal fenestrae, openings in the squamosal bone at the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> are larger in Voalavo than in Eliurus. The zygomatic plate, a plate at the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> that roots the front part of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), is narrower in Voalavo, and lacks a clear zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} zygomatic plate), which is present in Eliurus. Among nesomyines, only Brachytarsomys has a more reduced zygomatic notch.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls. Thus, the horns {{may have been a}} device for the {{distribution}} of compression forces without damage to the brain. This is supported by the flattened upper sides of the horns, the strongly fused bones of the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> and the inability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> to survive rapid head blows.|$|E
5|$|Sculpturing is seen on many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> bones, in {{the form}} of long grooves, pits and protrusions. Like other ceratosaurs, the frontal bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> roof were fused together. Carnotaurines {{commonly}} had bony projections from the skull. Carnotaurus had two pronounced horns, projecting outward above the eyes, while its close relative Aucasaurus had smaller projections in the same area. Majungasaurus and Rajasaurus had a single bony horn or dome, projecting upwards from the skull. These projections, like the horns of many modern animals, might have been displayed for species recognition or intimidation. In Arcovenator, the dorsal margin of the postorbital (and probably also the lacrimal) is thickened dorsolaterally, forming a strong and rugose bony brow ridge rising above the level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> roof. Maybe this rugose brow ridge supported a keratinous or scaly structure for displays.|$|E

5|$|The three named {{species of}} Gryposaurus differ in details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and lower jaw.

5|$|A novelization of {{the film}} and a prequel {{entitled}} The Island <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Skull</b> was also written.

5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides enough room for the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of}} the head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E

5|$|At {{the back}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> {{there is a}} protrusion, called the nuchal crest, arising from the fused parietal bones, a feature shared with all tyrannosaurids. In Alioramus, the nuchal crest is greatly thickened, {{similarly}} to Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. Like the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> the lower jaw of Alioramus was long and slender, another possible juvenile characteristic. As in Tarbosaurus, a ridge on the outer surface of the angular bone of the lower jaw articulated with {{the rear of the}} dentary bone, locking the two bones together and removing much of the flexibility seen in other tyrannosaurids. Other tyrannosaurids had four premaxillary teeth, D-shaped in cross section, on each side. Including 16 or 17 in each maxilla, and 18 in each dentary, Alioramus had 76 or 78 teeth, more than any other tyrannosaurid. The braincase of A. altai was intermediate between the basal theropod and avialan conditions.|$|E
5|$|Carnotaurus was {{the first}} {{theropod}} dinosaur discovered with {{a significant number of}} fossil skin impressions. These impressions, found beneath the skeleton's right side, come from different body parts, including the lower jaw, the front of the neck, the shoulder girdle, and the rib cage. The largest patch of skin corresponds to the anterior part of the tail. Originally, the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> also was covered with large patches of skin—this was not recognized when the skull was prepared, and these patches were accidentally destroyed. Still, the surface texture of much of the right side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> is very {{different from that of the}} left side, and probably shows some features of the scalation pattern of the head.|$|E
5|$|Ceratopsians {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> On {{the tip of}} a ceratopsian upper jaw is the rostral bone, an edentulous (toothless) ossification, unique to ceratopsians. Othniel Charles Marsh recognized and named this bone, which acts as a mirror image of the predentary bone on the lower jaw. This ossification evolved to morphologically aid the mastication of plant matter. Along with the predentary bone, which forms the tip of the lower jaw in all ornithischians, the rostral forms a superficially parrot-like beak. Also, the jugal bones below the eye are very tall and flare out sideways, making the skull appear somewhat triangular when viewed from above. This triangular appearance is accentuated in later ceratopsians by the rearwards extension of the parietal and squamosal bones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> roof, to form the neck frill.|$|E

25|$|Ornitholestes was a bipedal carnivore. Its {{head was}} {{proportionally}} {{smaller than that}} of most other predatory dinosaurs, but <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> was heavily built, with a short snout and robust lower jaw.

5|$|Euchambersia was a {{small and}} short-snouted therocephalian, {{possessing}} large canines as {{is typical of the}} group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large indentation in the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> Under the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged, it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom delivery mechanism. More recently, the internal structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; other possibilities, such as the indentation supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain plausible.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Polish {{paleontologist}} Teresa Maryańska {{proposed that}} the complex sinuses and nasal cavities of ankylosaurs may have lightened the weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> housed a nasal gland, or acted as a chamber for vocal resonance. Carpenter rejected these hypotheses, arguing that tetrapod animals make sounds through the larynx, not the nostrils, and that reduction in weight was minimal, as the spaces only accounted for a small percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> volume. He also considered a gland unlikely, and noted that the sinuses {{may not have had}} any specific function. It is also been suggested that the respiratory passages were used to perform a mammal-like treatment of inhaled air, based on the presence and arrangement of specialized bones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Darren Tanke of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta {{relocated}} the long lost S. parksi site. Pieces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> evidently abandoned by the 1915 crew, {{were found in the}} quarry. These were collected and it is hoped more pieces will be found, perhaps enough to warrant a redescription <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> and test whether S. albertensis and S. parksi are the same. The Tyrrell Museum has also collected several partial Styracosaurus skulls. At least one confirmed bonebed (bonebed 42) in Dinosaur Provincial Park has also been explored (other proposed Styracosaurus bonebeds instead have fossils from a mix of animals, and nondiagnostic ceratopsian remains). Bonebed 42 is known to contain numerous pieces of skulls such as horncores, jaws and frill pieces.|$|E

5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its zygomatic plate (a bony plate on the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull).</b> It hardly extends forward in front of the connection between the plate and the main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> and that connection is relatively low on the skull. Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the rear}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull</b> is preserved. It likely showed a horselike, broad snout {{equipped}} with pencil-like teeth, {{as seen in}} related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known. As in other dicraeosaurids, the external naris (nostril opening) was situated in the posterior half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> diagonally above the eye socket, which was proportionally large. As in most other dinosaurs, the skull featured three additional openings (fenestrae). The infratemporal fenestra, located below the eye socket, was long and narrow. Behind the eye socket was the supratemporal fenestra, which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side. This contrasts with other diapsid reptiles, where these openings were directed upwards, thus being visible only in top view. The antorbital fenestra would have been located {{in front of the}} eye socket, although this region is not preserved. An unusual feature were small openings seen on the backside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull,</b> the so-called parietal openings or fontanelles. In other tetrapods, these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close as the individual grows. Skull features shared with Dicraeosaurus but absent in other sauropods included the fused frontal bones and the notably long basipterygoid processes, bony extensions connecting the braincase with the palate.|$|E
5|$|P. sinensis {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} species by numerous features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> Adult skulls are smaller than those of P. mongoliensis and have less teeth. Uniquely, the premaxillary bone contacts the jugal (cheek) bone on the outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>skull.</b> The jugals flare out sideways, forming 'horns' proportionally wider {{than in any other}} known Psittacosaurus species except P. sibiricus and P. lujiatunensis. Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually wider than it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the eye, at the contact of the jugal and postorbital bones, a feature also seen in P. sibiricus. The mandible (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or fenestra, seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an underbite. The skull of an adult P. sinensis can reach 11.5centimeters (4.5in) in length.|$|E
