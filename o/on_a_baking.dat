5000|$|... : {{cooked with}} plain flour (particularly wholemeal flour) - {{rather than the}} {{standard}} self-raising flour, and baking powder, resulting in a much flatter and crisper cake. Typically, this variant is made as a slab on a bakestone, or nowadays <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> tray, hence the name [...] (literally, [...] "Welsh slab").|$|E
50|$|German Streuselkuchen {{is usually}} a flat cake made <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> tray and cut into oblong pieces. It should be very flat - about one inch - so crumbs make about 50% of its height. Yeast dough is the original; a short crust is possible, too, and a puff pastry at the bottom turns it into a Prasselkuchen.|$|E
50|$|Green bean chips may be {{prepared}} mixed {{with olive oil}} and seasonings, which is placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> pan and baked until they are crisp. They may {{be prepared}} by freeze-drying green beans that are then vacuum-fried. Per a one-ounce (30 g) serving, green bean chips contain 130 calories, 4.5 g fat and 5 g fiber.|$|E
50|$|The candy is made {{of sugar}} dough which is boiled, kneaded <b>on</b> <b>a</b> marble <b>baking</b> table, pulled, and twisted by hand to the right size. The candies contain peppermint, sugar, water, and a very small amount of vinegar, and are sold in about 20 stores in the town.|$|R
5000|$|Meatloaf is a dish {{of ground}} meat mixed with other ingredients, formed into a loaf shape, then baked or smoked. The loaf shape is formed by either cooking it in a loaf pan, or forming it by hand <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flat <b>baking</b> pan. [...] Meatloaf is usually made from ground beef, {{although}} lamb, pork, veal, venison, poultry and seafood are also used.|$|R
50|$|Green {{coffee beans}} can be roasted in a {{convection}} oven {{provided that the}} beans are spread out in only one layer <b>on</b> <b>a</b> perforated <b>baking</b> tray with raised sides. Because they are not stirred, the beans at {{the perimeter of the}} tray get dark first. The oven area should be well ventilated because a lot of smoke will be generated. This method produces coffee beans with a variety of roast levels as {{it is almost impossible to}} achieve a consistent roast, however, some people like the resultant melange roast.|$|R
50|$|The classic Ellio's pizza may be {{prepared}} {{only in a}} conventional or toaster oven. In each instance, the baking temperature is 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 °C), with the pizza baking either directly on the rack for about 9-12 minutes, or <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> sheet for 14-16 minutes (not more than 14 minutes in a toaster oven).|$|E
50|$|A {{very long}} roll may be bent {{so that it}} fits <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> sheet; the result is called a patkó (horseshoe). Before baking, the roll may be given a wash of milk. The roll can be {{finished}} with an icing after baking, made of powdered sugar and lemon juice (or a glaze during baking). Usually it is brought from the kitchen already sliced.|$|E
5000|$|A macaroon ( [...] ) {{is a type}} {{of small}} {{circular}} cake, typically made from ground almonds (the original main ingredient), coconut, and/or other nuts or even potato, with sugar, egg white, and sometimes flavorings (e.g. honey, vanilla, spices), food coloring, glace cherries, jam and/or a chocolate coating. Some recipes call for sweetened condensed milk. Macaroons are often baked on edible rice paper placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> tray.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to paper, cupcake liners {{may be made}} from very thin aluminum foil or, in a non-disposable version, silicone rubber. Because they can stand up on their own, foil and silicone liners {{can also be used}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flat <b>baking</b> sheet, which makes them popular among people who do not have a specialized muffin tin. Some of the largest paper liners are not fluted and are made out of thicker paper, often rolled at the top edge for additional strength, so that they can also stand independently for <b>baking</b> without <b>a</b> cupcake tin. Some bakers use two or three thin paper liners, nested together, to simulate the strength of a single foil cup.|$|R
5000|$|A kitchen utensil is a {{small hand}} held tool used for food preparation. Common kitchen tasks include cutting food items to size, heating food <b>on</b> <b>an</b> open fire or <b>on</b> <b>a</b> stove, <b>baking,</b> grinding, mixing, blending, and measuring; {{different}} utensils are made for each task. A general purpose utensil such as a chef's knife {{may be used for}} a variety of foods; other kitchen utensils are highly specialized and may be used only in connection with preparation of a particular type of food, such as an egg separator or an apple corer. Some specialized utensils are used when an operation is to be repeated many times, or when the cook has limited dexterity or mobility. The number of utensils in a household kitchen varies with time and the style of cooking.|$|R
50|$|The {{recipe for}} {{peppermint}} bark uses few ingredients, with only chocolate and mint candies required. Some recipes also add peppermint flavoring. The candies used may be candy canes. The candies should be broken up, and the chocolate is melted. These two ingredients are combined <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> sheet and then chilled until firm. The bark is then {{removed from the}} sheet and broken into pieces {{in a similar way}} to peanut brittle.|$|E
50|$|The Hungarian kalács (pronounced ˈkɒlaːtʃ) is a sweet bread {{very similar}} to brioche, usually baked in a braided form, and {{traditionally}} considered an Easter food. Until {{the end of the}} 19th century, the preparation of kalács was similar to that of everyday bread; the difference was in the shape, and in the better/quality flour used for the kalács. Nowadays kalács is prepared from dough enriched with milk and eggs. It is baked in an oven or brick oven, sometimes directly on the stones of the brick oven, or <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> sheet.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} common ways to prepare {{butternut}} squash is roasting. To do this, the squash is cut in half lengthwise (see pictures), lightly brushed with cooking oil or put in a thin layer of water and placed cut side down <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> sheet. It is then baked for 45 minutes or until soft. Once roasted, it can be eaten in a variety of ways.The fruit is prepared by removing the skin, stalk, and seeds, which are not usually eaten or cooked. However, the seeds are edible, either raw or roasted, and the skin is also edible and softens when roasted.|$|E
50|$|Potato filling: boil the {{potatoes}} and rice them, add salt and melted butter, sour cream and egg.Carrot filling: prepare just like {{the potatoes}}, only instead of salt add sugar.Dough: mix the ingredients and make dough. Flatten it and with a bigger round object (a mug, for instance) cut out the round pieces approximately 10-20 cm in diameter. Then turn up {{the edges of the}} pieces of dough (1 cm). Place the prepared dough pads <b>on</b> <b>an</b> oiled <b>baking</b> pan and fill them with a thin layer of the potato filling and then put the thicker layer of the carrot filling on the potato paste.Bake the pies in the medium heated baking oven until the dough becomes dry and the carrot filling grows light brown. Serve with milk and honey or with skābputra (a fermented milk-and-barley porridge).|$|R
5000|$|In Los Angeles {{the danger}} dog {{is known as}} the bacon-wrapped hot dog. Vendors can be found cooking them <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{stainless}} steel <b>baking</b> tray over Sterno heat sources outside of bars, concerts, sporting events, and other late night establishments. The bacon-wrapped usually consists of a bacon-wrapped hot dog, grilled onions and bell peppers, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and grilled jalapeño peppers. [...] After a public campaign in 2010, the L.A. City Council proclaimed the bacon-wrapped to be the official hot dog of Los Angeles.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first two}} songs, [...] "Bright Lights, Big City" [...] and [...] "Monkey On My Back", deal {{directly}} with David McComb’s drug abuseand are infused with bitterness and desperation. The song which gave {{its name to the}} EP tells the tale of a loner who has some unrequited love issues with a rich girl who’s just finished school. He pleads with her to ride with him <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> hot summer's night and she goes along. Driven mad by the intolerable heat and by her rejection he murders her. This song was originally two songs - [...] "Field of Glass" [...] and [...] "Pleasure Slide".|$|E
5000|$|The Needham family {{believed}} that Ben was kidnapped {{with the intention}} of selling him for adoption, or that he was taken by child traffickers. Carol Sarler, writing in The Times in 2007, said: [...] "I have repeatedly asked police and press, British and Greek, for a single example to support this rumour. There is none. When pretty little Western European kiddies go missing... we know about it; if we don't know, it isn't happening. Those of us who properly investigated Ben's disappearance are certain he was not abducted; put bluntly, a child less than 2, toddling unsupervised for five hours <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking,</b> remote, inhospitable hillside that is still largely unsearched, is easy prey to the lonely accident." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{first ever}} {{game for the}} club was played at Hillsborough Arena, home of the Hillsborough Hawks, against the Swinton Lions supporters. It ended in a narrow victory for the Lions 22-20. The game was short sided, full contact, and some Beagles guested for the Lions. The team {{then went on to}} play the Castleford Aybertigers at Castleford in a tag rather than contact game and they {{recorded}} their first ever victory <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> hot August day. A heavy loss against the Hull FC Irregulars at The Boulevard was followed by a lesson in tag rugby at the annual IMBRL tournament. Despite these setbacks on the field, the concept had worked and was allowing new players to play rugby league as well as watching it, at a standard suitable for beginners.|$|E
40|$|A new simple {{processing}} route to produce starch-based porous materials was developed based <b>on</b> <b>a</b> microwave <b>baking</b> methodology. This innovative {{processing route}} {{was used to}} obtain non-loaded controls and loaded drug delivery carriers, incorporating a non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent. This bioactive agent was selected as model drug with expectations that the developed methodology might be used for other drugs and growth factors. The prepared systems were characterized by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopy which allow {{the study of the}} interactions between the starch-based materials and the processing components, i. e. the blowing agents. The porosity of the prepared materials was estimated by measuring their apparent density and studied by comparing drug-loaded and non-loaded carriers. The behaviour of the porous structures, while immersed in aqueous media, was studied in terms of swelling and degradation, being intimately related to their porosity. Finally, in vitro drug release studies were performed showing a clear burst effect, followed by a slow controlled release of the drug over several days (up to 10 days) ...|$|R

5000|$|Morels can be {{preserved}} in several ways: They can be 'flash frozen' by simply running {{under cold water}} or putting them in a bucket to soak for a few minutes, then spread <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> tray and placed into a freezer. After freezing, they keep very well with the frozen glaze {{for a long time}} in airtight plastic containers. However, when thawed they can sometimes turn slightly mushy, so they are best frozen after steaming or frying. Due to their natural porosity, morels may contain trace amounts of soil which cannot be easily washed out. Any visible soil should be removed with a brush, after cutting the body in half lengthwise, if needed. Mushroom hunters sometimes recommend soaking morels in a bowl of salt water briefly prior to cooking, although many chefs would disagree.|$|E

In it, Kodos is preparing their boss' visit by cooking dinner: Homer <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> tray (continually eating himself), Bart on a skillet, Marge and Maggie in pies and Lisa in a soup. The boss gives the meal a delicious rating, but his stomach bursts ends up liberating Bart. Kang and Kodos are given a hyper-galactic promotion, much to the aliens' delight.

50|$|Matzah pizza is {{prepared}} by covering {{a piece of}} matzo with sauce and melted cheese. It can be eaten as is, or baked first. In the latter case, the matzo is first softened in water; alternately, the sauce ingredients are used to soften the matzo. Other traditional pizza toppings {{may be used in}} addition to cheese. For example, chef Spike Mendelsohn suggests topping matzah pizza with figs and asparagus, peppers and feta cheese, or cherry tomatoes, olives, and rosemary, while Martha Stewart recommends placing a fried egg on top of a matzah pizza. Other recipes suggest using crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and some recipes suggest substituting hummus for sauce. Some recipes recommend baking the matzo and toppings <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>baking</b> sheet, either in a conventional oven or in a microwave oven, while other recipes recommend baking matzah pizza in a casserole pan, so that the dish resembles a layered lasagna. Vegan recipes suggest utilizing vegan cheese or omitting the cheese entirely.|$|E
