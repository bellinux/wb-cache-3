40|$|Abstract—The {{contribution}} {{is dealing with}} the influence of high speed parameters on the quality <b>of</b> <b>machined</b> surface. In general the principle of high speed cutting lies in achieving faster machine times with concurrent increase in accuracy and quality <b>of</b> the <b>machined</b> areas in largely irregular, mathematically hard to define shapes. High speed machining is a highly effective method <b>of</b> <b>machining</b> with the following goals: increasing <b>of</b> <b>machining</b> productivity, increasing <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> the <b>machined</b> surface, improving <b>of</b> <b>machining</b> economy, improving <b>of</b> ecological aspects <b>of</b> <b>machining.</b> This article is based on an experiment performed by the Department <b>of</b> <b>Machining</b> and Assembly <b>of</b> the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of VŠB-Technical University of Ostrava.

5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} to farmers. This allowed horses to remain a key aspect of agriculture and transportation {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor <b>of</b> <b>machines,</b> and population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s and collapsed completely in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E
5|$|Robert Peel (1723– 12 September 1795), {{commonly}} known as Parsley Peel, was an influential cotton mill owner and grandfather to Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, future prime minister of Great Britain. Peel started life as a yeoman farmer but experimented with calico printing, eventually creating a parsley leaf pattern which would become his trademark. Despite losing a number <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> during riots, Peel's company became {{the largest in the}} textile sector by the time of his death, with 23 factories.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> for wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is a moot point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered twist drills, self-centring drill chucks (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported agricultural implements and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|E

In this work, {{in order to improve}} the quality <b>of</b> <b>machined</b> surface, study on morphology <b>of</b> <b>machined</b> surface in high-speed milling hardened steel. The model of cutting trajectory in high-speed milling hardened steel was established. By studying the measure method on micro-unit of surface texture, the simulation model <b>of</b> <b>machined</b> surfacesmorphology in high-speed milling hardened steel was established. This work researched on rule that the different parameters influenced on surface morphology with simulation. The results show that, residual surface height significantly increases with the increase of space in row spacing direction, the residual surface height increases with the increase of feed per tooth, improving spindle speed is conducive to bettering the morphology <b>of</b> <b>machined</b> surface, machining inclination angle is little effect on morphology <b>of</b> <b>machined</b> surface, the cutting vibration is conducive to bettering the morphology <b>of</b> <b>machined</b> surface when the tool amplitude was below the threshold. ...|$|R

5|$|During his lifetime, Leonardo was valued as an engineer. In {{a letter}} to Ludovico il Moro, he claimed {{to be able to}} create all sorts <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> both for the {{protection}} of a city and for siege. When he fled to Venice in 1499, he found employment as an engineer and devised a system of moveable barricades to protect the city from attack. He also had a scheme for diverting the flow of the Arno river, a project on which Niccolò Machiavelli also worked. Leonardo's journals include a vast number of inventions, both practical and impractical. They include musical instruments, a mechanical knight, hydraulic pumps, reversible crank mechanisms, finned mortar shells, and a steam cannon.|$|E

John Fitch had launched the first rudimentary steamboat onto the Delaware River in the late 1780s, and the Philadelphia waterworks was by 1802 operating two low-pressure steam engines to pump water from the Schuylkill River, but these were rare examples and most instances of this new technology were to be found in Europe. Much of the development of steam power had occurred in Great Britain, with Thomas Newcomen and James Watt instrumental in developing and commercializing steam power there and elsewhere in Europe, with several hundred <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> operating there in industrial and labor-saving applications by 1800.|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} {{suffered a}} downturn {{between the two}} world wars, as working horses were replaced by lorries and peat demand dropped, but after the Second World War peat {{was used by the}} horticultural industry in increasing volumes, and harvesting expanded again. From 1947, experiments were made with locomotives on the tramways, and they soon replaced horses. A total of 23 had worked on the system {{by the time it was}} closed down. The extraction process was mechanised in the 1960s, with the introduction <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> that could cut and stack the peat turves. In 1981 mechanical loading of the turves into the trains was introduced. Surface milling of the peat was introduced in 1985, which completely stripped the surface of large areas of the moors.|$|E

Other applications of the Reuleaux triangle include giving the shape to guitar picks, pencils, and drill bits for drilling square holes, as well as in graphic design in the shapes of some signs and corporate logos.|$|E

5|$|ReCore is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. It centers around Joule Adams {{and her three}} robotic machines known as corebot companions, whose function is to aid her in combat and puzzle solving; these types <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> are amenable to improvement, should players find the blueprints and materials to do so, which grants upgrades to their attack and defense. The machines' cores can be swapped between them, changing their abilities in succession, and their frames are rearrangeable. Players can level up Joule's weapons and vitality. Ranged weapons have three kinds of ammunition that serve the purpose of taking down an enemy with a matching color: red, blue and yellow. Furthermore, if one of Joule's corebots matches the color of an enemy, it will thus inflict more damage in combat. Joule also wields a grappling hook that she uses to extract her enemies' energy cores after {{a certain amount of}} damage is done. Joule must dodge, jump or dash quickly to avoid taking damage while engaged in enemy conflict.|$|E
5|$|The high-right policy led to {{a series}} <b>of</b> <b>machines</b> with {{ever-increasing}} prices. The original Macintosh plans called for a system around $1,000, {{but by the time}} it had morphed from Jef Raskin's original vision of an easy-to-use machine for composing text documents to Jobs' concept incorporating ideas gleaned during a trip to Xerox PARC, the Mac's list price had ballooned to $2,495. From there, the price of Mac systems continued to climb: the Macintosh Plus was slightly more expensive at $2,599, the SE was $2,900 or $3,900 depending on the model, and a basic Macintosh II with a 40 MB hard drive was at least $5,500 (at launch, with the price increasing in late 1988). More modern machines cost even more: the Macintosh IIcx was $5,369, the IIci $6,269, and the IIfx $9,900 - all without monitors or keyboards. Color CRTs were relatively expensive in the late 1980s; Apple's 14-inch 640×480 monitor had a list price of $999 and Apple's ADB keyboards, while of high quality, were similarly expensive. The only inexpensive machine in the lineup by the late 1980s was the several-year-old Mac Plus, which was now selling for around $1,800.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the possibility of increasing the accuracy and stability <b>of</b> <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> low-rigidity shafts while ensuring high efficiency and economy <b>of</b> their <b>machining.</b> An effective way of improving the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>machining</b> <b>of</b> shafts is increasing their rigidity as a result of oriented change of the elastic-deformable state through the application of a tensile force which, combined with the machining force, forms longitudinal-lateral strains. The paper also presents mathematical models describing the changes of the elastic-deformable state resulting from the application of the tensile force. It presents the results of experimental studies on the deformation of elastic low-rigidity shafts, performed on a special test stand developed {{on the basis of a}} lathe.
