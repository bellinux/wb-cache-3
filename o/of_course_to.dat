5|$|Las Casas {{has also}} often {{been accused of}} exaggerating the atrocities he {{described}} in the Indies, some scholars holding that the initial population figures given by him were too high, making the population decline look worse than it actually was, and that epidemics of European disease were the prime cause of the population decline, not violence and exploitation. Demographic studies {{such as those of}} colonial Mexico by Sherburne F. Cook in the mid-20th century suggested that the decline {{in the first years of}} the conquest was indeed drastic – ranging between 80 and 90%, due <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> many different causes, but all ultimately traceable to the arrival of the Europeans. The overwhelming main cause was disease introduced by the Europeans. It has also been noted that exaggeration of numbers was the norm in writing in 16th-century accounts, and both contemporary detractors and supporters of Las Casas were guilty of similar exaggerations.|$|E

25|$|The roundarm {{controversy}} {{came to a}} head {{before the}} 1827 season and MCC agreed to the staging of three trial matches between Sussex and All-England. Roundarm's supporters made the grandiose claim that their campaign was a march of intellect. It is difficult to discern anything intellectual about propelling a cricket ball with arm outstretched vis-à-vis propelling it with hand below elbow, but there we are.

25|$|The title {{requires}} some clarification. “In {{the words of}} Aristotle: ‘catastrophe is an action bringing ruin and pain on stage, where corpses are seen and wounds and other similar sufferings are performed,’”. Malone refers to “Catastrophe … in the old sense … o be buried alive in lava and not turn a hair, it is then a man shows what stuff he is made of.” The more obvious definition applies <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> the act of defiance itself; the effect {{is nothing less than}} catastrophic.|$|E

25|$|They {{have a large}} {{sagittal}} crest, a bone {{running along}} {{the middle of the}} skull that is necessary for muscle attachment. They also have unusually positioned orbits, an unusually shaped cranium with the frontal bones elevated, and a retracted nasal incision. All of these modifications to the normal mammal skull are, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>to</b> make room for the proboscis. This proboscis caused a retraction of bones and cartilage in the face during the evolution of the tapir, and even caused the loss of some cartilages, facial muscles, and the bony wall of the nasal chamber.|$|E
25|$|As a {{concrete}} example, suppose you ran a cruise ship. You {{have to decide}} how many famous comedians to hire. This boat can handle {{no more than one}} ton of passengers and the entertainers must weigh less than 1000lbs. Each comedian has a weight, brings in business based on their popularity and asks for a specific salary. In this example you have multiple objectives. You want, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>to</b> maximize the popularity of your entertainers while minimizing their salaries. Also, you want to have as many entertainers as possible.|$|E
25|$|Ireland, {{being an}} island {{on the western}} edge of Europe and on the {{continental}} shelf, is perfectly suited for recreational diving activities such as scuba diving and snorkelling. Ireland's waters provide diving sites of various qualities and standards to encompass all individual requirements. Because of its small size it is relatively easy to travel from one part of the island to another; giving divers the opportunity to travel for one or more days diving. The dive season in Ireland generally starts around March and ends around October. It is possible <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>to</b> dive outside these times, but due to adverse weather and sea conditions it is not appealing.|$|E

Additionally, some state appellate courts require attorneys {{to obtain a}} separate certificate of admission to plead and practise in the appellate court. Federal courts require specific admission to that court's bar to practise before it. At the state appellate level and in Federal courts, there is generally no separate examination process, although some U.S. district courts require an examination on practices and procedures in their specific courts. Unless an examination is required, admission is usually granted as a matter <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> any licensed attorney in the state where the court is located.

25|$|Lütjens radioed Wilhelmshaven and Berlin and all {{the naval}} {{commands}} concerning the sinking of Hood continually until his message was acknowledged. It was received only at 14:40 in Berlin. Aboard Prinz Eugen Captain Brinkmann noted that such actions were dangerous. He recorded in the ships' war diary that Lütjens' insistence on radioing every change <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> the shore commands; then confirmed by a final “Execute!” order, was unnecessary and risky. In {{the morning of the}} 25 May, his 52nd birthday, Lütjens persisted by sending a long message on the Hood action. It was apparent that he mistakenly believed he was still under surveillance by the British and thus any message could do no harm since his position was known to the enemy.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} arch-based constructions, {{there is an}} outward thrust {{generated}} against the walls underneath a barrel vault. There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust. One is, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>to</b> make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method. A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other. This method was most often used in construction of churches, where several vaulted naves ran parallel {{down the length of}} the building. However, the outer walls of the outermost vault would still have to be quite strong or reinforced by buttressing. The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles, thus forming a groin vault.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} hone {{the manner in}} which things, media and big data are interconnected, it is first {{necessary}} to provide some context into the mechanism used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that s in media approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead tap into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations. The ultimate aim is, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>to</b> serve or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with the consumer's mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring the messages (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various data-mining activities.|$|E
25|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), {{the largest}} Latter Day Saint denomination, the Melchizedek priesthood {{is one of}} two {{governing}} priesthoods, which is typically given as a matter <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>to</b> worthy male members 18 years and older. No exact rule exists about how much time a man must be a member first; he may receive this priesthood as soon as local church leaders feel he is prepared. Ordination is based on the recipient's age and worthiness and does not require any specific training or aptitude. A candidate for this ordination is interviewed and often counseled to study the 84th, 107th, and 121st sections of the Doctrine and Covenants to begin to understand the oath and covenant of the priesthood, the covenant a person makes with God when he receives the Melchizedek priesthood. The candidate is also usually asked to stand in a gathering {{of the members of the}} church to be publicly accepted as being worthy of ordination. For male Latter-day Saints, receiving the Melchizedek priesthood is considered to be a saving ordinance of the gospel.|$|E
