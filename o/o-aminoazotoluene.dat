Among these research areas, one notable work was [...] "Induction of hepatic cancer in rats by <b>o-aminoazotoluene,</b> one of the azo dyes". This study, published in 1932 by Takaoki Sasaki and Tomizo Yoshida, was the first scientific report in the world on a successful method for induction of cancer in animal organs by feeding chemicals. Research on Yoshida Sarcoma, a strain of tumor cells, was also conducted at this institute in the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|AN {{examination}} {{of the effects of}} several chemically unrelated carcinogens upon the sulphydryl (-SH) levels of various susceptible and non-susceptible tissues led to the question of an increase in-SH levels being an essential feature of tumour induction (Calcutt, Doxey and Coates, 1960). This is an obviously important issue and so further evidence has been sought. A series of different chemical carcinogens has been tested as previously and the detailed findings are given below.

40|$|The enterochromaffin {{cells of}} the guinea pig {{duodenum}} and 5 -hydroxytryptamine incorporated into gelatin models gave, after formalin fixation, nearly identical reactions with methenamine silver, ferric-ferricyanide, and diazotized <b>o-aminoazotoluene.</b> Following formaldehyde fixation the indole reaction with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde was negative in tissue enterochromaffin cells; similarly the indole reaction was negative after formaldehyde fixation of gelatin models. In the duodenum of the guinea pig 5 -hydroxytryptamine appears to be largely, if not entirely, contained in the enterochromaffin cells. Its intracellular concentration estimated from relative cell volume and assay of concentration in the whole tissue, was not less than 5 mg. /gm. of cells, and as judged by the intensity of staining reaction may have been as high as 10 to 20 mg. /gm. of cells. Reserpine administered parenterally caused release of the chromogenic material of duodenal enterochromaffin cells and a parallel reduction {{in the amount of}} extractable 5 -hydroxytryptamine...|$|E
40|$|Tumors {{produced}} by dimethylaminoazobenzene (butter yellow) occur in an organ {{which in the}} presence of injury may undergo rapid regenerative changes affecting both terminal ducts and livers cells. Study of these tumors shows that there is an orderly sequence of changes with proliferation of bile ducts, liver parenchyma, and supporting fibrous tissue, terminating in the formation of tumors that are characteristically malignant and astonishingly complex in structure. The sequence of events leading to the production of tumors is profoundly modified by diet (1), which is the essential factor in determining {{the presence or absence of}} cirrhosis. The study further gives opportunity to investigate the relation of tumor formation to cirrhosis, a subject that has long been discussed with reference to human pathology. Sasaki and Yoshida (2) found following administration of <b>o-aminoazotoluene</b> progressivc hyperplasia of liver cells resulting in the formation of adcnomas that might become malignant. The earliest tumors appeared after 196 days. If administration of the agent was discontinued after 4 months, tumors were formed later...|$|E
40|$|DESPITE the {{widespread}} distribution and poteintial extreme reactivity of vascular tissue, pathological descriptions of experimenital neoplasms derived from it are comparatively few. In {{the case of}} the rat, so far as I am aware, haemangiomas have only been described following inoculation with polyoma virus (Kirsteln et al., 1962). In mice these tumours have been described after treatment with carcinogenic hydrocarbons (White and Stewart, 1942) and in higher yield following <b>o-aminoazotoluene</b> (Andervont, 1950). More recently they have also been produced in mice after the subcutaneous administration at birth of 9, 10 -dimethyl- 1, 2 -benzanthracene (Roe, Rowson and Salaman, 1961). In an investigation of the effect of the subcutaneous administration of 9, 10 dimethyl- 1. 2 -benzanthracene (DMBA) given withiin 24 hours of birth to rats, primarily intended to study the effects on the haemopoietic system and lymphoma development, a considerable number of the animals developed haemangiomas. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to describe the anatomical distribution and morphological appearances of these tumours, but it must be emphasised that the...|$|E
40|$|The aim {{of these}} {{experiments}} {{has been to}} determine how diet affects the occurrence of tumors and of cirrhosis produced by p-dimethylamlnoazobenzene or butter yellow, and to define the relation of tumor production to cirrhosis. The great variety of structural change associated with {{the administration of the}} carcinogenic agent has offered the opportunity to study the pathogenesis of tumors in their relation to injury, hyperplasia, and other changes in the parenchymatous dements and supporting framework of the liver. The Japanese workers (Sasaki and Yoshida (1); Kinosita (2)) who first produced tumors of the liver by means of <b>o-aminoazotoluene</b> and dimethyl aminoazobenzene (butter yellow) fed rats a diet consisting of brown rice supplemented by a small quantity of carrot. Animals so treated suffer considerable injury, and in some experiments almost half of them have died within 1 month. Nevertheless, of rats fed by Sigiura and R_hoads (3) only 3 per cent died during the first 2 months. Of the animals that survived from 91 to 220 days, 89 per cent were said to have had liver cancer. A variety of modifications of the rice diet have diminished the frequency wit...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that uroporphyrinogen is oxidized to uroporphyrin by microsomes (microsomal fractions) from 3 -methylcholanthrene-pretreated chick embryo liver [Sinclair, Lambrecht & Sinclair (1987) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 146, 1324 - 1329]. We report here that a specific antibody to chick liver methylcholanthrene-induced cytochrome P- 450 (P- 450) inhibited both uroporphyrinogen oxidation and ethoxyresorufin O-de-ethylation in chick-embryo liver microsomes. 3 -Methylcholanthrene-pretreatment of {{rats and mice}} markedly increased uroporphyrinogen oxidation in hepatic microsomes as well as P- 450 -mediated ethoxyresorufin de-ethylation. In rodent microsomes, uroporphyrinogen oxidation required the addition of NADPH, whereas chick liver microsomes required both NADPH and 3, 3 ', 4, 4 '-tetrachlorobiphenyl. Treatment of rats with methylcholanthrene, hexachlorobenzene and <b>o-aminoazotoluene</b> increased uroporphyrinogen oxidation and P- 450 d, whereas phenobarbital did not increase either. The contribution of hepatic P- 450 c and P- 450 d to uroporphyrinogen oxidation and ethoxyresorufin O-de-ethylation in methylcholanthrene-induced microsomes was assessed by using specific antibodies to P- 450 c and P- 450 d. Uroporphyrinogen oxidation by methylcholanthrene-induced rat liver microsomes was inhibited up to 75 % by specific antibodies to P- 450 d, but not by specific antibodies to P- 450 c. In contrast, ethoxyresorufin de-ethylation was inhibited only 20 % by anti-P 450 d but 70 % by anti-P 450 c. Methylcholanthrene-induced kidney microsomes which contain P- 450 c but non P- 450 d did not oxidize uroporphyrinogen. These data indicate that hepatic P- 450 d catalyses uroporphyrinogen oxidation. We suggest that the P- 450 d-catalysed oxidation of uroporphyrinogen has {{a role in the}} uroporphyria caused by hexachlorobenzene and other compounds...|$|E
