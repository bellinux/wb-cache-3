Georgetown's <b>Old</b> <b>Stone</b> House was built in 1765, making it the oldest-standing original building in the city. Founded in 1789, Georgetown University features a mix of Romanesque and Gothic Revival architecture.

By 1831, Romney Academy had outgrown its educational facilities in an <b>old</b> <b>stone</b> building just north of the Hampshire County Courthouse in Romney. Also at this time, several academies in present-day West Virginia were aspiring to collegiate status, as there were few colleges operating in the region prior to the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|St Mary's Church is {{an active}} Anglican parish church located in Monk's Lane, Acton, a village {{to the west of}} Nantwich, Cheshire, England. Since 1967 it has been {{designated}} a GradeI listed building. A church has been present on this site since before the time of the Domesday Survey. The tower is the oldest in Cheshire, although it had to be largely rebuilt after it fell in 1757. One unusual feature of the interior of the church is that the <b>old</b> <b>stone</b> seating around its sides has been retained. In the south aisle are some ancient carved stones dating back to the Norman era. The architectural historian Alec Clifton-Taylor includes the church in his list of 'best' English parish churches. In the churchyard is a tall 17th-century sundial. The church {{is an active}} Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Macclesfield and the deanery of Nantwich.

5|$|The {{church is}} built in red {{sandstone}} with a lead roof. The tower {{is within the}} body of the church with arches leading into the nave and the side aisles. These arches, together with the thin lancet windows and the flat buttresses, date from the 13thcentury. The authors of the Buildings of England series state that this early date is rare for towers in Cheshire. The upper parts of the tower, built after the collapse of 1757, are by William Baker in early Gothic Revival style. The nave has four bays, with north and south aisles of six bays. The chancel has three bays with a vestry on its north side. The piers of the arcade date from the 13thcentury while the capitals are from the 19th-century restoration. The authors of the Buildings of England series state that {{the body of the}} church is mostly Perpendicular in style. At the east end of the north aisle is the Mainwaring chapel, which was originally a Lady Chapel; at {{the north side of the}} tower is the Dorfold chantry. <b>Old</b> <b>stone</b> seating remains around the sides of the church, which is unusual.|$|E

Soon they return underground to find Will's adoptive father, and attempt to rescue Chester once again. They encounter another Styx patrol, and Uncle Tam kills a member of the Styx, whom he calls Crawfly, but is mortally wounded in the fight, and the strong willed Uncle Tam chooses to stay behind to give the boys time to escape. With the help of Imago Freebone, a member of Uncle Tam's gang, Will and Cal escape to a small hiding place halfway between the Colony and the Eternal City. There, they rest and mourn for Uncle Tam; and are told by Imago that Chester's train to the deeps will pass directly under their hiding spot shortly.
