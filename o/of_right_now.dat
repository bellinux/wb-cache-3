500|$|In June 1819, Lord Eldon, the Lord Chancellor, {{introduced}} a bill to abolish private appeals following acquittals, and also abolish trial by battle. The act passed in great haste, with {{all three of the}} required readings of the bill in the House of Lords passing on one night. According to Sir Robert Megarry, who wrote of Ashford v Thornton in 2005, the haste was due to a wager of battle being made in another case, though the names of the parties are not known. The act, which was recorded as 59 Geo. III, Chapter 46, recited, [...] "whereas appeals of murder, treason, felony, and other offences, and the manner of proceeding therein, {{have been found to be}} oppressive; and the trial by battle in any suit, is a mode of trial unfit to be used; and it is expedient that the same should be wholly abolished." [...] The Act abolished appeals of murder and other offences, and enacted in section 2: [...] "that from and after the passing of this act, in any writ <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> depending, or which may hereafter be brought, instituted, or commenced, the tenant shall not be received to wage battel, nor shall issue be joined nor trial be had by battel in any writ of right; any law, custom, or usage to the contrary notwithstanding." ...|$|E

[...] Bousman also indicated interest, stating; [...] "I would love to follow up Repo and finish the story, because it was conceived as a three-part movie. But this movie is all about support from the internet, and support from fans. This is not a movie where you'll see billboards or bus stop ads or trailers on TV."

2500|$|There {{has been}} some major concern for the {{population}} in the Mekong River due to numerous threats. In the 1970s, many Irrawaddy Dolphins were slaughtered for oil and soon after, there was intensive fishing practices with explosives and gill nets [...] As <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> the dolphins are protected in Cambodia and Laos Democratic Republic. Now, both explosive fishing and use of gill nets is restricted in many of the Irrawaddy Dolphin's habitats. Canadian conservationist Ian Baird set up the Lao Community Fisheries and Dolphin Protection Project to study the Irrawaddy dolphins in the Lao part of the Mekong. Part of this project compensated fishers for the loss of nets damaged to free entangled dolphins. This project was expanded to include Cambodia, after the majority of the dolphin population was determined to have been killed or migrated to Laos' southern neighbour. The Si Phan Don Wetlands Project has successfully encouraged river communities to set aside conservation zones and establish laws to regulate how and when fish are caught. In April, after a 200kg Irrawaddy Dolphin was found dead on the coast of Laos, the death toll for Irrawaddy Dolphins is now five in the year 2015. Usually, Irrawaddy Dolphins are found dead with bruises and scars on their body being killed by illegal poaching, however this Irrawaddy Dolphin was found dead because of old age. She is the oldest and largest Irrawaddy Dolphin researchers have discovered. The dolphin was 2.5 meters in length and most likely in her late 20's. The body will be taken to the WWF office for an autopsy of the body.|$|E

6000|$|Edgar {{was much}} {{disturbed}} by the story he had heard so unexpectedly from the sergeant. He regretted {{now that he had}} acted so hastily. Certainly the story put a completely new complexion on the case, and his chance of being Captain Clinton's son was just the same as it had ever been. He wondered whether his father and mother--for so in his thoughts he always named them--had doubted the truth of this woman's statement to him, or whether they had believed it as he had done, and had put him out of their hearts as one with whom they had nothing to do, and who had been already too long imposed upon them. But he felt that this was an unjust view, and that however they might now be confident that Rupert was their son and heir they still cherished an affection towards him. [...] "However," [...] he said, [...] "this will make no difference to me. The die is cast, and I cannot go back now. Still I shall be happier than I was before. Then I considered that I had been an impostor who had received affection and care and kindness to which I had no shadow <b>of</b> <b>right.</b> <b>Now</b> I know that this is not so, and that it is just as likely that I am their son as it is that Rupert is; and I stay away for my own choice, and because, having made them believe that Rupert was their son, I am not going to disturb and make them unhappy again by showing them that this was a mistake, and that everything is as unsettled as before.|$|E
60|$|Either {{we have no}} {{government}} at all, or else the very word implies the right, and therefore the duty, in the governing power, of protecting itself from destruction and its property from pillage. But for Mr. Buchanan's acquiescence, {{the doctrine of the}} right of secession would never for a moment have bewildered the popular mind. It is simply mob-law under a plausible name. Such a claim might have been fairly enough urged under the old Confederation; though even then it would have been summarily dealt with, {{in the case of a}} Tory colony, if the necessity had arisen. But the very fact that we have a National Constitution, and legal methods for testing, preventing, or punishing any infringement of its provisions, demonstrates the absurdity of any such assumption <b>of</b> <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> When the States surrendered their power to make war, did they make the single exception of the United States, and reserve the privilege of declaring war against them at any moment? If we are a congeries of mediæval Italian republics, why should the General Government have expended immense sums in fortifying points whose strategic position is of continental rather than local consequence? Florida, after having cost us nobody knows how many millions of dollars and thousands of lives to render the holding of slaves possible to her, coolly proposes to withdraw herself from the Union and take with her one of the keys of the Mexican Gulf, on the plea that her slave-property is rendered insecure by the Union. Louisiana, which we bought and paid for to secure the mouth of the Mississippi, claims the right to make her soil French or Spanish, and to cork up the river again, whenever the whim may take her. The United States are not a German Confederation, but a unitary and indivisible nation, with a national life to protect, a national power to maintain, and national rights to defend against any and every assailant, at all hazards. Our national existence is all that gives value to American citizenship. Without the respect which nothing but our consolidated character could inspire, we might as well be citizens of the toy-republic of San Marino, for all the protection it would afford us. If our claim to a national existence was worth a seven years' war to establish, it is worth maintaining at any cost; and it is daily becoming more apparent that the people, so soon as they find that secession means anything serious, will not allow themselves to be juggled out of their rights, as members of one of the great powers of the earth, by a mere quibble of Constitutional interpretation.|$|E
