500|$|Some, such as Petaling Jaya city {{councillor}} Richard Yeoh, {{believe that}} Abdullah Ahmad, an aide of Mahathir's, {{was the first}} to use the term [...] "ketuanan Melayu". Yeoh described the context in which Ahmad used it as [...] "a fairly benign speech and most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>might</b> have had no problem with it, but it has been taken to mean Malay supremacy by some Umno leaders who don't necessarily know what it means." ...|$|E
500|$|Krrish {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics in India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{believed that the}} film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed Krrish to be [...] "a terrifically exciting and compelling experience", and awarded the film 4.5 of 5 stars. Nikhat Kazmi noted in The Times of India that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not enough of them. He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor. On the other hand, Raja Sen said that Krrish was infinitely better than KMG, though ultimately {{it was all about}} Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for Rediff, both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both said {{that it was a good}} film for children. Sen summarised [...] "So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned. It's a full-on kiddie movie, and while a lot <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>might</b> be scornful of Krrish, it's heartening to see fantasy officially entering mainstream Bollywood." [...] Verma agreed with other critics that it took too long for the action to get started, and said that a lot of attention was spent showing off Roshan's muscles. He summarised, [...] "Krrish neither has the sleek aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes. What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan, which is likely to appeal to children. And that's worth a three-star cheer." [...] Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a hackneyed, formulaic masala film, with special effects added on top, and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan. He gave the film only 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "Krrish is only an average film that could have been so much better if the makers had concentrated as hard on its story as they did on its action and stunts." ...|$|E

We could have killed all the men that got into holes on the hill, but they were glad to let us alone, and so we let them alone too. Rain-in-the-Face was with me in the fight. There were twelve hundred <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> <b>Might</b> be no more than one {{thousand}} in the fight. Many of our Indians were out on a hunt." ...|$|E

[...] Murphy described her performance as [...] "inspirational", but added, [...] "it was more than that. It was chilling. [...] It was chilling to watch because you could see Wellington racing her way right to the hospital, paying literally no heed to her brain's internal governor – {{one that has been}} wired into the human body through millions of years of evolution." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{judge the}} success of the Libby Prison escape solely by the number of men who crossed Federal lines would be a mistake. [...] Richmond was deeply {{affected}} by the break, and Libby Prison itself was thrown into chaos, much to the satisfaction and raised morale of the remaining prisoners. [...] Lieutenant Colonel Cavada recorded some of the more humorous effects of the escape inside the prison. [...] On one occasion, the entire camp was roused {{in the middle of the}} night for a roll call because a sentry thought he saw something down in a sewer. [...] It turned out to be his own shadow. [...] Even the Confederate warden, Major Thomas P. Turner, was visibly shaken. [...] Cavada commented, [...] "Really, when our distracted little Commandant now comes into our rooms, he keeps his knees well together, it is necessary to be very cautious, some <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>might</b> slip out between his legs!" ...|$|E

Janeway also anticipated the widespread advent of two-income families when, in 1976, he said that [...] "single-paycheck families are doomed. They don't have a fighting chance.

6000|$|There was a hush, and the {{men looked}} into each other's eyes as the Senior Subaltern came forward in a dazed and dizzy way, and took the paper. We were {{wondering}} as we stared, whether there was anything against any one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> that <b>might</b> turn up later on. The Senior Subaltern's throat was dry; but, as he ran his eye over the paper, he broke out into a hoarse cackle of relief, and said to the woman:--"You young blackguard!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, captain, {{what are}} we going to do? Now that our danger is past, I suppose the best thing for us is to stay here in quiet and thankfulness, and wait for Mr. Rynders.

50|$|The {{price of}} {{electric}} power station capacity is high, and electric demand is variable, {{so it is}} often cheaper to import some portion of the needed power than to generate it locally. Because loads are often regionally correlated (hot weather in the Southwest portion <b>of</b> the <b>US</b> <b>might</b> cause many people to use air conditioners), electric power often comes from distant sources. Because of the economic benefits of load sharing between regions, wide area transmission grids now span countries and even continents. The web of interconnections between power producers and consumers should enable power to flow, even if some links are inoperative.|$|R
