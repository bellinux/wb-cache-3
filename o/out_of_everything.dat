500|$|Liu Kang's Fatality {{from the}} {{original}} game is the [...] "Shaolin Uppercut", in which he performs a butterfly kick (often mistaken for a cartwheel) on his opponent before hitting an uppercut that knocks them offscreen before landing. In Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks, there were two versions; one where the victim explodes to pieces upon impact and the original, in which the opponent is torn to pieces upon falling to the ground. In another signature Fatality, he morphs into a large dragon, chomping the upper body of his opponent. This Fatality was turned into an Animality in Mortal Kombat 3 and back into a normal Fatality in Mortal Kombat 4. In the Game Boy and Game Gear versions of Mortal Kombat II, the dragon torches the opponent with fire instead. The series' composer and co-designer John Vogel noted it to be his favorite Fatality due to how much Liu Kang's appearance changes. Another famous Fatality of Liu Kang has him vanish and a Mortal Kombat arcade game machine drop down and crush his opponent. According to GameSpy's MK2011 walkthrough, Liu Kang [...] "inflicts better damage" [...] than Kung Lao [...] "by jumping around like a lunatic and kicking the crap <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> he sees." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Hale for the New York Times praised Mays' performance, noting: [...] "Jayma Mays {{registered}} Emma’s devastation {{with just}} the slightest widening of those enormous eyes. In fact all the best non-singing moments in the episode were hers." [...] Hale was less impressed {{with the rest of}} the episode, deeming the pregnancy storyline [...] "so boring that is hardly mattered". He noted that: [...] "For many viewers, the best moments in the episode probably came very early on and involved Jane Lynch’s Sue Sylvester, who still got all the best lines." [...] Jarett Wieselman for the New York Post agreed with this assessment, opining that although the episode was [...] "filled with more brilliant moments than ever before", the stand-out scene was Sue writing in her journal, which Wieselman deemed [...] "jam-packed with so many one liners, it acted as a vacuum, sucking the smart <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> else on TV from 9:05 to 9:07pm." [...] Fellow New York Post critic Maxine Shen deemed the episode her favorite of the series so far. Anna Pickard of The Guardian called the pseudoephedrine storyline [...] "relentlessly silly [...] but joyfully so", preferring the boys' performance to the girls' as [...] "some excellent comedy helped me forget about Finn's dodgy autotuned vocals for once".|$|E

500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will {{go down in history as}} probably my favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and be with my friends. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> in this whole career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E
