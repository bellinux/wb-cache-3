5|$|The 610 Office is a {{security}} {{agency in the}} People's Republic of China. Named for the date of its creation on June 10, 1999, it was established {{for the purpose of}} coordinating and implementing the persecution of Falun Gong. Because it is a Communist Party-led office with no formal legal mandate, it is sometimes described as an extralegal organisation. The 610 Office is the implementation arm of the Central Leading Group <b>on</b> <b>Dealing</b> <b>with</b> the Falun Gong (CLGDF), also known as the Central Leading Group <b>on</b> <b>Dealing</b> <b>with</b> Heretical Religions.|$|E
5|$|Although Minton {{was on the}} Supreme Court, he {{remained}} casually involved in Democratic internal politics. He wrote Truman several letters criticizing Justices Robert H. Jackson and Hugo Black, referring to Black as a demagogue. He also offered advice <b>on</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> Republican opposition in the Senate. In a 1954 letter, after Truman left office, he urged Truman to help focus public attention {{on the economy and}} away from communism, a threat he claimed the Republicans were exaggerating to avoid confronting their own problems.|$|E
5|$|But, after {{assessing}} {{the situation in}} Alsace, Julian evidently decided that his force was insufficient to prevail over the Alamanni alone. Instead, {{he set out to}} recover Cologne. From Metz, he led his army via Treviri (Trier) to Roman-held Koblenz and thence along the Rhine to Cologne. Entering the ruined city unopposed, Julian's men were set to work to rebuild the city walls. Julian then concluded a peace treaty with the Franks. This had the important result of removing half the opposition from the equation and allowing Julian to focus his resources <b>on</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the Alamanni.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the police}} focused their law {{enforcement}} efforts <b>on</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the illegal consumption of alcohol, which {{was considered to}} promote violent behaviour among the First Nations. By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the First Nations on the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed {{that the practice of}} horse theft was slowing the assimilation of the First Nations into broader Canadian society. The authorities were also concerned that if the First Nations were allowed to steal horses from across the border in the United States, it could provoke a military intervention into Canada.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{literature on the}} subject of deserts. An early historical account is that of Marco Polo (c. 1254–1324), who travelled through Central Asia to China, crossing a number of deserts in his twenty four year trek. Some accounts give vivid descriptions of desert conditions, though often accounts of journeys across deserts are interwoven with reflection, {{as is the case in}} Charles Montagu Doughty's major work, Travels in Arabia Deserta (1888). Antoine de Saint-Exupéry described both his flying and the desert in Wind, Sand and Stars and Gertrude Bell travelled extensively in the Arabian desert in the early part of the 20th century, becoming an expert on the subject, writing books and advising the British government <b>on</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the Arabs. Another woman explorer was Freya Stark who travelled alone in the Middle East, visiting Turkey, Arabia, Yemen, Syria, Persia and Afghanistan, writing over twenty books on her experiences. The German naturalist Uwe George spent several years living in deserts, recording his experiences and research in his book, In the Deserts of this Earth.|$|E

25|$|Baleztena {{assembled}} a new Junta Regional in 1939; his {{objective was to}} preserve independent Carlist infrastructure, and his strategy relied <b>on</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the collaborationists. The successes recorded were saving El Pensamiento Navarro from amalgamation in the Francoist propaganda, setting up a Carlist outpost of the Principe de Viana institute {{and a number of}} local administrative appointments; the cost was electing Rodezno vice-president of Diputación Foral in 1940. Co-operation with Fal, still national political leader, continued to be difficult; in 1941, when composing new regional Junta, Baleztena insisted that merindades elect their jefes, while Fal opted for appointments. During the Begoña crisis of 1942 the Baleztenas tried to avoid a showdown with Falange and urged moderation.|$|E
25|$|Premier Frank Hsieh, DPP {{election}} organizer {{and former}} mayor of Kaohsiung (the city {{at the center of}} the MRT scandal) twice tendered a verbal resignation immediately following the election, but his resignation was not accepted by President Chen until January 17, 2006 after the DPP chairmanship election had concluded. The former DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang was appointed to replace Hsieh as premier. Hsieh and his cabinet resigned en masse on January 24 to make way for Su and his new cabinet. President Chen had offered the position of Presidential Office Secretary-General (vacated by Yu) to the departing premier, but Hsieh refused and left office criticizing President Chen for his tough line stance <b>on</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the PRC.|$|E

25|$|Prince Philip {{appears to}} have been {{generally}} liked by his contemporaries: 'dynamic, good-natured and earnest,' suitably pious, having a 'lively body and a peaceful disposition,' albeit with a relatively weak constitution. The comparison with the memory of the disobedient and ultimately insane Carlos was usually a positive one, although some commented that Prince Philip appeared less intelligent and politically competent than his late brother. Indeed, although Philip was educated in Latin, French, Portuguese and astronomy, and {{appears to have}} been a competent linguist, recent historians suspect that much of his tutors' focus on Philip's undeniably pleasant, pious and respectful disposition was to avoid reporting that, languages aside, he was not in fact particularly intelligent or academically gifted. Nonetheless, Philip does not appear to have been naive – his correspondence to his daughters shows a distinctive cautious streak in his advice <b>on</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> court intrigue.|$|E
25|$|The French {{regularly}} {{described the}} Natchez as ruled with absolute, despotic authority by the Great Sun and Tattooed Serpent. The existence of two opposing factions {{was well known}} and documented. The Great Sun and Tattooed Serpent repeatedly pointed out their difficulty in controlling the hostile Natchez. It {{is likely that the}} White Apple faction functioned at least semi-independently. Whatever power the family of the Great Sun and Tattooed Serpent did have over outlying villages was reduced in the late 1720s after both died. They were succeeded by relatively young, inexperienced leaders. While the new Great Sun was technically the paramount chief of the Natchez, the chief of White Apple became the eldest Sun chief and had more political clout than the Great Sun. The French continued to hold the Great Sun responsible for the conduct of all Natchez villages. They insisted <b>on</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the Natchez as if the people were a unified nation ruled from its capital, the Grand Village of the Natchez.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of his {{resignation}} as a municipal Civil servant in 1942, Beel was Director of Social Affairs and Deputy Town Clerk. Beel resigned because he opposed the German Occupation of The Netherlands. To avoid being taken prisoner by the German occupational forces he frequently had to go in hiding. Eindhoven was liberated on 18 September 1944 at {{the time of}} the World War II military offensive known as Operation Market Garden. Dutch resistance fighters, massively manifesting themselves immediately after the Germans had gone, saw Beel as one of them. He became the spokesman of a group of prominent citizens in Eindhoven, who had resisted the Germans during the war. The group was not in favour of a continuation of the pre-war political party-lines, with the ever-dominant Anti Revolutionary Party. In this vein they sent an Address, drafted by Beel, to Queen Wilhelmina, who still resided in London. Beel was urged to accept the function of adviser to the Military Administration (Militair Gezag), the temporary government in the liberated southern part of The Netherlands under Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. In this capacity Beel was invited by the Dutch government in exile to travel to London and to advise <b>on</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> the war victims. He arrived in London on 1 January 1945. On 10 January he visited at her request Queen Wilhelmina in her English mansion Mortimer. This visit gave a decisive turn to Beel's life.|$|E
