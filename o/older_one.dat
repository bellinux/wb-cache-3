5|$|As is his pattern, Hosseini drew on {{his early}} {{experiences}} in Afghanistan {{to create the}} foundation of the book. He states that his travels to Afghanistan later in life also influenced his writing, albeit involuntarily. For example, during a 2009 visit he met two young sisters in a remote village outside Kabul. The <b>older</b> <b>one,</b> who he estimated to be around six years old, acted as a mother figure to the younger girl. Hosseini stated that their bond formed {{the foundation of the}} relationship between Abdullah and Pari in the novel.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} mentioned by Franz Nopcsa in 1923 as a subfamily of Acanthopholidae, {{along with the}} previously defined Acanthopholinae. The family has gone through many taxonomic revisions since it was defined by Nopcsa in 1902. It is now recognized as a junior synonym of the family Nodosauridae. The subfamily now includes the genera Anoplosaurus, Europelta, Hungarosaurus, and Struthiosaurus, designated as the type genus. Because of the instability of Acanthopholis, the generic namesake of Acanthopholinae, and its current identification as a nomen dubium, Struthiosaurinae, the next named group, was decidedly used over the <b>older</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|The ancient {{surface of}} Callisto {{is one of}} the most heavily cratered in the Solar System. In fact, the crater density is close to : any new crater will tend to erase an <b>older</b> <b>one.</b> The {{large-scale}} geology is relatively simple; there are no large mountains on Callisto, volcanoes or other endogenic tectonic features. The impact craters and multi-ring structures—together with associated fractures, scarps and deposits—are the only large features to be found on the surface.|$|E
50|$|In Being Human (UK), the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are a {{group of}} vampires of varying ages. They are {{introduced}} with Ivan in series 2, and Hal Yorke, {{a member of the}} series 4-5 trio, is an <b>Old</b> <b>One.</b> Series four's main plot revolves around the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> trying to take over the world. The vampire world takes great effort to prepare for them, including rituals, Cutler's plan, even such things as red carpets. The <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are unaffected by religious symbols. Mr. Snow is an <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> and also one of the first vampires, whose blood can be found in every vampire.|$|R
50|$|Old Speech: This is {{the spoken}} {{form of the}} ancient {{language}} of the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b> When an <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> comes to power, this language is used instinctively by the <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> when speaking {{to members of the}} Light or the Dark. Will Stanton begins to do this without even realizing it. When an <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> speaks the <b>Old</b> Speech in front of a normal human, it will sound like gibberish.Some agents of the Dark, such as the Rider, can also speak Old Speech, but with a distinctive accent which gives them away to the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R

5|$|There are two {{connected}} Underground stations at Victoria, {{on different}} levels and built {{more than a}} century apart. The <b>older</b> <b>one,</b> {{on the north side of}} the bus station, serves the District and Circle lines, constructed by 'cut and cover' methods just below road level. The newer station, closer to the main line station, serves the Victoria line, a deep-level tube. Each has its own ticket hall, and the two are connected by a pedestrian passage beneath the bus station.|$|E
5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the <b>older</b> <b>one</b> and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.|$|E
5|$|Males {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, with younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an <b>older</b> <b>one</b> for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males tend to have more supportive and equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E

50|$|The {{leader of}} the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> is/was a Great <b>Old</b> <b>One</b> once called Xy who, {{through a series of}} {{circumstances}} and betrayal, forgot his own past and now believes himself to be Thoth, the ancient Egyptian god of Wisdom. It was he, as Thoth, who helped to fashion the super-spell that would finally force the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> into mystic slumber.|$|R
5000|$|They {{arrive to}} find out by Scarlett's {{housekeeper}} that Scarlett's father has rushed her to Hong Kong on apparent [...] "urgent business". Matt is very disappointed by this news and he, Jamie and Richard have a meeting with The Nexus where Matt finally discovers the Old Ones' plan. The <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> have trapped Scarlett in Hong Kong, China in hope of luring Matt there too by using Scarlett as the bait. It is then discovered that the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> want the Gatekeepers to have the diary, {{so that they can}} discover where the doors around the world are, and as there is one in Hong Kong the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> hope the Gatekeepers will go through the door where the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> will capture them all and torture them, whilst the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> take over the world. It is then revealed that Scarlett's father works for Nightrise and so will give Scarlett to the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Hastings Chapel {{contains}} {{a number of}} family monuments, including a large alabaster tomb for Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon, who died in 1561, and his countess, Catherine. The monument was carved by Joseph Pickford to a design by William Kent. A memorial to Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon, who died in 1746, is on the east wall and is by Michael Rysbrack. His widow, Selina, founded a training college for evangelical ministers, and a sculpture of her in mourning, also by Rysbrack, is placed by her husband's memorial. The countess herself is remembered through a large brass plaque in the chancel floor. The larger of two vaults containing the coffins of the Hastings family lies beneath the chancel, and the smaller and <b>older</b> <b>one</b> is under their chapel.|$|E
5|$|The present building, {{dating from}} around 1283 to 1537, mostly {{replaced}} the earlier monastic church founded in 1093 {{which was built}} in the Norman style. It is believed that the newer church was built around the <b>older</b> <b>one.</b> That the few remaining parts of the Norman church are of small proportions, while the height and width of the Gothic church are generous would seem to confirm this belief. Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept, which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to the sacristy, which was formerly a chapel. The transept has retained an early 16th-century coffered ceiling with decorated bosses, two of which are carved with the arms of HenryVIII and Cardinal Wolsey.|$|E
25|$|GNOME Builder {{is the new}} {{integrated}} development environment, Anjuta is the <b>older</b> <b>one.</b> Glade Interface Designer software constructs graphical interfaces {{using the}} graphical control elements in GTK+. Devhelp is an API browser, Accerciser an accessibility explorer.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> were a {{race that}} had evolved even earlier than the Necrontyr, but along {{substantially}} different lines. Where the Necrontyr developed purely on science and technology, leaving spirituality and mysticism in the dark annals of their history, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> embraced both science and their spirituality. In their alternate philosophies and mystic practices, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> eventually gained access to the primordial Warp, but not the Warp {{as it is known}} in the 41st Millennium. In the days of the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> the Warp was a shining parallel reality where emotions, thoughts, and even dreams were intensely reflected and molded together. Through natural fluency and masterful concentration, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> used the Warp to become a civilization of powerful psykers, with supernatural abilities far exceeding any other sentient race in the galaxy. These abilities gave the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> a harmonious bond with (as well as control over) great cosmic forces, bestowing onto them the gift of immortality and near-omniscience. It is not known why the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> refused to trade or even interact with the expanding Necrontyr empire at the time, however their continual refusal to share their knowledge, most especially on the secrets of immortality, would eventually garner the enmity of the short-lived Necrontyr. This simmering hatred was used as a basis by the Triarchs to wage war with the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> created two massive gates at {{the poles}} that allowed instant {{transport}} between the Warhammer world and wherever the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> came from. Later, {{in the coming}} of Chaos, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> either went missing, or sacrificed themselves to try to destroy the polar gates and halt the never-ending tide of Chaos in a cataclysmic explosion. Every race formed by the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> fought against the threat of Chaos, including the great armies of the Lizardmen which consisted of billions of Saurus. After the wars, the Slann immediately put defences and wards in place to better contain the threat of Chaos.|$|R

25|$|In 1852 Eston {{moved with}} his wife and three {{children}} to Madison, Wisconsin, where they changed their surname to Jefferson and entered the white community. Their sons both served in the Union Army, and the <b>older</b> <b>one,</b> John Wayles Jefferson, achieved the rank of colonel. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, becoming a wealthy cotton broker and never married.|$|E
25|$|North Kent {{is heavily}} industrialised with cement-making at Northfleet and Cuxton, brickmaking at Sittingbourne, {{shipbuilding}} on the Medway and Swale, engineering and aircraft {{design and construction}} at Rochester, chemicals at Dartford and papermaking at Swanley, and oil refining at Grain. A steel mini mill in Sheerness and a rolling mill in Queenborough.There are two nuclear power stations at Dungeness, although the <b>older</b> <b>one,</b> built in 1965, was closed {{at the end of}} 2006.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of Warhammer 40,000, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> traveled through space manipulating minor species on several planets and growing them into tools for their {{battle against the}} C'tan. The Slann were probably their servants. Although a reference in the novel Ghostmaker (2000) might indicate that the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> could be the Eldar, all other instances that refer to both the Eldar and the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> make clear that the two are separate races, the Eldar always being less powerful than [...] - [...] and usually servants and/or creations of [...] - [...] the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the frequency of hematoma formation subsequent to injection of dental local anesthetics in 4, 134 children, 3 to 13 years of age. Hematoma formation occurred following 0. 1 % of the injections, all being buccal infiltrations of maxillary molars. This represents a 0. 4 % incidence of hematoma formation subsequent to this injection. There was no age specificity in hematoma formation, occurring in <b>one</b> 5 year <b>old,</b> <b>one</b> 7 year <b>old,</b> <b>one</b> 8 year <b>old,</b> <b>one</b> 10 year <b>old,</b> and <b>one</b> 11 year <b>old...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are {{the main}} villains in Anthony Horowitz's book series The Power of Five (2005-2012). As shapeshifting demons, they can take many forms. In the series, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> ruled Earth ten {{thousand}} years ago and suppressed numerous human rebellions before finally being banished into another dimension by the Gatekeepers, who are later reincarnated into modern teenagers {{in order to stop}} the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> when their prison is unlocked.|$|R
25|$|In 1866 and 1868, Elmore and Chilton {{counties}} {{were split}} off from Autauga County, {{and the county}} seat {{was moved to the}} population center of Prattville, where a new courthouse was completed by local builder George L. Smith in 1870. In 1906, a new and larger courthouse was erected in a modified Richardsonian Romanesque style a block north of the <b>older</b> <b>one.</b> The building was designed by Bruce Architectural Co. of Birmingham and built by Dobson & Bynum of Montgomery.|$|E
25|$|The four Manning Wardle saddle tanks {{from the}} Inland Waterways and Docks Department were {{identical}} so PR designated them class M. These were satisfactory as shunting locomotives and PR {{kept them in}} service for many years. The J. Aird & Co. Manning Wardles were dissimilar and the PMR had already lost the <b>older</b> <b>one</b> in 1918 in a collision on the Jerusalem branch with an LSWR 395 class (see above). PR disposed of the Hanomag well tank and the former Aird 1902 Manning Wardle for scrap in 1928.|$|E
25|$|The {{platform}} of the Stoivadeion dedicated to Dionysus bears {{a statue of}} the god of wine and the life-force. On {{either side of the}} platform, a pillar supports a colossal phallus, the symbol of Dionysus. The southern pillar, which is decorated with relief scenes from the Dionysiac circle, was erected around 300BCE to celebrate a winning theatrical performance. The statue of Dionysus was originally flanked by those of two actors impersonating Paposilenoi (conserved in the Archaeological Museum of Delos). The marble theatre is a rebuilding of an <b>older</b> <b>one,</b> undertaken shortly after 300BCE.|$|E

25|$|Terminal 1 is {{the main}} {{building}} and features large landside and airside areas containing several shops and service facilities. It consists of two check-in halls, the <b>older</b> <b>one</b> containing 13 desks (1–13), and the newer one housing 68 desks (37–89 and 90–106). The joint departures area features 29 gates, {{most of which are}} equipped with jet-bridges, with 7 of them designated to non-Schengen destinations. As the airport features several more apron stands, bus boarding is also frequently used here. Most airlines use Terminal 1, including TAP Air Portugal and its Star Alliance partners.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, many {{researchers}} {{have come to believe}} that one variant of the northeastern Iberian script, the <b>older</b> <b>one</b> according to the archaeological contexts, distinguished voicing in the plosives by adding a stroke to the glyphs for the alveolar (/d/~/t/) and velar (/g/~/k/) syllables, creating distinct glyphs for unvoiced /t/ and /k/, and restricting the original glyphs to voiced /d/ and /g/. (This is the so-called dual signary model: see northeastern Iberian script.) If correct, this innovation would parallel the creation of the Latin letter G by the addition of a stroke to C, which had previously stood for both /k/ and /g/.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} yet who owned the house {{through the middle of}} the next century. But around 1810, it is believed, the {{original}} Federal style mantel on the main fireplace was replaced with the current one. The same 1882 history that assesses the house as being built around 1730 claims that the house had never passed out of the Martin family, although Edward Martin, the family member living in the area at that time, appeared to be living in the house Gottlieb Martin had built rather than the <b>older</b> <b>one,</b> which was recorded as being the residence of E.L. Traver, another farmer and member of a prominent local family of longstanding residence in the area.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> {{appear in}} the Time Quartet (1962-1986), Madeleine L'Engle's series of science fantasy books about the Murry family, notably in A Swiftly Tilting Planet (1978). Similar {{to those found in}} Susan Cooper's The Dark Is Rising series, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are humans born with unusual mystical powers and {{dedicated}} to a never-ending struggle against the powers of darkness and evil. In both series, the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are associated with an Old Music.|$|R

50|$|Illyria was {{loved and}} feared as {{few of the}} <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> were, so much so she still had {{followers}} and acolytes in the modern day. When the <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> lost their claim over this world, Illyria's essence {{was placed in a}} stone sarcophagus, her powers drained and placed in jewels embedded on her coffin. Her sarcophagus was placed in a mystical graveyard known as The Deeper Well along with the coffins of other <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b> A warrior of good and his army were assigned to guard the Deeper Well to prevent anyone from extracting one of the coffins, as <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> are capable of resurrection.
