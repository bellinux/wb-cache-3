The two routes run along a two-lane undivided road that heads through fields and woodland with some development, passing through the community of Holicong. Upon reaching the unincorporated village of Lahaska, the two routes split, with PA 263 bearing <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and becoming Upper York Road, a two-lane undivided road. The route passes through Peddler's Village before coming to an intersection with Street Road. At Street Road, PA 263 exits Buckingham Township and enters Solebury Township.|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} came in LCIs. These were craft {{that had no}} ramps; {{infantry}} disembarked from the down gangways. That they were not suitable for an assault landing was not overlooked, {{but they were all}} that was available. The first wave's mission had been to capture Scarlet Beach and the foreshore. Since that had not been done, they came under fire from the Japanese bunkers. Despite explicit orders not to, they replied with their Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. Some helped to suppress the Japanese machine guns, while others fired wildly and caused casualties among the Australian troops ashore. Like the first wave, they veered <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> adding to the chaos. At least three of the LCIs grounded on a sand bar, but were able to retract and make better landings, although still on the wrong beach.|$|E

5|$|On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet crashed {{while taking}} off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was {{described}} as having reached {{two-thirds of the way}} down the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway. On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on the runway. On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, veered <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> of the runway, and skidded three thousand feet while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency chutes to evacuate the plane safely. On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north of the runway. On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff. On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north of the runway after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a Minimum Interval Takeoff drill. On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers. The jet, which crashed about 2.4 miles off the TransCanada Highway in New Brunswick, was attempting to land at Loring.|$|E

25|$|Stephen and Stirling {{moved their}} {{divisions}} without incident, {{even though their}} troops were coming under fire from the enemy's light troops. De Borre somehow mismanaged the shift of Sullivan's division. Instead of simply moving to the right, the Frenchman ordered the division to file <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and circle back to the northeast. At {{the end of the}} bizarre maneuver, the 1st Brigade was in almost the same position it started. Instead of being alongside the 1st Brigade, the 2nd Brigade was behind it. At this moment, the crack Brigade of Guards supported by two 12-pound cannons attacked. When the sound of gunfire erupted, the confused soldiers of the 2nd Brigade volleyed into the backs of the 1st Brigade. The 1st Maryland Regiment put up some resistance, suffering 26 casualties, but the entire division soon crumbled. The soldiers headed to the rear pursued by the British Guards. De Borre later stated to Samuel Smith of the 4th Maryland that a wound on his cheek was caused by the English firing fish hooks. Smith suspected that de Borre misrepresented his injury and that it was caused by riding through some briars. Since it led the column of march, Hazen's regiment apparently did not take part in de Borre's maneuver and instead joined Stirling's left flank.|$|E

[...] The navy gunners, with the only weapons the British had available to contest the riflemen at that range, were now out of position, and were also being threatened by the large militia force approaching the earthworks. [...] They spiked their guns and retreated across the bridge, and Captain Leslie ordered his men to retreat into Fort Murray.

500|$|In Nan Sector, the 8th Brigade advance started {{slower than}} that of the 7th Brigade, because the Chaudières had lost most of their {{equipment}} on the advance over the beaches. The Queen's Own Rifles' [...] "C" [...] Company was pinned down at the edge of Bernières by sniper-fire, and could not cross the open fields behind the town; their armoured support was also stopped by heavy antitank fire coming from Beny-sur-Mer. The Chaudières [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] Companies were caught in the crossfire; [...] "B" [...] Company lost almost an entire platoon when a German 88mm scored hit a Priest self-propelled gun. Chaudière and QOR progress was slow; all told, it took nearly two hours for artillery and heavy guns to clear the defences at Beny-sur-Mer, allowing the QOR to advance towards the town. Beny-sur-Mer was reported cleared at 14:00, at which point the Chaudières began to mass in the town for a further advance south towards Carpiquet. The QOR broke <b>off</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> to engage heavy artillery batteries to the west of Beny, and [...] "B" [...] Company was assisted by the guns of HMCS Algonquin, which destroyed a bunker of 105mm guns. To their east, [...] "C" [...] and [...] "D" [...] Company of the North Shores advanced towards Tailleville—the headquarters of II Battalion of the 736th Grenadiers. Mortar fire north of the headquarters was both concentrated and accurate, slowing the advance of [...] "C" [...] Company. They were supported in their drive south by tanks of the Fort Garry Horse, which caught close to 100 German defenders in open fields. The North Shores and their armour support entered Tailleville at 14:00, at which point the six tanks of [...] "C" [...] Squadron moved through the village, destroying German gun emplacements. The defenders of the II Battalion had created a complex underground bunker system in the village, which enabled them to continuously outflank Canadian infantry; it took another seven hours to clear Tailleville of defenders, which ensured that the North Shores would be unable to capture German radar sites to the south on D-Day.|$|E
