25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, {{it seems to me that}} I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> outlook now.|$|E

[...] "People {{get a bit}} worried about me," [...] he told Cricinfo in 2008, [...] "Shane Warne's been a fine bowler—no doubt about it, he's done some wonderful things—but Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett, who have better strike-rates per match than Warne and never played against a 2nd XI —they only played against the best—had no rough to bowl at. I never had to bat to a leg-spinner who bowled into the rough <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> leg stump, and I played for a long time." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2009, Rowland ended her {{professional}} relationship with Beyoncé's father Mathew Knowles, who had managed her career {{since she was}} a member of Destiny's Child. Knowles stressed that no animosity was involved in the decision and acknowledged that Rowland will always be a part of the Knowles family. Then two months later, Rowland announced that she left Columbia Records, adding that she [...] "felt the need to explore new directions, new challenges, and new freedoms <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> comfort zone." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rowland stated that the label ended her contract because Ms. Kelly was not commercially successful. She later signed with Universal Motown Records.|$|E
500|$|Talking {{about her}} {{feelings}} {{when she got}} the part, Bell expressed, [...] "Since I was 4 years old, I dreamed {{of being in a}} Disney animated film," [...] she said. [...] "It was the first goal I ever set for myself. It seemed like {{it would be a very}} unrealistic one." [...] She described Disney movies as [...] "the ones [...] watched over and over again when [...] was a kid," [...] and continued, [...] "I knew every line from The Little Mermaid. I love Aladdin. When asked about her favorite Disney character, Bell said, [...] "Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Because I think it was a shift that Disney had, where a female lead—the [...] "princess," [...] I guess—didn't just want to find her mate. She was singing [...] "I want to be where the people are. I want to see the world. I want to venture <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> comfort zone."" [...] Bell described her initial reaction when she first found that she was cast as [...] "I was in glee". Lee admitted Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened a couple of vocal tracks from The Little Mermaid, including [...] "Part of Your World" [...] that the actress recorded when she was young, stating that without these recordings, it would've been very difficult to the find the right one to play Anna.|$|E
500|$|The episode's flashforwards {{commence}} with Ben {{waking up}} alarmed in the Sahara with a wounded {{right arm and}} vapor rising from him. [...] The Dharma Initiative parka that he wears was codenamed [...] "Dharka" [...] by the writers. [...] A couple of Easter eggs are present in this scene: Ben's parka has a name tag that indicates that it was formerly owned by Edgar Halliwax (François Chau) and it displays the first appearance of the logo for a Dharma station called the [...] "Orchid" [...] {{that would not be}} seen until the episode titled [...] "There's No Place Like Home". [...] Another Easter egg is glimpsed in the next scene, when Ben reveals his forged Canadian passport previously seen in [...] "The Economist" [...] for his alias Dean Moriarty, which is also the name of the central character in Jack Kerouac's 1951 novel On the Road. [...] Among the most frequent questions that the writers are asked is whether they have planned out future storylines, so the writers try to allude to future plot points, such as with the Dharka scene, that they can later call on as proof that they do know where the story is headed. [...] Director Jack Bender described the scene, which was filmed in a Hawaiian rock quarry, as especially hard to shoot because the actors had to ride horses and use guns, the crew had to relocate due to rocks present that were unsuitable for the scene, and Bender walked head-first into a crane. [...] Emerson stated that the set is [...] "definitely a no-glamour zone... I thought we would ease into things. [...] Instead, I get this all-Ben extravaganza: combat, riding horses, foreign languages. And piano playing! [...] All waaaay <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> comfort zone.

2500|$|Cosgrave {{wrote to}} the Party Leader, Richard Mulcahy, in May 1947, on the poor {{attendance}} in the Dáil, and informed his leader that [...] "I cannot any longer conscientiously ask the public to support the party as a party, and in the circumstances I do not propose to speak at meetings <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> constituency." [...] Nevertheless, Cosgrave became the parliamentary secretary to the Taoiseach and Chief Whip when the party returned to power in 1948. Mulcahy, while remaining leader of Fine Gael, allowed John A Costello to become Taoiseach of the Inter Party Government as the latter had wider appeal and acceptance.|$|E
2500|$|I find {{in myself}} innumerable ideas of things which, {{though they may}} not exist outside me, can't {{be said to be}} nothing. While I have some control over my {{thoughts}} of these things, I do not make the things up: they have their own real and immutable natures. Suppose, for example, that I have a mental image of a triangle. While it may be that no figure of this sort does exist or ever has existed <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> thought, the figure has a fixed nature (essence or form), immutable and eternal, which hasn't been produced by me and isn't dependent of my mind.

2500|$|Hughes was {{appointed}} {{a member of}} the Order of Merit by Queen Elizabeth II just before he died. He continued to live at the house in Devon, until suffering a fatal myocardial infarction on 28 October 1998 while undergoing hospital treatment for colon cancer in Southwark, London. His funeral was held on 3 November 1998, at North Tawton church, and he was cremated in Exeter. Speaking at the funeral, fellow poet Seamus Heaney, said: [...] "No death <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> immediate family has left me feeling more bereft. No death in my lifetime has hurt poets more. He was a tower of tenderness and strength, a great arch under which the least of poetry's children could enter and feel secure. His creative powers were, as Shakespeare said, still crescent. By his death, the veil of poetry is rent and the walls of learning broken." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2009, it was {{revealed}} that the singer was parting ways with Columbia Records. Speaking of her decision to leave, Rowland said, [...] "as a solo artist, I felt the need to explore new directions, new challenges, and new freedoms <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> comfort zone and my friends and family at Columbia have been incredibly understanding about my evolution. I want to thank everyone at Columbia for the love and support they've shown and I will never forget how many good times we've had over the years." [...] It was also announced in March that Guetta was releasing [...] "When Love Takes Over", his collaboration with Rowland. The song went on to be a worldwide success for the duo. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "the success comes at an intriguing time in Rowland's career", having noted that she had landed a hosting job on Bravo's The Fashion Show and was in between labels.|$|E
2500|$|Manzon's {{role was}} {{originally}} intended {{for one of}} the most prominent European actors, Lino Ventura. Despite Ventura's concerns about his English, he also initially approved Friedkin's proposal. However, after McQueen backed out, Ventura was hesitant to take part in the movie. Mastroianni was still interested but had problems related to his daughter's custody after his separation from Catherine Deneuve, which eventually made him decline the director's offer. After the disagreement with McQueen, Friedkin approached Robert Mitchum who, despite appreciating the script, sternly declined, asking Friedkin [...] "Why would I want to go to Ecuador for two or three months to fall out of a truck? I can do that <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> house." [...] Another candidate for Scanlon's role was Warren Oates, but since the movie's budget escalated beyond $10 million, the studio decided that [...] " [...] name wasn't big enough to carry that big a picture." [...] They eventually worked together on Friedkin's follow-up to Sorcerer, titled The Brink's Job.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Hoppus {{was born}} in Ridgecrest, California, on March 15, 1972, to Kerry Wernz and Tex Hoppus. Ridgecrest {{is a small town}} in the California desert, {{composed}} mainly of what Hoppus later described as [...] "geniuses, scientists, physicists and then just complete strung-out meth-heads". Hoppus' Finnish paternal great-grandparents, Aaron and Lempi Orrenmaa, emigrated to the U.S. from Laihia. His father, like many in Ridgecrest, worked for the U.S. Department of Defense, designing missiles and bombs for the town's Navy testing center. Hoppus describes himself as [...] "pretty mellow" [...] until his parents divorced when he was eight, which had a [...] "drastic, unsettling effect" [...] on him. [...] "When my parents argued, it was always behind closed doors. I remember sitting <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> parents' room when I was seven years old, hearing the dulled voice of anger behind the door. It upset me a lot." [...] Following these events, he spent two years shuffling between his parents' homes with sister Anne, until he and his father moved to nearby Monterey. His father was often away earning a postgraduate degree in college. He later would describe his childhood as lonely, remarking, [...] " [...] was living by myself in the fifth grade." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mike first {{appears in}} the episode [...] "Preggers" [...] {{as a member of}} the McKinley High {{football}} team. He dances to [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] by Beyoncé with Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) and his fellow high school football players, and subsequently decides to join the New Directions glee club with his friends and teammates Matt (Dijon Talton) and Puck (Mark Salling). Mike is a very talented dancer, able to perform complicated pop-n-lock dance steps, and he is shown singing background vocals and performing short dance solos in the glee club's musical numbers. In the final episode of season one, Mike says that before New Directions, [...] "I was afraid to dance <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> room." [...] Over the summer, Mike and Tina are both arts counselors at [...] "Asian Camp", where they kiss and start dating. He gets his first vocal solo in the episode [...] "Duets" [...] when he performs [...] "Sing!" [...] from A Chorus Line with Tina, and is selected to perform a dance routine with Brittany (Heather Morris) for Sectionals. Their constant rehearsing worries Tina, who mistakenly fears that she is losing Mike to Brittany; she later apologizes to him for her doubts. He performs the show's first solo dance routine in [...] "A Night of Neglect".|$|E
2500|$|He {{began and}} {{finished}} {{composition of the}} Symphonie fantastique in 1830, a work which would bring Berlioz much fame and notoriety. He entered into a relationship with– and subsequently became engaged to– Marie Moke, despite the symphony being inspired by Berlioz's obsession with Harriet Smithson. As his fourth cantata for submittal to the Prix de Rome neared completion, the July Revolution began. [...] "I was finishing my cantata when the revolution broke out," [...] he recorded in his Mémoires. [...] "I dashed off the final pages of my orchestral score {{to the sound of}} stray bullets coming over the roofs and pattering on the wall <b>outside</b> <b>my</b> window. On the 29th I had finished, and was free to go out and roam about Paris till morning, pistol in hand." [...] He finally won the prize with the cantata Sardanapale. He also arranged the French national anthem La Marseillaise and composed an overture to Shakespeare's The Tempest, which was the first of his pieces to play at the Paris Opéra. An hour before the performance, a sudden storm created the worst rain in Paris in 50 years, meaning the performance was almost deserted. Berlioz met Franz Liszt who was also attending the concert. This proved to {{be the beginning of a}} long friendship. Liszt would later transcribe the entire Symphonie fantastique for piano to enable more people to hear it.|$|E
