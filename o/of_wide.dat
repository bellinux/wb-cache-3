40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the findings of}} a two-year study that investigated the potential benefits <b>of</b> <b>wider</b> edge line pavement markings. There were four general tasks discussed in the report: 1) review of literature, 2) survey {{of the state of the}} practice, 3) summary of recent safety analyses, and 4) a human factors nighttime study of the impact <b>of</b> <b>wider</b> and brighter edge line pavement markings. The results show that states are increasing their use <b>of</b> <b>wider</b> edge lines, and safety studies are beginning to show evidence supporting the use <b>of</b> <b>wider</b> edge lines for two-lane highways. The human factors study included surrogate safety measures, such as lateral placement, edge line encroachments, and driver eye glance patterns. The results from these metrics all support positive safety findings. Pavement marking brightness had less of an impact than pavement marking width on these operational metrics. In this study, there was no attempt to relate pavement marking retroreflectivity to safety. The researchers recommend the use <b>of</b> <b>wider</b> pavement markings on two...|$|R

Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant <b>of</b> <b>wide</b> variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E

5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because <b>of</b> <b>wide</b> individual variability.|$|E
