25|$|Although {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a one-dimensional, recurring villain who might occasionally enter the Simpsons' lives and wreak some sort of havoc, Mr. Burns' popularity has led to his repeated inclusion in episodes. He is a stereotype <b>of</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>America</b> in his unquenchable desire to increase his own wealth and power, inability to remember his employees' names (including Homer's, despite frequent interactions– {{which has become a}} recurrent joke) and lack of concern for their safety and well-being. Reflecting his advanced age, Mr. Burns is given to expressing dated humor, making references to Jazz Age popular culture, and aspiring to apply obsolete technology to everyday life. Conan O'Brien has called Mr. Burns his favorite character to write for, due to his arbitrarily old age and extreme wealth.|$|E
25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder. They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. They value seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they live in a society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing <b>of</b> <b>Corporate</b> <b>America.</b> She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E
500|$|To {{promote the}} album, Fall Out Boy {{embarked}} on the Believers Never Die Tour Part Deux, which included dates in the United States and Canada. The {{name of the}} tour {{was based on the}} band's 2004 Believers Never Die Tour. In keeping with the political themes of Folie à Deux, the tour featured symbolic commentary on the current state <b>of</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>America.</b> The group began the sets with a [...] "corporate retreat" [...] in which the group performed in dress suits with policemen in riot gear playing drums {{by the side of the}} stage. Afterwards, the band would change to casual attire for the rest of the set. Wentz noted that the purpose of the formal dress was to demonstrate [...] "how the rich rob the poor", and encouraged fans to direct attention to poverty-stricken nations such as Sri Lanka and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E

2500|$|Members of {{the upper}} class control and own {{significant}} portions <b>of</b> <b>corporate</b> <b>America</b> and may exercise indirect power through the investment of capital. The high salaries {{and the potential for}} amassing great wealth through stock options have greatly increased the power and visibility of the [...] "corporate elite". There is disagreement over whether the [...] "nouveau riche" [...] should be included as members {{of the upper}} class or whether this term should exclusively be used for established families. Many sociologists and commentators make a distinction between the upper class (in the sense of those in the families of inherited wealth) and the corporate elite. By implication, the upper class is held in lower regard (as inheritors of idle wealth) than the self-made millionaires in prestigious occupations.|$|E
