500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Halo developer Bungie's former content manager Frank O'Connor said that {{the inclusion of the}} Arbiter as a playable character in Halo2 {{was supposed to be a}} [...] "secret on the scale of a Shyamalan plot twist" [...] and explains that Bungie was able to keep the public uninformed about this until the game's release, to the point that O'Connor never even considered including it on the weekly development updates posted at Bungie's webpage. O'Connor also stated that Bungie [...] "had some other things that were secrets within secrets" [...] and claimed that there was material related to the Arbiter that was kept secret during the development of Halo3 because [...] "There is an aspect of the Arbiter's character that is still secret to this day and will remain so for a good reason." [...] Story director Joseph Staten said that the purpose of introducing the Arbiter was [...] "to offer another, compelling point of view on a war where telling friend from foe wasn't always clear-cut. We knew we had a trilogy <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands,</b> so we were looking past the shock of playing as the enemy [...] ".|$|E

500|$|The graphic emblem most {{associated}} with the straight edge movement is a black [...] "X", typically drawn on the wearer's hands with a marker. According to MacKaye, [...] "We were in San Francisco, and we played a place called Mabuhay Gardens. They figured out we were underage, and they wouldn't let us play. We worked out a deal with their management that {{we just wanted to}} play and we weren't going to drink, so they got a marker and put a big 'X' <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>hand,</b> So we came back to Washington D.C. and went to this nightclub, the 9:30, and said 'Hey look, we're not going to drink and we will put this 'X' <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>hand.</b> If you see us drinking you can throw us out forever. We are not going to drink, we just came to see the music'". The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol [...] "wasn't supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth".|$|R

2500|$|In April 2006, {{asked whether}} {{negotiations}} with Russians are possible, the top separatist commander Doku Umarov answered: [...] "We offered them many times. But {{it turned out}} that we constantly press for negotiations and it's as if we are always standing with an extended hand and this is taken as a sign of our weakness. Therefore we don't plan to do this any more." [...] In the same month, the new separatist spokesman Movladi Udugov said that attacks should be expected anywhere in Russia: [...] "Today, we have a different task <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands</b> – total war, war everywhere our enemy can be reached. (...) And this means mounting attacks at any place, not just in the Caucasus but in all Russia." [...] Reflecting growing radicalization of the Chechen-led militants, Udugov said their goal was no longer Western-style democracy and independence, but the Islamist [...] "North Caucasian Emirate".|$|E

Sandwiched between his goals, he provided an assist for centre half Frazer Wright, who, up for a corner {{at the end of}} the first half, headed Bryson's cross in. For his efforts, Bryson was named man of the match and won the plaudits of his manager Jim Jefferies, who said: [...] "Craig's whole game was terrific and if he keeps playing like that we've got a real player <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands.</b> It was a top performance by him and for me he was the best player on the pitch by a mile." [...] He scored twice more and was again named man of the match in a 4–1 win against Inverness Caledonian Thistle on 22 March.

2500|$|Limestone Lad {{began his}} racing career {{competing}} in National Hunt Flat races, {{also known as}} [...] "bumpers". On his debut at Naas Racecourse on 12 February 1997, he started at odds of 20/1 and finished ninth of the twenty four runners, eighteen lengths behind the winner Mount Druid. He was well beaten in further bumpers at Naas (behind the future Grand National winner Amberleigh House), Cork and Thurles, before recording his first success in a race confined to female riders at Limerick Racecourse on 27 December. Ridden by Aileen Sloan-Lee he won [...] "easily" [...] by nine lengths from thirteen opponents at odds of 6/1. Michael Bowe later recalled [...] "I suspected we had something exciting <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands</b> when he won that day. My lasting memory after that race was holding him in the car park, giving him a piece of grass with a band playing in the background. They were playing Perfect Day - and it was". In January 1998 he finished a distant third at Navan Racecourse and then finished sixth of the ten runners at Gowran Park. On his final appearance in a bumper, the gelding led from the start to win an eleven runner contest at Naas, beating the mare Our Meg by {{two and a half}} lengths.|$|E
2500|$|Facing the {{possibility}} of defeat in the 2012 Presidential election the Obama Administration accelerated work {{in the weeks before}} the election to develop explicit rules for the targeted killing of terrorists by unmanned drones, so that a new president would inherit clear standards and procedures. The work to codify U.S. drone policy began in summer 2011. [...] "There was concern that the levers might no longer be in our hands," [...] said one unnamed U.S official. With a continuing debate about the proper limits of drone strikes, Obama did not want to leave an [...] "amorphous" [...] program to his successor, the official said. The effort, which would have been rushed to completion by January had Mitt Romney won, will now be finished at a more leisurely pace, the official said. [...] "One of the things we've got to do is put a legal architecture in place, and we need Congressional help in order to do that, to make sure that not only am I reined in but any president's reined in terms of some of the decisions that we're making," [...] Obama said and added [...] "creating a legal structure, processes, with oversight checks on how we use unmanned weapons, {{is going to be a}} challenge for me and my successors for some time to come." [...] U.S. President Obama also expressed wariness of the powerful temptation drones pose to policy makers. [...] "There's a remoteness to it that makes it tempting to think that somehow we can, without any mess <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>hands,</b> solve vexing security problems," [...] he said.|$|E
