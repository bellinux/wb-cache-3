50|$|The {{northern}} <b>olingo</b> (Bassaricyon gabbii), {{also known}} as the bushy-tailed <b>olingo</b> or as simply the <b>olingo</b> (due to it being the most commonly seen of the species), is a tree-dwelling member of the family Procyonidae, which also includes raccoons. It was the first species of <b>olingo</b> to be described, and while it is considered by some authors to be the only genuine <b>olingo</b> species, a recent review of the Bassaricyon genus has shown that there are a total of four <b>olingo</b> species, although two of the former species should now be considered as a part of this species. Its scientific name honors William More Gabb, who collected the first specimen. It is native to Central America.|$|E
50|$|The eastern lowland <b>olingo</b> (Bassaricyon alleni) is {{a species}} of <b>olingo</b> from South America, where it is known from the {{lowlands}} east of the Andes in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru and Venezuela. It is the only <b>olingo</b> species found east of the Andes. The Latin species name honors Joel Asaph Allen, the American zoologist who first described the genus Bassaricyon.|$|E
50|$|The western lowland <b>olingo</b> (Bassaricyon medius) is {{a species}} of <b>olingo</b> from Central and South America, where it is known from Panama and from Colombia and Ecuador west of the Andes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Olingos</b> {{are similar}} to the {{kinkajou}} in morphology and habits. However, genetic studies have shown that kinkajous were an early offshoot of the ancestral procyonid line and are not closely related to any of the other extant procyonids, to which they are a sister group. This divergence is thought to have occurred about 22.6 million years ago. The similarities between the kinkajou and <b>olingos</b> are thus an example of parallel evolution; the closest relatives of the <b>olingos</b> are actually the coatis. The kinkajou is distinguished from <b>olingos</b> by its prehensile tail, its foreshortened muzzle, its extrudable tongue, and its lack of anal scent glands. The only other carnivoran with a prehensile tail is the binturong of Southeast Asia.|$|R
50|$|The Central- and South American {{kinkajou}} (Potos flavus) and <b>olingos</b> (Bassaricyon sp.) {{are similar}} in appearance and behavior to African pottos, and were formerly classified with them (hence Potos). <b>Olingos</b> and kinkajous are now known {{to be members of}} the raccoon family.|$|R
5000|$|The genus Bassaricyon {{consists}} of small Neotropical procyonids, {{popularly known as}} <b>olingos</b> [...] They are native to the rainforests of Central and South America from Nicaragua to Peru. They are arboreal and nocturnal, and live at elevations from sea level to 2,750 m. <b>Olingos</b> closely resemble the kinkajou in morphology and habits, though they lack prehensile tails and extrudable tongues, have more extended muzzles, and possess anal scent glands. Genetic {{studies have shown that}} the closest relatives of the <b>olingos</b> are actually the coatis; the divergence between the two groups is estimated to have occurred about 10.2 million years (Ma) ago, while kinkajous split off from the other extant procyonids about 22.6 Ma ago. The similarities between kinkajous and <b>olingos</b> are thus an example of parallel evolution.|$|R
50|$|The eastern lowland <b>olingo</b> {{is smaller}} than the {{northern}} <b>olingo,</b> but larger than the recently described olinguito ("little olingo"), the most montane member of the genus. It {{is larger than the}} western lowland <b>olingo</b> subspecies B. medius medius from west of the Andes, but about {{the same size as the}} B. m. orinomus subspecies from eastern Panama. The pelage is slightly darker than the western species.|$|E
50|$|Beddard's <b>olingo</b> (Pocock, 1921) {{is named}} after him.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{subspecies}} of {{the western}} lowland olingo: the nominate B. m. medius (Colombia and Ecuador) and B. m. orinomus (Panama and possibly Colombia). The closest relative {{of the western}} lowland <b>olingo</b> is the other lowland <b>olingo</b> species, B. alleni, found east of the Andes, from which it diverged about 1.3 million years ago.|$|E

2500|$|Family Procyonidae: ringtails, <b>olingos,</b> kinkajou, raccoons, coatis, {{red panda}} ...|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{studies have}} shown that kinkajous are a sister group to all other extant procyonids; they split off about 22.6 Ma ago. The clades leading to coatis and <b>olingos</b> on one hand, and to ringtails and {{raccoons}} on the other, separated about 17.7 Ma ago. The divergence between <b>olingos</b> and coatis is estimated to have occurred about 10.2 Ma ago, {{at about the same time}} that ringtails and raccoons parted ways.|$|R
50|$|R. S. Jaque's <b>Olingo</b> (1944) {{included}} roots from Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, {{and several}} other non-Indo-European languages. It was generally Esperantic.|$|E
50|$|There is {{disagreement}} {{on the number}} of species in this genus, with some taxonomists splitting the populations into as many as five species (adding B. pauli to the list below), two species (dropping B. medius and B. neblina), or just a single species (B. gabbi). Until recently, only the northern <b>olingo</b> (B. gabbii) was particularly well-known, and it was usually confusingly referred to simply as an <b>olingo.</b> Olingos are quite rare in zoos and are often misidentified as kinkajous.|$|E
50|$|The closest {{relative}} of the eastern lowland <b>olingo</b> is the western lowland species, B. medius, from which it diverged about 1.3 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|Procyonidae {{includes}} the raccoons, coatis, kinkajous, <b>olingos,</b> ringtails and cacomistles. Procyonids inhabit {{a wide range}} of environments, and are generally omnivorous.|$|R
50|$|The Musteloidea {{consists}} of the families Ailuridae (red pandas), Mustelidae (mustelids: weasels, otters, martens, and badgers), Procyonidae (procyonids: raccoons, coatis, kinkajous, <b>olingos,</b> olinguitos, ringtails and cacomistles), and Mephitidae (skunks).|$|R
50|$|Procyonidae is a New World {{family of}} the order Carnivora. It {{includes}} the raccoons, coatis, kinkajous, <b>olingos,</b> olinguitos, ringtails and cacomistles. Procyonids inhabit {{a wide range of}} environments and are generally omnivorous.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>olingo</b> has a {{diet and}} habitat {{similar to those}} of kinkajous, and, when resources are in short supply, the larger animal may drive it away from its preferred trees. Predators known to feed on the northern <b>olingo</b> include the jaguarundi, ocelot, tayra, and several boas. It is believed to breed during the dry season, and to give birth to a single young after a gestation period of around ten weeks. It has lived for up to twenty-five years in captivity.|$|E
50|$|B. g. medius {{is smaller}} on average than Bassaricyon gabbii and the morphologic and genetic {{analysis}} demonstrated {{that is a}} different species: B. medius (western lowland <b>olingo).</b>|$|E
50|$|This is {{the largest}} of the <b>olingo</b> species. Its pelage is {{typically}} less rufous than the other olingos, while its tail bands are a bit more distinct.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} {{was the first}} identification of a new mammal species of the order Carnivora in the Americas in 35 years. Olinguitos were regularly seen and even publicly exhibited decades before they were recognized {{as members of a}} new species. The animal had previously been confused with its taxonomic cousins, the <b>olingos.</b> One such example was Ringerl, an olinguito who lived in the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., for a year and also toured many other zoos. Researchers unsuccessfully tried to breed her with <b>olingos,</b> not realizing she was a different species. Ringerl died in 1976.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{classification scheme}} shown below {{on the left}} predates the recent revolution {{in our understanding of}} procyonid phylogeny based on genetic sequence analysis. This outdated classification groups kinkajous and <b>olingos</b> together on the basis of similarities in morphology that are now known to be an example of parallel evolution; similarly, coatis are shown as being most closely related to raccoons, when in fact they are closest to <b>olingos.</b> Below right is a cladogram showing the results of the recent molecular studies. Genus Nasuella was not included in these studies, but in a separate study was found to nest within Nasua.|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{evidence}} (cytochrome b sequences) {{has suggested}} that the genus Nasuella should be merged into Nasua, as the latter is otherwise paraphyletic. Other genetic {{studies have shown that the}} closest relatives of the coatis are the <b>olingos</b> (genus Bassaricyon); the two lineages are thought to have diverged about 10.2 million years ago.|$|R
5000|$|With data {{derived from}} anatomy, morphometrics, nuclear and {{mitochondrial}} DNA, field observations, and geographic range modeling, Helgen and coworkers demonstrated that four <b>olingo</b> species can be recognized: ...|$|E
50|$|The closest {{relatives}} of B. gabbii {{are the two}} lowland <b>olingo</b> species of Panama and northwestern South America, B. alleni and B. medius, from which it diverged about 1.8 million years ago.|$|E
50|$|An undescribed <b>olingo,</b> {{similar to}} but {{distinct}} from B. alleni, {{was discovered in}} 2006 by Kristofer Helgen at Las Maquinas in the Andes of Ecuador. He named this species B. neblina or olinguito and presented his findings on August 15, 2013.|$|E
50|$|Nasua {{differs from}} Nasuella in being larger and having larger canine teeth, but {{preliminary}} genetic evidence (cytochrome b sequences) suggests that Nasuella should be merged into Nasua. Other genetic {{studies have shown}} that the closest relatives of the coatis are the <b>olingos</b> (genus Bassaricyon), from which they diverged about 10.2 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} historical uncertainty over the correct classification of several members. The red panda was previously classified in this family, {{but it is}} now classified it in its own family, the Ailuridae, based on molecular biology studies. The status of the various <b>olingos</b> was disputed: some regarded them all as subspecies of Bassaricyon gabbii before DNA sequence data demonstrated otherwise.|$|R
50|$|The olinguito {{is smaller}} than the other species in the genus Bassaricyon. Its body (head to rump) is {{approximately}} 355 mm long, and its tail 335 - 424 mm long. It is also much furrier and has a shorter tail and smaller ears than others that share its genus. The olinguito {{is found in the}} northern Andes at altitudes between 1500 and 2750 m above sea level, which is much higher than the habitats for other <b>olingos.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adults have a head-body {{length of}} 36 to 42 cm, with a 38 to 48 cm tail. They weigh around 1.2 to 1.4 kg. The {{northern}} <b>olingo</b> possesses {{a pair of}} anal scent glands, capable of producing a foul-smelling chemical when the animal is alarmed.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{discovery}} was announced on 15 August 2013 by Kristofer Helgen, {{the curator of}} mammals at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, <b>olingo</b> expert Roland Kays of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences and collaborators. [...] Helgen discovered specimens of the species in storage at The Field Museum in Chicago and used DNA testing to confirm a new species.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>olingo</b> is a nocturnal herbivore, feeding {{almost entirely}} on fruit, especially figs. It has been observed to drink the nectar of balsa trees during the dry season, and, on rare occasions, to pursue and eat small mammals, such as mice and squirrels. During the day, it sleeps in dens located in large trees. It has an estimated home range of around 23 ha.|$|E
50|$|The {{diversification}} {{of the genus}} apparently started about 3.5 million years ago, when B. neblina branched off from the others; B. gabbii then split off about 1.8 Ma ago, and the two lowland species, B. alleni and B. medius, diverged about 1.3 Ma ago. The dating and biogeography modeling suggest that the earliest {{diversification of}} the genus took place in northwestern South America shortly after the ancestors of <b>olingos</b> first invaded the continent from Central America {{as part of the}} Great American Interchange.|$|R
5000|$|The olinguito is {{distinct}} from the other species within the genus, popularly known as [...] "olingos", and also from the kinkajou (kinkajous resemble <b>olingos,</b> but are not closely related). Its average weight is 900 g, making it the smallest procyonid. The animal is an omnivorous frugivore that eats mainly fruits (such as figs), but also insects and nectar; this diet results in feces the size of small blueberries. The olinguito {{is thought to be}} solitary, nocturnal and moderately reclusive. Olinguitos appear to be strictly arboreal. They have a single pair of mammae, and probably produce a single offspring at a time.|$|R
50|$|The Cozumel Island coati (Nasua narica nelsoni) is a coati {{from the}} Mexican island of Cozumel. It {{is in the}} family Procyonidae, which also {{includes}} raccoons, <b>olingos,</b> and kinkajous. It has been treated as a species, {{but the vast majority}} of recent authorities treat it as a subspecies of the white-nosed coati. Cozumel Island coatis are slightly smaller than the white-nosed coatis of the adjacent mainland (N. n. yucatanica); but, when compared more widely to white-nosed coatis, the difference in size is not as clear. The level of other differences also support its status as a subspecies rather than a separate species.|$|R
