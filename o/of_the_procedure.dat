5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E
5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the urinary system {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure,</b> however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the vascular system entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure.</b> Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk {{through a variety of}} mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's campaigns {{acquired}} Italian {{pieces by}} treaties, as war reparations, and Northern European pieces as spoils {{as well as}} some antiquities excavated in Egypt, though {{the vast majority of the}} latter were seized as war reparations by the British army and are now part of collections of the British Museum. On the other hand, the Dendera zodiac is, like the Rosetta stone, claimed by Egypt even though it was acquired in 1821, before the Egyptian Anti-export legislation of 1835. The Louvre administration has thus argued in favor of retaining this item despite requests by Egypt for its return. The museum participates too in arbitration sessions held via UNESCO's Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to Its Countries of Origin. The museum consequently returned in 2009 five Egyptian fragments of frescoes (30cm x 15cm each) whose existence of the tomb of origin had only been brought to the authorities attention in 2008, eight to five years after their good-faith acquisition by the museum from two private collections and after the necessary respect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> of déclassement from French public collections before the Commission scientifique nationale des collections des musées de France.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis is the {{administration}} of an enzyme (intravenous or directly into the affected vein through a catheter), which acts to enzymatically break up clots. This may {{reduce the risk of}} post-thrombotic syndrome by a third, and possibly reduce the risk of leg ulcers, but is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The ACCP currently suggests anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis, but patients may choose thrombolysis if prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome outweighs concerns over the complexity, bleeding risk, and cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedure.</b> NICE recommends that thrombolysis is considered in those who have had symptoms for less than two weeks, are normally well, have a good life expectancy and a low risk of bleeding.|$|E

40|$|Objective: While patient-reported outcome {{measures}} (PROMs) in ERCP are scarce, these reports {{are important for}} making improvements in quality of care. This study sought to document patient satisfaction and specifically pain related to endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedures and to identify predictors for these experiences. Methods From 2007 through 2009, prospective data from consecutive ERCP procedures at 11 hospitals during normal daily practice were recorded. Information regarding undesirable events that occurred during a 30 -day follow-up period was also reported. The patient-reported pain, discomfort and general satisfaction with the ERCP were recorded. Results: Data from 2808 ERCP procedures were included in this study. Patient questionnaires were returned for 52. 6 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures.</b> Moderate or severe pain was experienced in 15. 5 % and 14. 0 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> during <b>the</b> ERCP and in 10. 8 % and 7. 7 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures</b> after <b>the</b> ERCP, respectively. In addition, female gender, endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST), and longer procedure times served as independent predictors of increased pain during the ERCP. The performing hospitals and sedation regimens were independent predictors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedural pain experience. In 90. 9 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures,</b> <b>the</b> patients {{were satisfied with the}} information overall, and in 98. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>procedures,</b> <b>the</b> patients were satisfied with the treatment provided. Independent predictors <b>of</b> dissatisfaction with <b>the</b> treatment included <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> specific complications after ERCP and pain during or after <b>the</b> <b>procedure.</b> Conclusions: Female gender, <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> EST and longer procedure times were independent predictors for increased procedure-related pain. The individual hospital and sedation regimen predicts the patient's pain experience. </p...|$|R
