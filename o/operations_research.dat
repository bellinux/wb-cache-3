5|$|Saville {{was made}} {{lieutenant}} colonel on January 5, 1942. In tackling {{the problem of}} air defense of the Panama Canal Zone, he brought together civilian mathematicians and military defense experts to organize the first <b>operations</b> <b>research</b> group in the Air Corps, following two such groups formed by the Navy. Saville was promoted to brigadier general on November 2.|$|E
5|$|Saville was a {{technical}} and scientific-minded leader who helped pioneer advanced mathematics for <b>operations</b> <b>research,</b> and computer systems for centralized coordination of air defense. He advocated {{the expansion of}} radar installations to create an unbroken air defense network. He explored {{the concept of a}} military aircraft designed around an integrated electronics fire-control system built by various subcontractors. After retiring from the military, Saville worked in the defense industry.|$|E

5|$|The Army {{contacted}} the Johns Hopkins University <b>Operations</b> <b>Research</b> Office (ORO) {{to consider the}} task of shooting down ballistic missiles using a Nike-like system. The ORO report took three years to complete, and the resulting The Defense of the United States Against Aircraft and Missiles was comprehensive. While this study was still progressing, in February 1955 the Army began initial talks with Bell, and in March they contracted Bell's Nike team to begin a detailed 18-month study of the problem under the name Nike II.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Operations</b> <b>Research</b> Section (ORS) {{was also}} set up {{in light of the}} success of such {{programs}} in Fighter and Bomber Commands. Many scientists were appointed to the ORS Coastal Command. Some acted as advisors to Air Marshal Bowhill. Four sections were set up; planned flying and maintenance, ASO, A/S, and weather and navigation. Resources were spread evenly. However, A/S received more attention. The rest did not receive close attention until 1943, when the U-boats had been contained and a certain degree of ascendancy achieved.|$|E
5|$|Frances Elizabeth Somerville Alexander (née Caldwell; 13 December 1908 – 15 October 1958) was a British geologist, academic, and physicist, whose wartime {{work with}} radar and radio led to early {{developments}} in radio astronomy. Alexander earned her PhD from Newnham College, Cambridge, {{and worked in}} Radio Direction Finding at Singapore Naval Base from 1938 to 1941. In January 1941, unable to return to Singapore from New Zealand, she became Head of <b>Operations</b> <b>Research</b> in New Zealand's Radio Development Lab, Wellington. In 1945, Alexander correctly interpreted that anomalous radar signals picked up on Norfolk Island were caused by the sun. This interpretation became pioneering {{work in the field}} of radio astronomy, making her one of the first women scientists to work in that field, albeit briefly.|$|E

5|$|Most major belligerents {{attempted}} {{to solve the}} problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine. Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception, which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard. Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, <b>operations</b> <b>research</b> and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel.|$|E
