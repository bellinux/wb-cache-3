5|$|During the 1970s, {{a number}} of diverse styles emerged in stark {{contrast}} to mainstream American popular music. Though these genres were not largely popular in the sense of selling many records to mainstream audiences, they were examples <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>music,</b> as opposed to folk or classical music. In the early 1970s, African Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York City developed hip hop culture, which produced a style of music also called hip hop. At roughly the same time, Latinos, especially Cubans and Puerto Ricans, in New York also innovated salsa music, which combined many forms of Latin music with R and rock. The genres of punk rock and heavy metal were most closely associated with the United Kingdom in the 1970s, while various American derivatives evolved later in the decade and into the 1980s. Meanwhile, Detroit slowly evolved a series of electronic music genres like house and techno that later became a major part <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>music</b> worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In {{the history}} <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>music,</b> {{there are a}} {{relative}} handful of performers who have redefined {{the content of the}} music at critical points in history—people whose music left the landscape, and definition <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>music,</b> altered completely. The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming folk music into a hot commodity and creating a demand—where none had existed before—for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. On a purely commercial level, from 1957 until 1963, the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world, and folk music was sufficiently popular as to make that a significant statement. Equally important, the original trio—Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane—in tandem with other, similar early acts such as the Limeliters, spearheaded a boom in the popularity of folk music that suddenly made the latter important to millions of listeners who previously had ignored it.|$|E

5|$|The Sex Pistols were an English {{punk rock}} band formed in London in 1975. Although they {{initially}} lasted just {{two and a}} half years and produced only four singles and one studio album, Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, they have been called one of the most influential acts in the history <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>music,</b> having initiated the punk movement in the United Kingdom, and inspired many later punk and alternative rock musicians.|$|E
5|$|The first {{internationally known}} bands from Dominica were 1970s {{groups such as}} Exile One and Grammacks. These bands were {{the stars of the}} cadence-lypso scene, which was the first style of Dominican music to become popular across the Caribbean. By the 1980s, however, Martinican zouk and other styles were more popular. In 1988, WCK formed, playing an {{experimental}} fusion of cadence-lypso with the island’s jing ping sound. The result became known as bouyon, and has re-established Dominica in the field <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E

It was among the earliest pieces <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>music</b> to be recorded.

5|$|Bouyon (Boo-Yon) {{is a form}} <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>music</b> of Dominica, {{also known}} as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who {{originated}} the style in 1988 by experimenting elements of kadans (or cadence-lypso), lapo kabwit drumming, the folk style jing-ping, and a quick-paced electronic drum pattern. From a language perspective, Bouyon draws on English and Dominican Creole French. More recently, deejays with raggamuffin-style vocals (bouyon-muffin) have moved to the fore, updating the sound for the New Generation.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>music.</b> In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some purveyors of the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist cohesion.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, American musical theater {{was a major}} source for popular songs, many of which {{influenced}} blues, jazz, country, and other extant styles <b>of</b> <b>popular</b> <b>music.</b> The center of development for this style was in New York City, where the Broadway theatres became among the most renowned venues in the city. Theatrical composers and lyricists like the brothers George and Ira Gershwin created a uniquely American theatrical style that used American vernacular speech and music. Musicals featured popular songs and fast-paced plots that often revolved around love and romance.|$|E

It has been noted by music writers for its traditional R influences, conscious-driven lyrics, and strong female presence.|$|E
