5000|$|The TRC-97 can be {{connected}} {{to one of three}} mobile antennas, depending on the distance and signal strength needed. One such antenna that can be used with the TRC-97 is the MRT-2 parabolic tropospheric antenna, measuring 15 feet across, which is designed to cover distances of up to 160 km, or 96 miles. Another antenna was a simple feed horn type mounted on a 30 ft pole. The third is a set of 8 foot parabolic dishes on 15' masts (pictured in the photo). These antennas are transported on trailers and have to be manually erected every time they are used, so knowledge of mechanics as well as electronics was needed to erect and maintain that equipment. The system was powered by a 3-cylinder diesel or later by a turbine generator (TG). a typical crew would consist of 2 or three wideband (airforce) technicians and 1 power production (airforce) technician to service the generator set. two units could be used back to back to provide a relay capability for extra long haul traffic. this was usually done at the baseband level without need of any other equipment other than cables. it also could be remotely monitored from up to 2 miles away using the BZ109 test and monitor set. this was accomplished by connecting a single pair of field wires (common military phone line [...] ). th BZ109 would provide remote <b>order</b> <b>wire,</b> some basic measurements and alarm monitoring.|$|E

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient {{technique for}} reducing interconnect active power in VLSI systems is presented. Power reduction {{is accomplished by}} simultaneous wire spacing and net ordering, such that cross-capacitances between wires are optimally shared. The existence of a unique poweroptimal <b>wire</b> <b>order</b> within a bundle is proven, and a method to construct this order is derived. The optimal <b>order</b> of <b>wires</b> depends only on the activity factors of the underlying signals; hence, it can be performed prior to spacing optimization. By using this <b>order</b> of <b>wires,</b> optimality of the combined solution is guaranteed (as compared with any other ordering and spacing of the wires). Timing-aware power optimization is enabled by simultaneously considering timing criticality weights and activity factors for the signals.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1981 / Bahia Hotel, San Diego, CaliforniaPacket TM of {{asynchronous}} multi-instrumented spacecraft requires {{framing of}} packets having different lengths and different arrival intervals. A similar situation would {{occur in a}} general message networking application with messages of arbitrary length and arrival rate at a network node. Use of a bus-system for packet transfer, or an <b>order</b> <b>wire</b> for message transfer, requires a minimum rate of status inquiry, and of data read rate, to insure stability and non-overloading. Our paper offers a rather general, but compact, throughput delay analysis suited to packet characteristics from uniform to source-dependent period and length. Arrival probability may vary from “soft” or uniform to “hard” arrival induced by slotted delay. The arrival probability is modular in source packet-period. A closed solution form, though expressible, is not tractable, and a recursive solution was used to obtain numerical results. Computed throughput delays for various combinations of identical sources and mixed sources are illustrated. For identical sources, under “hard” periodic arrival probability, channel slotting is desirable to maintain channel capacity. Some comparative results are offered. For mixed sources with source-dependent packet length and rate, slotting may not be feasible or efficient. Only read-rate controls the expected throughput. The analysis and results shown should prove helpful both to further study and present application of packet TM and message networking...|$|E

30|$|In recent decades, most {{commercial}} {{solar cells}} {{are based on}} crystalline silicon [c-Si], but there is increasing efforts on thin film solar cells (second generation) as well as third generation solar cells which {{require the use of}} nano/microstructures for high efficiency and low cost [1]. Three-dimensional Si has been attracting much attention for future applications in photovoltaic devices due to their superior properties [2 – 9]. Si wire-based solar cells have two major advantages relative to commercial crystalline and thin-film Si absorbers. First, p-n junctions in the radial direction enable minority carriers to drift only short distances to the junction region for efficient carrier collection. That means low grade Si raw materials can be utilized, and manufacturing cost will be lowered [2]. In addition, the enhanced light absorption by an <b>ordered</b> <b>wire</b> is attributed to the light-trapping effect to the incident light [3, 4]. Moreover, a wire array transfer technique has been studied, which not only yields c-Si wires on a flexible substrate for photovoltaic applications, but also allows the c-Si wafer to be reused for further production of aligned wire arrays [7, 8].|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Optimal {{ordering}} and sizing {{of wires}} in a constrained-width interconnect bundle are studied in this paper. It is shown that among all possible orderings of signal <b>wires,</b> a monotonic <b>order</b> of the signals {{according to their}} effective driver resistance yields the smallest weighted average delay. Minimizing weighted average delay is a good approximation for MinMax delay optimization. Three variants of monotonic ordering are proven to be optimal, depending on the MCF ratio between the signals {{at the sides of}} the bundle and that of the internal <b>wires.</b> The monotonic <b>order</b> property holds for a very broad range of VLSI circuit settings arising in common design practice. A simple, yet nearoptimal, setting of wire widths within the bundle to yield the best average weighted delay is proposed. The theoretical results have been validated by numerical experiments on 65 nanometer process technology and industrial design data. In all cases the ordering optimization yielded improvement in the range of 10 % in wire delay, translated to about 5 % improvement in the clock cycle of a high-performance microprocessor implemented in that technology.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the metallicity of Ag-root 3 <b>ordered</b> atomic <b>wires</b> {{close to one}} monolayer (ML) coverage, which are formed on Si(557) via self assembly. For this purpose we combined high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with tunneling microscopy. By extending the excess Ag coverage up to 0. 6 ML on samples annealed at high temperatures where partial desorption occurs, we demonstrate that one-dimensional metallicity in the Ag-root 3 x root 3 R 30 degrees <b>ordered</b> atomic <b>wires</b> on the (111) mini-terraces originates only from Ag atoms in excess of (local) monolayer coverage, which are adsorbed and localized at the highly stepped parts of the Si(557) surface. Thus these Ag atoms act as extrinsic dopants on the atomic scale, causing coverage dependent subband filling and increasing localization {{as a function of}} doping concentration. The second layer lattice gas as well as Ag islands on the (111) terraces turn out not to be relevant as dopants. We simulated the peculiar saturation behavior within a modified lattice gas model and give evidence that the preparation dependent saturation of doping is due to changes of average terrace size and step morphology induced by high temperature treatment.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} track routing and {{optimization}} for yield (TROY), the first track router for the optimization of yield loss due to random defects. As {{the probability of}} failure (POF), which is an integral of the critical area and the defect size distribution, strongly depends on <b>wire</b> <b>ordering,</b> sizing, and spacing, track routing can {{play a key role}} in effective wire planning for yield optimization. However, a straightforward formulation of yield-driven track routing can be shown to be integer nonlinear programming, which is a nondeterministic polynomial-time complete problem. TROY overcomes the computational complexity by combining two effective techniques, i. e., the minimum Hamiltonian path (MHP) from graph theory and the second-order cone programming (SOCP) from mathematical optimization. First, TROY performs <b>wire</b> <b>ordering</b> to minimize the critical area for short defects by finding an MHP. Then, TROY carries out optimal wire sizing/spacing through SOCP optimization based on the given <b>wire</b> <b>order.</b> Since the SOCP can be optimally solved in near linear time, TROY efficiently achieves globally optimal wire sizing/spacing for the minimal POF.

40|$|The {{conductance}} of Pb wires {{grown by}} self-assembly on Si(557) {{has been studied}} in detail {{as a function of}} coverage and of the facet structure. Only for 1. 31 ML, corresponding to one physical monolayer on the terraces (steps not covered with Pb), and a perfectly <b>ordered</b> <b>wire</b> array along the [¯ 1 ¯ 12] direction quasi-one-dimensional (1 D) transport along the [1 ¯ 10] direction is found, corroborating the model of one-dimensional band filling in an adsorbate induced (223) facet structure. The transport results recently shown by Morikawa et al. [Phys. Rev. B 82, 045423 (2010) ] can also reproduced by our group. In contrast to what was claimed by them, our results clearly show that either a too small coverage or structural imperfections of the surface are responsible for a metal-insulator transition around 140 K irrespective of the crystallographic direction. The variety of different transport scenarios found is caused by strong adsorbate-induced refacetting into an electronically stabilized (223) orientation, which differs from the macrosocopic orientation of the substrate.
