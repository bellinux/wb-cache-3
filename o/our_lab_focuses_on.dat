Elevated levels of Spy 1 A significantly increased cell invasion, coincident with an increase beta-catenin transcriptional levels. We hypothesize that these characteristics may maintain cells in a more 2 ̆ 6 2 ̆ 2 stem-like 2 ̆ 2 state. Mammary stem cells are highly proliferative, they rely on adherence to surrounding cells for self renewal and invasion and migration into the mammary fat pad. We further demonstrate that Spy 1 A overexpression results in the formation of larger mammospheres, where mammosphere size has been correlative of stimulating stem cell self-renewal. Further resolving the roles of Spy 1 in the developing mammary gland is essential to fully elucidate its roles in human disease...|$|E

In recently performed screens for ribosome-associated ncRNAs (rancRNAs) in various model organisms, tRNA-derived fragments and tRNA halve molecules {{were among the most}} abundant RNA-Seq reads. Post-transcriptional cleavage and/or alterations of tRNA molecules to generate smaller fragments appear to be widespread mechanisms enlarging the structural and functional complexities of cellular RNomes. For a subset of tRNA-derived fragments we have gathered experimental evidence demonstrating ribosome association in a stress-dependent manner. Subsequent functional analyses revealed tRNA-fragments and tRNA-halves as regulators of protein biosynthesis during specific environmental stress situations in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii, the human pathogen Trypanosoma brucei, and in Chinese hamster ovary cells, respectively. In Haloferax volcanii we identified a tRNA fragment originating from Val-tRNA to bind the small ribosomal subunit and to interfere with efficient translation initiation.

Cells {{of the brain and}} spinal cord do not readily regenerate therefore excessive damage can be devastating. <b>Our</b> <b>lab</b> <b>focuses</b> <b>on</b> stem cell-based therapies for brain disorders. Previous studies indicate the potential of stem cells for use in therapies to treat neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, my lab project deals with dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells (DPMSCs) that are currently being investigated due to their ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, including neural cells. Our DPMSCs are composed of populations of mesenchymal stem cells harvested from normal human third molars (wisdom teeth). The initial goal of my research is to assess the variation of marker expression by the dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells to describe their developmental potentials, particularly neuronal development since neurons are the functional unit of the brain. Our results identified expression of neuronal-specific markers (indicative of neuronal precursors and mature neurons) at the gene and protein level by the DPMSCs specifically, we observed expression of nestin, β-III tubulin, and GFAP as well as the MSC markers CD 90, CD 73 and CD 44. Based on these findings, we propose that human DPMSCs may possess the capabilities necessary for therapeutic treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. In future experiments, we plan to perform cell transplantations into mouse models with neurodegenerative disorders.

The jerboa is a bipedal rodent with elongated hindlimbs and three toes on feet that lack intrinsic foot muscles. During my thesis work, I sought to understand the progression and mechanism of muscle loss in the context of its relationship with the motor nerve. We initially tested two alternate hypotheses: either jerboas never develop foot muscles or muscle fibers form and are lost over time. RNA in situ hybridization to MyoD and immunofluorescence detection of myosin heavy chain determined that jerboas are born with muscles in their feet, which are virtually nonexistent by post-natal day 7. I examined the structure of the nerve and its associated neuromuscular junctions to evaluate if proper innervation occurs at early critical stages and if that innervation is maintained during the earliest stages of myofiber degeneration. I utilized immunohistochemistry to examine the integrity of the nerve structure and to identify structural synapses. I also injected neonatal jerboas with CTB- 555 labeling dye to retrograde trace motor neurons of the foot back to their origin in the spinal cord. I discovered that the muscles in the feet of the jerboa receive proper innervation and that this innervation is maintained for several days after birth, even after the myofibers begin to disorganize and degenerate. These results indicate it is unlikely a developmental innervation failure is responsible for muscle loss in the jerboa but rather itself degenerates concurrent with loss of its innervation target...|$|E

However, {{instead of}} peptides, CD 1 d presents lipids to Natural Killer (NK) T cells, {{a subset of}} T cells that express both NK cell markers and the T cell receptor and produces both T helper (Th) 1 and Th 2 cytokines. <b>Our</b> <b>lab</b> <b>focuses</b> <b>on</b> the regulation CD 1 d-mediated antigen presentation. TGF beta is a known regulator of the immune system, such as controlling MHC class II antigen presentation. Further, TGF beta can activate the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p 38, a known negative regulator of CD 1 d-mediated antigen presentation. Therefore, we hypothesized that TGF beta would be a negative regulator of CD 1 d-mediated antigen presentation, and our results showed a decrease in antigen presentation by CD 1 d in response to TGF beta treatment. However, this inhibition was not through p 38 activation, {{as indicated by the}} absence of a rescue of CD 1 d-mediated antigen presentation in, TGF beta-treated, p 38 dominant negative-expressing cells. Alternatively, the Smad pathway, the canonical pathway activated by TGF beta, was investigated through a lentivirus shRNA-mediated knockdown of Smad 2, Smad 3 and Smad 4 proteins. Smad 2 shRNA-expressing cells showed in an increase in CD 1 d-mediated antigen presentation, suggesting an inhibitory role for Smad 2. In contrast, Smad 3 shRNA-expressing cells did not differ from control cells. However, {{as in the case of}} Smad 2, CD 1 d+ cells in which Smad 4 was knocked down, were substantially better at CD 1 d-mediated antigen presentation than control cells, suggesting that it also negatively regulates antigen presentation.

My master thesis research employs a phage display library screening technology aiming to identify peptides that preferentially home in to undifferentiated PCa cells, which our lab has previously demonstrated to be intrinsically resistant to castration. There is now evidence that a population of cells in PCa possesses characteristics associated with stem cells; these cells are referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). CSCs have been implicated in tumor propagation, progression and recurrence. In PCa, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the mainstay treatment however, the majority of patients relapse after treatments, resulting in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Our lab has provided evidence that the phenotypically undifferentiated PCa cell population expressing low levels or no prostate specific antigen (i. e., PSA-/lo) is enriched in prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) that can long-term propagate tumors and also resist ADT. The PSA-/lo PCa cell population represents the best characterized PCSCs and likely a cell-of-origin for CRPC. Consequently, it is important to find therapeutics that can preferentially target these cells. To this end, we employed highly purified PSA-/lo LNCaP PCa cells to perform phage display library screening. Our preliminary efforts identified two peptides, JRM 1 and JRM 2 that displayed preferential binding to PSA-/lo PCa cells. We first identified a potential peptide that may home in to the PSA-/lo LNCaP cells by conducting a phage display library screening of LNCaP PSA-GFP utilizing a competitive assay technique. This peptide, TEWDYLTV, referred to as JRM 1, showed slight but not statistically significant, preferential binding to the PSA-/lo LNCaP cells. With this knowledge we carried out another phage display library screening using adherent LNCaP PSA-GFP cells and an indirect subtraction assay. The results led to the identification of peptide JRM 2, GFYVGQR, which demonstrated preferential and statistically significant binding to the PSA-/lo LNCaP cells. With this peptide we would like to attach either anti-cancer drugs or pro-apoptotic peptides to it and measure their effectiveness at killing undifferentiated and castration-resistant PCa cells...|$|E

Improper function of protein trafficking has pathological consequences, as the malfunction of certain transport systems can give rise to certain cancers. <b>Our</b> <b>lab</b> <b>focuses</b> <b>on</b> the dynamic mechanisms of transport between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes using the model protein Ste 13 p. The goal of my project is to deepen our understanding of Ste 13 p retrieval from the early endosome to the TGN via binding of the adaptor complex (AP- 1). Previous research suggests that the C-terminal domain of the AP- 1 subunit Apm 1 p interacts with a sorting signal contained within amino acids 1 - 12 of the cytosolic domain of Ste 13 p. With this in mind, we developed plasmids that expressed different regions of the C-terminal domain of Apm 1 p in E coli. The hope was to find a construct that provided both high expression and ease of purification. As part of a collaboration, we intended to discover how the 1 - 12 region of Ste 13 p binds to Apm 1 p on an atomic level. Each construct was contained within the expression vector pET 28 a(+) which is under the control of a T 7 promoter. The results led us to choose Apm 1 p 161 - 475 as the best construct. Using a nickel column, we purified this Apm 1 p construct due to the nickel's binding affinity for the engineered 6 xHistidine tag. Soon, we will perform a pull down assay to confirm the binding of Apm 1 161 - 475 to a peptide that represents amino acids 1 - 12 of Ste 13 - GST. After completion of the assay, we will send our construct to our collaborator who will co-crystallize the AP- 1 derivative with a Ste 13 p peptide to structurally define the binding between these two proteins. Structural data will make it easier to understand how mutations could affect the binding of the signal with the adaptor protein, thus allowing more detailed manipulations of both proteins...|$|E
40|$|In a bacterium's environment, life {{conditions}} {{are subject to}} constant changes. One of the proposed mechanisms of adaptation to these changes is the increase in mutation rate. Bacterial mutability is generally kept very low by action of various mechanisms of control and repair, {{one of the most}} important ones being the Mismatch Repair, which is the master regulator of genetic stability of organisms.

40|$|Tightly {{controlled}} {{by the action of}} protein kinases, protein phosphorylation regulates most aspects of cellular life. Abnormalities in protein phosphorylation are either the cause or consequence of most diseases. Therefore, protein kinase inhibitors are becoming attractive agents to assess the physiological roles of individual kinases in cell signaling networks and potential tools for disease treatment. The most exploited avenue in protein kinase inhibition is the design of ATP competitive inhibitors, but this strategy brings the challenge of selectivity due to the high similarity of the ATP binding sites among different kinases. ^ To address this challenge, <b>our</b> <b>lab</b> <b>focuses</b> <b>on</b> the development of organometallic compounds as protein kinase inhibitors. We aim to design organometallic compounds where the overall three-dimensional structure of the compounds, not reactivity of the metal, is responsible for their biological activity which can then easily be modified by shuffling the organic ligands around the metal center. ^ In this work, first the concept of creating metal complexes with specific biological activities where the metal possesses a purely structural role is verified. It is demonstrated that exchanging ruthenium for its heavier homologue osmium in a bioactive half-sandwich scaffold does not alter its biological properties such as kinase binding, activation of a signaling pathway and anticancer activity. This is a unique example in which the replacement of a metal in an anticancer scaffold by its heavier homolog does not significantly alter the biological activity. ^ Next, it was investigated if switching the selectivity between kinases could be achieved by varying the ligands around the metal center. By combining organoruthenium chemistry, small molecule screening and structure based inhibitor design, a highly potent and selective GSK- 3 and PIM- 1 half-sandwich complex NP 309 was successfully converted into the octahedral PAK 1 inhibitors Λ-FL 172 and Λ-FL 411. These compounds were shown to inhibit the PAK 1 kinase with nanomolar potency and show significant selectivity when tested against a panel of kinases. In addition, these compounds were shown to be cell permeable and able to evoke cellular responses associated with PAK 1 inhibition. ^ Finally, the binding mode of an organoruthenium inhibitor to the kinase PAK 4 was examined using X-ray crystallography. The main goal of this particular study was to demonstrate that PAK 1 and PAK 4 have significantly different inhibitor selectivity profiles and to lay the groundwork to develop potent and selective organometallic PAK 4 inhibitors. ...|$|E
40|$|DNA is the {{storehouse}} {{of genetic}} {{information for the}} normal functioning of all cellular processes. This DNA is 2 ̆ 2 read 2 ̆ 2 by RNA Polymerases (RNAP) {{to carry out the}} transcription process, {{which is one of the}} most vital regulatory mechanisms within the cell for gene expression. There are three important RNA Polymerases available in the cell. RNAPI synthesizes ribosomal RNAs, while RNAPII makes mRNA precursors, snRNAs and most microRNAs, additionally RNAPIII takes care of tRNAs, small RNAs and 5 S rRNAs that occur in the nucleus and the cytosol. The work in <b>our</b> <b>lab</b> <b>focuses</b> <b>on</b> the function of RNAPII transcription. It is not straightforward for RNAPII to transcribe the DNA, it needs to struggle with two major roadblocks that are in its path. First, is the nucleosomal barrier that is scattered across the coding regions of active genes. The mechanism to overcome this major obstacle is a very complex process that involves an extensive range of proteins which work collectively to help in the alteration of chromatin structure that ultimately facilitates transcriptional regulation. The second obstacle is that the DNA is also subject to constant onslaught by a variety of intrinsic and external damaging agents. Maintenance of normal physiological functions in addition to cell survival depends on the ability to preserve the genome integrity by protecting it from different mutations. Consequently, the cells have developed an extremely evolved repair mechanism known as the DNA damage response (DDR) system. This DDR pathway can restore various forms of damaged DNA that encompasses single base modifications, single strand damages and even the most toxic double strand breaks. Transcription-coupled DNA repair is involved in taking care of the single strand damages that can be induced by various chemicals including 4 -nitroquinoline 1 - oxide (4 NQO) which forms bulky adducts on the DNA bases. On the other hand, double strand breaks are repaired via more complex and involved mechanisms that include non-homologous end joining and homologous recombination. Once the DNA is protected from injury it is prepared for transcription, replication and recombination. In my thesis, I have attempted to take a look at this intricate network and have studied the function of Rad 26 p, in yeast (associated with CSB-Cockayne syndrome B, in humans), a transcription coupled DNA repair factor, having an additional role in transcription. The results reveal that Rad 26 p plays a novel role in the regulation of elongation by modulating histone H 2 A-H 2 B dimer occupancy. Further, the study revealed how Rad 26 p is targeted to lesions for DNA repair. Next, I extended my study to the role of a nucleotide excision repair factor, Rad 14 p (associated with Xeroderma Pigmentosum, XPA- in humans), and for the first time demonstrated its function in transcription initiation in the absence of DNA damage. Finally, I analyzed whether repair of double strand breaks could be connected to transcription via an elegant method developed in my lab. This presented us with first time evidence that establishes that double strand break repair is faster on actively transcribing gene (ADH 1) when compared to a nearly silent gene (MATα locus); thus, supporting our transcription-coupled DNA double strand break repair. The significance of all the proteins involved in my study is reflected by the various syndromes and diseases that arise due to mutations in their respective human homologues. Therefore, the results of my study will significantly advance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that are involved in the normal physiological functions of the cell which can be extended to humans...|$|E

The purified protein shows a UVvisible absorbance spectrum consistent with that of a 4 Fe- 4 S cluster. ESR expts. of reduced UvrC give rise to a signal indicative of a 4 Fe- 4 S cluster. Electrochem. expts. indicate that the protein is electrochem. active on DNA- modified gold electrodes. Finally, genetic methods to study possible DNA- mediated signaling between UvrC and other DNA- processing enzymes contg. 4 Fe- 4 S clusters are being examd...|$|R

40|$|AbstractProtein {{design is}} {{currently}} {{used for the}} creation of new proteins with desirable traits. In <b>our</b> <b>lab,</b> we <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the synthesis of proteins with high essential amino acid content, having potential application in animal nutrition. One of the limitations we face in this endeavor is the achievement of stable proteins in spite of a highly biased amino acid content. We report here the synthesis and characterization of MB- 1 Trp, a protein with a tailored content in selected essential amino acids. The protein is a Tyr 62 -Trp mutant of the parent molecule MB- 1 described earlier. The new protein is largely helical as per design, is well folded, and has a melting temperature of 55 °C. Its resistance to proteolytic degradation compares to that of cytochrome c, a protein of similar size. Design strategy used for MB- 1 Trp is discussed with regards to its applicability toward the creation of efficient nutritional proteins...|$|R
40|$|The retina is {{responsible}} for sensing light and transmitting the signal to the brain {{in the form of}} chemical and electrical signals. In <b>our</b> <b>lab,</b> we <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the development of one set of neurons in the retina, the retinal ganglion cells. These cells receive visual information and send that information as a signal to the brain via their axons, which make up the optic nerve. Studying these cells is important for medical advancement treating diseases such as glaucoma, in which the death of these cells eventually leads to blindness. The goal of my research is to identify the genes most critical to development of healthy retinal ganglion cells by characterizing the mRNA expressed in these cells in the developing chick retina at different time points. Identifying these critical genes and the time points at which they are expressed could contribute to successful ganglion cell generation in vitro. The cells could then be used to replace unhealthy cells that are causing disease and blindness...|$|R
40|$|Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) {{tumors are}} highly {{malignant}} {{in nature and}} despite an aggressive therapy regimen, long–term survival for glioma patients is uncommon as cells with intrinsic or acquired resistance to treatment repopulate the tumor. This creates the need to investigate new therapies for enhancing GBM treatment outside of the standard of care, which includes Temozolomide (TMZ). <b>Our</b> <b>lab</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> two novel strategies to overcome resistance in GBMs. In our first approach, the cellular responses of GBM cell lines to two new TMZ analogues, DP 68 and DP 86, are reported. The efficacy of these compounds was independent of DNA repair mediated by Methyl Guanine Methyl Transferase (MGMT) and the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway. DP 68 or DP 86 treated cells do not give rise to secondary spheres, demonstrating that {{they are no longer}} capable of self-renewal. DP 68 -induced damage includes interstrand DNA crosslinks and exhibits a distinct S-phase accumulation before G 2 /M arrest; a profile that is not observed for TMZ-treated cells. DP 68 induces a strong DNA damage response and suppression of FANCD 2 expression or ATR expression/kinase activity enhanced the anti-GBM effects of DP 68. Collectively, these data demonstrate that DP 68, {{and to a lesser extent}} DP 86, are potent anti-GBM compounds that circumvent TMZ resistance and inhibit recovery of cultures. Our second approach stems from a previous discovery in <b>our</b> <b>lab</b> which demonstrated that the combination of TMZ with Notch inhibition, using a gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI), enhances GBM therapy. Efficacy of TMZ + GSI treatment is partially due to GBM cells shifting into a permanent senescent state. We sought to identify a miR signature that mimics the effects of TMZ + GSI as an alternative vi approach to enhance GBM therapy. MiR- 34 a expression was highly upregulated in response to TMZ or TMZ + GSI treatment. Exogenous expression of miR- 34 a revealed that it functions as a tumor suppressor and mimicked the in vitro effects of TMZ + GSI treatment. Additionaly, miR- 34 a overexpression leads to the downregulation of Notch family members. Together these two studies contribute to our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving resistance in GBM tumors and suggest strategies to develop more effective therapies...|$|R

Metalloinsertors bind selectively to DNA mismatches and show preferential selectivity in MMR- deficient cells. We have also been interested in designing luminescent ruthenium complexes that could function as diagnostic probes for DNA mismatches. It is known that the complex [Ru(bpy) _ 2 (dppz) ]^(2 +) while non- emissive in aq. soln., exhibits a restored luminescence upon binding to duplex DNA. In this work, a new sterically expansive ligand (BNIQ) was synthesized and coordinated to ruthenium to create a new luminescent complex [Ru(bpy) _ 2 (BNIQ) ]^(2 +). The luminescent properties of this complex in the presence of well- matched and mismatched DNA duplexes were examd. using steady state and emission lifetime measurements. The complex exhibits an enhanced luminescence in the presence of mismatched DNA relative to well- matched DNA, suggesting that this complex may be utilized as a novel probe for DNA mismatches...|$|R

40|$|We all desire a long-lasting, non-explosive, {{flexible}} and small lithium-ion battery (LIB) for our {{portable electronic devices}} and (future) electric vehicles. The use of a solid polymer as electrolyte, instead of a flammable solvent, is currently the most promising solution for thinner and safer LIBs. Poly(ethylene oxide) -based polymers (PEO) are widely used, even commercially, thanks to their good ability to transport lithium ions at temperatures over 60 °C. In <b>our</b> <b>Lab,</b> we <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the structuring of classic −EO− based backbones by photo-polymerization, a fast, cost-effective and solvent-free technique. Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) based on different monomers/oligomers are prepared. By incorporating high amounts of plasticizers and lithium salts, outstanding ionic conductivities are obtained (σ > 10 - 4 S cm- 1 at 20 °C) along with wide electrochemical stability window (> 5 V vs. Li+/Li) as well as good interfacial stability. Besides, SPEs have remarkable morphological characteristics in terms of homogeneity, flexibility and robustness. All-solid lithium-based polymer cells show very good cycling behavior in terms of rate capability and stability {{over a wide range}} of operating temperatures, which confirms the promising prospects of photocured polymer electrolytes for practical application at ambient/sub-ambient temperatures...|$|R
