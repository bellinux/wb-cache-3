5|$|The {{standard}} Roman bow was the recurved composite bow, {{a relatively}} compact but powerful weapon. Foot archers normally formed the rear rank of the Roman battle-line, shooting <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> {{of their own}} infantry, whilst protected by it from the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Foster's {{flair for}} musical melodrama inspires Madonna {{to turn in}} what is easily her most assured and {{full-bodied}} vocal performance to date. Amid a swirl of strings and Spanish guitars, she spews the song's declaration of romantic independence with a theatrical verve that perfectly matches the stagey, potentially overpowering tone of Foster's arrangement without flying <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> of her youthful top 40 following. A stunning effort that could easily become the 'I Will Survive' of this generation.|$|E
5|$|At the foundry {{near the}} Carey Street Bridge, {{a crowd of}} more than 100 {{gathered}} and threatened to {{set fire to the}} area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> of the crowd was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining garrison there.|$|E

5|$|In September 1915, the Machine Gun Corps (MGC) {{was formed}} to provide heavy machine-gun teams after a {{proposal}} was made to the War Office {{for the formation of}} a single specialist machine-gun company for each infantry brigade—a goal to be achieved by withdrawing guns and gun teams from the battalions. Created in October 1915, the MGC consisted of infantry machine-gun companies, cavalry machine-gun squadrons and motor machine-gun batteries. In the trenches, the Corps' guns were deployed with an interlocking field of fire and proved to be a devastating defensive weapon against attacking infantry. They were also used in an indirect fire support role, in which they fired <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> and from the flanks of the advancing infantry and behind the German trenches to stop reinforcements and supplies from getting to the front.|$|E
5|$|The period {{immediately}} after half‑time saw few chances, but then, after just over an hour's play, Manchester City regained their stride and suddenly went two goals ahead. A throw-in to Revie led to interplay {{on the right}} wing involving Barnes, Dyson, and Johnstone, resulting in a through-ball which put Dyson clear of the defence to score. Two minutes later, Trautmann collected the ball {{at the end of}} a Birmingham attack and kicked the ball long to Dyson, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> of the retreating Birmingham players. Dyson flicked the ball on to Bobby Johnstone, who scored Manchester City's third, becoming the first player ever to score in consecutive Wembley finals in the process.|$|E
5|$|Julian drew up his {{infantry}} in two lines, widely spaced apart, each several ranks deep. This was {{a standard}} Roman line-up: the rear line troops were reserves {{who would be}} able to intervene if the enemy threatened to break through at any point, and to exploit opportunities as they arose. During the battle, the foot archers (sagittarii) would have formed the rear rank of the front line, to shoot <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> of their own infantry. But at the start, archers were sometimes stationed in front of the main line, so that they could disrupt the enemy ranks with their missiles. This was especially likely if the Romans' archer forces were much stronger than Chnodomar's, giving them a competitive advantage in a long-range missile exchange. But Ammianus does not state if this happened on this occasion. On the right wing was posted the entire cavalry. Most likely, the light cavalry would have been stationed in front, to harass the enemy before the heavy cavalry launched their shock charge. Set back from the left flank of the front line, Julian posted a separate division under Severus to face the woods beyond the highway, apparently with orders to advance into them, presumably to launch a surprise attack on the German right wing. Julian himself, with his escort of 200 scholares, probably took up position in the gap between the Roman lines, giving him a close, but relatively protected, view of the action.|$|E

5|$|Where {{the late}} army {{appears to have}} evolved to some extent is in battle tactics. The older army of the Principate had relied on a barrage of heavy {{javelins}} (pila) followed by an infantry charge, which was often sufficient to shatter, or at least disorganise, the barbarian line. After that, legionaries were trained to engage in aggressive hand-to-hand combat, using the gladius short-sword to execute quick thrusts at the abdomen of their enemies, {{in a similar manner}} to more recent bayonet drill. In close combat, the Romans had the crucial advantage of superior armour, and such tactics very often resulted in the rout of the less well-equipped and trained barbarian foe. The mounted archers and slingers in front of the main infantry line would loose their missiles on the enemy before the infantry lines engaged and would then hastily retreat to the rear of their own infantry line, whence, in conjunction with the foot archers already there, they would loose a continuous rain of missiles on the enemy foot by shooting <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> of their own infantry. The cavalry's task on each wing was to scatter the enemy cavalry facing them and then, if possible, to encircle the main body of enemy infantry and attack them from the flanks and rear.|$|E

25|$|On April25, a {{majority}} of voters expressed confidence in the president and called for new legislative elections. Yeltsin termed the results a mandate for him to continue in power.

He lasted six minutes before he was shot down and killed. Further attacks were unable to get through the anti-aircraft barrage and the Italian aircraft flew back to base, landing at 15.50 pursued by the Ark Royals Fulmars, which strafed the airfield at Cagliari (Sardinia), damaging ten seaplanes and causing three casualties.|$|E

25|$|The {{ensemble}} {{represents the}} supremacy of Justice over all Earthly authorities; {{a variant of the}} medieval pictorial formula of virtue defeating vice. The contemporary belief in the divine nature of Justice is made more apparent in a 1558 Bernese drawing for a stained-glass window by Hans Rudolf Manuel; there, a winged Justice strides <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> of princes whose symbols of power are broken. Divine Justice was a frequent element of political discourse in Reformation-era Bern. In the view of the reformators, doing justice according to God's word was the highest duty of all authority, superseding feudal rights. Such arguments were used, among others, to justify Bern's conquest of Vaud in 1536 from the dukes of Savoy.|$|E

25|$|Holliday was {{reported}} to have been involved in a shooting on the Withlacoochee River, Georgia, in 1873. At age 22, Holliday went with some friends to their favorite swimming hole, but discovered it was occupied by a group of black youths. Holliday and his companions told them to leave, but they refused. Accounts of this event vary. Holliday left and returned carrying either a shotgun or a pistol and started shooting, either at or <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> of the youths. Some of them may have shot back. There are no contemporaneous accounts of the incident. Some family members and friends allege that Holliday killed one to three of the youths, but other members of Holliday's family dispute those accounts.|$|E

25|$|Penderel Moon simply {{attributes}} the League's {{rise to power}} to the alluring and irresistible appeal of the Pakistan cry to the Muslim masses.

Pakistani historians have explained the League's success in the Punjab, as elsewhere in the subcontinent, solely {{in terms of the}} Two Nation Theory. Whatever the historians may suggest, one thing is clear that League's success was due to the political vision, farsightedness of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He was a man of high personal integrity and intelligence who became a Grandmaster of the game by his clever, and clever calculations.|$|E
25|$|The four terrorists stormed {{into the}} ship's dining room. They shot their {{automatic}} weapons <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> of the eating passengers. Screams from the passengers meshed with the shouting of the gunmen {{and with the}} sound of falling glass shards and splinters. Viola Meskin tried to run to a door but was intercepted by a terrorist with a gun who turned her back. Austrian passenger Anna Hoeranter ran to an exit but was pushed down an adjacent flight of stairs by one of the terrorists. Other passengers ran in a panic from the dining room into the kitchen and were chased by one of the terrorists. Inside the kitchen the pursuing terrorist beat two of the kitchen staff to the floor.|$|E
25|$|The long through ball: This is a long, {{and usually}} high, pass from a teams' own half, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> {{of the other}} team's defence. It is {{intended}} for the attacking players to chase {{and it is important}} that they remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked. The tactic works best with strong and fast forwards who will {{have a good chance of}} winning back the ball, taking control over it, and eventually getting a shot on goal. In the diagram, the ball (red line) is played in front of the furthermost forward, the dotted blue line showing their run. In this example, a through-ball pass along the ground would be picked up by one of the defenders (black team) because the gap between the two central defenders is too small.|$|E

After a defensive rebound, a well-thrown overhead, or outlet, pass can allow a breaking offensive player to quickly score without even dribbling by catching the ball near the basket.|$|R
