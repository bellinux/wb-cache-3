5|$|Antibiotic drug {{design is}} {{facilitated}} when an enzyme {{that is essential}} to the pathogen's survival is absent or very different in humans. In the example above, humans do not make peptidoglycan, therefore inhibitors <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> are selectively toxic to bacteria.

5|$|In some cases, it is {{difficult}} to tell whether a trait has been lost and then re-evolved convergently, or whether a gene has simply been switched off and then re-enabled later. Such a re-emerged trait is called an atavism. From a mathematical standpoint, an unused gene (selectively neutral) has a steadily decreasing probability of retaining potential functionality over time. The time scale <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> varies greatly in different phylogenies; in mammals and birds, there is a reasonable probability of remaining in the genome in a potentially functional state for around 6 million years.|$|E

5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kīlauea {{was created}} as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes {{are the most}} recent evidence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain.

5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau slowly raised these {{formations}} {{much higher}} than where they were deposited. This steepened the stream gradient of the ancestral rivers and other streams on the plateau. The faster-moving streams took advantage of uplift-created joints in the rocks to remove all Cenozoic-aged formations and cut gorges into the plateaus. Zion Canyon was cut by the North Fork of the Virgin River in this way. Lava flows and cinder cones covered parts of the area during the later part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
30|$|Glucose {{utilization}} involves {{two different}} pathways. Oxidative phosphorylation is the energy-generating biochemical process whereby pyruvate, produced by glycolysis, is oxidized to CO 2 and H 2 O {{with the production}} of 30 moles <b>of</b> ATP. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> requires oxygen. Glycolysis is the energy-generating biochemical process whereby glucose is converted to pyruvate and lactate with the net production of 2 moles <b>of</b> ATP. <b>This</b> <b>process</b> is nonoxidative, producing lactate [25].|$|R

5|$|A {{short period}} of home leave followed, before the battalion's {{personnel}} concentrated at Royal Park for a march through Melbourne. A draft of reinforcements arrived around this time also, incorporating men from New South Wales and several others states. In mid-September, the battalion moved to Greta, New South Wales, travelling by rail through Shepparton, Tocumwal and Newcastle. A brief period of training was undertaken there, during which the battalion's khaki uniforms were dyed green. During this time, the battalion was re-organised and converted to the jungle establishment; as part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> its authorised strength was reduced to around 800 personnel of all ranks. The situation in the Pacific had deteriorated dramatically, and the Australian forces holding out against the Japanese in New Guinea were hard-pressed and desperately in need of reinforcement. Thus in early October 1942, not {{more than two months}} after returning to Australia, the 2/5th moved to Brisbane, Queensland, where it deployed to Milne Bay, which had only recently been held {{in the face of a}} Japanese landing, aboard the Dutch transport Maetsuyker.|$|E
