40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{widespread}} adoption of BPM, there exist many business processes not adequately supported by existing BPM technol-ogy. In previous work we {{reported on the}} properties of these processes. As a major insight we learned that, in accordance to the data model com-prising object types and object relations, the modeling and execution of processes can be based on two levels of granularity: object behavior and object interactions. This paper focuses on micro processes capturing object behavior and constituting a fundamental pillar of our framework for object-aware process management. Our approach applies the well es-tablished concept of modeling object behavior in terms of states and state transitions. Opposed to existing work, we establish a mapping be-tween attribute values and objects states to ensure compliance between them. Finally, we provide a well-defined operational semantics enabling the automatic and dynamic generation of most end-user components at run-time (e. g., <b>overview</b> <b>tables</b> and user forms) ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Nordic {{countries}} are generally {{seen as the}} leaders in CSR accounting. However, one cannot assume that all the Nordic countries disclose information in the same way. At the same time, {{few studies have been}} made that concerns employee disclosures separated from other CSR aspects. Purpose: To analyze and discuss the similarities between the Nordic countries regarding employee disclosures and how this has developed since 2009. Delimitations: The thesis only includes information available in the companies’ annual reports and on their websites. Furthermore, only the GRI information that the companies claim to include in their report is taken into consideration when analyzing GRI disclosures. Method: The study is based on secondary analysis of qualitative data, where the annual and sustainability reports of three largest companies in each Nordic country according to number of employees are examined. The process of content analysis is conducted in two steps. The scoring manual, General <b>overview</b> <b>table</b> and the GRI scoring table are created in order to precede the research. Empirical findings: This chapter includes the tables that show the results from the gathered data with explanations to the content of each table. The tables presented in this chapter are the General <b>overview</b> <b>table</b> from 2009 and 2014, the GRI scoring table for each country and the indicators included table for each country. Analysis: In this chapter, the empirical findings in both, the General <b>overview</b> <b>table</b> and the GRI scoring table are being analyzed with help of the frame of reference in order to investigate how the results connects with previous research and models. Finally, the connections between both of the tables are also interpreted. Conclusions: The thesis shows that most similar way of disclosing the employee disclosures is by using the GRI guidelines. The development from 2009 indicates that the usage of the GRI guidelines has grown while the percentage of the sustainability reports regarding the employee perspective have decreased in all of the Nordic countries except Denmark...|$|E

40|$|Investigating and {{improving}} the quality of conceptual models has gained tremendous importance in recent years. In general, model understandability is regarded {{one of the most important}} model quality goals and criteria. A considerable amount of empirical studies, especially experiments, have been conducted in order to investigate factors in-fluencing the understandability of conceptual models. However, a thorough review and reconstruction of 42 experiments on conceptual model understandability shows that there is a variety of different understandings and conceptualizations of the term model understandability. As a consequence, this term remains ambiguous, research results on model understandability are hardly comparable and partly imprecise, which shows the necessity of clarification what the conceptual modeling community is actually talking about when the term model understandability is used. This contribution represents a supplement to the article „ Understanding understandability of conceptual models – What are we actually talking about?” published in the Proceedings of the 31 st International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER 2012) which aimed at overcoming the above mentioned shortcoming by investigating and further clarifying the concept of model understandability.

The volume, written in English, comprises ca. 1150 pages and was compiled in cooperation with 280 authors coming from 26 countries. As with the preceding volumes, the geographic scope remains Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Somalia; such regions as Sudan, Kenya, and the Arabian Peninsula are considered as well. The reference work's main focus is the humanities. The topics covered include basic elements of country study with fundamental geographic facts; topics from history, language and literature studies, art and culture, religion and ethnography, as well as aspects of social, political and economic development; and the region's relationships with Near East and the Western countries well into {{the second half of}} the 20 th century. Key actors of regional history, politics and research are treated in biographic articles. All entries are supplied with bibliographic references with a distinction being made between primary and secondary sources. Illustrations and maps provide additional information where possible.
