60|$|On going down-stairs, Anne {{found that}} Katherine and Harriet {{had gone to}} spend the morning with the Mrs. Turner {{mentioned}} during the walk to St. Austin's, as her daughter, Miss Wilhelmina, had engaged to teach Harriet to make wax flowers. Lucy was up-stairs, writing to Major Hazleby; and Helen {{was sitting in the}} school-room, where Elizabeth was teaching the children. Little Winifred had just finished her lessons, and was skipping off in high glee with her medal round her neck, to tell her mamma that she had gained four good marks. Dora was perched on a high stool, at Elizabeth's desk, with a broadly ruled paper before her, on the top of which the words, 'My dear Horace, St. Austin's Church was consecrated yesterday,' were to be seen in fair round hand. No more was visible, for the little girl laughingly laid down her rosy cheek, and all her light wavy curls, flat upon the letter, as Anne advanced and made a stealthy attempt to profit by the intelligence she was sending to her brother. Edward was standing by Elizabeth, reading Mrs. Trimmer's Fabulous Histories, for, though five years old, he made very slow progress in English literature, being more backward in learning to read than any of the others had been, excepting Helen. He did not like the <b>trouble</b> <b>of</b> <b>spelling,</b> and was in the habit of guessing at every word he did not know; and on his very composedly calling old Joe the gardener, 'the old gander,' Anne burst into an irrepressible giggle, and Helen, sedate as she was, could not help following her example. They had just composed themselves, when Edward made another blunder, which set them off again, and Elizabeth, who when alone with the children, could bear anything with becoming gravity, also gave way.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{were three}} {{purpose of this}} study;(1) {{exploring}} successful factors <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting diagnoses in single-chip microprocessor; (2) analyzing the thinking processes of sampling group possessing successful achievement;(3) designing the diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting in single-chip microprocessor circuits. 16 students of Electrical Engineering were sampled to participate the experiments in three types of diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting in single-chip microprocessor circuits. Recording their experimental procedures, thinking aloud procedure and using protocol analysis were three main research methods in this study. The conclusion after data analyzing was as following: The successful factors of the diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting in single-chip microprocessor circuits consists of professional knowledge, comprehension for circuits, fully taking advantage of strategies, wisely making use of electric meters, judging defining qualities of components, and using sensory assessment. The procedures for diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting in single-chip microprocessor circuits are judging symptoms <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting, searching <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting points in circuit, firmly determining trouble shooting points, executing repair activities, accomplishing repairing process. The rank <b>of</b> indicated <b>trouble</b> shooting behaviors were that visual behavior was the most judging activity among all and sensory assessment was the most strategy among all while using electric meter...|$|R

50|$|UConn ended UCF's American conference win-streak {{at eleven}} games, handing the Knights their first regular season conference loss since November 2012 against Tulsa. This loss was also UCF's first {{to a team}} that {{finished}} the season not bowl eligible since September 2012 against Missouri. The Knights had won the only previous meeting between the two programs in a blowout 62-17 home victory in 2013. The victory was UConn's first against an FBS opponent in 2014. Justin Holman's four interceptions coupled with special team <b>troubles</b> <b>spelled</b> doom for UCF's effort to remain unbeaten in conference play for a second straight year. William Stanback had a season-high 141 rushing yards and two touchdowns. JJ Worton had eleven receptions for 178 yards, including a 73-yard touchdown pass from Holman {{in the third quarter}} - the Knights longest play from scrimmage this season.|$|R

40|$|Drawing on {{the methods}} of {{conversation}} analysis (Sidnell, 2010; Sidnell and Stivers, 2012) and the data provided by recordings of ordinary interaction, in this paper I ask what a radically empirical approach to word meaning might look like.

What is the missing something that leaves participants in interaction feeling as though {{they do not understand}} what another means? Four types <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> in interaction are discussed: <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> exophoric or anaphoric reference, <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> common ground, <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> lexical meaning, <b>troubles</b> <b>of</b> sense...|$|R
