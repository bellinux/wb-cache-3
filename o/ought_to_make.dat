25|$|Zimmer Comes to the Front With an Indoor GameCharley Zimmer, the good-natured and gentlemanly catcher of the Cleveland Club has invented and {{patented}} {{an indoor}} game of base ball that <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{him a little}} fortune. It promises {{to become one of}} the greatest toys of the age. A regular game can be played. The ball is pitched from an ingenious device and goes straight over the plate. If a hit isn't made or the ball struck at all the 'catcher' gets it. All the 'players' are in position, and there are regular catches in the outfield and pick-ups in the infield. The bat is a curious contrivance, and it takes good judgment to operate it. A fast or slow ball can be pitched, and the batter is liable to be 'fooled' by changes of pace. Nothing like it was ever seen before in toy games. The invention is to be shown in Hudson's window after Thanksgiving, and will surely attract great attention.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{receiving}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} the critics, the country-rock style of Sweetheart of the Rodeo {{was such a}} radical departure from the band's previous sound that large sections of the group's counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, said of the album: [...] "The new Byrds do not sound like Buck Owens & his Buckaroos. They aren't that good. The material they've chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It's not pretentious, it's pretty. The musician-ship is excellent." [...] Gifford added that [...] "The Byrds have made an interesting album. It's really very uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the 'Easy-Listening' charts. 'Bringing it all back home' has never been an easy thing to do." [...] Rolling Stone praised the album in its September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: [...] "The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today." [...] Landau added that [...] "they leave just enough rock in the drums {{to let you know that}} they can still play rock & roll." [...] In a 1969 article for The New York Times, Robert Christgau described Sweetheart of the Rodeo as [...] "a bittersweet tribute to country music".|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{reviewer}} Jeannette Catsoulis praised it {{for avoiding}} the dichotomy of [...] "corporate greed versus environmental well-being", adding {{that instead of}} being an exposé, [...] "Under the gentle, humane investigations of its director, what emerges most strongly is a portrait of exploitation that <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> us more nauseated than elated over those $20 jeans". Tamsin Blanchard, for the Daily Telegraph, called it a work that will [...] "do for the fast fashion business what Food Inc did for fast food". The Hollywood Reporters Frank Scheck commended it for approaching an issue often [...] "untouched by major news organizations". He said the film was [...] "more despair-inducing than instructive", but was optimistic about its possible impact on the fashion culture, citing the effect that films such as Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation had on the fast food industry. Carson Quiros of Paste also compared it to the former film. David Noh of Film Journal International called it a [...] "vitally important documentary" [...] that contains scenes that [...] "are {{enough to make you}} never want to go shopping again". Gabrielle Wilson of MTV stated it is [...] "hard to swallow but never feels preach-y or like a barrage of depressive factoids" [...] and will empower viewers to change their shopping habits. Casey Jarman said she was disappointed by [...] "the only solution offered: eliminating global capitalism"; however, ultimately, she wrote for Willamette Week that it is a [...] "compelling film, which is, above all else, a badly needed conversation-starter".|$|E

500|$|An {{important}} {{deviation of}} the film's plot from history {{is that there}} is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy's relationship went beyond acquaintance. Rather, all that is known of them together is that they danced at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was [...] "too proud" [...] to ask his aunt about him two years later. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a [...] "boyish love". As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that {{he was in love with}} her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love. As this occurred in a friendly & private conversation, I feel some doubt whether I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it public.Lori Smith, author of The Jane Austen Guide to Life, opined that:No doubt this relationship and her [...] repartee with Tom fueled her writing. Whether it was [...] "her greatest inspiration" [...] as the trailers for Becoming Jane claim, well, that's debatable. But I'm sure it provided as spark.However, contrary to the film's story line, Jane had attempted her first full-length novel before she met Tom and had already read The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling before meeting him. In a cut scene from the movie, it is clear that she is reading the novel for the second time, but in the theatrical release without that scene, it appears he introduces her to it.|$|E

2500|$|Copland's {{compositions}} {{before leaving}} for Paris were mainly short works for piano and art songs, inspired by Liszt and Debussy. In them, he experimented with ambiguous beginnings and endings, rapid key changes, and the frequent use of tritones. His first published work, The Cat and the Mouse(1920), was a piece for piano solo based on the Jean de la Fontaine fable. In Three Moods (1921), Copland's final movement is entitled [...] "Jazzy", which he noted [...] "is based on two jazz melodies and <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the old professors sit up and take notice".|$|E

He uses his weight to advantage, and although not too good a starter, he <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a lot of runs". In fact he was something of a disappointment on the tour, scoring 529 at an average of 21.16. He scored a useful 74 in the second match of the tour against Essex and later 68* against Scotland and 68 against Leicestershire.|$|E

[...] In December 1922, Washington owner Clark Griffith hired Bush to replace Clyde Milan as player-manager for the 1923 season. [...] The Sporting News opined that Bush had the characteristics to make a solid manager: [...] "The same traits that made our friend Donie a great little ball player have been recognized when Clark Griffith appoints him manager. Brains, a good pair of hands, and a bulldog disposition made him a playing success against the handicap of being undersized and rather weak of arm[...] [...] [...] He <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> quite a manager; ought to put something into that Washington team that it lacked." ...|$|E

The following year, Foote {{was charged with}} falsifying a government document relating to the check-in of a motor pool vehicle he had borrowed to visit a girlfriend in Belfast, Teresa Lavery—later his first wife—who lived two miles beyond the official military limits. He was court-martialed and dismissed from the Army. Shelby and Teresa divorced while she was living with his mother in New Orleans, after Shelby sent her to the U.S. on a warship convoy. [...] After the war, Teresa married Kermit Beahan, the Nagasaki atomic bomb bombardier, in Roswell, New Mexico.

2500|$|When the new {{parliamentary}} session began on 6 October Fitzwilliam moved an amendment (drafted by Burke) {{to the address}} criticising Lord Malmesbury peace mission to France, {{the only person to}} do so. This near universal support was due [...] "not from Opposition concurring in the measures of Government but from Government abandoning their own measures of to adopt those of Opposition—the regular order of things seems subverted". It was futile to desire peace with [...] "a species of power, with whose very existence all fair and equitable accommodation is incompatible". Furthermore, such a peace would be dishonourable because the government had previously stated it would only seek peace [...] "through the ancient and legitimate government long established in France" [...] and that he solemnly recorded his discharging [...] "of the duty I owe to my king and country". The Annual Register said Fitzwilliam's protest [...] "breathes the genuine spirit first roused, and perhaps, still actuated {{to a greater extent than}} was acknowledged by the British government". Laurence wrote to Fitzwilliam on 26 October that Henry Addington, Speaker of the House of Commons, viewed him as [...] "man of high integrity; no person could say that his lordship had abandoned his principles". Burke wrote to Fitzwilliam on 30 October of his appreciation of [...] "the solo you played in the grand orchestra" [...] and that his arguments were [...] "relished by the public" [...] and were given greater power due to [...] "your personal weight and character". Burke further stated that his Two Letters on a Regicide Peace were a [...] "poor attempt to second what you have done". Fitzwilliam wrote to Burke on 10 November that his pamphlets had [...] "roused a spirit in the country, which does not act, only because those, who <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of it, choose to keep it under". He also claimed that [...] "It is the dread of an [...] expedition slipping over to Ireland, and erecting there the standard of revolt, which makes him [...] drive England headlong into peace". Fitzwilliam wrote to Laurence on 10 November that [...] "Every other political consideration, continental connexions, balance of power in Europe—the existence of civil society itself—is to be sacrificed, rather than give up their system in Ireland. ... Had it been permitted to me to have gratified them [...] in the little they looked for, Ireland would not have been what it now is, a millstone upon the neck of England".|$|E
