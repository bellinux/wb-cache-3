5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, {{the leaves}} are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between {{the upper and lower}} leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to <b>oblanceolate,</b> and reaching sizes up to 50cm long and 14cm across (19inches long and 5inches wide). They become smaller higher up the stem, and less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem is solid and 2–2.5cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, the stem and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaves are}} alternate, simple, and <b>oblanceolate</b> with crenate margins and pinnate venation; in autumn {{the leaves turn}} a bold red color. Dark trichomes are present on the upper midrib surface. The flowers are small, with 5 petals and 5 sepals, and {{produced}} in corymbs of 10-25 together. Hypanthium is urn-shaped. The fruit is a small pome, with an astringent flavor.|$|E
25|$|Beta vulgaris is an {{herbaceous}} biennial or, rarely, perennial plant up to 120cm (rarely 200cm) height; cultivated {{forms are}} mostly biennial. The roots of cultivated forms are dark red, white, or yellow and moderately to strongly swollen and fleshy (subsp. vulgaris); or brown, fibrous, sometimes swollen and woody {{in the wild}} subspecies. The stems grow erect or, in the wild forms, often procumbent; they are simple or branched in the upper part, and their surface is ribbed and striate. The basal leaves have a long petiole (which may be thickened and red, white, or yellow in some cultivars). The simple leaf blade is <b>oblanceolate</b> to heart-shaped, dark green to dark red, slightly fleshy, usually with a prominent midrib, with entire or undulate margin, 5–20cm long on wild plants (often much larger in cultivated plants). The upper leaves are smaller, their blades are rhombic to narrowly lanceolate.|$|E
25|$|These are basal, {{emerging}} from the bulb initially enclosed in a tubular membranous sheath of cataphylls. These are generally two (sometimes three) and linear, strap-shaped or <b>oblanceolate.</b> Vernation, {{the arrangement of the}} emerging leaves relative to each other, varies between species. These may be applanate (flat), supervolute (conduplicate) or explicative (pleated). In applanate vernation the two leaf blades are pressed flat to each other within the bud and as they emerge; explicative leaves are also pressed flat against each other, but the edges of the leaves are folded back (externally recurved) or sometimes rolled; in supervolute plants one leaf is tightly clasped around the other within the bud and generally remains {{at the point where the}} leaves emerge from the soil (for illustration, see Stearn and Davis). In the past, this feature has been used to distinguish between species and to determine the parentage of hybrids but has been shown to be homoplasious, and not useful in this regard.|$|E
500|$|Telopea 'Braidwood Brilliant' is a frost-tolerant hybrid {{between a}} male T.speciosissima and female T.mongaensis. Dr Boden of the Canberra Parks Administration began {{investigating}} this hybrid in 1962, {{and it was}} registered in 1975 by Richard Powell. It is a lignotuberous shrub to [...] high and has <b>oblanceolate</b> leaves to [...] long. The red blooms are [...] in diameter, intermediate in size between the parent species. It has grown well in cooler climates such as Canberra.|$|E
500|$|Xerochrysum 'Cockatoo' arose as a {{spontaneous}} hybrid between 'Dargan Hill Monarch' and a white-flowered perennial form of X.bracteatum, {{in the garden}} of Victorian plantsman Doug McKenzie in Ocean Grove near Geelong in Victoria. He applied to the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority (ACRA) for registration, which was granted in 1980. It is a dense perennial shrub which reaches around [...] high and wide. The <b>oblanceolate</b> leaves measure [...] long and are covered with fine hairs that give them a greyish cast. Fine hairs also cover the stems. The flower heads have light lemon-yellow bracts and orange discs and average [...] in diameter. They are held on long stems around [...] above the foliage. Like all forms, it prefers full sun. Although a perennial, it loses vigour after a few years, at which time it is best replaced. The name 'Cockatoo' was chosen as the shape and colour of the ray florets are reminiscent of the wing feathers of the sulphur-crested cockatoo.|$|E
500|$|B.spinulosa var.cunninghamii: This variety was {{published}} as B.cunninghamii in 1827 {{in honour of}} the botanist Allan Cunningham, and demoted {{to a variety of}} B.spinulosa in 1981. The demotion has not been universally accepted however: in New South Wales it is still given species rank, and B.spinulosa var.neoanglica is considered a subspecies of it. George notes that at locations where both var.spinulosa and var.cunninghamii coexist, such as Fitzroy Falls in Lawson, no intermediate forms occur. This plant is a fast-growing nonlignotuberous shrub or small tree to [...] in height, occurring in the Great Dividing Range from southeast Queensland to southern New South Wales and also in Victoria. The juvenile leaves are highly serrated, new branchlets are hairy and leaf undersides are pale brown rather than white as in the two previous varieties. Inflorescences are gold with black styles, though an all-yellow form from Victoria is known. The linear to <b>oblanceolate</b> adult leaves are [...] long by 2–7mm wide; those from Victoria having markedly longer juvenile leaves, and larger cotyledons.|$|E
2500|$|Lilium pardalinum subsp. pitkinense attains {{a height}} of [...] The leaves of the Pitkin Marsh lily are {{typically}} about 14 centimeters long and one to two centimeters in width. The whorled leaves of the Pitkin Marsh lily are staggered along the stem, and are generally elliptical to <b>oblanceolate</b> in shape. [...] Near the Pitkin Marsh, individuals are found which seem to be hybrids with the closely related Panther lily.|$|E
2500|$|The scape bears {{at the top}} a pair of bract-like spathe valves usually fused {{down one}} side and joined by a papery membrane, {{appearing}} monophyllous (single). From between them emerges a solitary (rarely two), pendulous, nodding, bell-shaped white flower, held on a slender pedicel. The flower bears six free perianth segments (tepals) rather than petals, arranged in two whorls of three, the outer whorl being larger and more convex than the inner series. The outer tepals are acute to more or less obtuse, spathulate or <b>oblanceolate</b> to narrowly obovate or linear, shortly clawed and erect spreading. The inner tepals are much shorter (half to two thirds as long), oblong, spathulate or <b>oblanceolate,</b> somewhat [...] (claw like) and tapered to the base and erect. These tepals also bear green markings at the base, apex or both that when at the apex are bridge-shaped over the small sinus (notch) {{at the tip of}} each tepal, which are emarginate. Occasionally the markings are either green-yellow, yellow or absent, and the shape and size varies by species.|$|E
