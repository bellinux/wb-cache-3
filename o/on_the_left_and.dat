5|$|Early {{the next}} day the NZMRB moved towards Katia, with the {{intention}} of attacking a Turkish gun emplacement. The brigade positioned itself between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right. Taking the lead, the regiment advanced close enough by 14:30 to charge the position on horseback, then dismounted and continued the attack on foot, all in the face of heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. No progress was made and they {{spent the rest of the}} day returning fire from cover. The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded.|$|E

Priced from ¥1,281,000 to ¥1,617,000, Mitsubishi initially aimed for 5,000 cars per month within the domestic market, and managed to exceed its target in its first month by over 1,000. By the end of 2006, approximately 37,000 had been sold. The company has already exported the i to Singapore, Brunei, Hong Kong, and New Zealand, where like Japan they drive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> introduced it to the United Kingdom on July 1, 2007, with a price of UK£9,000 and a target of 300 sales per year.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 November 1757 the Prussian camp lay between Rossbach <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> the village of Bedra on the right, facing the Allies. Charles, the Prince Soubise, {{commanding}} the French, and the Prince Saxe-Hildburghausen, commanding the Holy Roman Empire's forces, had maneuvered in the preceding days without giving Frederick an opportunity to begin fighting. Their forces were located to the west, with their right flank {{near the town of}} Branderoda and their left at Mücheln. The advanced posts of the Prussians stood in villages immediately west of their camp, those of the Allies on the Schortau hill and the Galgenberg.|$|E

5|$|The {{articles}} of capitulation were signed on October 19, 1781. Signatories included Washington, Rochambeau, the Comte de Barras (on {{behalf of the}} French Navy), Cornwallis, and Captain Thomas Symonds (the senior Royal Navy officer present). Cornwallis' British men were declared prisoners of war, promised good treatment in American camps, and officers were permitted to return home after taking their parole. At 2:00pm the allied army entered the British positions, with the French <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> the Americans on the right.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} tongue, except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue. There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> one on the right.|$|E

In general, within one row (period) the elements are metals <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> non-metals on the right.|$|E
5|$|The pudendal nerve is paired, meaning {{there are}} two nerves, one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> {{one on the right}} side of the body. Each is formed as three roots {{immediately}} converge above the upper border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the coccygeus muscle. The three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower cord, and these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the sacrospinous ligament. The three roots are derived from the ventral rami of the second, third, and fourth sacral spinal nerves, with the primary contribution coming from the fourth.|$|E
5|$|After halting overnight, the {{regiment}} led the NZMRB at 04:30 {{to attack the}} Turkish position. By 05:15 {{the regiment}} made contact with the Turkish outposts and advanced on foot towards the main Turkish defences, under covering fire from the Royal Horse Artillery (RHA). The regiment had the 3rd Squadron <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>and</b> two troops of the 11th Squadron and a machine-gun section on the right. Their right flank {{was supposed to be}} covered by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, but it had failed to arrive. In consequence the regiment had to extend its lines to cover the open flank, so two troops from the 4th Squadron were sent there. Things were also not going well on the other flank. At 11:20 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were forced to retire. Then, just before midday, two Turkish battalions of about 1,100 men attacked the regiment. Still supported by the RHA, the brigade held its positions. For the next three and a half hours, the brigade was subjected to a heavy artillery bombardment. This was followed by another attack by three Turkish battalions. Holding out until 16:15 the regiment was then ordered to pull back. The day's fighting cost the regiment twelve dead and twenty-one wounded.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, to the south, Percy {{advanced}} with some 3,000 men. Percy advanced in two columns with his brigade of Hessians <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> Percy himself leading the right. About 200 {{yards from the}} American lines Percy halted the advance, waiting for the feint by Stirling to take place. Facing Percy was Alexander Graydon and his company. Graydon's superior was Lambert Cadwalader, Magaw's second in command, {{who was in charge}} of holding the three defensive lines south of Fort Washington. After hearing that there was a landing on the shore in his rear, Cadwalader sent 50 men to oppose it. The 50 men ran into the feint by Col. Stirling's 42nd Foot of 700 men. Where Stirling landed happened to be the least defended area of the American defenses, and when Cadwalader heard how many men were there, he sent another 100 men to reinforce the 50 he had sent earlier. The British landing parties spread out, looking for a path through the rough terrain on the landing spot. The Americans took up a position on a hilltop and began firing at the British troops who were still crossing the river, killing or wounding 80 men. The British troops charged the American position, dispersing them.|$|E
5|$|As {{the files}} {{converge}} {{on the east}} frieze we encounter the first women celebrants E2–27, E50–51, E53–63. The priestesses carry the sacrificial instruments and paraphernalia including the phiale (phial or jug), oinochoai (wine jars), thymiaterion (incense burner), {{and in the case}} of E50–51, evidently they have just handed the marshal E49 a kanoun, making the girl the kanephoros. The next groups E18–23, E43–46, are problematic. Six <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> four on the right, if one does not count two other figures who may or may not be marshals, then this group might be taken to be the ten eponymous heroes who gave their names to the ten tribes. Their proximity to the deities indicates their importance, but selecting differently, then nine of them may be the archons of the polis or athlothetai officials who managed the procession; there is insufficient iconographic evidence to determine which interpretation is correct.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00, Napoleon drafted {{his general}} order: Reille's Corps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>and</b> d'Erlon's Corps {{to the right}} were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, {{rather than at the}} more forward {{position}} on the ridge. To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A grande batterie of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.|$|E
