40|$|Existing design {{criteria}} for vibration energy harvesting systems provide guidance on the appropriate {{selection of the}} seismic mass and load resistance. To harvest maximum power in resonant devices, the mass needs to be as large as possible and the load resistance needs to be equal to {{the sum of the}} internal resistance of the generator and the mechanical damping equivalent resistance. However, it is shown in this paper that these rules produce suboptimum results for applications where there is a constraint on the relative displacement of the seismic mass, which is often the case. When the displacement is constrained, increasing the mass beyond a certain limit reduces the amount of harvested power. The <b>optimum</b> <b>load</b> resistance in this case is shown to be equal to the generator’s internal resistance.

The nanocomposites were prepared by {{using a combination of}} melt mixing and latex compounding method. Five different samples with different filler loading namely PAL 2 (2 phr), PAL 4 (4 phr), PAL 6 (6 phr), PAL 8 (8 phr) and PAL 10 (10 phr) were prepared in this work. All the samples were subjected to curing and tensile test. All the results were compared with pure gum of natural rubber. The curing characteristics of PAL/NR nanocomposites such as minimum and maximum torque were higher at <b>optimum</b> filler <b>loading,</b> PAL 4. It means that the <b>optimum</b> filler <b>loading</b> would produce higher rigidity of the sample. Thus, PAL 4 had higher stiffness compared to other filler loading. The scorch time and cure time of the sample that had undergone melt mixing and latex compounding method were higher compared to NR. The increase in both scorch time and cure time revealed that the presence of PAL could increase the curing process of the nanocomposites. Furthermore, PAL 4 showed 18 % increment in tensile strength. These results showed the <b>optimum</b> filler <b>loading</b> can increase the compatibility between PAL and NR. The size and shape of the PAL and the combination of melt mixing and latex compounding method might also contribute to this improvement. The morphology characteristics of all PAL/NR nanocomposites sample showed thicker tear line and rougher surface compared to control sample, NR. This might due to the homogenous dispersion of PAL which contains <b>optimum</b> filler <b>loading.</b> Thus, 4 phr of palygorskite loading found to be the <b>optimum</b> filler <b>loading</b> with a combination of melt mixing and latex compounding methods...|$|R
