In a little more than an hour, the worst was over--the Walrus issuing into an <b>open</b> <b>basin</b> of several leagues in extent, which was, however, completely encircled by the frozen mountains. Here Noah took a look at the pumpkin, after which he made no ceremony in plumply telling Dr. Reasono that he had been greatly mistaken in laying down the position of Captivity Island, as he himself had named the spot where the amiable strangers had fallen into human hands. The philosopher was a little tenacious of his opinion; but what is argument in the face of facts? Here was the pumpkin, and there were the blue waters! The captain now quite frankly declared that he had great doubts whether there was any such place as Leaphigh at all; and as the ship had a capital position for such an object, he bluntly, though privately proposed to me, that we should throw all the monikins overboard, project the entire polar basin on his chart as being entirely free from islands, and then go a-sealing. I rejected the propositions, firstly, as premature; secondly, as inhuman; thirdly, as inhospitable; fourthly, as inconvenient; and lastly, as impracticable.|$|E
60|$|I have {{examined}} fourteen skulls of POLISH AND OTHER CRESTED BREEDS. Their differences are extraordinary. First for nine skulls of different sub- breeds of English Polish fowls. The hemispherical protuberance of the frontal bones (7/68. See Mr. Tegetmeier's account with woodcuts {{of the skull}} of Polish fowls in 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' November 25, 1856. For other references see Isid. Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire 'Hist. Gen. des Anomalies' tome 1 page 287. M. C. Dareste suspects ('Recherches sur les Conditions de la Vie' etc. Lille 1863 page 36) that the protuberance is not formed by the frontal bones, but by the ossification of the dura mater.) {{may be seen in}} figure 34, in which (B) the skull of a white-crested Polish fowl is shown obliquely from above, with the skull (A) of (G. bankiva in the same position. In figure 35 longitudinal sections are given of the skull of a Polish fowl, and, for comparison, of a Cochin of the same size. The protuberance in all Polish fowls occupies the same position but differs much in size. In one of my nine specimens it was extremely slight. The degree to which the protuberance is ossified varies greatly, larger or smaller portions of bone being replaced by membrane. In one specimen there was only a single open pore; generally, there are many variously shaped open spaces, the bone forming an irregular reticulation. A medial, longitudinal, arched ribbon of bone is generally retained, but in one specimen there was no bone whatever over the whole protuberance, and the skull, when cleaned and viewed from above, presented the appearance of an <b>open</b> <b>basin.</b> The change in the whole internal form of the skull is surprisingly great. The brain is modified in a corresponding manner, as is shown in the two longitudinal sections, which deserve attentive consideration. The upper and anterior cavity of the three into which the skull may be divided, is the one which is so greatly modified; it is evidently much larger than in the Cochin skull of the same size, and extends much further beyond the interorbital septum, but laterally is less deep. This cavity, as I hear from Mr. Tegetmeier, is entirely filled with brain. In the skull of the Cochin and of all ordinary fowls a strong internal ridge of bone separates the anterior from the central cavity; but this ridge is quite absent in the Polish skull here figured. The shape of the central cavity is circular in the Polish, and lengthened in the Cochin skull. The shape of the posterior cavity, together with the position, size, and number of the pores for the nerves, differ much in these two skulls. A pit deeply penetrating the occipital bone of the Cochin is entirely absent in this Polish skull, whilst in another specimen it was well developed. In this second specimen the whole internal surface of the posterior cavity likewise differs to a certain extent in shape. I made sections of two other skulls,--namely, of a Polish fowl with the protuberance singularly little developed, and of a Sultan in which it was a little more developed; and when these two skulls were placed between the two above figured (figure 35), a perfect gradation in the configuration of each part of the internal surface could be traced. In the Polish skull, with a small protuberance, the ridge between the anterior and middle cavities was present, but low; and in the Sultan this ridge was replaced by a narrow furrow standing on a broad raised eminence.|$|E

50|$|The winter {{route is}} a little {{different}} from the summer trail, and involves exposure to complex avalanche terrain. Skiers can cross the frozen lake, if the ice is thick enough, and at the far side can stay {{to the left of the}} creek, following a good trail that skirts the canyon. After about 700 m the route drops down onto the creek bed and follows it through a gorge. After the gorge becomes too difficult to negotiate, skiers must ascend the bank to the left at one of the easier points, and then angle up through the trees, parallel to the canyon. When the route reaches an <b>open</b> <b>basin,</b> it is possible to see the hut high up on the headwall to the right. From that point, skiers should aim for the right-hand corner of the headwall, staying left initially to avoid the worst of the moraine. Toward the end of the valley, a number of possible routes lead up through the headwall to the hut, which is a few hundred metres from the top of the headwall. The trip normally takes 3 to 5 hours.|$|E
50|$|Most common {{approach}} route for Mount Forbes {{is from the}} Alberta side, starting at the Icefields Parkway.

From there follow the old trail up the north bank of the Glacier River to the large <b>open</b> <b>basin</b> {{at the head of the}} river. Ford the Glacier river. Find the climbers trail ascending the timbered knob at the south end of the basin. Follow this trail as it climbs steeply up the knob then crosses to the west and climbs improbably up toward cliffs to the west. Eventually you climb above the canyon and then the drop slightly to the edge of the Mons Glacier. Camps can be made here or at the foot of the North Glacier of Mt. Forbes. From here, the peak can be climbed in a reasonable day. The approach takes 4 to 6 hours. A faster and shorter approach is from the west via recent logging roads starting north of Golden, BC. The 4-6 hour approach mentioned above has become much longer due to deteriorating trails, and also involves a cold river crossing. Many parties take two days using this approach. For a faster approach start on the Bush logging road and follow this until 68 km. Here turn right on the Vallenciennes Road to 13 km where you follow the left fork up the Mons road. Park just past 23 km beside Icefall Brook. From here a trail ascends 350 m up a gravel slope, where it traverses north on ledges above the Icefall Canyon. This ledge is on the west side of Mons Peak. After traversing for 1 km, the open meadows and moraines below the Mons Glacier are reached. From a camp here Mt. Forbes can be climbed in a day. This approach is 4 km long, climbs 1000 m, and can be done in 3 to 4 hours.|$|E

We show that the tracer release method is suitable for quantifying facility- and some process-scale emissions, while the chamber measurements provide insight into individual process emissions. Uncertainties for the two methods are described and discussed. Applying the methods to CH 4 emissions of the WWTP, we confirm that the <b>open</b> <b>basins</b> are not a major source of CH 4 on the WWTP (about 10 % of the total emissions), but that the pretreatment and sludge treatment are the main emitters.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{molecular}} organic markers were determined in surface sediments from the Gulf of Genoa (Ligurian Sea) {{in order to}} evaluate their potential for palaeo-environmental reconstructions. Allochthonous input can be characterized by the distributions of n-C 29 and n-C 31 alkanes, n-C 26 and n-C 28 alkanols and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs), whose concentrations are generally highest near the river mouths. In the <b>open</b> <b>basin</b> however, terrestrial n-alkanes and n-alkanols may have an additional, aeolian source. Autochthonous input is represented by crenarchaeol and isoprenoid GDGTs. Their concentrations are highest in the <b>open</b> <b>basin</b> showing the preference of Thaumarchaeota for oligotrophic waters. Indications of a significant degradation of sterols and C 37 alkenones exclude these lipids as reliable productivity proxies. Using terrestrial and aquatic lipids as end-members allows estimating the percentage of terrestrial organic matter between 20 % and 58 % in the coastal area decreasing to 1 to 30 % in the deep basin. The spatial distribution of sea surface temperature (SST) estimates using the alkenone-based UK' 37 index {{is very similar to}} the autumnal (November) mean satellite-based SST distribution. Conversely, TEXH 86 -derived SST estimates are close to winter SSTs in the coastal area and summer SSTs in the <b>open</b> <b>basin.</b> This pattern reflects presumably a shift in the main production of Thaumarchaeota from the coastal area in winter to the <b>open</b> <b>basin</b> in summer.

In this study, we present the results from a surface sediment transect through the northern Bothnian Bay, from the Kalix river mouth to the <b>open</b> <b>basin,</b> providing a baseline study on the terrestrial molecular distribution. Furthermore, the propensity of biomarker deposition along the transect is investigated. This information can be used to predict the impact on mineralisation processes in sub-Arctic shelf areas.

This easily accessible estuary has been shown to resemble the western Great Russian Arctic Rivers (Gustafsson et al., 2000; Ingri et al., 2004; Guo et al., 2004) and can therefore be used as a valuable model system.
