50|$|Oilite is a porous bronze or {{iron alloy}} {{commonly}} impregnated with an <b>oil</b> <b>lubricant</b> {{and used in}} bearings. The original Oilite and Oilite Plus are bronze alloys, while Super Oilite and Super Oilite 16 are iron-based. Oilite was developed by Chrysler in 1930, originally for use in bearings for water pumps and spring shackles, and without oil as the porous filter element in gasoline filters. Chrysler sold approximately 500,000 Oilite bearings in 1930 and approximately 2.5 million the next year. The Super Oilite was introduced in 1932. Overall sales of all Oilite material in 1932 was seven million; this rose to 18 million in 1933. Oilite was a profit center for Chrysler during this time. Currently, the Oilite trademark belongs to Beemer Precision.|$|E

A side effect of having this runway, decades later North Bay was selected as an emergency site for NASA's Space Shuttle, and periodically, due to the long runway and relatively isolated location, free of air traffic and built-up areas, plus security offered by the military, NASA used North Bay's airfield for research into different fields of aviation.|$|E

In May 1918 (with effect from 1 April 1918), Malik was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant. In the summer of 1918, he was posted back to France with No. 11 Squadron RAF, first stationed at Bapaume, then at Nivelles. Malik was stationed at Aulnoye-Aymeries when the Armistice was signed on 11 November. By the war's end, Malik had been credited with two aerial victories, though he claimed six victories, which would have made him a flying ace and the only other Indian flying ace of the First World War besides Indra Lal Roy. Of the four Indians who flew with the RAF during the First World War, Malik was one of two who survived.|$|E
40|$|The <b>lubricant</b> <b>oil</b> {{is one of}} the sub-products of petroleum, {{which is}} not {{completely}} absorbed during its process and generates a large amount of used and contaminated oils that, when not accordingly disposed, can contaminate and cause damage to the environment.

40|$|Today, in {{the area}} of {{material}} design conversion coatings {{play an important role in}} the applications where temperature, corrosion, oxidation and wear come in to play. Wear of metals occurs when relative motion between counter-surfaces takes place, leading to physical or chemical destruction of the original top layers.

The Surface morphology of manganese phosphate coatings was examined by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX).

30|$|The {{environmental}} burdens are {{allocated for}} coconut oil by assuming it replacing commercial paraffin <b>oil</b> <b>lubricant</b> [35]. As mentioned in ‘Inventory data for coconut cultivation’, 4.7 kg of husked nuts (9.4 numbers equals approximately 10) {{is required to}} produce 1 kg (or 1.08 l) of coconut oil. Thus, corresponding to the generation of 1 MJ of syngas energy (reference functional unit), the net quantity of ‘lubricant’ (coconut oil) production can be computed and modeled in SimaPro. A separate module is created for paraffin <b>oil</b> <b>lubricant</b> production (modified Ecoinvent module), and the producer gas life cycle system boundary is expanded to include the system of processes in the commercial paraffin <b>oil</b> <b>lubricant</b> production. By proceeding like this, the net emissions associated with the production of producer gas with 1 MJ of energy are determined by subtracting {{the sum of the}} emissions (or impacts) associated with the saved fossil fuel-based electricity production and the saved commercial lubricant production from the emissions associated with the generation of producer gas.|$|E

Full details of this licence are available at: [URL] Chemical additives are incorporated into commercial lubricant oils to modify the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the lubricant. The quantitative analysis of additives in oil-based lubricants deposited on a surface without extraction of the sample from the surface presents a challenge. The potential of desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) for the quantitative surface analysis of an oil additive in a complex <b>oil</b> <b>lubricant</b> matrix without sample extraction has been evaluated. Methods The quantitative surface analysis of the antioxidant additive octyl (4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -di-tert-butylphenyl) propionate in an <b>oil</b> <b>lubricant</b> matrix was carried out by DESI-MS in the presence of 2 -(pentyloxy) ethyl 3 -(3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -hydroxyphenyl) propionate as an internal standard. A quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer fitted with an in-house modified ion source enabling non-proximal DESI-MS was used for the analyses. RESULTS An eight-point calibration curve ranging from 1 to 80 μg/spot of octyl (4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -di-tert-butylphenyl) propionate in an <b>oil</b> <b>lubricant</b> matrix and {{in the presence of the}} internal standard was used to determine the quantitative response of the DESI-MS method.

The result was found to be reliable once the FE model was validated by the established work. The extrusion force for each extrusion ratio was described and evaluated. The FE analysis also accounts for plasticity material flow and equivalent plastic strains in the deformation region. The analysis agreed that the extrusion ratio of 1. 5 reduced the extrusion force compared to the extrusion ratio of 2 and 3. This was confirmed by the plotted equivalent plastic strain deformation which shows that the high value of equivalent plastic strain near the extrusion die surface was decreased.
