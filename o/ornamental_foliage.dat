6000|$|With {{respect to}} trees, {{the history of}} but few of the many {{varieties}} with curious or <b>ornamental</b> <b>foliage</b> is known; but several probably have originated by bud-variation. Here is one case:--An old ash-tree (Fraxinus excelsior) in the grounds of Necton, as Mr. Mason states, [...] "for many years has had one bough of a totally different character {{to the rest of}} the tree, or of any other ash-tree which I have seen; being short-jointed and densely covered with foliage." [...] It was ascertained that this variety could be propagated by grafts. (11/61. W. Mason in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1843 page 878.) The varieties of some trees with cut leaves, as the oak-leaved laburnum, the parsley-leaved vine, and especially the fern-leaved beech, are apt to revert by buds to the common forms. (11/62. Alex. Braun 'Ray Soc. Bot. Mem.' 1853 page 315; 'Gardener's Chron.' 1841 page 329.) The fern-like leaves of the beech sometimes revert only partially, and the branches display here and there sprouts bearing common leaves, fern-like, and variously shaped leaves. Such cases differ but little from the so- called heterophyllus varieties, in which the tree habitually bears leaves of various forms; but it is probable that most heterophyllous trees have originated as seedlings. There is a sub-variety of the weeping willow with leaves rolled up into a spiral coil; and Mr. Masters states that a tree of this kind kept true in his garden for twenty-five years, and then threw out a single upright shoot bearing flat leaves. (11/63. Dr. M.T. Masters 'Royal Institution Lecture' March 16, 1860.) ...|$|E

40|$|Zamioculcas zamiifolia is an <b>ornamental</b> potted <b>foliage</b> {{plant and}} a {{relatively}} new introduction {{to the world of}} interior plants. However, its low growth rate in conventional solid media is a constraint in mass propagation. The present study aimed at developing improved culture techniques that would enhance the growth and rapid propagation of the plant. Three experiments were conducted to find out the best type of vegetative cuttings, the effect of light on plant growth in a liquid (distilled water) medium, and to develop a new solid medium with nutrients to increase the growth rate. Basal leaflets without rachis were found to be the best cutting type for rapid propagation. Solid substrate was better than liquid medium for rapid rooting. Compost + sand + 0. 75 g l- 1 fertilizer nutrients can be recommended for rapid propagation of the plant. Plant growth was high in the light-exposed liquid medium compared to dark treatment. Interestingly, the liquid medium led to development of a miniature plant which could be introduced as a novel table-top ornament.

40|$|Florida {{accounts}} for more than 75 % of the national cut foliage production. Unfortunately, root-knot nematodes (RKN) (Meloidogyne spp.) are a serious problem on these crops, rendering many farms unproductive. Currently, information on the Meloidogyne spp. occurring on most commonly cultivated cut foliage crops in Florida, and tools for their rapid identification are lacking. The objectives of this study were to (i) identify specific RKN infecting common <b>ornamental</b> cut <b>foliage</b> crops in Florida and (ii) evaluate the feasibility of using the mtDNA haplotype as a molecular diagnostic tool for rapid identification of large samples of RKN. A total of 200 Meloidogyne females were collected from cut foliage plant roots. Meloidogyne spp. were identified by PCR and RFLP of mitochondrial DNA. PCR and RFLP of mitochondrial DNA were effective in discriminating the Meloidogyne spp. present. Meloidogyne incognita is the most dominant RKN on cut foliage crops in Florida and must be a high target for making management decisions. Other Meloidogyne spp. identified include M. javanica, M. hapla, Meloidogyne sp. 1, and Meloidogyne sp. 2. The results for this study demonstrate the usefulness of the mtDNA haplotype-based designation as a valuable molecular tool for identification of Meloidogyne spp...|$|R

30|$|Cultivation of <b>foliage</b> <b>ornamental</b> plants {{contributes}} to the biggest segment of the floriculture industry followed by potted flowering and nursery plants, flowering bulbs and other plant material for propagation purposes (Dole and Wilkins 2005). Foliage plants need suitable rooting atmosphere for better growth whereas traditional soils generally have some inherent problems, especially {{for the production of}} plants in containers in terms of poor aeration and drainage, and may contain insects, weed seeds and disease causing organisms. The frequent water demanded by container plants will cause various soils to compact into a tight, brick-like mass (Tariq et al. 2012) and nutrition management is also more difficult because indigenous soils have their own nutritional status, which interferes with the plant nutrient uptake ability for the growth and development (Younis et al. 2013 a). Nursery production of container plants and greenhouse plant production mainly depends on a number of soilless cultural practices (Wilson et al. 2003; Younis et al. 2011). One of them, most important cultural input is growing media that is the basic prerequisite for better growth and development of horticultural plants (Younis et al. 2013 b).|$|R

50|$|Home Demonstration Garden: Since {{its opening}} in 2003 this 3 acre space {{has been devoted}} to {{educational}} displays including noteworthy plants and architectural techniques and materials suitable for Central Florida gardeners. It is divided into 10 residentially scaled “idea gardens” showcasing different plant groups that include the following gardens: Bird, Bog, Enabling, Evening, Fragrance, Ornamental Grass, Shade, Subtropical Fruit, Urban Patio and Wildflower. • The Bird Garden displays plants that attract and sustain birds in Central Florida. Some of the plants produce fruit and berries for birds to eat while other plants have dense growth habits that allow birds cover or nesting sites. There are also flowering plants that hummingbirds feed from and find attractive. • The Bog Garden demonstrates plants that can tolerate growing in a wet location in the landscape. This is an area in which water can stand for several hours to a couple of days at a time following a heavy rainfall but is not permanent. The soil is very heavy and poorly drained. A “dry” streambed runs {{through the center of the}} Bog Garden but does not have a permanent flow of water.• The Enabling Garden was specifically designed to support Leu Garden’s extensive horticultural therapy program. The beds are raised for gardening for several purposes; to provide accessibility for someone in a wheelchair, for someone who needs to remain seated most of the time or for people with visual impairments, because the plants are in closer range than on the ground. The plantings in these beds may change throughout the year. In addition there is a small Texture Garden that contains plants with unusual textures to the touch or brightly colored foliage and flowers and a small Scented Garden with plants that have fragrant flowers or leaves or flowers. • The Evening Garden displays a wide variety of plants that have foliage or flowers that are easily seen in the evening or bear flowers that are fragrant at night. Many of these plants have white flowers or variegated foliage• The Fragrance Garden contains plants that bear fragrant flowers or have leaves or even fruit that is fragrant. • The Ornamental Grass Garden contains grasses or grass-like plants in a variety of heights short and tall. Most are grown for the <b>ornamental</b> <b>foliage</b> while others bear striking inflorescences.• The Shade Garden demonstrates different plant specimens that can grow in shady and low light locations of a landscape.• The Subtropical Fruit Garden contains different subtropical and tropical fruit trees and plants that can be grown in Central Florida• The Urban Patio Garden is ideally suited to smaller urban spaces. It can help gardeners learn how to bring shape, form and color to a small area. • The Wildflower Garden demonstrates wildflower specimens that are excellent choices for the low maintenance home landscape. Many are drought tolerant and pest resistant. They offer color almost year round and are good for attracting butterflies, beneficial insects like bees, and sometimes hummingbirds. Most of the wildflowers displayed here are native to Central Florida, with some being annuals and some perennials. There are also native grasses, shrubs, and trees planted in this area.|$|E
