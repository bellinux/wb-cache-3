Built in travertine around 1100, the Romanesque building was once richly decorated in frescos, remains {{of which can be}} seen on the rear wall. It is no longer a functioning church. St Jørgensbjerg Church stands <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hill to the northwest of the old town, overlooking the fjord. With a nave and chancel in travertine dating from c. 1080, it is Denmark's oldest preserved stone building. It features a carved pulput from 1616.|$|E

25|$|Jourdan's {{left wing}} was {{in serious trouble}} because it had to retreat through Altenkirchen. This place was nearer to the archduke's Austrians {{than it was to}} the French left wing. Fortunately for Jourdan, Marceau and Bernadotte capably held off the Austrian advance guards long enough for the French left wing to barely get away. Meanwhile, Castelverd withdrew into Neuwied's {{bridgehead}} where his troops were secure behind prepared fortifications. On 19 September, as the last French columns were still filing through Altenkirchen, Jourdan ordered Marceau to hold <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> longer with Poncet's division.

25|$|I {{grew up on}} the Jersey Shore, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> barrier island. The Atlantic Ocean was on one side, the bay was on the other. Everyone there hunted {{and fished}} and clammed and got crabs out of the bay. And one day my brother told me someone had come down from the Bureau of Petty Harassment or {{something}} and they measured the temperature of the water and had decided it was a little too warm and a certain type of bacteria might incubate in it and there was a chance that might harm the clams. And so, from now on, no one was supposed to take clams out of the bay anymore. Which everyone ignored. And no one died. That was before the government got tenacious about this stuff. So I thought that was pretty stupid right there.|$|E

500|$|William Chamberlayne {{inherited}} the castle in 1826 {{and built a}} crenellated tower on the south-east end of the property the following year, inspired by a proposal by the antiquarian Horace Walpole that the castle be made habitable.

[...] Up until 1914, Victoria regularly visited her relatives abroad in both Germany and Russia, including her two sisters who had married into the Russian imperial family: Elisabeth, who had married Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, and Alix, who had married Emperor Nicholas II. Victoria was one of the Empress's relatives who tried to persuade her away from the influence of Rasputin. On the outbreak of war between Germany and Britain in 1914, Victoria and her daughter, Louise, were in Russia at Yekaterinburg. By train and steamer, they travelled to St Petersburg and from there through Tornio to Stockholm. They sailed from Bergen, Norway, on [...] "the last ship" [...] back to Britain.|$|E
500|$|As {{he waited}} for offers of {{employment}} through the summer and autumn of 1943, Larkin added more works to the Coleman oeuvre. He began a sequel to Trouble at Willow Gables, set in a women's college at Oxford and entitled Michaelmas Term at St Bride's, but did not finish it: [...] "All literary inspiration has deserted me", he informed Amis on 13 August. Nevertheless, a week later he told Amis that Brunette was helping him to write a novel, provisionally entitled Jill, about [...] "a young man who invents an imaginary sister, and {{falls in love with}} her". With this letter Larkin sent a Coleman poem, [...] "Bliss", the first of seven written in the girls' school idiom. [...] As late as 19 October he reported to Amis that [...] "Brunette is working <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> monograph about girls' school stories". This is a reference to the putative literary manifesto [...] "What Are We Writing For", which became the final Coleman work. Thereafter, Motion records, she disappeared, [...] "to be mentioned only fleetingly in later accounts of his university life... She ended up as an occasional comic reminder of lost youth".|$|E

I really {{wanted to write about}} that: the independence that's a little bit scary but also a really positive thing in a lot of ways. And I'm not sure that most kids have that today". Throughout the novel, Miranda and her friends often walk around town without any adults. They are even found working in a sandwich store at lunch and walking home from school while trying to avoid the laughing man. While writing the novel, Stead hoped to show her sons the time period in which she lived, [...] "send them <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> time-travel journey of their own". Laura Miller of The New Yorker found that this lack of independence in today's youth is mainly {{due to the fact that}} kids now grow up with adults constantly watching them. Miller noted how, despite the lower crime rate in current times, the [...] "characters, middle-class middle school students, routinely walk around the Upper West Side by themselves, a rare freedom in today's city." ...|$|E

500|$|By March 1873, Ellen was {{believed}} to be suffering from starvation. At first, she had largely subsisted on port, tea and milk, given three times per day. After about 15months—while her mother was attempting to administer arrowroot—Ellen's jaw locked closed. Subsequently, according to Hayman, she was fed [...] "wine, gruel and other things" [...] using the [...] "spout of a toy teapot inserted between two broken teeth". The Daily Telegraph journalist expanded on Ellen's feeding: [...] "The feeding implements stand <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> table {{by the side of the}} stump bedstead, and, at first sight, give you the idea that they are toys placed there to attract her attention should she, by a merciful termination of her trance, presently awake to life. The toys in question are two tiny 'teapots', each not much larger than a full-sized walnut and holding four small teaspoonfuls. One of these is filled with port wine, and the other with milk... this quantity of liquid nourishment... cannot weigh more than half an ounce..." [...] At this time, it was considered [...] "manifestly out of the question to think of moving her". How the family dealt with Ellen's passing of urine and faeces is unclear, but in 1880, Hayman said that Ann Frewen told him that no bowel movements had occurred for five years, and that approximately every four days [...] "a somewhat large amount would pass from the bladder".|$|E

To promote The Sweet Escape, Stefani was a mentor on the sixth season of American Idol and performed the song with Akon. The song earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals. Three more singles were released from the album; [...] "4 in the Morning", [...] "Now That You Got It" [...] which featured Damian Marley and [...] "Early Winter". To promote the album, Stefani embarked on a worldwide tour, The Sweet Escape Tour, which covered North America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific and part of Latin America. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly on June 6, 2011, Stefani stated {{that she had no}} plans to continue work as a solo artist, adding, [...] "That was a moment in time...

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 6, 1910. It states: [...] "Mr. Jenks {{and his family are}} spending the summer in a fashionable summer hotel, and Mr. Jenks is kept bored and busy performing the many services demanded by his wife. He hits upon the bright idea of sending himself a business telegram which would necessitate his immediate presence in the city, then starts out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> vacation on his own account. Walking on the beach he discovers a secluded spot, and leaving his clothes on the beach he takes a swim. In the meantime, a convict, who has escaped from a nearby penitentiary, has entered a house nearby in search of a change of clothes, his stripes being too conspicuous. The convict locks a woman of the house up and ransacks the house, but the only garments he can find are women's clothes, and, deciding that they are better than stripes, he dons them. As the convict in his new disguise is walking along the beach he sees Jenks' clothes lying there and promptly makes another change. There is nothing for Jenks to do when he comes out except to array himself as a woman. On {{his way back to the}} hotel he passes the house that has been robbed and is unlucky enough to hear the woman's cry for help. When she gets out of the closet, through his aid, she naturally believes that he is the convict, and screams for help. Jenks, frightened, runs away, but is captured after a chase in which the entire village takes part. His wife and daughter witness humiliation, and it's almost impossible for them to 'square things.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> food, but if we lose our freedom, we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} August 31, 2010, in Oxford, England, which included St Aldate's street {{and some of}} the University of Oxford's buildings, and lasted for two days. Production then moved to Pinewood Studios in Iver, and to Georgia in October, including Tybee Island, Thunderbolt and Savannah, after sites in Louisiana, North Carolina and West Michigan were considered. Jekyll Island was chosen over Tybee Island after a producer reviewed the locations on Google Earth and thought the water near Jekyll looked more blue. Palm trees were planted into the island's sand so that it would look more like a tropical beach, but the cold weather caused many of the palm trees to become brown or die only days into the shoot, necessitating significant digital color correction from the visual effects team. Additional location shooting took place in Russia. A section of the plot is set in the Argentine coastal city of Villa Gesell, but was filmed in another province of the country with no beach but with mountains instead. Wenders]]' Paris, Texas?

The Englefield House in Berkshire served as the X-Mansion, and had its interior decoration adapted to resemble the way the mansion looked in the previous films. Both the submarine and the X-Jet were built on hydraulic sets so that they could be rotated for the vehicles' movements. Principal photography ended in December, but additional filming, primarily in California at Los Angeles and Long Beach, continued into April 2011, leaving only three to four weeks for post-production before the film's scheduled premiere in June. The tight schedule to meet the release date led Vaughn to declare that he had [...] "never worked under such time pressure". The film cost approximately $160million to produce without tax breaks, with the eventual cost around $140million.|$|E
