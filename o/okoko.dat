The ko or kō (香) portion in these names literally means [...] "fragrant", and the term was used as a nyōbō kotoba or [...] "woman's word" [...] for miso in reference to the smell. Over time, this term was also applied to pickles, again for the smell. Oshinko (literally [...] "new fragrance" [...] in reference to relative freshness) more specifically referred to vegetables that had been only lightly pickled and that had not yet changed color that much. The term is now also used more broadly to refer to pickles in general.|$|E

The columns have been prepared {{as part of a}} basin analysis investigation undertaken by the Sedimentary and Petroleum Geology Research Group in the Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Waikato, and have been compiled into a common format from recent MSc and PhD theses to make the information more readily available, principally to assist hydrocarbon exploration activities in the region. The columns represent a level of detail underpinning a rationalized lithostratigraphy of the Te Kuiti Group presented in a companion report (Tripathi et al. 2008). This report contains two enclosures, one show in the location of columns in relation to the distribution of the two subgroups (<b>Okoko</b> Subgroup, Castle Craig Subgroup) of the Te Kuiti Group, and the other shows a series of north-south and west-east column correlation panels...|$|E
40|$|Paleogeography - Te kuiti group (Map 1 - 13) {{in print}} copyThe Late Eocene - Oligocene Te Kuiti Group crops out {{extensively}} in central-western North Island between Port Waikato and Awakino, providing a useful window for examination of a broadly transgressive shelfal to upper bathyal mixed carbonate-siliciclastic basin fill succession. The group accumulated during initiation of Cenozoic glaciations on Antarctica when {{there may have}} been associated eustatic changes in sea- level changes, and during the initiation of the Australia-Pacific plate boundary through the New Zealand region, which might also have caused relative changes in sea level in the Waikato Basin. As part of this study Te Kuiti lithostratigraphy in central-western North Island has been reviewed and rationalized. Special emphasis has been given to correlation of the significant stratigraphic discontinuities (erosional unconformities, depositional hiatuses) between units. Combined with a review of the foraminiferal biostratigraphy and new Sr isotope ages for the group, lithologically diverse formations have been able to be correlated across and along the outcrop belt. In the revised stratigraphic scheme, seven formations and 24 members of Kaiatian to Waitakian (Late Oligocene to Early Miocene) age are identified. The Te Kuiti Group is subdivided into two subgroups, a lower <b>Okoko</b> Subgroup, and an upper Castle Craig Subgroup. The <b>Okoko</b> Subgroup is dominated by calcareous siltstone and sandstone members, with limestone members commonly occurring at the base of formations, whereas the Castle Craig Subgroup is almost entirely comprised of limestone in the south and by calcareous siltstone in the northern parts of the basin. Six unconformity-bound sequences (TK 1 - TK 6) have been identified and mapped within the Te Kuiti Group using sequence stratigraphic principles. For several of these sequences (TK 2, TK 4, TK 5 TK 6) detailed facies and sequence analyses have been undertaken based on field characteristics, complemented with laboratory grain size and compositional (carbonate % and thin-section) data. The depositional paleoenvironments have been interpreted for these sequences, with the basin evolution for all sequences summarised in a series of 13 paleogeographic maps representing multiple horizons within the Te Kuiti Group. TK 1 strata are mostly terrestrial coal measures (Waikato Coal Measures) of Late Eocene to earliest Oligocene age that accumulated in paleovalleys concurrent with minor extensional faulting. The upper beds are marginal marine and consist primarily of estuarine and shallow shelf mudstone (Mangakotuku Formation). The Early Oligocene (lower Whaingaroan) Glen Massey Formation (TK 2) is entirely marine in origin, its lowermost member (Elgood Limestone Member) marking a significant marine flooding event across the basin with a landward shift in the position of stratal onlap. Whaingaroa Formation (TK 3) comprises predominantly siltstone with some limestone (Awaroa Limestone Member) at its base in the south, which reflects expansion of a southern shelf area. An extensive subaerial unconformity between Whaingaroa Formation (TK 3) and Aotea Formation (TK 4), combined with a basinward shift in the position of onlap for sequence TK 4, indicates a dramatic mid-upper Whaingaroan (c. 29 Ma) change in stratigraphic development and basin dynamics inferred to result from the start of reverse displacement on Taranaki Fault along the basin's western margin. Aotea Formation comprises lithologically diverse facies dominated by limestone (Waimai Limestone Member) in the north, calcareous sandstone (Hauturu Sandstone Member) in the southwest and muddy sandstone (Kihi Sandstone Member) in south-central and eastern areas. A condensed section in the upper parts of Aotea Formation, especially in the north, records relative deepening and reduction of clastic sediment supply into sediment-starved northern parts of the basin. A major erosional unconformity {{at the base of the}} Castle Craig Subgroup in the south and a depositional hiatus in the north reflects a second phase of inversion along the southwestern margin of the basin and reverse displacement on Manganui Fault at c. 27 Ma. The rocky shorelines that consequently formed along the eastern side of the Herangi High supported carbonate factories supplying reworked carbonate to the adjacent shelf (Orahiri Formation and Otorohanga Limestone). These formations pass northward into outer shelf-upper bathyal micritic limestone (Raglan Limestone Member) and calcareous siltstone (marl). Several additional phases of unconformity development are recorded in the Castle Craig Group, but these unconformities had limited extent in the basin, being mainly restricted to the area immediately west of the Herangi High. Early Miocene Waitemata Group strata unconformably overlie the Te Kuiti Group in the north, reflecting basin inversion and erosion driven from a developing subduction zone to the northeast, whereas early Miocene Mahoenui Group strata in southern parts of the basin are mostly conformable on the Te Kuiti Group, having accumulated in a piggy-back basin carried westward on underlying Taranaki and related faults. Tectonic movements and cycles of subsidence and subtle basin inversion driven by the alternate accumulation and release of strain on Taranaki and related fault are regarded as the primary control on relative sea-level changes within the Te Kuiti Group, which led to sequences TK 4 -TK 6. The accumulation of sequences TK 1 -TK 3 resulted from tectonic subsidence in the Waikato region as the zone of extension widened to the east of Taranaki Basin coupled with progressive landward shifts in the position of coastal onlap. Glacio-eustatic sea- level changes driven from glaciations in Antarctica are not regarded as having generated sea-level changes of sufficient magnitude to impact upon the dynamics of late Eocene and Oligocene sedimentation in the Waikato Basin when the Te Kuiti Group accumulated...|$|E
