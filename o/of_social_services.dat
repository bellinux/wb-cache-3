Suspecting child abuse, Bernhardt S. Kramer, the Commissioner of the Ulster County Department <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Services</b> initiated parental neglect proceedings and removed Tina Santosky from {{the custody of}} her parents, John and Annie Santosky, in November 1973. 10 months later, the Santoskys' second child, John II, was removed after he {{was found to be}} suffering from malnutrition.

30|$|As Mr. Wang points out, <b>social</b> <b>service</b> {{organizations}} are “getting {{on the right}} track” and “breaking in” when entering into the community. He repeatedly mentions the importance of boundaries for the development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> organizations. <b>Social</b> <b>service</b> organizations aim {{to benefit from the}} enabling of the government contracting-out service institutions. Such strategic activities of FISCs make the development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> organizations quite different from the growth <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> organizations in Western countries.|$|R
5|$|Agnes Mary Mansour (April 10, 1931 – December 17, 2004) was an American Roman Catholic nun who {{was given}} a choice from the Vatican in 1983 to end her {{religious}} vows or to resign from her position {{as the director of}} the Michigan Department <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Services</b> which required her to support and allocate public funding for abortions. The controversy involved her belief that abortion was tragic but should be legal, despite her vows as a religious and the teachings of the Catholic Church.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} sought {{primarily}} {{to determine whether}} attainment <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> goals was affected {{by the number of}} days between admission to home care and referral to medical social ser-vices. We also sought to determine if patient resi-dence in a rural or urban area, annual income, and the total number <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> goals affected attainment <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> goals. Using a random sample of 306 home care patients throughout Texas, we found that the length of time between admission to home care and <b>social</b> <b>service</b> referral and annual income did not {{have a significant effect on}} <b>social</b> <b>service</b> goal attain-ment. However, elders living in rural areas and those having a moderate number <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> goals had significantly more unattained <b>social</b> <b>service</b> goals. <b>Social</b> <b>service</b> implications are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Tubas {{has been}} {{governed by a}} {{municipal}} council since 1953, when it was granted permission {{to do so by}} Jordanian authorities who controlled the West Bank at the time.

5|$|After {{the general}} {{election}} in November 1982, the incoming Michigan governor, James Blanchard, appointed Mansour in December to the directorship of the Michigan Department <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Services</b> (DSS); Michigan's biggest agency. The administrative position involved oversight of public health programs including disbursement of some $5million in federal monies from Medicaid for abortions. To accept the appointment, she asked for and received permission from her order and from Szoka. Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition. Mansour did not follow his request. Though she personally disapproved of abortion, she knew that many others felt differently, and she determined that the poor should have equal access to abortion {{as long as it}} was legal.|$|E
5|$|Demobilisation also {{included}} establishing {{arrangements for the}} medical care of ex-service personnel. After the war responsibility for medical treatment was gradually transferred from the services to the Repatriation Commission. The Army's hospitals were also transferred to the Commission, meeting its immediate need for facilities. It proved necessary to build new hospitals {{for the treatment of}} tuberculosis and mental disorders, however as the specialised Army hospitals established for the treatment of these conditions were respectively unsatisfactory and had to be returned to the Government of New South Wales. The Department <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Services</b> was responsible for providing assistance to veterans with a disability not caused by their military service, and this led to the foundation of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service in 1955.|$|E

30|$|Therefore, the {{third-party}} government-partnership theory cannot {{explain the}} development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> organizations in China; neither {{can it be}} explained by the theoretical perspective of embedded development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> organizations. The premise of the third-party government theory is the existence of a relatively independent relationship between the state and society and the strong development of NPOs. Based on this premise, cross-boundary cooperation brought about by the government may lead to more efficient public service. When the theory is used to explain the development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> organizations in China, it is similar to direct adoption. The point of the embedded development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> work, as emphasized by Chinese scholars, has a comparatively strong functional structure, regardless of the dynamics of the development process or <b>of</b> <b>social</b> organization strategies. From the stand of society, the view that <b>social</b> <b>service</b> organizations are absorbed may only reflect one pattern of boundary production. However, determining how to reposition the boundary role <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>service</b> organizations is <b>of</b> great importance.|$|R
5|$|Philanthropy and {{charitable}} giving {{are part of}} the community. More than 40% of adults in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area give time to volunteer work, the highest such percentage of any large metropolitan area in the United States. Catholic Charities USA {{is one of the largest}} providers <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> locally. The American Refugee Committee helps 2.5 million refugees and displaced persons each year in Asili-Democratic Republic of Congo, Jordan, Myanmar, Pakistan, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, and Uganda. In 2011, Target Corporation was #42 in a list of the best 100 corporate citizens in CR magazine for corporate responsibility officers.

The metropolitan area gives 13% of its total charitable donations to the arts and culture. The majority of the estimated $1 billion recent expansion of arts facilities was contributed privately.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Powers, the Wizard <b>of</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Services,</b> {{is about}} to retire and takes his {{apprentice}} to Mount Magic to complete the initiation ceremony. For a wizard to retire, they must hatch their apprentice from an egg and train them for fifty years. However, Leonard abandoned his apprentice, the Harry Potter-like Lionel, in Chinatown and did not contact him until the ceremony. Later, it is revealed that to become a wizard, the apprentices must be circumcised. Meanwhile, the demons—the wizard's enemies—are ready to attack Mount Magic, but a force field is keeping them out. Since Leonard still needs to sign his retirement forms, demons Twayne Boneraper and Callie Maggotbone decide to use Mark Lilly to lead them to Leonard. To get Mark to come along, they elect him as the camp leader for a summer camp (originally a mining camp) that they build nearby. Mark brings his students from the Department of Integration to the camp, and the devil, Aldermach, brings several demons to act like the camp's visitors. The department's police officer, Frank Grimes, also comes along, but runs away to live with bears as he thinks the camp is infested by vermin. Mark's students and his roommate, the zombie Randall, begin to mine in an old silver mine. However, they get trapped inside, but Doug the koala begins to dig them out.|$|E
5|$|The Diocese of Miami {{was created}} on October 7, 1958, with Coleman Carroll {{installed}} as bishop. The diocese included the 16 southern counties in Florida, with a Catholic population of 200,000. It encompassed {{one half of}} the area of the state. Less than a year after the creation of the diocese, Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba. This set off a mass exodus of Cuban exiles to South Florida, increasing church membership in the region. The Catholic Welfare Bureau, created by Carroll, played a significant part in helping these waves of Cuban immigrants. Between 1960 and 1962, 14,000 Cuban children were sent to the United States. Operation Pedro Pan, created by Monsignor Bryan O. Walsh, placed them with friends, relatives or the Catholic Welfare Bureau. In 1996, the Catholic Welfare Bureau changed its name to Catholic Charities. Today it claims to be the largest non-governmental provider <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>services</b> in South Florida. It served over 17,000 families in the tri-county area of Broward, Dade and Monroe counties in 2006.|$|E
