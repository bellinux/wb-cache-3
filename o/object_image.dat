25|$|Additionally, to {{rationalize}} sensory dominance, Gori et al. (2008) advocates {{that the brain}} utilises the most direct source of information during sensory immaturity. In this case, orientation is primarily a visual characteristic. It can be derived directly from the <b>object</b> <b>image</b> that forms on the retina, irrespective of other visual factors. In fact, data shows that a functional property of neurons within primate visual cortices' are their discernment to orientation. In contrast, haptic orientation judgements are recovered through collaborated patterned stimulations, evidently an indirect source susceptible to interference. Likewise, when size is concerned haptic information coming from positions of the fingers is more immediate. Visual-size perceptions, alternatively, have to be computed using parameters such as slant and distance. Considering this, sensory dominance is a useful instinct to assist with calibration. During sensory immaturity, the more simple and robust information source {{could be used to}} tweak the accuracy of the alternate source. Follow-up work by Gori et al. (2012) showed that, at all ages, vision-size perceptions are near perfect when viewing objects within the haptic workspace (i.e. at arm's reach). However, systematic errors in perception appeared when the object was positioned beyond this zone. Children younger than 14 years tend to underestimate object size, whereas adults overestimated. However, if the object was returned to the haptic workspace, those visual biases disappeared. These results support the hypothesis that haptic information may educate visual perceptions. If sources are used for cross-calibration they cannot, therefore, be combined (integrated). Maintaining access to individual estimates is a trade-off for extra plasticity over accuracy, which could be beneficial in retrospect to the developing body.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} new co-clustering problem {{of images and}} visual features. The problem {{involves}} a set of non-object images {{in addition to a}} set of <b>object</b> <b>images</b> and features to be co-clustered. Co-clustering is performed in a way that maximises discrimination of <b>object</b> <b>images</b> from non-object images, thus emphasizing discriminative features. This provides a way of obtaining perceptual joint-clusters of <b>object</b> <b>images</b> and features. We tackle the problem by simultaneously boosting multiple strong classifiers which compete for images by their expertise. Each boosting classifier is an aggregation of weak-learners, i. e. simple visual features. The obtained classifiers are useful for object detection tasks which exhibit multimodalities, e. g. multi-category and multi-view object detection tasks. Experiments on a set of pedestrian images and a face data set demonstrate that the method yields intuitive image clusters with associated features and is much superior to conventional boosting classifiers in object detection tasks. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{compound}} microscope uses a lens {{close to the}} object being viewed to collect light (called the objective lens) which focuses a real image of the object inside the microscope (image 1).

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design a Content and Tag Based Image Retrieval System using Automatic Image Annotation that will help in organizing a large database of images. We propose to build a system that will detect <b>objects</b> from <b>images</b> and retrieve images containing the similar objects from database and organize those images by attaching tags, thus keeping them organized for ease of access. The proposed system involves Content Based Image Retrieval with interpretation of objects using different features. The proposed system will first extract features from image and compare those features with the existing set of <b>object</b> <b>images,</b> so as to detect what objects are present in the image, thus finding out all the tags related to the image. Then the user will be asked to verify the tags attached and also to add more tags if required. Then the image will be saved to database with appropriate tags. The saved dataset <b>object</b> <b>images</b> will get updated time to time by removing the <b>object</b> <b>images</b> which are found inappropriate using a accept to reject ratio calculated based on the user feedback. The proposed system will consist of an image input or a text query which will be used to find the similar images from the user's database. User can add new annotations which will be added to the database for future use...|$|R

50|$|Digitization, less {{commonly}} digitalization is {{the process}} of converting information into a digital (i.e. computer-readable) format, in which the information is organized into bits. The result is the representation of an <b>object,</b> <b>image,</b> sound, document or signal (usually an analog signal) by generating a series of numbers that describe a discrete set of its points or samples. The result is called digital representation or, more specifically, a digital image, for the object, and digital form, for the signal. In modern practice, the digitized data {{is in the form of}} binary numbers, which facilitate computer processing and other operations, but, strictly speaking, digitizing simply means the conversion of analog source material into a numerical format; the decimal or any other number system that can be used instead.|$|E
50|$|Digital Holographic Microscopy (DHM) is digital {{holography}} {{applied to}} microscopy. Digital holographic microscopy distinguishes itself from other microscopy methods by not recording the projected {{image of the}} object. Instead, the light wave front information originating from the object is digitally recorded as a hologram, from which a computer calculates the <b>object</b> <b>image</b> by using a numerical reconstruction algorithm. The image forming lens in traditional microscopy is thus replaced by a computer algorithm.Other closely related microscopy methods to digital holographic microscopy are interferometric microscopy, optical coherence tomography and diffraction phase microscopy. Common to all methods {{is the use of}} a reference wave front to obtain amplitude (intensity) and phase information. The information is recorded on a digital image sensor or by a photo detector from which an image of the object is created (reconstructed) by a computer. In traditional microscopy, which do not use a reference wave front, only intensity information is recorded and essential information about the object is lost.|$|E
5000|$|Box {{counting}} is {{a method}} of gathering data for analyzing complex patterns by breaking a dataset, <b>object,</b> <b>image,</b> etc. into smaller and smaller pieces, typically [...] "box"-shaped, and analyzing the pieces at each smaller scale. The essence of {{the process has been}} compared to zooming in or out using optical or computer based methods to examine how observations of detail change with scale. In box counting, however, rather than changing the magnification or resolution of a lens, the investigator changes the size of the element used to inspect the object or pattern (see Figure 1). Computer based box counting algorithms have been applied to patterns in 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional spaces. The technique is usually implemented in software for use on patterns extracted from digital media, although the fundamental method can be used to investigate some patterns physically. The technique arose out of and is used in fractal analysis. It also has application in related fields such as lacunarity and multifractal analysis.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{recognizing}} <b>objects</b> <b>imaged</b> in complex real-world scenes is examined from a parametric perspective using {{the theory of}} statistical estimation. A scalar measure of an object's complexity, which is invariant under affine transformation and changes in image noise level, is extracted from the object's Fisher information. The volume of Fisher information is shown to provide an overall statistical measure of the object's recognizability in a particular image, while the complexity provides an intrinsically physical measure that characterizes the <b>object</b> in any <b>image.</b> An information-conserving method is then developed for recognizing an <b>object</b> <b>imaged</b> in a complex scene.
