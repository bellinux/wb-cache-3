5|$|Some relics, such as purported {{remnants}} of the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Thorns,</b> receive only a modest number of pilgrims, while the Shroud of Turin (which is associated with an approved Catholic devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus), has received millions, including popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.|$|E
5|$|The two upper {{register}} wings {{on either}} side of Jesus show a pair of angels holding the instruments of the Passion. These include a lance, crown <b>of</b> <b>thorns</b> and a stick with a sponge soaked in vinegar. The angels are dressed in white liturgical vestments.|$|E
5|$|Among those {{collections}} {{kept away}} from public view are the numerous blood-soaked garments from Jesuits martyred in Japan, the skull of Cardinal Morton, the ropes used to quarter St Edmund Campion SJ, the hairs of St Francis Xavier SJ, an enormous solid silver jewel-encrusted monstrance, the Wintour vestments, a cope made for Henry VII, and a thorn said {{to be from the}} crown <b>of</b> <b>thorns</b> placed upon Jesus' head at the crucifixion.|$|E

5|$|In {{the medieval}} period some {{religious}} institutions displayed ancient Greek coins {{of the island}} of Rhodes as specimens of the Thirty Pieces of Silver. The obverses of these coins showed a facing head of the sun god Helios, with rays projecting around {{the upper part of}} it. These rays were interpreted as a representation of the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Thorns.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Last Judgement was an {{especially}} appropriate subject for setting a relic from the Crown <b>of</b> <b>Thorns.</b> Some {{thought that the}} crown was held by the French kings on loan, and would be reclaimed by Christ on the Day of Judgement—a belief expressed in the antiphon sung at Sens Cathedral in 1239 to celebrate {{the arrival of the}} main relic.|$|E
5|$|When Rotting {{first came}} out it stirred {{a huge amount of}} {{controversy}} due to its cover art— a traditional grim reaper figure licking what appears to be Jesus Christ's face. It was based upon a medieval painting. The cover artist himself, Kelson Frost, refused to paint a crown <b>of</b> <b>thorns</b> over the man's head, which would readily identify him as the Christian messiah.|$|E
40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>thorn</b> graphs {{proposed}} {{recently by}} Gutman is {{extended to the}} broader concept of generalized thorny graphs.

50|$|The topynomy of {{the village}} name {{is derived from the}} {{combination}} of the Old English words <b>of</b> <b>þorn</b> and tūn, which gave the meaning <b>of</b> <b>Thorn</b> tree farm, and partly from St. Restitutus, the patron saint of the medieval chapel erected here. The chapel no longer exists.|$|R

5|$|Heralds {{could have}} {{attributed}} to Jesus the harp for arms inherited as {{a descendant of}} David. Nevertheless, the cross was regarded as Christ's emblem, {{and it was so}} used by the Crusaders. Sometimes the arms of Christ feature a Paschal lamb as the principal charge. By the 13th century, however, numerous indulgences had brought increased veneration for the instruments of the Passion. These instruments were described in heraldic terms and treated as personal to Christ much as a coat of arms (Dennys, 96). An early example in a seal from c. 1240 includes the Cross, nails, lance, crown <b>of</b> <b>thorns,</b> sponge and whips.|$|E
5|$|Madonna's {{performance}} of the song during the 2006 Confessions Tour was controversial. She was raised from the floor hanging on a mirrored cross wearing a red blouse and velvet pants, with a crown <b>of</b> <b>thorns</b> on her head. During the performance, the number 12million flashed above her on the stage's backdrop screens, along with images of African children. This was intended to detail the estimated {{number of children who}} have been orphaned by the AIDS pandemic in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Reddish {{paintings}} on wooden panels commissioned by Father Antonio Ubeda from 1856 to 1859 {{can be found}} inside the church. These are the Ascension of Our Lord and Pentecost on the doorway; and two portraits of the Doctors of the Church. A third portrait belonging to the set of Doctors of the Church is on the church museum while the fourth portrait is lost. The paintings Agony in the Garden and Crowning <b>of</b> <b>Thorns,</b> also commissioned by Father Úbeda, is currently housed at the San Agustin Museum in Intramuros, Manila.

During a {{religious}} conflict between Protestant townsfolk represented by mayor Johann Gottfried Rösner, and the Roman Catholic {{students of the}} Jesuit college in the city <b>of</b> <b>Thorn</b> (Toruń) in Royal Prussia, the college had been vandalised by a crowd of German Protestants. The mayor and nine other Lutheran officials were blamed for neglect of duty, sentenced to death, and executed on 7 December 1724.|$|R

5|$|Headed by Saint Peter, the Apostles {{are dressed}} in white robes and sit on two facing benches set below Christ {{and to the right}} and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups {{gathered}} at each side of the benches. A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They hold his cross and {{are dressed in}} white amice and albs, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue dalmatic vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets. The two angels on either side of Christ bear the symbols of the crucifixion already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and crown <b>of</b> <b>thorns,</b> the angel on the right a sponge and nails.|$|E
5|$|Prey of cnidarians {{ranges from}} {{plankton}} to animals several {{times larger than}} themselves. Some cnidarians are parasites, mainly on jellyfish but a few are major pests of fish. Others obtain most of their nourishment from endosymbiotic algae or dissolved nutrients. Predators of cnidarians include: sea slugs, which can incorporate nematocysts into their own bodies for self-defense; starfish, notably the crown <b>of</b> <b>thorns</b> starfish, which can devastate corals; butterfly fish and parrot fish, which eat corals; and marine turtles, which eat jellyfish. Some sea anemones and jellyfish have a symbiotic relationship with some fish; for example clown fish live among the tentacles of sea anemones, and each partner protects the other against predators.|$|E

5|$|The thornback {{guitarfish}} was scientifically {{described by}} American ichthyologists David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in an 1880 {{issue of the}} scientific journal Proceedings of the United States National Museum. They assigned it to the genus Platyrhina, and named it triseriata from the Latin tres ("three") and series ("row"), {{in reference to the}} three rows <b>of</b> <b>thorns</b> on its back. One year later in the same journal, Samuel Garman placed this species in a newly created genus, Platyrhinoidis. The type specimen is an adult male caught off Santa Barbara on February 8, 1880. Other common names for this species include banjo shark (not {{to be confused with the}} Australian banjo sharks, Trygonorrhina), California thornback, guitarfish, round skate, shovelnose, thornback, and thornback ray.|$|E
5|$|King Louis IX of France bought what he {{believed}} to be the authentic Crown <b>of</b> <b>Thorns</b> in Constantinople in 1239, and individual thorns were distributed as gifts by subsequent French kings. John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416), brother of King Charles V of France, had this reliquary made to house a single thorn; it was probably made a few years before he commissioned his famous Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, and some years after he commissioned the Royal Gold Cup, also in the British Museum. Previously dated between 1401 and 1410, from evidence in John Cherry's book of 2010 the reliquary is now thought to have been made before 1397; based on the heraldic forms used, the museum now dates it to 1390–97. The Holy Thorn Reliquary was later thought to have been in the possession of Louis I, Duke of Orléans, but all recent writers prefer his brother, the Duke of Berry.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette's lineage {{was likely}} {{one of the}} oldest and most {{distinguished}} in Auvergne and, perhaps, in all of France. Males of the Lafayette family enjoyed a reputation for courage and chivalry and were noted for their contempt for danger. One of Lafayette's early ancestors, Gilbert de Lafayette III, a Marshal of France, had been a companion-at-arms of Joan of Arc's army during the Siege of Orléans in 1429. According to legend, another ancestor acquired the crown <b>of</b> <b>thorns</b> during the Sixth Crusade. His non-Lafayette ancestors are also notable; his great-grandfather (his mother's maternal grandfather) was the Comte de La Rivière, until his death in 1770 commander of the Mousquetaires du Roi, or Black Musketeers, King Louis XV's personal horse guard. Lafayette's paternal uncle Jacques-Roch died on 18 January 1734 while fighting the Austrians at Milan in the War of the Polish Succession; upon his death, the title of marquis passed to his brother Michel.|$|E
