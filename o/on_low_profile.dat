Up to late 1907, rounded stub hammers were used, but Colt, with {{the interest of the}} military and apparently the public now set <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> spur hammers (due to that requirement on the Model 1907 US test pistols, these being modified Model 1905s with grip safeties), started phasing in low profile spur hammers on all their exposed hammer automatics that they were continuing in production: the 1903 Pocket Hammer Model, the 1902 Military Model, and the 1905 Model [...]45 ACP. Therefore, the rounded hammer Colt 1903 Pocket Hammers can help date those pistols at a glance to 1903-1907.|$|E

The Dodges are the Time Keeper's cop cars. These too have been smoothed and externally customized, with grilles front and rear covering the lights, and low profile tires on disc wheels. In stark contrast to the Lincolns, paintwork is matte black. A slim police light-bar is fitted internally, behind the windshield. Externally this fleet looked immaculate but no money was spent on what would not be seen and many of the vehicles had wrecked interiors, with ripped seats, carpets and head-linings. Because the cars had been assembled from many sources and prepared to look identical, the interiors of most were of a color which did not match the black exteriors. The best of the Lincoln Continentals, for instance, whose interior is seen in the production, is trimmed out in blue.|$|E

These topologies may be implemented on top of several middleware specifications as a means for managing distributed resources and service redundancy of CPS at run-time...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{analyses}} {{the results}} of a detailed experimental study <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> vortex generators used to control the turbulent boundary layer separation on a large-scale flat plate with a prescribed adverse pressure gradient, typical of aggressive turbine intermediate ducts. This activity is part of a joint European research program on Aggressive Intermediate Duct Aerodynamics (AIDA). Laser Doppler Velocimetry and a Kiel total pressure probe have been employed to perform measurements in the test section symmetry plane and in cross-stream planes to investigate the turbulent boundary layer, with and without control device application. Velocity fields, Reynolds stresses, and total pressure distributions are analysed and compared for the controlled and non controlled flow conditions to characterize the mean flow behaviour. The detail and the accuracy of the measurements allow the evaluation of the deformation works of the mean motion in the test section symmetry plane. Normal and shear contributions of viscous and turbulent deformation works have been analysed and employed to explain the distribution of the total pressure loss. For the controlled flow the discussion of the flow field is extended considering the effects of the vortex generated in the cross-stream planes. The experimental data allow the evaluation of the global amount of losses, considering a balance of total pressure fluxes in the different measuring planes...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of a {{detailed}} experimental study <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> vortex generators (VGs) used to control boundary layer separation on a large-scale flat plate with prescribed adverse pressure gradients. This activity is part of a joint European research program on Aggressive Intermediate Duct Aerodynamics. The inlet turbulent boundary layer and the pressure gradient over the flat plate are representative of aggressive turbine intermediate ducts. By regulating the inclination of the wall opposite to the flat plate, different pressure gradients, typical of turbine intermediate ducts, can be obtained. To avoid separation on the movable wall, boundary layer suction is applied. Previous measurements showed the effectiveness of VGs in delaying separation and revealed their optimum configuration for the different prescribed pressure gradients. In the present work, laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) is applied to the most significant pressure gradient case, in order to obtain a more thorough knowledge of the near-wall flow field. Velocity and turbulence profiles are determined up to the near-wall region in order to provide an in-depth analysis of turbulent boundary layer at separation conditions, with and without application of control devices. LDV allowed high spatial resolution and accurate statistical analysis of the boundary layer velocities. The results show velocity and turbulence profiles typical of separated turbulent boundary layers for the baseline case, and non-conventional unseparated boundary layer profiles when VGs are installed on the flat plate...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} was performed {{during the summer}} and autumn in 1984. The purpose was to investigate factors <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> implement tyres affecting the coefficient of rolling resistance. The following factors were studied: - inflation pressure - width - diameter - construction - ply rating - aspect ratio - tread pattern Tests wars performed on concrete, harrowed fields, ploughed fields and stubble. Important factors when reducing the CRR when driving on concrete are: - increase the diameter and width - higher ply rating - decrease in aspect ratio - less aggressive tread pattern - choice of particular constructions (Garden Tractor or Steel Belt). The most important factor in reducing rolling resistance on soft ground is to ensure that the tyre size is adequate to carry the vertical load at as low inflation pressure as possible. A big soft tyre with low inflation pressure giving no or little sinkage is desirable. Choice of aggressive tread patterns will lead to an increase in rolling resistance because of the energy losses produced by the high compaction under the lugs. The relation between diameter and width must be large enough to ensure no or a minimum of bulldozing resistance. Reducing rolling resistance will lead to a number of advantages. The low inflation pressures will cause a decrease in soil compaction, and there will be an increase in yields. Lower railing resistance will also result in savings in fuel and time...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{tendency in}} modern aeroengine gas turbines towards reduction of blade count and ducts length {{may lead to}} aerodynamic loading increase beyond the limit of boundary layer separation. For this reason boundary layer separation control methods, up to now mostly employed in external aerodynamics, begin to be experimented in internal flows applications. The present paper reports {{the results of a}} detailed experimental study <b>on</b> <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> vortex generators used to control boundary layer separation on a large-scale flat plate with prescribed adverse pressure gradients. Inlet turbulent boundary layer conditions and pressure gradients are representative of aggressive turbine intermediate ducts. This activity is part of a joint European research program on Aggressive Intermediate Duct Aerodynamics (AIDA). The pressure gradients on the flat plate are generated by increasing the aperture angle of a movable wall opposite to the flat plate. To avoid separation on the movable wall, boundary layer suction is applied on it. Complementary measurements (surface static pressure distributions, surface flow visualizations by means of wall mounted tufts, instantaneous and time-averaged velocity fields in the meridional and cross-stream planes by means of Particle Image Velocimetry) have been used to survey the flow with and without vortex generators. Three different pressure gradients, which induce turbulent separation in absence of boundary layer control, were tested. Vortex generators height and location effects on separation reduction and pressure recovery increase were investigated. For the most effective VGs configurations detailed analyses of the flow field were performed, that demonstrate the effectiveness of this passive control device to control separation in diffusing ducts. Particle Image Velocimetry vector and vorticity plots illustrate the mechanisms by which the vortex generators transfer momentum towards the surface, re-energizing the near-wall flow and preserving the boundary layer from separation...|$|E

40|$|Voluntary wheel {{running of}} mice {{has been used}} as a measure of {{physical}} activity in a multitude of studies. The aim of this study was to validate <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> wireless running wheels (Med Associates Inc.) against solid-surface, traditionally-mounted vertical running wheels. All animal procedures were approved by the Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M IACUC. Eleven week old female C 57 BL/ 6 J mice (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) were randomly assigned to either vertical running wheels (n= 5) or <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> running wheels (n= 5). Daily distance run was monitored for 12 days following initial wheel orientation exposure. Average daily distance run by the mice was not different (p= 0. 37) between the two types of wheels, with the mice on vertical wheels averaging 6. 74 (± 1. 74 km/day; average ±SD) versus 8. 58 (± 1. 87 km/day) <b>on</b> the <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> wheels. The distance run by the mice <b>on</b> the <b>low</b> <b>profile</b> wheels was also compared to the distance the same mice ran on the vertical wheels (8. 6 ± 1. 04 km/day; p= 0. 96). Thus data collected on the low-profile wheels was similar to the vertical running wheels not only among two age and sex-matched groups of mice, but also when the same group of mice ran on the two wheel types. However, on the low-profile wheels, the inability to measure duration of wheel running due to software limitations of the data-collection bin size eliminates the calculation of running speed, both of which are important phenotypes of physical activity. Additionally, there were also numerous observations of the mice coasting on the low-profile wheels, an issue not present on the traditional, solid-surface wheels. The presence of coasting would inflate distance measures over true measures of activity and may have been responsible for the non-significant elevation of distance on the low-profile wheels. Thus, if accurate measures of distance or measurement of duration and speed are not required, the low-profile wheel is a valid methodology...|$|R
