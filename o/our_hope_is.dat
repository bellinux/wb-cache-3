500|$|In November 2011, it was {{revealed}} on Tegan and Sara Quinn's official website that they were writing new material for their seventh studio album: [...] " [...] are back in our home studios working away at more songs. We’re {{really looking forward to}} making a new record now. <b>Our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> to be in the studio by early 2012." [...] "I'm Not Your Hero" [...] was written for the album, which was later named Heartthrob and recorded between February and May 2012. Sara, who wrote the lyrics, said the song was based on her life as a teenager when she was unable to identify with the lives of pop culture figures and had unforeseen thoughts about her future. She claimed the lyrics were about her political views from watching The West Wing, her identity and her sexuality. Tegan stated that when Sara showed the song to her and the producers, it was initially more of a love song and much more acoustic and slow than the final mix that would be released, and said she [...] "was haunted by it almost immediately. I found the verses to be quintessential Sara." ...|$|E

Carleton issued a statement asserting that the school's [...] "emphasis is not on sending students specifically to elite graduate schools. Carleton is a top-notch liberal arts college first and foremost, not a pre-professional school. <b>Our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> that any Carleton graduate who goes on to graduate school finds the program {{that is the best}} fit for him or her." ...|$|E

Archbishop Robert Duncan was present at the Global South Fourth Encounter that took place in Singapore, from 19 to 23 April 2010, where he presided at the Eucharist and met primates and representatives from 20 Anglican provinces. The Global South Encounter final statement declared: [...] "We are grateful that the recently formed Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) is a faithful expression of Anglicanism. We welcomed them as partners in the Gospel and <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> that all provinces will be in full communion with the clergy and people of the ACNA and the Communion Partners." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of many {{quotations}} in the Little Red Book (Mao's Quotations) {{that the}} Red Guards would later follow as a guide, provided by Mao, was [...] "The world is yours, {{as well as}} ours, {{but in the last}} analysis, it is yours. You young people, full of vigor and vitality, are in the bloom of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. <b>Our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> placed on you ... The world belongs to you. China's future belongs to you." [...] 350million copies of the book had been printed by December 1967. [...] It was the mechanism that led the Red Guards to commit to their objective as the future for China. These quotes directly from Mao led to other actions by the Red Guards in the views of other Maoist leaders.|$|E
2500|$|The Occupy Central with Love and Peace {{movement}} who {{had vowed}} to launched a massive civil obedience occupation {{at the city}} centre of Central, Hong Kong if the constitutional reform proposals did not reach the international standard of free and fair election slammed Beijing's decision as a move that stifles democracy and blocks people with different political views from running for office. [...] "Genuine universal suffrage includes both the rights to elect and to be elected," [...] its statement said. [...] "The decision of the NPC Standing Committee has deprived people with different political views {{of the right to}} run for election and be elected by imposing unreasonable restrictions, thereby perpetuating 'handpicked politics.'" [...] It said it would go on with their Occupy Central plan in the rally where several thousand people turned out opposing Beijing's plan on 31 August night. Occupy Central co-founder Benny Tai told the crowd, [...] "our hope is that people gathered here will be dauntless civil resisters.

For this we have reason to be thankful; and the appearance of affairs in that quarter is hopeful, but <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> mingled with anxiety, because mankind is terribly prone to go to sleep on hopeful appearances. Our nature is such, that our only chance of success lies, under God, in resolving ceaselessly to energise until our ends be accomplished.

60|$|Madame de Bourke, very white, {{but quite}} calm, insisted on silence and then said, 'I {{do not think}} the danger is very great to {{ourselves}} if you will keep silence and not attract attention. But <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> in Heaven. My brother, will you lead our prayers? Recite our office.' Obediently the Abbe fell on his knees, and his example was followed by the others. His voice went monotonously on throughout with the Latin. The lady, no doubt, followed in her heart, and she made the responses as did the others, fitfully; but her hands and eyes were busy, looking to the priming of two small pistols, which she took out of her jewel case, and the sight of which provoked fresh shrieks from the maids. Mademoiselle Julienne meantime was dressing Ulysse, and standing guard over him, Estelle watching all with eager bright eyes, scarcely frightened, but burning to ask questions, from which her uncle's prayers debarred her.|$|E

[...] She is now, we may safely trust, a blessed saint in Heaven, far removed from all cares and anxieties; and, instead of spending our time in useless tears and wicked repinings, we should rather learn to imitate her example and virtues, that, when we die, we may sleep in Him as <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> this our sister doth, and may be finally united with her in Heaven.

60|$|In {{this war}} {{there is no}} {{combination}} of souls to resist Satan, nor can any human powers in any way assist us in the trying battle. Here, O my reader, you and I must stand alone far from the aid of our fellow-men. We must call upon all the resources of our minds, and while there is unity within, no resisting or treason--while the Holy Spirit strengthens and inclines the will, the understanding, the conscience, the affections, and all our powers are united to resist Satan, God fights for us, and the heart is safe under the gracious smiles of our Emmanuel. May we never forget that our spiritual life is totally dependent upon him, in whom, as to the body, we live, and move, and have our being. But when doubts enfeeble us, and Bloodmen harass us, there is no help from man. No pope, cardinal, archbishop, minister, or any human power can aid us; ALL <b>our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is</b> in God alone; every effort for deliverance must be by fervent prayer and supplication, from the heart and conscience, directly to God. Our petitions must be framed by the Holy Ghost, and presented unto Shaddai, not by priest or prelate, but by our Emmanuel, Jesus Christ, the only intercessor and mediator.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Our</b> <b>hope</b> <b>is,</b> {{that the}} Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy; that because He is man, {{as well as}} God, He can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; that He knoweth our frame, He remembereth {{of what we are}} made: else the spirit would fail before Him, and the souls which He has made. So we can have hope, that, though Christ rebuke us, He will yet hear us, if our prayers are reasonable, and {{therefore}} according to His will. And surely, surely, surely, if our prayers are for the improvement of any human being; if we are praying that we, or any human being, may be made better men and truer Christians at last, and saved from the temptations of the world, the flesh, and the devil--oh then, then shall we not be heard? The Lord may keep us long waiting, as He kept St Monica of old, when she wept over St Augustine's youthful sins and follies. But He may answer us, as He answered her by the good bishop--"Be of good cheer. It is impossible that the son of so many prayers should perish." [...] And so, though He may shame us, in our inmost heart, by the rebuke--"Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe"--He will in the same breath grant our prayer, undeserved though His condescension be, and say--"Go in peace, thy son liveth." ...|$|E
60|$|Having run {{round the}} whole {{circle of the}} European system, {{wherever}} it acts, I must affirm that all the foreign powers who are not leagued with France for the utter destruction of all balance through Europe and throughout the world demand other assurances from this kingdom than are given in that Declaration. They require assurances, not of the sincerity of our good dispositions towards the usurpation in France, but of our affection towards the college of the ancient states of Europe, and pledges of our constancy, our fidelity, and of our fortitude in resisting to the last the power that menaces them all. The apprehension from which they wish to be delivered cannot be from anything they dread in the ambition of England. Our power must be their strength. They hope more from us than they fear. I am sure the only ground of their hope, and of <b>our</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>is</b> in the greatness of mind hitherto shown {{by the people of}} this nation, and its adherence to the unalterable principles of its ancient policy, whatever government may finally prevail in France.
