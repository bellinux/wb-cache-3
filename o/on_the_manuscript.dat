The promptbook is one of only two known surviving promptbooks created by John Wilkes Booth, and uses the Colley Cibber adaptation of Shakespeare's text. The full book with the actor's handwritten notations has been digitized. The other promptbook is also for Richard III, and can be found in the Harvard Theatre Collection.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{said that}} the angel {{returned}} the plates to him in September, 1828. In April 1829, he met Oliver Cowdery, who replaced Harris as his scribe, and resumed dictation. They worked full time <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> between April and early June 1829, and then moved to Fayette, New York, where they continued {{to work at the}} home of Cowdery's friend, Peter Whitmer. When the narrative described an institutional church and a requirement for baptism, Smith and Cowdery baptized each other. Dictation was completed around July 1, 1829.|$|E

5|$|When {{he moved}} to Salisbury, Allen met Thomas Young, a doctor living and {{practicing}} just across the provincial boundary in New York. The doctor, only five years older than Allen, taught the younger Allen {{a great deal about}} philosophy and political theory, while Allen was able to bring to Young his appreciation of nature and life on the frontier. Young and Allen eventually decided to collaborate on a book intended to be an attack on organized religion, as Young had convinced Allen to become a Deist. They worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> until 1764, when Young moved away from the area, taking the manuscript with him.|$|E
5|$|During World War II Fleming had {{mentioned}} to friends {{that he wanted}} to write a spy novel, {{but it was not until}} 17 February 1952 that he began to write his first novel, Casino Royale. He started writing his book at his Jamaican home Goldeneye, typing out 2,000 words in the morning, directly from his own experiences and imagination; he finished work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> in just over two months, completing it on 18 March 1952. Publishers Jonathan Cape were initially reluctant to publish the book, but were persuaded by Fleming's brother Peter (1907–1971), who had previously published material through them. On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s, 6d, with a cover that had been devised by Fleming himself. The first edition of 4,728 copies of Casino Royale sold out in less than a month; a second print run the same month also sold out, as did a third run of more than 8,000 books published in May 1954. At the time, Fleming was the Foreign Manager for Kemsley Newspapers, an organisation which owned The Sunday Times. Upon accepting the job, Fleming requested that he be allowed three months holiday per year, which allowed him the freedom to write.|$|E

5|$|George {{returns to}} Paris and learns from Andre Lobineau, a {{colleague}} of Nicole's, that Montfauçon is a location in Paris. Flap and Guido attempt to steal the tripod from the museum; but they are beaten to the theft by Nicole, who gives the artifact to George. In the sewers of Montfauçon, George spies on a secret meeting of people who {{claim to be the}} Templars, and he learns of their plan to find the Sword of Baphomet. After the group leaves, George uses the tripod and gem in the underground chamber to reveal the name of a village in Syria: Marib. He travels to the village and discovers that Khan has been looking for him. At a nearby rock formation called the Bull's Head, George finds a lens and deduces that it is represented <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> as a crystal ball. He also discovers an idol with three bearded faces, Baphomet; and a Latin inscription that describes Britain. Khan arrives and holds George at gunpoint, but George manages to escape.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{draft of}} the play was entitled simply Anon: A Play. Barrie's working titles for it included The Great White Father and Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Hated Mothers.

25|$|As 1923 {{turned into}} 1924, Sibelius was distracted {{from his work}} on the symphony by a number of outside events: the award of a large cash prize from a Helsinki foundation, family birthdays and the {{composition}} of a number of brief piano works.

25|$|Work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> began around 1380 or 1390, {{and over}} the course of almost sixty years {{involved}} a variety of artists, assistants and patrons during perhaps seven separate campaigns of work. Its conception and first leaves were commissioned by a high-ranking member of the French court whose identity is now lost, and involved mainly French artists. Before 1413 it was in the possession of Jean, Duc de Berry; by 1420 in that of the Count of Holland John of Bavaria, who contracted mostly Flemish artists.|$|E

25|$|The journey {{began at}} Folly Bridge in Oxford and ended 3 miles (5km) north-west {{in the village}} of Godstow. During the trip, Dodgson told the girls a story that {{featured}} a bored little girl named Alice who goes looking for an adventure. The girls loved it, and Alice Liddell asked Dodgson to write it down for her. He began writing the manuscript of the story the next day, although that earliest version no longer exists. The girls and Dodgson took another boat trip a month later when he elaborated the plot to the story of Alice, and in November he began working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> in earnest.|$|E
25|$|Twain {{initially}} {{conceived of}} the work as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography. Twain worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> {{off and on for}} the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set it aside for several years. After making a trip down the Hudson River, Twain returned to his work on the novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade).|$|E
25|$|In the {{dedication}} page for Uglies, Westerfeld says: “This novel {{was shaped by}} a series of e-mail exchanges between myself and Ted Chiang about his story “Liking What You See: A Documentary.” His input <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> was also invaluable.” In another interview, Westerfeld says that this documentary is about a new technology that enables an individual to turn off their ability to see beauty so they can focus on the deeper and more important parts of another individual. In a 2012 interview on Bookyurt, Westerfeld explained that his point in writing the book was not to make a big commentary on the issues with beauty, but to make people aware of the culture of retouching that is developing in the world and to be aware of our own ideas about beauty and our need to think for ourselves.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the next}} several years, Stanford kept writing, {{publishing}} {{in a wide range}} of literary journals and magazines around the world. In 1969, he met Linda Mencin, the daughter of a retired Naval Commander and World War II ace, through a mutual friend. The two soon moved into a house in Fayetteville's Mt. Sequoyah neighborhood together, Mencin working for the War on Poverty and Stanford writing poetry— often all day long. In Mt. Sequoyah, Stanford worked away on his magnum opus, The Battlefield Where The Moon Says I Love You — which he had likely begun as a teenager — handwriting the poem in pen on his and Mencin's dining room table. The full chronology of the creation of the poem is unclear, but consensus is that Stanford worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript</b> sporadically over many years until late 1974 or 1975, by which time the book was finished.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1948 he arrived in Italy and visited Fossalta where in 1918 he had been wounded. A month later, while duck hunting with an Italian aristocrat he met 18-year-old Adriana Ivancich. He and his then wife Mary then went to Cortina to ski: she broke her ankle and, bored, Hemingway began the draft of the book. Hemingway himself then became ill with an eye {{infection}} and was hospitalized. In the spring he went to Venice where he ate lunch with Adriana a few times. In May he returned to Cuba and carried out a protracted correspondence with her while working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>manuscript.</b> In the autumn he had returned to Europe and at the Ritz in Paris he finished the draft. Once done, he and Mary went again to Cortina to ski: {{for the second time}} she broke her ankle and he contracted an eye infection. By February the first serialization was published in Cosmopolitan and in March the Hemingways returned to Paris and then home to Cuba where the final proofs were read before the September publication.|$|E
