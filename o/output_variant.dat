40|$|Abstract- A multiobjective {{optimization}} technique was proposed for designing combinational logic circuits with 100 % functionality and minimized number of gates. The main {{idea is to}} consider each <b>output</b> <b>variant</b> as an objective function, which is assigned to an individual. At first, it evolves each individual to satisfy the matches between the outputs produced by corresponding <b>output</b> <b>variant</b> of an encoded circuit and the values specified by the truth table. If an individual meets the above matches, it is further evolved to finish matches {{of the rest of}} the output variants. Once an individual is feasible, it is optimized in terms of the number of gates. Experiments are carried to assess the performance of multiobjective simulated annealing (MSA) against some intelligent � algorithms and human designs, results illustrate MSA can design combinational logic circuits efficiently...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Intravenous general {{anesthetic}} {{agents are}} among the most important and widely used anesthetic drugs in the clinical practice. Many pharmacological studies have shown that potentiation of GABA and glycine on their receptors is the most plausible mechanism. Nevertheless, there is limited information on the effects of co-administration of two or more of these agents. However, experimental models for investigation of optimized drug combinations to have maximum effects on the receptors, have certain limitations and are both time consuming and expensive. One method to optimize drug combinations is the use of artificial neural network, in which the response optimization is performed by using experimental results. Methods: In this research, artificial neural network has been used to model a function with seven input and one output variants. Each input variant represents one of the intravenous general anesthetics including thiopentone, methohexitone, pentobarbitone, propofol, etomidate, saffan and ketamine and the <b>output</b> <b>variant</b> is the effectiveness of these drugs on glycine receptors. Results: Results of the present study show that maximum potentiation of the tested drugs on glycine receptor are around 1500 %, which can be achieved under certain drug concentrations, while maximum potentiation that has been obtained in experimental models by combination of propofol or saffan and by combination of thiopentone and pentobarbitone has been around 600 % and 640 %, respectively. Conclusion: In order to evaluate and validate the calculated results, experiments are recommended to be performed with the proposed combinations and concentrations...|$|E

40|$|A {{diversity}} of tools {{is available for}} identification of variants from genome sequence data. Given the current complexity of incorporating external software into a genome analysis infrastructure, a tendency exists {{to rely on the}} results from a single tool alone. The quality of the <b>output</b> <b>variant</b> calls is highly variable however, depending on factors such as sequence library quality as well as the choice of short-read aligner, variant caller, and variant caller filtering strategy. Here we present a two-part study first using the high quality 'genome in a bottle' reference set to demonstrate the significant impact the choice of aligner, variant caller, and variant caller filtering strategy has on overall variant call quality and further how certain variant callers outperform others with increased sample contamination, an important consideration when analyzing sequenced cancer samples. This analysis confirms previous work showing that combining variant calls of multiple tools results in the best quality resultant variant set, for either specificity or sensitivity, depending on whether the intersection or union, of all variant calls is used respectively. Second, we analyze a melanoma cell line derived from a control lymphocyte sample to determine whether software choices affect the detection of clinically important melanoma risk-factor variants finding that only one of the three such variants is unanimously detected under all conditions. Finally, we describe a cogent strategy for implementing a clinical variant detection pipeline; a strategy that requires careful software selection, variant caller filtering optimizing, and combined variant calls in order to effectively minimize false negative variants. While implementing such features represents an increase in complexity and computation the results offer indisputable improvements in data quality...|$|E
40|$|In adult French phonology, schwa is a {{separate}} vowel category that either deletes or merges with /œ/ in the output. This thesis revolves around the distribution, categorisation and acquisition of schwa. We test two main hypotheses {{on the basis of}} Swiss French adult and child data: one, that schwa does not constitute {{a separate}} category in early child language, and two, that the acquisition of schwa alternation, consonant sequencing and the reduction of non-prominent syllables are intertwined. The analysis of inter-adult judgement and production data shows that the distribution of schwa and /œ/ is near complementary. The implication for the language acquisition process is that there are few indications in the input that output [œ] needs to be split into two categories. The analysis of child-directed speech shows that the rate of schwa alternation is lower compared to inter-adult speech. The implication for the language acquisition process is that the categorical distinction between schwa and /œ/ is blurred in the child’s input. The analysis of spontaneous and semi-controlled child language data shows that children in all ages, from 2; 03 to 3; 05, prefer the <b>output</b> <b>variant</b> with schwa. Schwa alternation in spontaneous speech is rare, even in children who master consonant sequencing and syllable reduction. As for children who do not master these aspects of phonology, no spontaneous alternation is attested. In a semi-controlled setting, where the child is exposed to the variant without schwa, the older children, who master consonant sequencing and syllable deletion, are sensitive to the input and produce the variant without schwa. As for the children who do not master these aspects, sensitivity to the input is low. However, in the rare cases where they do show sensitivity, they modify the target form in conformity with their current grammar...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports an {{integrated}} solution, called BALSA, for the secondary analysis of {{next generation sequencing}} data; it exploits the computational power of GPU and an intricate memory management to give a fast and accurate analysis. From raw reads to variants (including SNPs and Indels), BALSA, using just a single computing node with a commodity GPU board, takes 5. 5 h to process 50 -fold whole genome sequencing (∼ 750 million 100 bp paired-end reads), or just 25 min for 210 -fold whole exome sequencing. BALSA’s speed is rooted at its parallel algorithms to effectively exploit a GPU to speed up processes like alignment, realignment and statistical testing. BALSA incorporates a 16 -genotype model to support the calling of SNPs and Indels and achieves competitive variant calling accuracy and sensitivity {{when compared to the}} ensemble of six popular variant callers.

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{methods of}} internal consistency in population projections at multiple levels of aggregation. The {{first step in}} the process is to make the initial assumptions used in the projections at different levels of aggregation consistent. This input-level consistency can be further enhanced by output-level analysis. Comparing the results at the relevant levels of aggregation ensures internal consistency at the output level. Thus, we are able to compare the differences in the age and sex distribution of the population and specific demographic indicators (such as the old age dependency ratio) over various regional levels. In PLUREL, the national projections will be carried out using the probabilistic method while the regional projections will use deterministic or variant methods. The results at these two levels of aggregation cannot be directly compared one-to-one as there is no simple correspondence between the <b>output</b> <b>variants</b> and the probabilistic range. To avoid any problems arising from this, we develop an index representing the differences in the size and distribution of the population from the variant method to a given percentile in the probabilistic population estimate. The report discusses various population projection techniques together with their strengths and weaknesses. The relative advantage of specific models for different purposes is discussed forming a selection of models to be used for the population projections in PLUREL: National (NUTS 1 - 0), Regional (NUTS- 2) and Case Study Projections (NUTS- 5). We conclude that stochastic projections are best suited for national projections, while classic or multiregional cohort-component model projections are likely to be the best choice for the regional projections and for the detailed case study projections...|$|R

Our monetary macromodel exhibits the following features: asset market clearing, disequilibrium in the product and labor markets, sluggish price and quantity adjustments, two Phillips curves for the wage and price dynamics and expectations formulation which represents a combination of adaptive and forward looking behavior. Two alternative monetary policy rules for controlling inflation are considered: the monetary authority (1) targeting monetary aggregates or (2) targeting the interest rate. For those two policy rules the model's dynamic features are explored given certain parameter constellations. Then the key parameters of the model variants are estimated through GMM and single equation estimations employing US time series data 1960. 1 - 1995. 1. Stochastic simulations are performed and contrasted with US macroeconomic data in terms of standard deviations of macro variables as well as their cross-correlation to output.
