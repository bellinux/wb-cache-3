5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E

40|$|Faculty {{and administrators}} still {{struggle}} {{to practice and}} sup-port a holistic approach to engaged scholarship. Many institu-tions have created a culture <b>of</b> <b>engaged</b> scholarship, yet faculty are looking for practical ways to plan, implement, and reflect on engaged scholarship due to productivity expectations.

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>engaged</b> scholarship, as a 'new' and {{participatory}} approach to knowledge production, has received much attention {{over the past}} decade.

Rather, they are consistent with Sanmicheli, who indeed possessed the only workshop in town capable <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> a work of this magnitude. Certainly the twelve Apostles in the spandrels in the arches of the nave are Cairano's work - the artist's hand is unmistakable.

5|$|The Court {{supported}} this interpretation by {{recognizing that the}} First Amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing Branti v.

Because employees thinking <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by a correct dismissal, both reasonings {{should be considered in}} violation of the First Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{returned}} to Kentucky, accepting the pastorate of First Presbyterian Church of Lexington. His return to Kentucky was also {{motivated by a}} growing fondness for his cousin, Virginia Hart Shelby, who had cared for two of his children during his stay in Pennsylvania. Virginia was the widow of Alfred Shelby, the son of Isaac Shelby, who was twice governor of Kentucky. Their written exchanges included love poems from Robert and concerned questions from Virginia about the wisdom <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> in a relationship. Despite being advised by her sisters to avoid the marriage and her own wavering on the issue, the two were married in April 1847. They had three children, only one of whom survived to adulthood. Disagreements among the children of both partners' previous marriages exacerbated an already tense union, which almost ended in divorce in September 1856. Robert managed to reconcile with his wife, and they remained together until Virginia's death in 1859.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1945, {{cities and}} {{industrial}} {{facilities in the}} Japanese home islands were under sustained attack from United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers based in the Mariana Islands. Attacks by Allied submarines and surface ships had also cut most of the country's trade routes, and US Navy aircraft carrier task groups had raided locations in the home islands on several occasions. Shortages of fuel had confined most of the Imperial Japanese Navy's surviving ships to port and forced them and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service to hold its air units in reserve against the Allied invasion that {{was expected to be}} launched late in the year. Prior to the war, the Japanese military had assessed that coastal artillery was no longer suited to the country's circumstances. As a result, only a few strategic ports were protected by artillery capable <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> enemy warships, and most of these guns were of relatively small calibers.|$|E
40|$|Demonstrating {{impact from}} {{research}} {{has always been}} a key consideration in the knowledge production business. However, {{it can be argued that}} the models and frameworks available for enabling such impact to be demonstrated are poorly developed. Those that do exist are predominantly derived from a linear uni-dimensional perspective of the knowledge flow from the academy to practice. Little sustained attention has been given to the development of models and ways of working that go beyond traditional approaches to impact monitoring through impact factors and citation indices. Engaged scholarship offers a framework that has as an explicit intention, the creation of connections between researchers/universities and practitioners/health care providers. In this paper a model is offered derived from the theory of ‘engaged scholarship’. The principles <b>of</b> <b>engaged</b> scholarship will be outlined, as well as an articulation <b>of</b> <b>engaged</b> scholarship as an approach to the co-production of knowledge. An example of a practice development and evaluation study will be offered that is consistent with the principles <b>of</b> <b>engaged</b> scholarship.

5|$|During {{the letters}} scandal, Charlotte lost her diary which {{contained}} both family secrets and critical thoughts on {{various members of}} her family; the diary was eventually given to Wilhelm, who never forgave her for its contents. Bernhard was transferred to a regiment in the quiet town of Breslau, effectively exiling him and his wife. As controller of Charlotte's allowance, Wilhelm also limited their ability to travel outside of the country unless {{they were willing to}} go without royal honours. In 1896, Dona accused Charlotte <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> in an affair with Karl-August Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, a court official. Charlotte fiercely denied the allegations. Bernhard defended his wife and criticised the Hohenzollerns for attempting to keep every Prussian princess {{under the control of the}} family. Bernhard considered resigning his army position and leaving with his wife for Meiningen, though the dispute eventually resolved itself when von Diersburg returned to court with his wife. The scandal was considered to have seriously damaged the reputation of the monarchy.|$|E

In 1241 he however converted this into a vow <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> in warfare against pagan peoples in the north {{in light of the}} Mongol invasion of Europe. When a group of Karelians ("Bjarmians") had been forced westwards by the Mongols, Haakon allowed them to stay in Malangen and had them Christianized—something that would please the papacy. Later, in 1248, Louis IX of France proposed (by Matthew Paris as messenger) to Haakon to join him for a crusade, with Haakon as commander of the fleet, but Haakon turned the offer down. While Haakon had been unsuccessful in gaining the recognition of Pope Gregory IX, he quickly gained the support from Pope Innocent IV who sought alliances in his struggle with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Haakon finally achieved royal recognition by Pope Innocent in 1246, and Cardinal William of Sabina was sent to Bergen and crowned Haakon in 1247.|$|E
5|$|Hoepner's Panzer Corps and Prioux' Cavalry clashed head-on near Hannut, Belgium, on 12 May. Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Germans did not outnumber the French.

The R35 was equal or superior to the Panzer I and Panzer IIs in armament terms. This applies all the more to the 90 Panhard 178 armoured cars of the French Army.

In terms of tanks that were capable <b>of</b> <b>engaging</b> and surviving a tank-vs-tank action, the Germans possessed just 73 Panzer IIIs and 52 Panzer IVs.
