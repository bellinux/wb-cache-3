5|$|On October 16, 2016, Gay's daughter, Trinity Gay, was {{fatally shot}} {{in the parking lot}} of a Cook Out {{restaurant}} in Lexington, Kentucky.

5|$|Potbelly {{sculpture}}s from Sin Cabezas are stylistically {{related to}} Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples, being found in fill {{dating to the}} Late Classic period. The monuments at Sin Cabezas were headless when they were found and no fragments of the missing heads were evident, suggesting that they had already been damaged when they were re-erected by later <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> the site.|$|E
5|$|The ferry {{typically}} attracts {{about two}} million passengers a year; <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> vehicles (including drivers) are counted as passengers. Ferry patronage is still high for vehicles, but has fallen away to minimal numbers for foot passengers. In 2012 the ferry carried around 20,000 vehicles and 50,000 passengers weekly.|$|E

5|$|The outer rainbands of Alex caused three {{deaths in}} Acapulco, Guerrero, after a {{retaining}} wall collapsed over the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> an improvised shack in a vacant lot. The investigation that followed {{found that the}} wall had been built without structural enforcements, and that the torrential rainfall had weakened the wall's foundation.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} {{developed}} {{very close to}} shore, it only briefly traveled west-northwest before making landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico early on June 29 as a weak tropical storm. It continued inland, producing heavy rain over the state of Veracruz until dissipating over the mountains of San Luis Potosí late on June 29. Hundreds of homes were damaged, and several towns, including Naranjos and Chinampa, about 60miles (95km) south of Tampico, were severely flooded, but the only reported fatalities were the two <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> a car that was swept away by floodwaters in Naranjos.|$|E
5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access doors were locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E

50|$|The eastern tower {{dates from}} 1067-68, while the western tower dates from 1093. Both towers {{appear to be}} the work of the architect, Muhammad bin Makki al-Zanjani.

5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> the building against evil influences such as demons, ghosts and witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period of}} hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 1958, Vulcan VX770 {{was flown}} by a Rolls-Royce test pilot on an engine {{performance}} sortie with a fly past at RAF Syerston Battle of Britain At Home display. It flew {{along the main}} runway then started a roll to starboard and climbed slightly, during which the starboard wing disintegrated and the main spar collapsed. VX770 went into a dive with the starboard wing on fire and struck the ground, killing three <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> a controllers' caravan and all four crew on board. Proposed causes of the structural failure have included pilot error, metal fatigue due to air intake vibration, and inadequate maintenance.|$|E

5|$|On {{capturing}} the second-line, {{elements of the}} Liverpool Scottish decided to consolidate the shallow trenches that afforded little protection. The battle had quickly degenerated into a disorganised and chaotic affair, with British battalions losing cohesion and becoming mixed up with each other. An intensive German barrage decimated the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> the second-line trenches, while the 10th's temporary commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel E.G. Thin, was wounded by gunfire. The remainder of the Liverpool Scottish continued onto the third-line with portions of the Royal Scots Fusiliers and 1st Northumberland Fusiliers.|$|E
5|$|Ptolemy's tribes located {{north of}} the Forth-Clyde isthmus include the Cornovii in Caithness, the Caereni, Smertae, Carnonacae, Decantae, Lugi and Creones also {{north of the}} Great Glen, the Taexali in the north-east, the Epidii in Argyll, the Venicones in Fife, the Caledonians in the central Highlands and the Vacomagi centred near Strathmore. It is likely {{that all of these}} {{cultures}} spoke a form of Celtic language known as Pritennic. The <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> southern Scotland were the Damnonii in the Clyde valley, the Novantae in Galloway, the Selgovae on the south coast and the Votadini to the east. These peoples may have spoken a form of Brythonic language.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} the early modern period it was a common custom to hide objects such as written charms, dried cats, horse skulls, and witch bottles in the {{structure}} of a building, but concealed shoes are by far the most common items discovered. Archaeologist Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are found suggest that at least some were concealed as magical charms to protect the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> the building against evil influences. Such hidden caches of objects are known by archaeologists as spiritual middens.|$|E

5|$|The Playford family {{heritage}} can {{be traced}} back to 1759, when a baby boy was left at the door of a house in Barnby Dun, Yorkshire, England, with a note to christen the child 'Thomas Playford'. The <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> the house, who were to raise the child, were given instructions to receive money from a bank account for the deed. The child grew up to be a simple farmer in the village, and had a son in 1795 who he christened 'Thomas Playford'. The tradition of naming the firstborn son in the family in this way has continued since.|$|E
5|$|The SS Gothenburg was a {{steamship}} that operated {{along the}} British {{and then later}} the Australian and New Zealand coastlines. In February 1875, she left Darwin, Australia en route to Adelaide when she encountered a cyclone-strength storm off the north Queensland coast. The ship was wrecked on the Great Barrier Reef north-west of Holbourne Island on 24 February 1875. Survivors {{in one of the}} lifeboats were rescued two days later by Leichhardt, while the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> two other lifeboats that managed to reach Holbourne Island were rescued several days later. Twenty-two men survived, while between 98 and 112 others died, including a number of high-profile civil servants and dignitaries.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was debated in the days immediately following the fire. Public speculation led {{to the arrest of}} Crocker and Warren, the <b>occupants</b> <b>of</b> the warehouse. The Daily-Tribune reported that the explosions could not have occurred without the presence of gunpowder in addition to the saltpeter, and thus they were suspected of possessing gunpowder, which would have led to a murder charge. However, later inquiry released Crocker and Warren of all charges as no evidence of gunpowder was discovered.|$|E
