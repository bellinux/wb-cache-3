British Journal of Industrial Medicine, 31, 261 - 274. Intervention {{studies of}} cotton {{steaming}} to reduce biological effects of cotton dust. Previous exposure chamber studies {{had suggested that}} steaming cotton could reduce significantly the levels and the biological effects of cotton dust. Therefore an intervention study using a high capacity steamer was designed to test {{the effectiveness of this}} process in a single cotton mill. The mill population was surveyed and dust sampling was completed prior to intervention with steamed cotton. A panel of 62 byssinotics and heavily exposed workers was selected to serve as a test panel while steamed cotton was introduced to the mill. Following the introduction of adequately steamed cotton the mean Monday decrement in forced expired volume in one second among panel members was significantly reduced to half that observed during control trials. Dust levels were also significantly reduced in the initial <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> processes but increased significantly in later processes. Re-evaluation of the mill population by work area suggested some improvement in expiratory flow per milligram of dust exposure but a progression in symptoms of byssinosis and bronchitis in later mill processes. It is suggested that steaming may have resulted in removal of some bronchoconstricting property of cotton dust, but that binding of fine dust to the fibre may also occur, resulting in delayed release of fine dust particles. The implications of these observations on environmental control are discussed...|$|E
50|$|In March 2007 he {{made his}} san'yaku debut at sekiwake rank, the first {{newcomer}} to the rank for nine tournaments. He made a poor start to the tournament, losing eight of his first nine bouts, but he showed great strength of character in winning the last six in a row to finish with a 7-8 record and remain in san'yaku, albeit at the lower rank of komusubi. Further losing scores {{in the next two}} tournaments caused him to slip to maegashira 3 by September 2007. However, a 10-5 mark in that tournament returned him to the titled ranks for November, again at komusubi. In that tournament he defeated yokozuna Hakuhō on the <b>opening</b> day <b>and</b> <b>picked</b> up his second Technique prize.|$|R
50|$|In {{spite of}} highly {{positive}} reviews, KHJJS {{had a very}} poor <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> didn't <b>pick</b> up due to word of mouth even. Eventually, the film was a Box Office disaster and {{proved to be a}} very huge loss for the PVR Production House. The GM of the PVR group mentioned later that they couldn't even get back 10% of the total film's budget. Yet, he mentioned that his production house was happy that they lost only on giving an excellent film, not a poor one. Similarly, Amitabh Bachchan and Director Anurag Kashyap also expressed their views later and said that films like KHJJS are assets to Bollywood, but the failure of such films is a very bad sign and it doesn't motivate young directors to come up with quality products. The Box Office failure of KHJJS was indeed a very big shock and disappointment among the critics as well the industry.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, {{after serving}} his country in World War II, Lee was {{selected}} to play for England in the European Championships, scoring six goals in 10 appearances. He signed for Nottingham Forest in 1947 for a fee of £7500, before a £12,000 move to West Bromwich Albion in 1949. He made his debut for Albion in a 1-0 win against Charlton Athletic on 20 August 1949, {{the opening day of}} the 1949-50 season, and scored his first goal for the club in a 2-1 defeat away to Liverpool on 18 February 1950. He became a regular in the no. 11 shirt in his first seven seasons at the club. Lee played in the 1954 FA Cup Final, setting up Ronnie Allen for the <b>opening</b> goal <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> up a winner's medal as the Baggies beat Preston North End 3-2. After scoring 65 goals in 295 appearances for Albion, Lee joined non-league Lockheed Leamington on a free transfer in June 1958, before a short period at Vauxhall Motors.|$|R

40|$|In {{the future}} of the aging society it becomes {{increasingly}} difficult to provide personal care to people who are in need of help due to physical impairments caused by various diseases or disorders. The number of caregivers is limited and the cost of individual personal care will increase. Although personal care is desired, the downside is that people in need of care become dependent on caregivers for accomplishing their activities of daily living. This dependence has a big influence on one’s quality of life and self esteem. A solution to this situation is the deployment of assistive robotic aids like multifunctional robotic arms mounted to a table or wheelchair. These systems can aid in various tasks like <b>opening</b> doors <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> up a drinking glass, as well as personal hygiene tasks. Because many of today’s wheelchair mounted robotic arms are based in some aspects on existing designs for industrial applications, they are not safe to be used in human care services. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} safe robotic arms that are applicable for this kind of care. This thesis describes various ways of accomplishing safety in robotic arms, and argues that using variable stiffness actuation, which has not been applied before in assistive robotic arms, is a way to accomplish that. These actuators provide the possibility to not only control the position of the actuator output, but also to influence the stiffness that can be perceived at this output. Various concepts of these actuators, using different principles, are investigated in Part I, and Part II treats the modeling of robotic arms that are driven by these actuators. Modularity was a specific goal, because of the large diversity of connections between the actuators and the arm. The result is a model based on graph theory, which consists of vertices and edges, in which the repositioning of an actuator means changing the connections of one or more edges. This thesis also presents a structured method of analyzing an arm's stiffness, and treats the control of the actuator stiffnesses to optimally approximate a desired end effector stiffness...|$|R

30|$|For this work, a {{few basic}} {{movements}} of the robot are assumed, which are, mobility, tuning up/down, <b>opening</b> <b>and</b> closing, switching on <b>and</b> off, <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> putting objects. It is assumed that the robot can hold something while performing open/close and tuning up/down actions. Planning and execution will revolve around these basic movements to achieve certain goals. Planner module {{is responsible for the}} planning and passing commands to the robot for its execution. Given a certain goal, planner module will compose a sequence of plans for the robot to execute such that after the plans are completed, the goal is achieved. For example, given that the goal is to place a canned soft drink in the fridge and that all cabinet needs to be closed, the robot will first find where the soft drink is. If there is one that happens to be in the kitchen cabinet, the robot will approach it, open the cabinet <b>and</b> <b>pick</b> up the soft drink, and then close it. It will subsequently approach and open the fridge, after which it will place the canned drink before closing it. No prior programming is required for the plan.|$|R

5000|$|A local {{sequence}} alignment matches a contiguous sub-section of one sequence with a contiguous sub-section of another. [...] The Smith-Waterman {{algorithm is}} motivated by giving scores for matches and mismatches. Matches increase the overall score of an alignment whereas mismatches decrease the score. A good alignment then has a positive score and a poor alignment has a negative score. The local algorithm finds an alignment with the highest score by considering only alignments that score positives <b>and</b> <b>picking</b> the best one from those. The algorithm is a Dynamic programming algorithm. When comparing proteins, one uses a similarity matrix which assigns a score to each possible residue. The score should be positive for similar residues and negative for dissimilar residues pair. Gaps are usually penalized using a linear gap function that assigns an initial penalty for a gap <b>opening,</b> <b>and</b> an additional penalty for gap extensions, increasing the gap length.|$|R
