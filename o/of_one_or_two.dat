5|$|Common and gregarious, the hardnose shark is a {{predator}} of bony fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans. This species is viviparous, {{with the growing}} embryos sustained to term via a placental connection to their mother. Females have a biennial reproductive cycle and bear litters <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> pups after a twelve-month gestation period. The hardnose shark is fished for meat throughout its range and, given its low reproductive rate, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Molecular oxygen is {{an ideal}} {{terminal}} electron acceptor {{because it is a}} strong oxidizing agent. The reduction of oxygen does involve potentially harmful intermediates. Although the transfer of four electrons and four protons reduces oxygen to water, which is harmless, transfer <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> electrons produces superoxide or peroxide anions, which are dangerously reactive.|$|E

5|$|The {{fore and}} hind wings {{are similar in}} shape, being long and narrow, with {{numerous}} cross-veins, and somewhat resembling those of primitive insects such as mayflies. A few genera, however, have reduced wings, or have lost them altogether. The abdomen is cylindrical with eleven segments, {{the first of which}} is fused to the metathorax. The cerci consist <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> segments. The abdomen typically curves upwards in the male, superficially resembling the tail of a scorpion, the tip containing an enlarged structure called the genital bulb.|$|E
5|$|Benthic in nature, {{the plain}} maskray feeds mainly on caridean shrimp and polychaete worms, {{and to a}} lesser extent on small bony fishes. It is viviparous, with females {{producing}} litters <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> young that are nourished during gestation via histotroph ("uterine milk"). This species lacks economic value but is caught incidentally in bottom trawls, which it is thought to be less able to withstand than other maskrays due to its gracile build. As it also has a limited distribution and low fecundity, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Common loons eat a {{wide range}} of animal prey {{including}} fish,crustaceans, insect larvae,molluscs, and occasionally aquatic plant life. They swallow most of their prey underwater, where it is caught, but some larger items are first brought to the surface. They are a seasonallymonogamousbreeders. Both members of a pair build a large nest out of deadmarsh grassesand other plants formed into a mound along the vegetated shores of lakes. A singlebroodis raised each year from a clutch <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> olive-brown ovaleggswith dark brown spots which are incubated for 24 to 25 days by both parents. Fed by both parents, the chicks fledge in 70 to 77 days. The chicks are capable of diving underwater and they fly to their wintering areas before ice forms in the fall.|$|E

5|$|In 1883, {{oil tanker}} design took a large step forward. Working for the Nobel company, British {{engineer}} Colonel Henry F. Swan designed {{a set of}} three Nobel tankers. Instead <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> large holds, Swan's design used several holds which spanned the width, or beam, of the ship. These holds were further subdivided into port and starboard sections by a longitudinal bulkhead. Earlier designs suffered from stability problems caused by the free surface effect, where oil sloshing {{from side to side}} could cause a ship to capsize. But this approach of dividing the ship's storage space into smaller tanks virtually eliminated free-surface problems. This approach, almost universal today, was first used by Swan in the Nobel tankers Blesk, Lumen, and Lux.|$|E
5|$|The Chacoan system brought large {{quantities}} of imported goods to Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, including pottery, shells, and turquoise, but by the late 12th century, as the system collapsed, the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined, and Mesa Verde became isolated from the surrounding region. For approximately six hundred years, most Mesa Verdean farmers had lived in small, mesa-top homesteads <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> families. They were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water. This practice continued into the mid- to late 12th century, but {{by the start of}} the 13th century they began living in canyon locations that were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields.|$|E
5|$|The {{superclass}} Tetrapoda {{is divided}} into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs. Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, {{some of which are}} impervious. Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage. They are not found in the sea with the exception <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps. On land, amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp.|$|E

5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} breeds {{during winter}} in colonies that may include other large waterbirds {{such as the}} spot-billed pelican. The nest is a large platform of twigs placed {{at the end of}} a near-horizontal branch of a tall tree. Nests are rarely placed in forks and an unobstructed top canopy allows the birds to fly easily from and to the nests. In the Nagaon nesting colony in Assam, tall Alstonia scholaris and Anthocephalus cadamba were favourite nest trees. The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree. While crowding at these sites, male birds mark out their nesting territories, chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them. They may also arch their body and hold their wings half open and drooped. When a female perches nearby, the male plucks fresh twigs and places it before her. The male may also grasp the tarsus of the female with the bill or hold his bill close to her in a preening gesture. A female that has paired holds the bill and head to the breast of the male and the male locks her by holding his bill over her neck. Other displays include simultaneous bill raising and lowering by a pair. The clutch, usually of three or four white eggs, is laid at intervals <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> days and incubation begins after the first egg is laid. Both parents incubate and the eggs hatch at intervals <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> days, each taking about 35 days from the date of laying. Adults at the nest have their legs covered with their droppings and this behaviour termed as urohidrosis is believed to aid in cooling during hot weather. Adults may also spread out their wings and shade the chicks. The chicks are fed at the nest for about five months. The chicks double in size in a week and can stand and walk on the nest platform when they are a month old. At five weeks, the juveniles leap frequently and can defend themselves. The parent birds leave the young along for longer periods at nest at this stage. The young birds leave the nest and fly around the colony when about four months but continue to be fed occasionally by the parents.|$|E
