50|$|One {{common type}} of wrench is shown on the right. The loop of chain is placed around the filter, and the bar is turned {{anticlockwise}} by hand until the chain wraps itself tightly around the <b>filter.</b> A socket <b>wrench</b> or adjustable spanner is then used to turn the hexagonal bar further in the same direction. This increases {{the tension in the}} chain, which bites into the soft metal casing of the <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> which helps prevent slippage.|$|R

50|$|An <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> is {{a filter}} {{designed}} to remove contaminants from engine oil, transmission oil, lubricating oil, or hydraulic <b>oil.</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>filters</b> {{are used in}} {{many different types of}} hydraulic machinery. A chief use of the <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> is in internal-combustion engines in on- and off-road motor vehicles, light aircraft, and various naval vessels. Other vehicle hydraulic systems, such as those in automatic transmissions and power steering, are often equipped with an <b>oil</b> <b>filter.</b> Gas turbine engines, such as those on jet aircraft, also require the use of <b>oil</b> <b>filters.</b> Aside from these uses, oil production, transport, and recycling facilities also employ filters in the manufacturing process.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{automobile}} engines {{did not use}} <b>oil</b> <b>filters.</b> For this reason, {{along with}} the generally low quality of oil available, very frequent oil changes were required. The first <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> were simple, generally consisting of a screen placed at the oil pump intake. On November 27, 1923, American inventors George Greenhalgh and Ernest Sweetland filed U.S. Patent #1721250 for an automotive <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> and called it the Purolator, a portmanteau of [...] "pure oil later". The Purolator <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> was the first <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> invented for the automobile and revolutionized the filtration industry. The Purolator <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> is still in production today. This original invention was a bypass filter: most of the oil flowed directly from the oil pan to the engine's working parts, and a smaller proportion of the oil was sent through the filter via a second flow path in parallel with the first. The <b>oil</b> was thus <b>filtered</b> over time. Modern bypass <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> systems for diesel engines are becoming popular in consumer applications, but have been in commercial use for some time due to potential reduction in maintenance costs.Oil filters are generally located near the middle or bottom of the engine.|$|R

50|$|Early engine <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> were of {{cartridge}} (or replaceable element) construction, {{in which}} a permanent housing contains a replaceable filter element or cartridge. The housing is mounted either directly on the engine or remotely with supply and return pipes connecting it to the engine. In the mid-1950s, the spin-on <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> design was introduced: a self-contained housing and element assembly {{which was to be}} unscrewed from its mount, discarded, and replaced with a new one. This made filter changes more convenient and potentially less messy, and quickly came to be the dominant type of <b>oil</b> <b>filter</b> installed by the world's automakers. Conversion kits were offered for vehicles originally equipped with cartridge-type filters. In the 1990s, European and Asian automakers in particular began to shift back in favor of replaceable-element filter construction, because it generates less waste with each filter change. American automakers have likewise begun to shift to replaceable-cartridge filters, and retrofit kits to convert from spin-on to cartridge-type filters are offered for popular applications. Commercially available automotive <b>oil</b> <b>filters</b> vary in their design, materials, and construction details. Ones that are made from completely synthetic material excepting the metal drain cylinders contained within are far superior and longer lasting than the traditional cardboard/cellulose/paper type that still predominate. These variables affect the efficacy, durability, and cost of the filter.|$|R
