Two maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids (SC 704, SC 301), vetch (Vicia villosa), bitter vetch (Vicia ervilia), berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) sole crops as well as intercrops of maize hybrids with each of the legumes were used. The experiment was carried out as randomized complete block design with three replications. Results of analysis of variance showed that dry matter (DM) yield of corn in intercropping with vetch and bitter vetch decreased. The corn dry matter yield loss in intercrop treatments in comparison with the sole crop of maize was 15. 80 percentages. Also legumes dry matter yield decreased as compared to the legumes monoculture. In general total forage yield of intercrops of corn hybrids with legumes was increased. On the average of two years, the largest DM yield was <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> hybrids -vetch mixture, which indicates the larger effect of vetch in increasing forage yield.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at extracting {{cellulose}} and nanocelluloses (cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and cellulose nanofibres (CNFs)) <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> stalks and flax fibres. Both flax fibres and maize stalks are composed of cellulose, lignin, hemicellulose and extractives. The extraction of cellulose involves the removal of lignin, hemicellulose and extractives. The presence of these components in plant fibres hinders the extraction of cellulose and nanocelluloses. Prior to extraction of cellulose, the different concentrations (1 wt. %, 1. 5 wt. % and 2 wt. %) of NaOH were optimised. However, chemical compositions and XRD results revealed that the treatment of flax fibres with 1. 5 wt. % sodium hydroxide (NaOH) gives optimum results and this concentration was further selected for the extraction of cellulose. Cellulose was extracted by chemical treatments (sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium chlorite (NaClO 2) and potassium hydroxide (KOH)) and a combination of chemical treatments and mechanical process (supermass colloider). The materials obtained after each treatment stage during the extraction process were characterised by different characterisation techniques such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results from the aforementioned characterisation techniques confirmed that cellulose was successfully extracted from flax fibres and maize stalks. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were extracted by sulphuric acid hydrolysis accompanied with ultra-sonication <b>from</b> cellulose <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> flax fibres and maize stalks. The extracted CNCs were rod-like material with diameters and lengths in nanoscale and microscale, respectively. On the other hand, cellulose nanofibres (CNFs) were extracted by mechanical process (supermass colloider). The extracted CNFs were web-like material with diameters and lengths in nanoscale and microscale, respectively. The dimensions of nanocelluloses were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Their dispersion was investigated by light polarised microscopy. The extracted nanocelluloses and cellulose were used to produce nanopapers and micropaper. Nanopapers mimic the traditional paper, the only difference of the nanopapers {{is that they are}} produced from high aspect ratio nanomaterials. Both nanopapers and micropapers were prepared by solvent evaporating method. Their thermal, optical and mechanical properties were investigated and compared. The mechanical and thermal properties of nanopapers produced from CNFs were better than those produced from CNCs and micropapers. On the other hand, nanopapers produced from CNCs were more transparent in comparison to nanopapers produced from CNFs and micropapers. Cellulosic fibres have attracted a considerable attention in composite materials due to their high tensile strength and tensile modulus.

As aflatoxin contamination in maize is of major concern, the necessity for suitable methods to predict moisture content with less time and higher accuracy assumes greater importance. Hence, Three Term Backpropagation network is proposed as a prediction tool for moisture content on maize. The new model is an improvement on Two Term Back propagation by the addition of an extra parameter, the proportional factor, which increases the convergence speed and reduces learning stalls in the conventional neural network. The experimental results are conducted using semi-annual datasets <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> a <b>maize</b> thermal dryer. The results show that the proposed model outperforms Two Term Back propagation and other prediction methods like empirical correlation, analytical models (tank in series) and genetic algorithm which were used as prediction tools. Quantitatively, Three Term Back Propagation Neural Network obtained a higher precision result with a Mea...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium verticillioides and Fusarium subglutinans are {{important}} fungal pathogens of maize and other cereals worldwide. In this study, we developed PCR-based protocols for {{the identification of}} these pathogens targeting the gaoB gene, which codes for galactose oxidase. The designed primers recognized isolates of F. verticillioides and F. subglutinans that were <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> seeds from several producing regions of Brazil but did not recognize other Fusarium spp. or other fungal genera that were either obtained from fungal collections or isolated from maize seeds. A multiplex PCR protocol was established to simultaneously detect the genomic DNA from F. verticillioides and F. subglutinans. This protocol could detect the DNA from these fungi growing in artificially or naturally infected maize seeds. Another multiplex reaction {{with a pair of}} primers developed in this work combined with a pre-existing pair of primers has allowed identifying F. subglutinans, F. konzum, and F. thapsinum. In addition, the identification of F. nygamai was also possible using a combination of two PCR reactions described in this work, and another described in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Filamentous fungi {{produce a}} great variety of enzymes, and {{research}} on their biotechnological potential has recently intensified. The objective of this work was to identify, at the species level, using DNA barcoding, 46 fungal isolates <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> grains with rot symptoms. We also analyzed the production of extracellular amylases, cellulases, proteases and lipases of 33 of those fungal isolates. The enzymatic activities were evaluated by the formation of a clear halo or a white precipitate around the colonies in defined substrate media. The found fungi belong to the genera Talaromyces, Stenocarpella, Penicillium, Phlebiopsis, Cladosporium, Hyphopichia, Epicoccum, Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Irpex, Fusarium, Microdochium, Mucor and Sarocladium. In the genus Fusarium, the species Fusarium verticillioides was predominant and this genus presented the highest diversity, followed by the genera Aspergillus. The best genera for lipase production were Cladosporium and Penicillium; while Cladosporium, Aspergillus and Penicillium were best for cellulase activity; Hyphopichia, Aspergillus and Irpex for amylase activity; and Cladosporium and Sarocladium for proteases activity. In conclusion, a collection of fungi from maize seeds presenting rotten symptoms were obtained, among which exist important producers of hydrolases...|$|E
30|$|The Carr's {{compressibility}} and Hausner indices {{were estimated}} as {{the ratios of}} the difference between tapped and bulk densities. The Carr's compressibility index gives an idea of how much a powder can be compressed, while Hausner index measures/estimates cohesion between particles; the values for both varies inversely with particle flow (Carr 1965; Wells 1988). For Carr's index, values in the ranges 5 to 10, 12 to 16, 18 to 21 and 23 to 28 indicate excellent, good, fair and poor flow properties of the material, respectively (Carr 1965). In the study, the indices for all the microcrystalline cellulose samples are approximately in the range 15 to 20 (fair-good flowability). On the other hand, for the Hausner ratio, a value of less than 1.20 indicates good flowability, whereas a value of 1.50 or higher suggests that the material will have poor flow properties. In our case, the Hausner ratio for the microcrystalline cellulose samples lie around the threshold of 1.20 (≈good flowability). Therefore, the values obtained for the Hausner ratio are consistent with those of the Carr's index. However, in both cases, the MCCA showed a little superior flow properties compared to microcrystalline cellulose samples <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>maize</b> cobs.|$|E
40|$|Influence of Indigenous Phosphate on Maize Straw Compost Quality and Biodegradation. Soil {{organic matter}} and {{phosphorus}} scarcities {{are the main}} constraints for intensification of crop production in Burkina Faso. To propose an adequate method to produce good quality organic matter, a study, in controlled conditions, was conducted using a Lixisol to evaluate the biodegradation of composts made of maize straw, rock phosphate, animal manure and a synthesis inoculum (SI). Composts <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> composting <b>maize</b> crop residues + manure ± SI had C/N of 19 and 18, respectively. Influence of composts produced on soil CO 2 production {{was related to the}} type of compost and to nitrogen application. An increase of 53 % of CO 2 production due to nitrogen application was observed when compost produced with manure and SI was incorporated in the soil. This increase was 118 % with incorporation of the compost obtained with manure, SI and rock phosphate. These results suggest that there is potential to produce high quality organic inputs by composting maize straw in presence of rock phosphate...|$|R
40|$|Polypeptide {{present in}} various cell {{fractions}} <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> homogenized <b>maize</b> mesocotyls {{were separated by}} sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotted, and screened for cross-reactivity with antibodies against three synthetic polypeptides spanning {{different regions of the}} rat heart gap junctional protein connexin 43 and the whole mouse liver gap junctional protein connexin 32. An antibody raised against a cytoplasmic loop region of connexin 43 cross-reacted strongly with a cell wall-associated polypeptide (possibly a doublet) of 26 kilodaltons. Indirect immunogold labeling of thin sections of mesocotyl tissue with this antibody labeled the plasmodesmata of cortical cells along {{the entire length of the}} plasmodesmata, including the neck region and the cytoplasmic annulus. Sections labeled with control preimmune serum were essentially free of colloidal gold. An antibody against connexin 32 cross-reacted with a 27 -kilodalton polypeptide that was present in the cell wall and membrane fractions. Indirect immunogold labeling of thin sections with this antibody labeled the plasmodesmata mainly in the neck region. It is suggested that maize mesocotyl plasmodesmata contain at least two different proteins that have homologous domains with connexin proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to verify the potential of top cross hybrids and of partially endogamic lines (S 3) <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> commercial <b>maize</b> hybrids. The 27 top cross hybrids, two commercial checks and the tester IA 33 were evaluated by complete block design with three replications, in two years (2005 / 2006 and 2006 / 2007) and inthree locations (Campinas, Mococa and Palmital) of São Paulo State. The following traits were evaluated: male flowering, plant height, ear height, percentage of lodging and broken plants and grain weight corrected to 14 % moisture. The effects of general combining ability and the heterobeltiosis of the top cross hybrids were considered. Top cross hybrids were verified with grain weight superior or similar to the commercial checks, proving the productive potential of the top cross hybrid. The hybrid IA 33 x HI 9 - 19 - 1 outstanding with high grain yield and heterobeltiosis, and the lines HI 9 - 19 - 1 and HG 7 - 12 - 1 showed high combining ability estimates in the three locations...|$|R
