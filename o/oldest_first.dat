25|$|Krieger has {{represented}} the United States at two FIFA Women's World Cups: 2011 in Germany and 2015 in Canada. She {{was part of}} the defense that held opponents scoreless for a record 540 minutes and helped lead the United States to become 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup champions. She started in all seven matches for the United States in the 2015 tournament, and she played every minute of all six United States matches at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. In 2012, Krieger sustained a serious knee injury during the 2012 CONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifying tournament and did not recover in time to be selected to the 2012 Olympic Team. After persevering, Krieger was named to her first Olympic team four years later and participated in the 2016 Rio Olympics. She became the <b>oldest</b> <b>first</b> time US olympian for women's soccer.|$|E

2500|$|Following this {{traditional}} view, Thumb noticed {{that in the}} Peloponnesus and in the islands, where the Dorians established themselves, their dialect showed elements [...] of the Arcadian dialect. This can be explained if the Dorians conquered a Pre-Doric population, which was pushed into the Arcadian mountains. Where the Dorians were a minority, there is a mixed dialect, as in Boeotia, or the Dorians adopted the existing dialect, as in Thessaly. To the Achaeans described by Homer belongs the Aeolic-Arcadian dialect {{in the whole of}} eastern Greece, with the exception of Attica, where the Ionians were confined. The Ionians must be considered the <b>oldest</b> <b>first</b> wave of the Greek migration.|$|E

2500|$|Related claims, {{perhaps in}} an attempt to sidestep these debates, are that Genji is the [...] "first {{psychological}} novel" [...] or [...] "historical novel", [...] "the first novel still considered to be a classic" [...] or other more qualified terms. [...] However, critics have almost consistently described The Tale of Genji as the <b>oldest,</b> <b>first,</b> and/or greatest novel in Japanese literature, though enthusiastic proponents may have later neglected the qualifying category of in Japanese literature, leading to the debates over the book's place in world literature. [...] Even in Japan, the Tale of Genji is not universally embraced; the lesser known Ochikubo Monogatari has been proposed as the [...] "world's first full-length novel", even though its author is unknown. [...] Despite these debates, The Tale of Genji enjoys solid respect among the works of literature, and its influence on Japanese literature has been compared to that of Philip Sidney's Arcadia on English literature.|$|E
