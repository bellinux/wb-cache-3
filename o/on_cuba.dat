5|$|Emilia Martins' 1998 study {{compared}} the head-bob displays {{from the source}} population <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> with these animals on Isla Magueyes. The durations and pauses were longer {{by as much as}} 350% in the feral population. In comparison, the blue iguana of Grand Cayman's head-bob displays differed from those of the animals <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> by only about 20%. The rapid change in display structure between the colony of animals on Isla Magueyes and those <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> illustrated the potential of small founding population size as a catalyst to evolution with regard to communication or display. In this case the difference was by only six generations at most.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of systems that developed, only one {{tropical}} cyclone, the second hurricane, managed to make landfall during the season. It severely impacted areas of the Greater Antilles, particularly the Dominican Republic, before making subsequent landfalls <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> and the U.S. states of Florida and North Carolina, with less severe effects. The estimated 2,000 to 8,000deaths caused by the storm in the Dominican Republic alone ranked it as one of the deadliest Atlantic hurricanes in recorded history. No other storms affected any landmasses during the year, although the first storm damaged a cruise ship in open waters.|$|E

5|$|In 1508, the Caribbean {{coast of}} Honduras was superficially {{explored}} by Spanish navigators Juan Díaz de Solís and Vicente Yáñez, but {{the focus of}} their expeditions lay further to the north. In the 1510s, expeditions from the Spanish settlements <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> and Hispaniola reported that the Bay Islands were inhabited. The first efforts to conquer Honduras were launched from several {{different areas of the}} Spanish Indies, including Hispaniola, Mexico, and Panama. This resulted in jurisdictional disputes over the territory that delayed the progress of the conquest.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw or Cuban red macaw (Ara tricolor) was {{a species}} of macaw native to the main island of Cuba and the nearby Isla de la Juventud that became extinct in the late 19th century. Its {{relationship}} with other macaws in the genus Ara is uncertain, but {{it may have been}} closely related to the scarlet macaw, which has some similarities in appearance. It may also have been closely related, or identical, to the hypothetical Jamaican red macaw. No modern skeletons are known, but a few subfossil remains have been found <b>on</b> <b>Cuba.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw {{was traded}} and hunted by Amerindians, and by Europeans after their {{arrival in the}} 15th century. Many {{individuals}} were brought to Europe as cagebirds, and 19 museum skins exist today. It had become rare by the mid-19th century due to pressure from hunting, trade, and habitat destruction. Hurricanes may also have contributed to its demise. The last reliable accounts of the species are from the 1850s <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> and 1864 on Isla de la Juventud, but it may have persisted until 1885.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} trough produced {{heavy rainfall}} across the western Caribbean Sea, which <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> unofficially reached over 7.8inches (200mm). Outer rainbands in Pinar del Río Province injured three people and damaged 55houses. In Florida, Barry dropped a moderate {{amount of precipitation}} across the drought-ridden state; rainfall peaked at 6.99inches (178mm). The rain caused some flooding and wet roads, which led to two indirect traffic fatalities. Rough seas killed one Florida surfer in Pinellas County. In Florida and Georgia, the precipitation assisted firefighters in combating severe wildfires. Overall damage from the storm was minor.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fox was {{the strongest}} and deadliest {{tropical}} cyclone of the below average 1952 Atlantic hurricane season. The seventh tropical storm, sixth Atlantic hurricane, and the third major hurricane of the season, Fox was a small and intense Caribbean storm that developed northwest of Cartagena, Colombia, in the southern Caribbean Sea. It moved steadily northwest, intensifying to a tropical storm on October 21. The next day, it rapidly strengthened into a hurricane and turned north. The cyclone attained peak winds of 150mph (240km/h) as it struck Cayo Guano del Este {{off the coast of}} Cienfuegos. Fox made landfall <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> at maximum intensity, producing peak gusts of 170–180mph (275–290km/h). It weakened over land, but it re-strengthened as it turned east over the Bahamas. On October 26, it weakened and took an erratic path, dissipating west-southwest of Bermuda on October 28.|$|E

5|$|McKinley {{proposed}} to open negotiations with Spain {{on the basis}} of Cuban liberation and Puerto Rican annexation, with the final status of the Philippines subject to further discussion. He stood firmly in that demand even as the military situation <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> began to deteriorate when the American army was struck with yellow fever. Spain ultimately agreed to a ceasefire on those terms on August 12, and treaty negotiations began in Paris in September 1898. The talks continued until December 18, when the Treaty of Paris was signed. The United States acquired Puerto Rico and the Philippines as well as the island of Guam, and Spain relinquished its claims to Cuba; in exchange, the United States agreed to pay Spain $20 million. McKinley had difficulty convincing the Senate to approve the treaty by the requisite two-thirds vote, but his lobbying, and that of Vice President Hobart, eventually saw success, as the Senate voted in favor on February 6, 1899, 57 to 27.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2005, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa. Gradually, the system organized on July 2 and formed a broad low pressure area. The system continued to organize, and became {{a tropical}} depression on July 4. Tracking westward, it became a tropical storm on July 5 and a hurricane on July 7. Dennis rapidly intensified to attain Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before making landfall <b>on</b> <b>Cuba.</b> The storm weakened to Category1 status before re-emerging in the Gulf of Mexico and intensifying. Dennis made landfall on the Florida Panhandle on July 10 before tracking over Alabama as a minimal hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Since {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} extinct macaws exist only for the species <b>on</b> <b>Cuba,</b> {{it is impossible to}} determine the species' relationships. It has been suggested that the closest mainland relative of the Cuban macaw is the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), due to the similar distribution of red and blue in their plumage, and the presence of a white patch around the eyes, naked except for lines of small red feathers. Furthermore, the range of the scarlet macaw extends to the margins of the Caribbean Sea. The Cuban macaw is distinct due to its lack of a yellow shoulder patch, its all-black beak, and its smaller size. The two also share a species of feather mite, which supports their relationship. James Greenway believed the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the other extinct species suggested to have inhabited Jamaica, Hispaniola and Guadeloupe.|$|E

5|$|The 1924 Cuba {{hurricane}} is {{the earliest}} officially classified Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale, {{and one of}} two hurricanes to make landfall <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> at Category 5 intensity, the other being Hurricane Irma in 2017. It formed on October14 in the western Caribbean, slowly organizing as it tracked northwestward. By October16, it attained hurricane status {{to the east of}} the Yucatán Peninsula, and subsequently executed a small counterclockwise loop. On October18, the hurricane began undergoing rapid deepening, and the next day it reached an estimated peak intensity of 165mph (270km/h). Shortly thereafter, it struck extreme western Cuba at peak intensity, becoming the strongest hurricane on record to hit the country. Later the hurricane weakened greatly, striking southwestern Florida with winds of 90mph (150km/h) in a sparsely populated region. While crossing the state it weakened to tropical storm status, and after accelerating east-northeastward, it was absorbed by a cold front on October23 south of Bermuda.|$|E

A tropical storm warning was issued for a stretch of coast slightly further east than the area covered by the preceding watch, and a hurricane watch was issued for the central section of this region. This turned into a hurricane warning from Pearl River, Louisiana to Indian Pass due to fears of a strengthening to hurricane strength. The warnings were reduced and were then canceled eight hours after the second landfall.|$|E
5|$|Militarily {{weaker than}} NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear {{missiles}} <b>on</b> <b>Cuba</b> {{to even the}} power balance. Although conflicted, Castro agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause of socialism. Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, Dorticós and security chief Ramiro Valdés knew the full plan. Upon discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the U.S. implemented an island-wide quarantine to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. saw the missiles as offensive; Castro insisted they were for defense only. Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a nuclear strike on the U.S. should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid nuclear war. Castro was {{left out of the}} negotiations, in which Khruschev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the U.S. would remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy. Feeling betrayed by Khruschev, Castro was furious and soon fell ill. Proposing a five-point plan, Castro demanded that the U.S. end its embargo, withdraw from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, cease supporting dissidents, and stop violating Cuban air space and territorial waters. Presenting these demands to U Thant, visiting Secretary-General of the United Nations, the U.S. ignored them, and in turn Castro refused to allow the U.N.'s inspection team into Cuba.|$|E
