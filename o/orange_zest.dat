25|$|Oranges, whose flavor {{may vary}} from sweet to sour, are {{commonly}} peeled and eaten fresh or squeezed for juice. The thick bitter rind is usually discarded, {{but can be}} processed into animal feed by desiccation, using pressure and heat. It also is used in certain recipes as a food flavoring or garnish. The outermost layer of the rind can be thinly grated with a zester to produce <b>orange</b> <b>zest.</b> Zest is popular in cooking because it contains oils and has a strong flavor {{similar to that of}} the orange pulp. The white part of the rind, including the pith, is a source of pectin and has nearly the same amount of vitamin C as the flesh and other nutrients.|$|E
50|$|The {{most basic}} {{cranberry}} sauce consists of cranberries boiled in sugar water until the berries pop and the mixture thickens. Some recipes include other ingredients such as slivered almonds, <b>orange</b> juice, <b>zest,</b> ginger, maple syrup, port, or cinnamon.|$|R

5000|$|The Lemonade fruit’s sweet flavor can {{lend itself}} to several applications: sweet, savory, cooked, raw, juiced, {{preserved}} even pickled.

Use Lemonade fruit juice in marmalade, jams, cocktails, vinaigrette, sauces and syrups. Use in lieu of lemon or <b>oranges</b> where <b>zest,</b> garnish and citrus rind are called for.|$|R
25|$|Fillings in {{pastries}} {{are sometimes}} made of finely ground poppy seeds mixed with butter or milk and sugar. The ground filling {{is used in}} poppy seed rolls and some croissants and may be flavored with lemon or <b>orange</b> <b>zest,</b> rum and vanilla with raisins, heavy cream, cinnamon, and chopped blanched almonds or walnuts added. For sweet baked goods, sometimes instead of sugar a tablespoon of jam, or other sweet binding agent, like syrup is substituted. The poppy seed for fillings are best when they are finely and freshly ground because this will {{make a big difference}} in the pastry filling's texture and taste. Some recipes for Mohnstriezel use poppy seed soaked in water for two hours or boiled in milk. A recipe for Ukrainian poppyseed cake recommends preparing the seeds by immersing in boiling water, straining and soaking in milk overnight.|$|E
2500|$|The type of malt {{determines the}} colour of the saison, and {{although}} most saisons {{are of a}} cloudy golden colour as result of the grist being mostly pale or pilsner malt, the use of darker malts results in some saisons being reddish-amber. Some recipes also use wheat. Spices such as <b>orange</b> <b>zest,</b> coriander, and ginger may be used. Some spice character may come through due {{to the production of}} esters during fermentation at warm temperatures. Modern examples brewed in the US tend to copy the yeast used by the Dupont Brewery, which ferments better at warmer temperatures like [...] than the standard [...] fermenting temperature used by other Belgian ales.|$|E

5000|$|The large Palestinian {{population}} in the country {{has led to the}} rise of another popular dish among the people of Jordan: maqluba. This dish is made of meat (typically beef or lamb), fried onions, and a variety of vegetables. The word maqlubah means [...] "upside down" [...] and the dish draws its name {{from the fact that the}} pot it is prepared in is turned upside down on a plate before it is served. The dish falls out of the pot with what had been at the bottom of the pot during preparation now sitting on top of the dish. [...] The Ottoman legacy also lives on in Jordanian cuisine, as evidenced by the presence of such dishes as one called kabsa or Riz Bukhari which is made with chicken, onions, carrots, tomatoes, <b>orange</b> or lemon <b>zest</b> and juice, and spices. This mixture is served on top of rice and sprinkled with raisons and chopped almonds. This dish originates with Turkish-speaking Uzbeks from Central Asia who came to Jordan in the decade after World War I.|$|R
5000|$|Cake {{opens on}} a baker {{cracking}} eggs into {{a mixing bowl}} to the opening strains of [...] "My Favorite Things", performed by Julie Andrews. This begins a montage of shots of white-uniformed cooks moving trolleys of ingredients and performing cake preparation work such as <b>zesting</b> <b>oranges</b> and mechanically mixing cake batter. Several large blocks of madeira cake are taken from the oven, starting a time-lapse sequence of the brick-like cakes being arranged into a pile and being mortared with buttercream icing. After a shot of gloved hands kneading orange sugar paste, a woman pours melted chocolate into a pot of Rice Krispies. The sugar paste is pressed between rollers, and the pot of Rice Krispies emptied into a mould. Layers of Battenberg cake are mortared together with raspberry jam. The Rice Krispies are removed from the moulds and arranged as panels around the madeira structure, creating the rough outline of a car. Jelly mixture is poured into a mould while another cook attaches Fox's Glacier Mints to a fondant base to create a headlamp. Long lines of liquorice are wrapped as belts around pieces of a madeira engine. A tin of golden syrup is poured in place of lubricant. The engine is lowered into {{the front of the}} car while pastry chairs are lowered into the interior. The jelly mould is removed to reveal a brake light, and a tyre made of chocolate fondant is wheeled in and various details such as liquorice windscreen wipers and a front grille made of chocolate Flakes are added to the car. The bonnet is lowered and icing sugar is dusted onto the roof before a fondant Škoda logo is attached to the front. The closing shot is of the team lined up around their creation, which now appears to be a cake replica of a Škoda Fabia, with the tagline [...] "The new Fabia. Full of lovely stuff."
