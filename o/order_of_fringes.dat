40|$|International audienceA new {{algorithm}} {{to reveal}} the <b>order</b> and sign <b>of</b> <b>fringes</b> formed by dual-beam electronic speckle-pattern interferometry is described. When combined with a previously reported phase-extraction method, it makes possible the evaluation of displacement absolutely and continuously over the entire surface of the object from {{a total of five}} frames. This technique is particularly useful when displacement is spatially discontinuous and temporally fast and the amount of data is large. A model experiment showing the validity of this method is presented...|$|R

One of the main problems is determination <b>of</b> the absolute <b>order</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fringe</b> for finding the depth difference between two points in moiré patterns, i. e. convex and concave surfaces distinction. Most solutions of the problem are very complicated; also they usually require sev-eral moiré images. Application of colour-encoded gratings in projection moiré method allows solving the problem simply and quickly. The authors analyze the information that contains in colour moiré fringes and estimate its effectiveness. With this purpose device independent simulations for colour formation <b>of</b> one moiré <b>fringe</b> in colour space by different conditions were made.

A single PS layer displays well-resolved Fabry-Pérot fringes in its reflectivity spectrum that is related to the refraction index of the film through the equation mλ[*]=[*] 2 nL, where m is the spectral <b>order</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fringe</b> at wavelength λ, n is the refractive index of the porous film, and L is the thickness of the film [18]. The value nL from this equation is regularly referred as OT of the porous layer and is obtained after applying the fast Fourier transform on the inverse of specular reflectance spectrum [21].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel marker encoded fringe projection profilometry (FPP) scheme for efficient 3 -dimensional (3 D) model acquisition. Traditional FPP schemes can introduce large errors to the reconstructed 3 D model when the target object has an abruptly changing height profile. For the proposed scheme, markers are encoded in the projected fringe pattern {{to resolve the}} ambiguities in the fringe images due to that problem. Using the analytic complex wavelet transform, the marker cue information can be extracted from the fringe image, and is used to restore the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> the <b>fringes.</b> A series <b>of</b> simulations and experiments {{have been carried out}} to verify the proposed scheme. They show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy over the traditional FPP schemes when reconstructing the 3 D model of objects with abruptly changing height profile. Since the scheme works directly in our recently proposed complex wavelet FPP framework, it enjoys the same properties that it can be used in real time applications for color objects.

40|$|In {{industrial}} situations, vibration {{tends to}} be measured using accelerometers. Interest in the measurement of the modal behaviour of test objects, {{as a means for}} determining ways of controlling their vibratory response, led to the use of holographic interferometry and thence to the comparative exercise which was the basis for this paper. To establish the bona fides of the interpretation procedures for the analysis <b>of</b> the optical <b>fringe</b> patterns, the behaviour of a complex three-dimensional test object was determined using both holography and multiple accelerometers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review some of the problems encountered when endeavouring to interpret the fringe patterns and to discuss methods which may be used to surmount them. The problem lies in the determination of the local vector of object motion. Since this motion can have six degrees of freedom, it is of the utmost importance to understand exactly what displacement is indicated by the fringe pattern. The second stage is to ascertain exactly the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> each <b>fringe.</b> In simple cases this is quite easy but when the object shape contains discontinuities, such direct identification methods are no longer valid. The most expedient method then is to employ an auxiliary reference to which the test position can be coupled by flexible tape; fringe counting along the tape providing the requisite order clarification. In the paper we shall present an explanation of the means for determining object displacements from interferograms and indicate the agreement that can be achieved with measurement data obtained using accelerometers. We shall discuss the problems to be expected when attempting to interpret fringe patterns on real engineering test pieces of complex shape and will summarise the methods we have now adopted to achieve successful application of holographic interferometry to this type of task...|$|R
