5|$|Croatia held an {{independence}} {{referendum on}} 19 May 1991, following the Croatian parliamentary elections of 1990 {{and the rise}} of ethnic tensions that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia. With 83 percent turnout, voters approved the referendum, with 93 percent in favor of independence. Subsequently, Croatia declared independence and the dissolution of its association with Yugoslavia on 25 June 1991, but it introduced a three-month moratorium on the decision when urged to do so by the European Community and the Conference <b>on</b> <b>Security</b> and Cooperation in Europe through the Brioni Agreement. The war in Croatia escalated during the moratorium, and on 8 October 1991, the Croatian Parliament severed all remaining ties with Yugoslavia. In 1992, the countries of the European Economic Community granted Croatia diplomatic recognition and Croatia was admitted to the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|During the study, various {{accusations of}} foul play by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the questions to be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis <b>on</b> <b>security</b> incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E

According to former Mayor Mohamed Ahmed Nur, the initiative also aims to help the authorities firm up <b>on</b> <b>security</b> and resolve housing ownership disputes. In March 2015, the Benadir administration likewise launched a renovation project on the Hawo Asir-Fagah major road in Mogadishu.

5|$|In {{the years}} after the fire One Meridian Plaza {{stood in the middle}} of Philadelphia vacant. The fate of the {{building}} was up in the air as the building's owners and the insurance company prepared for ligation on how to proceed with repairs, who would control those repairs, and at what cost. E/R Partners were proposing deconstructing the building down to the 19th floor and rebuilding from there. Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and spent up to $500,000 a month <b>on</b> <b>security</b> guards, utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y {{with the}} Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago, {{or at the}} Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, was considered, {{but in the end}} it was decided that a remote location would be best. A site in the vicinity of Los Angeles was rejected <b>on</b> <b>security</b> grounds, and one near Reno, Nevada as being too inaccessible. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The climate was mild, there were air and rail connections to Albuquerque, it was sufficiently distant from the West Coast of the United States for a Japanese attack not to be an issue, and the population density was low.|$|E
