5|$|As well as {{the series}} of secessionist movements, the eighteenth century saw the {{formation}} of a number of minor sects. These included the Glasites, formed by Church of Scotland minister John Glas, who was expelled from his parish of Tealing in 1730 for his objections to the state's intervention in the affairs of the kirk. He advocated a strong form of biblical literalism. With his son-in-law Robert Sandeman, from whose name they are known as the Sandemanians, he founded a number of churches in Scotland and the sect expanded to England and the United States. Closely involved with the Glasites were the followers of industrialist David Dale who broke with the kirk in the 1760s and formed the Old Scotch Independents, sometimes known as the Daleists. He preached a combination <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> faith that led him to co-found the cotton-mill at New Lanark and to contribute to the Utopian Socialism associated with his son-in-law Robert Owen.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1890, Bronisława — who {{a few months earlier}} had married Kazimierz Dłuski, a Polish physician and social and political activist — invited Maria to join them in Paris. Maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her {{a year and a half}} longer to gather the necessary funds. She was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again. All that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself. In early 1889 she returned home to her father in Warsaw. She continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891. She tutored, studied at the Flying University, and began her practical scientific training (1890–91) in a chemical laboratory at the Museum <b>of</b> <b>Industry</b> <b>and</b> Agriculture at Krakowskie Przedmieście 66, near Warsaw's Old Town. The laboratory was run by her cousin Józef Boguski, who had been an assistant in Saint Petersburg to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev.|$|E
5|$|Despite his administration's scandals, Grant {{continued}} to be personally popular. His reelection was supported by Frederick Douglas and other prominent abolitionists along with reformers of the Indian question. A growing number of political reformers, however, were disappointed by the Gold Ring, Grant's support of Reconstruction, and corruption in the New York Customs House. To placate them, Grant created a Civil Service Commission authorized by Congress in 1871. The Commission, chaired by reformer George William Curtis, proposed reformist rules and regulations, which Grant implemented by executive order in April 1872, Congress appropriating funds in May. Congress stopped funding the Commission in December 1875, having refused to pass legislation to implement its recommendations. There was further intraparty division between the faction most concerned with {{the plight of the}} freedmen, and the faction concerned with the growth <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> small government. During the war, both factions' interests had aligned, and in 1868 both had supported Grant. As the wartime coalition began to fray, Grant's alignment with the party's pro-Reconstruction elements alienated party leaders who favored an end to federal intervention in Southern racial issues.|$|E

5|$|Fishermen of the Canary Islands had {{to return}} to and remain in port for several days while {{weathering}} the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10–15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and man-made disasters. Only five of the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change, how they will affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the losses}} <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> jobs, St. Louis has had {{significant}} and persistent problems with both crime {{and perceptions of}} crime. In 2011 St. Louis was named by U.S. News and World Report as the most dangerous city in the United States, using Uniform Crime Reports data published by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, St. Louis was named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime. From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of firearm deaths for the metropolitan statistical area was one-fifth of the city rate.|$|E
5|$|Hatfield was {{a popular}} Governor who {{supported}} Oregon's traditional industries of timber and agriculture, but felt that in the postwar era expansion <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> funding for transportation and education needed to be priorities. While governor he worked to begin the diversification of the state's economy, such as recruiting industrial development and holding trade missions. As part of the initiative, he helped to found the Oregon Graduate Center {{in what is now}} the Silicon Forest in Washington County in 1963. A graduate level school in the Portland area (Portland State was still a college with no graduate programs at this time) was seen by business leaders as essential to attracting new industries and by Tektronix as needed to retain highly skilled workers. In lieu of the standard portrait for former governors, Hatfield is represented by a marble bust at the Oregon State Capitol.|$|E

5|$|He also {{attended}} meetings of Marxists from different political factions, there arguing with the Mensheviks over various policies, particularly {{their support for}} the Provisional Government. In turn, they accused him of trying to plunge Russia into civil war. The Mensheviks and Social Revolutionaries who dominated the Petrograd Soviet believed that Russia was insufficiently developed to transition to socialism, and thus supported the Provisional Government; Lenin disagreed, deeming them traitors to the socialist cause. Considering the government to be as equally imperialist as the Tsarist regime, he advocated immediate peace with Germany, rule by soviets, the nationalisation <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> banks, and the state expropriation of land, all with the intention of pushing toward a socialist society. Over the coming months he campaigned for these policies, attending the meetings of the Bolshevik Central Committee, prolifically writing for Pravda, and giving public speeches in Petrograd aimed at converting workers, soldiers, sailors, and peasants to his cause.|$|E
5|$|In 2015–2016, {{percentage}} {{share of}} Gross Value Added (GVA) at factor cost by Economic Activity at constant price (base year 2011–2012) was Agriculture-Forestry and Fishery – 14.84%, Industry 18.51% and Services 66.65%. It {{has been observed}} {{that there has been}} a slow but steady decline in the percentage share <b>of</b> <b>industry</b> <b>and</b> agriculture over the years. Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal. Rice is the state's principal food crop. Rice, potato, jute, sugarcane, and wheat are the top five crops of the state. Tea is produced commercially in northern districts; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high quality teas. State industries are localised in the Kolkata region, the mineral-rich western highlands, and the Haldia port region. The Durgapur–Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of major steel plants. Important manufacturing industries are engineering products, electronics, electrical equipment, cables, steel, leather, textiles, jewellery, frigates, automobiles, railway coaches, and wagons. The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea, sugar, chemicals, and fertilisers. Natural resources like tea and jute in and nearby parts has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries.|$|E

Upon arrival in Baghdad, he became critical of the plan set out by CPA, making clear that Iraq czar Paul Bremer's ideological vision was impeding progress that could have been made to stabilize Iraq. He left Baghdad two months after arriving in April 2003, disillusioned by an inability to execute a more pragmatic plan for Iraq's reconstruction. Carney returned to Washington where he made known his disagreement with the Bremer plan. In 2007,Under a significant reorganization of the Iraq reconstruction effort by the Bush administration that witnessed other policy dissenters return to Baghdad, Carney was asked by the State Department to return to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad to oversee the overall U.S. effort to rebuild Iraq.|$|E
