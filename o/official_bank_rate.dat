2500|$|North Korean won are {{intended}} exclusively for North Korean citizens, and the Bank of Trade (무역은행) issued a separate currency (or foreign exchange certificates) for visitors, {{like many other}} socialist states. However, North Korea made two varieties of foreign exchange certificates, one for visitors from [...] "socialist countries" [...] which were colored red and hence nicknamed [...] "red won", {{and the other for}} visitors from [...] "capitalist countries" [...] which were colored blue/green and hence known as [...] "blue won". FECs were used until 1999, then officially abolished in 2002, in favor of visitors paying directly with hard currency, especially the euro. Since at least 2012 foreigners (and [...] privileged locals) can buy goods priced in 'tied' won using a local debit card, which they have to credit with exchanging foreign currency (Euro, United States dollar or Renminbi/Yuan) at the <b>official</b> <b>bank</b> <b>rate.</b> One euro would provide a credit of 130 won. This card can be used for instance at the famous Pyongyang Department Store No. 1 or at the different stores at the international hotels, where the goods are priced at the tied won rate. This tied won does not exist in the form of bank notes. In normal stores and markets goods are priced in what has been called the 'untied' won or free market rate and regular banknotes can be used here. At for instance the Tongil Market and the Kwangbok Department Store (a.k.a. the Chinese Market) there are semi-official exchange agents who will give in regular banknotes around 10,000 won for one euro (2012) to locals and foreigners alike, so almost 77 times as much as the tied rate. However, the prices in the normal shops outside the tied won and restricted state shops are also based on this untied won rate.|$|E

50|$|When the Nixon shock {{happened}} in August 1971, BOJ should have appreciated the currency {{in order to}} avoid inflation. However, they still kept the fixed exchange rate as 360Yen/$ for two weeks, so it caused excess liquidity. In addition, they persisted with the Smithsonian rate (308Yen/$), and continued monetary easing until 1973. This created a greater than 10% inflation rate at that time. In order to control the stagflation, they raised the <b>official</b> <b>bank</b> <b>rate</b> from 7% to 9% and gradually skyrocketing prices ended in 1978. In 1979, when the energy crisis happened, they raised the <b>official</b> <b>bank</b> <b>rate</b> rapidly. BOJ succeeded in a quick economic recovery. After overcoming the crisis, they reduced the <b>official</b> <b>bank</b> <b>rate.</b> In 1980, BOJ reduced the <b>official</b> <b>bank</b> <b>rate</b> from 9.0% to 8.25% in August, to 7.25% in November, and to 5.5% in December in 1981. Reaganomics was set in America, and USD became strong. However, Japan tried to make fiscal reconstruction at that time, so they did not stop their financial regulation. In 1985, the agreement of G5 nations, known as the Plaza agreement, USD slipped down and Yen/USD changed from 240yen/$ to 200yen/$ at the end of 1985. Even in 1986, USD continued to fall and reached 160yen/$. In order to escape deflation, BOJ cut the <b>official</b> <b>bank</b> <b>rate</b> from 5% to 4.5% in January, to 4.0% in March, to 3.5% in April, 3.0% in November. At the same time, the government tried to raise the demand in Japan in 1985, and did economy policy in 1986. However, the market was confused about the rapid fall of USD. After Louvre Accord in February 1987, BOJ decreased the <b>official</b> <b>bank</b> <b>rate</b> from 3% to 2.5%, but JPN/USD was 140yen/$ at that time and reached 125yen/$ in the end of 1987. BOJ kept the <b>official</b> <b>bank</b> <b>rate</b> at 2.5% until May in 1989. The financial and fiscal regulation led to a widespread over-valuing of real estate and investments and Japan faced a bubble at that time.After 1990, the stock market and real asset market fell, at that time BOJ regulated markets until 1991 in order to end the bubble. In 1994, a terrible earthquake happened and Japanese yen became weaker and weaker. JPM/USD reached 80yen/$, so BOJ had to reduce the office bank rate to 0.5% and Japanese yen recovered. The long deflation for 20 years started at that time. In 1999, BOJ started zero-interest-rate policy, but they ended it despite government opposition when the IT bubble {{happened in}} 2000. However, Japan faced economic bubble burst in 2001, BOJ adopted the balance of current account as the main operating target for the adjustment of the financial market in March 2001 (quantitative relaxation policy), shifting from the zero-interest-rate policy. From 2003 to 2004, Japanese government did exchange intervention operation in huge amount, and the economy recovered a lot. In March 2006, BOJ finished qualitative easing, and finished the zero-interest-rate policy in June and raised to 0.25%. In 2008, the financial crisis happened, and Japanese economy turned to bad again. BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate to 0.3% and adopted the supplemental balance of current account policy. In December 2008, BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate again to 0.1% and they started to buy Japanese Government Bond (JGB).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{heterogeneity}} and rationality of professional forecasts at both {{short and long}} forecast horizons. We employ disaggregated survey data for forecasts of threemonth inter-bank rates and ten-year gilt yields for the period 1989 - 2006. We find evidence of heterogeneity among forecasters. Moreover, forecasts violate both the unbiasedness and orthogonality conditions of the rational expectations hypothesis. The majority of biased forecasts underestimate the future spot rate. The rationality of forecasts varies across maturities and forecast horizons with short horizon and short maturity forecasts exhibiting more rationality. It also varies across sub-periods corresponding to different monetary policy frameworks. We produce evidence indicating that both monetary policy actions and elements of communication policy have information content regarding the rationality of forecasts. Changes in <b>official</b> <b>bank</b> <b>rates</b> and disagreement, as recorded in the minutes of the Monetary Policy Committee, influence the rationality of forecasts.

I find that interest rate decisions react to deviations of the medium-term forecasts for inflation from target in order to pursue the inflation target. Forecast inflation uncertainty has a strongly intensifying effect on this reaction. Information from output growth is utilized {{in the form of}} near-term forecasts. The associated forecast uncertainty of output growth has an attenuating effect on the interest rate reaction. When accounting for asymmetries in forecast uncertainty I find that forecast upward risks to inflation contribute to the intensifying effect of forecast inflation uncertainty. The corresponding downward risks have no significant impact. As regards output growth, asymmetries in the forecast uncertainty have no significant impact on the interest rate reaction at all. Moreover, I find that forecast risks to inflation have a direct effect on the interest rate decisions, in particular when inflation is forecast close to target.

In this paper, a technique is developed to separate the anticipated and unanticipated components of such changes, and applied to estimate the response of euro–deutsche mark interest rates to adjustments in the Bundesbank’s Lombard and discount rates. [JEL E 43, E 47] GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, financial market participants, and agents in the economy at large attach importance to <b>official</b> central <b>bank</b> interest <b>rates.</b> What are termed official rates typically comprise the rates applied at one or more central bank standing facilities and in some cases at which the central bank operates a regular tender. In most industrialized countries, as in a number of developing countries, the central <b>bank</b> determines these <b>rates</b> both to define the range within which it manages short-term interbank rates through on-going open market operations, and to signal its medium-term policy stance (see Borio, 1997, for a recent survey). A change in official rates can thus affect expectations that are reflected in longer-term interest rates and other financial market prices, and hence initiate the monetary policy transmission process. It is therefore important that policymakers be able to predict the market response to such changes.
