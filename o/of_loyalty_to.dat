On July 11, 2011, the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York ruled that BS was {{entitled}} to $5,174.54 in fees; the district court reduced the fees to that number after finding that BS had breached its duty <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the Oneida's by also representing the Canadian claimants.|$|E

5000|$|Arent De Peyster, {{commander}} at Fort Detroit, {{concluded that}} the Miami fought La Balme's band of Canadien residents not because <b>of</b> their <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the British, but because <b>of</b> their <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Beaubien. [...] The British thereafter trusted Beaubien, and when all other traders were ordered to Fort Detroit, {{he was allowed to}} stay at Kekionga, reinforced with British rangers.|$|R
5|$|Burnet's first book, Biological Aspects of Infectious Disease, was {{published}} in 1940. It had wide influence and was translated into several languages. In 1942 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he travelled to Harvard University to deliver the Dunham Lectures. There he was offered a chair, but he refused and returned to Australia. This was attributed to his nationalistic tendencies, {{as well as his}} sense <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the Hall Institute. During his trip he also visited the US military facility at Fort Bragg, where he discussed his work on influenza with the scientists working there.|$|E
5|$|Edmund was not {{particularly}} popular while he was alive, nor did he enjoy a good reputation after his death. His unreliability in political issues, and repeated shifts in allegiance, might have contributed to this. His household was also said to behave {{in a way that}} caused popular resentment, taking provisions as they passed through the countryside while offering little compensation. At the same time, it has been pointed out that Edmund showed a great deal <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Edward II, in spite of receiving relatively little rewards and recognition from his brother.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He {{was chosen to}} sit on a committee that would draft Kentucky's response to the Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on the logic of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge now had to determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E
25|$|Khasakhala often fell {{a victim}} <b>of</b> his <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> friends. Albeit an illustrious {{political}} career, he never rose beyond {{the role of}} an assistant Cabinet Minister.

5|$|Jaidev {{is forced}} {{to decide whether to}} retaliate or leave Kolkata completely. He chooses to leave out <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Bhagavan and heads to Palasa, the village of Sandhya where Sandhya's brother Ashok (Subbaraju) is a valiant and kind-hearted cop. He comes across S. I. Paparayudu (Brahmanandam), and he solves the {{problems}} of the village by cleverly using Paparayudu. Jaidev cannot hide the truth from Sandhya anymore. Jaidev tells Sandhya about his life in Kolkata. Jaidev tells Sandhya that he made it look like that Paparayudu solved the problems of village. Since Jaidev told the truth, Sandhya still loves him.|$|E
5|$|Jared's silence {{leads to}} the {{breakdown}} of his relationships with both Rachel and his mother Diane. In the plays last scene Jared confesses to Diane that he witnessed the three youths raping Tracy, {{though he did not}} intervene. He is unsure why he did nothing though he believes it was out <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the boys who were his mates.

5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Fisher finds {{employment}} as a pharmacist {{in a local}} drug store; but his boss, Mr. Primont (Gavin Gordon)—who reluctantly hired Mr. Fisher after his boss made him do so—constantly demeans Mr. Fisher obviously out of retaliation, much to Danny's embarrassment. That situation {{makes it easier for}} Danny to go against his father's wishes and accept Charlie's job offer. Danny does; and when he becomes a hit at the King Creole, Maxie tries to hire him. Danny declines his offer out <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Speedie resurfaced in 1960, when he {{was named}} the end coach for the new American Football League's Houston Oilers under former {{teammate}} and Oilers head coach Lou Rymkus. The Oilers won the AFL championship in 1960, but Rymkus was fired after the team {{got off to a}} slow start the following year. Team owner Bud Adams urged Speedie to stay on the staff, but Speedie resigned out <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Rymkus.|$|E
5|$|When Joe Nieuwendyk {{refused to}} report to the Flames prior to the 1995 season, they named Fleury interim captain. The title was made {{permanent}} when Nieuwendyk was traded in December. Fleury was reluctant to assume the captaincy, but did so out <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the team and because there was nobody else capable of taking on the role. He relinquished it two seasons later after deciding that it was harming his play and affecting his relationship with his teammates and coach Pierre Pagé.|$|E

5|$|Alexander swore {{the oath}} <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the Greek {{constitution}} {{on the afternoon}} of 11 June 1917 in the ballroom of the Royal Palace. Apart from the Archbishop of Athens, Theocletus I, who administered the oath, only King Constantine I, Crown Prince George and the king's prime minister, Alexandros Zaimis, attended. There were no festivities. The 23-year-old Alexander had a broken voice and tears in his eyes as he made the solemn declaration. He knew that the Entente and the Venizelists would hold real power and that neither his father nor his brother had renounced their claims to the throne. Constantine had informed his son that he should consider himself a regent, rather than a true monarch.|$|E
5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E
5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E

5|$|In 1285, {{increasing}} Tatar {{pressure from}} the northeast had forced the Second Bulgarian Empire to come under the political dependence of Nogai Khan, the ruler of the Golden Horde. At the time Shishman's realm centred at Vidin was largely independent from the Bulgarian tsars in Tarnovo, though he retained a degree <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> Bulgaria and maintained friendly relations with Serbia. However, in 1291 Shishman too was forced to acknowledge the suzerainty of Nogai in order to counter the increasing Serbian {{pressure from the}} west. In the same year, the joint forces of Hungarian vassal Stephen Dragutin and Serbian king Stephen Milutin (r. 1280–1321) had managed to oust two Cuman–Bulgarian nobles and allies of Shishman, Darman and Kudelin, who were {{in control of the}} Braničevo region.|$|E
5|$|In 866, a major Arab raid along Dalmatia struck Budva and Kotor, {{and then}} laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867. The city appealed to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Macedonian, who responded by sending {{over one hundred}} ships. Finally, the 866–867 Saracens' siege of Dubrovnik, which lasted fifteen months, was raised due to the {{intervention}} of Basil I, who sent a fleet {{under the command of}} Niketas Oryphas in relief of the city. After this successful intervention, the Byzantine navy sailed along the coast collecting promises <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the empire from the Dalmatian cities. The damage done by Saracens is not known, but the fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long siege, proves how well the city was fortified.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1450s, Stafford {{might have been}} in the service of his distant {{relative}} John Stafford, Earl of Wiltshire, son of Humphrey Stafford, Duke of Buckingham. His association with James Touchet, Baron Audleyone of Wiltshire's menimplies so. If so, this represent a short episode <b>of</b> <b>loyalty</b> <b>to</b> the House of Lancaster over the House of York in the ongoing civil war. In 1460 the two were sent to Guînes to relieve the English garrison there. Bad weather forced them into the harbour of Calais, which was held by the Yorkist leader Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick. Here they were both recruited for the Yorkist cause.|$|E
