In June 1889, Morris traveled to Paris as the League's delegate to the International Socialist Working Men's Congress, where his international standing was recognised by being chosen as English spokesman by the Congress committee. The Second International emerged from the Congress, although Morris was distraught at its chaotic and disorganised proceedings.|$|E

We applied similar analyses to event-related functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) data to explore the relative roles of dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions during specific components of a working-memory (WM) maintenance task. The results of this study indicated that increases in dorsolateral PFC activity during encoding was related to subsequent retrieval-success. These results lend support to the hypothesis that ventrolateral PFC mediates a limited-capacity WM buffer that supports rehearsal maintenance functions while dorsolateral PFC mediates WM organization functions that accommodate the capacity limits of WM maintenance...|$|R
