25|$|Ozone {{precursors}} are a {{group of}} pollutants, predominantly those emitted during the combustion of fossil fuels. Ground-level <b>ozone</b> <b>pollution</b> (tropospheric ozone) is created near the Earth's surface {{by the action of}} daylight UV rays on these precursors. The ozone at ground level is primarily from fossil fuel precursors, but methane is a natural precursor, and the very low natural background level of ozone at ground level is considered safe. This section examines the health impacts of fossil fuel burning, which raises ground level ozone far above background levels.|$|E

40|$|The {{detrimental}} effects of ambient ozone on crops, even at relatively low concentrations, are well-established (Thompson et al., 1976; Heck and Brandt, 1977; Heck et al., 1982; Environmental Protection Agency, 1984; California Air Resources Board, 1987; Olszyk et al., 1988 a, 1988 b; Heagle et al., 1986; McCool et al., 1986, Ashmore, 1991). Ozone enters plant leaves through the stomatal {{openings in the}} leaf surface and then produces byproducts that reduce the efficiency of photosynthesis (CARB, 1987). Research suggests that ozone, either alone or in combination with nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide, {{may be responsible for}} up to 90 percent of U.

In an effort to address this problem, the Clean Air Act and its amendments include air pollution damages to vegetation as one of the criteria by which secondary national ambient air quality standards are evaluated (Adams et al., 1984). There is, of course, an economic cost associated with this reduced productivity.
