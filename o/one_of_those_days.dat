25|$|However, {{because of}} the holiday rules, Rosh Hashanah cannot fall on a Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday, so if TM2 is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days,</b> Rosh Hashanah in year 2 is {{postponed}} by adding one day to year 1 (the second deḥiyyah). To compensate, one day is subtracted from year 2. It is to allow for these adjustments that the system allows 385-day years (long leap) and 353-day years (short ordinary) besides the four natural year lengths.|$|E
25|$|From 1975 to 1980 Harper {{worked with}} English {{musician}} and 'Black Sheep' member Andy Roberts sometimes performing as a duo. During this period, Harper spent considerable {{time in the}} United States and signed with the US division of Chrysalis Records, who released HQ under a different title – When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease – and with alternative artwork. Chrysalis considered the original Hipgnosis-designed album cover of Harper walking on water to be too offensive for an American release. Harper disagreed, but was given no choice by the label. Chrysalis also changed the title of Harper's next album, Bullinamingvase, to <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>Those</b> <b>Days</b> in England. In 1978, US Chrysalis reissued Harper's first five Harvest albums, only one of which (Flat, Baroque and Berserk) had been previously released in America.|$|E

60|$|His {{address was}} at a boarding-house in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Bayswater squares, once of leisure, which {{nowadays}} are reduced to earning their living. Somebody had recommended him there. I started to call on him on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> January <b>days</b> in London, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> wintry <b>days</b> composed <b>of</b> the four devilish elements, cold, wet, mud, and grime, combined with a particular stickiness of atmosphere that clings like an unclean garment to one's very soul. Yet on approaching his abode I saw, like a flicker far behind the soiled veil of the four elements, the wearisome and splendid glitter of a blue sea with the Seven Islets like minute specks swimming in my eye, the high red roof of the bungalow crowning the very smallest of them all. This visual reminiscence was profoundly disturbing. I knocked {{at the door with}} a faltering hand.|$|R
500|$|On October 2, 1938, Feller was the {{starting}} pitcher against the Detroit Tigers. Detroit's Hank Greenberg was {{two home runs}} short of Babe Ruth's then-single-season record of 60 home runs. By the ninth inning, Feller had recorded 16 strikeouts, one fewer than the MLB record in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when he struck out Detroit's Pete Fox and passed it, to set a modern major league record of 18 strikeouts, when he struck out Chet Laabs {{for the fifth time}} that day. Greenberg said, [...] "Feller's curve was jumping wickedly and with that and his fast ball, he was murder." [...] Feller did not earn a win, however, as the Indians lost, 4–1. [...] "It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> when everything feels perfect, your arm, your coordination, your concentration, everything. There was drama in the air because of Greenberg's attempt to break Ruth's record, and the excitement grew even greater when my strikeouts started to add up", Feller said. For the 1938 season, Feller led all pitchers with 208 walks and 240 strikeouts. In 1939, Feller received his first career Opening Day start against the Tigers after a match against the Browns was rained out. He won the game 5–1, after allowing three hits. On Mother's Day, Feller pitched against the Chicago White Sox with his family in attendance. One pitch was fouled off by Marv Owen into the seats and into the face of Feller's mother; he {{went on to win the}} game. Feller finished the 1939 season having led the AL in wins (24), complete games (24) and innings pitched (296.2) and led the majors for a second consecutive year in both walks (142) and strikeouts (246).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the annual}} contest between Vanderbilt and the Sewanee Tigers on Thanksgiving Day, Sewanee {{won for the}} first time in a decade by the score of 16–0. The student {{newspaper}} The Sewanee Purple labeled it [...] "The Greatest Victory for Sewanee in Its Thirty-one Years of Football History." [...] Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin stated [...] "Sewanee played a brilliant, sustained game. It was her day all the way." [...] Michigan coach Fielding Yost said of the game, [...] "It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> when everything you try goes wrong and everything the other fellow tries goes right. Sewanee played great football." [...] Gil Reese was relatively controlled and Bob Rives' line play was adequately challenged. Gil Reese and Fatty Lawrence starred for the Commodores. Sewanee's backfield of [...] captain Harris, Gibbons, Barker, and Mahoney [...] "clicked to perfection" [...] and its line received lots of praise as well. It's the last time Sewanee has beaten Vanderbilt.|$|E

60|$|It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> summer <b>days</b> {{that are}} so still, that they seem as it were a holiday of nature.

60|$|The {{next day}} was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> of strong {{perception}} that stand out clear in one's memory when the common course of days is blurred.

He was conscious of being extraordinarily irritated, not so much with any particular person as with the world in general.

60|$|It {{was past}} meridian, on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days</b> of {{moderate}} exertion, that François was seen stealing from below, and staggering from gun to gun, {{to a place}} in the centre of the ship, where he habitually took the air, in good weather, and where he might dispose of his person, equally without presuming too far on the good-nature of his superiors, and without courting too much intimacy with the coarser herd who composed the common crew.|$|E
60|$|At last--it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> bright <b>days</b> {{in the end}} of February, {{when the}} sun is shining with a promise of {{approaching}} spring.

60|$|It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> May <b>days</b> that ape {{the light}} and heat of summer, and I {{remember}} disconnectedly {{quite a number of}} brightly lit figures and groups walking about, and a white gate between orchard and garden and a large lawn with an oak tree and a red Georgian house with a verandah and open French windows, through which the tea drinking had come out upon the moss-edged flagstones even as Mrs. Seddon had planned.|$|R
60|$|And though Martyn {{was gone}} back to school, the child felt the wrench from home most severely.

The sedges were still a greenish yellow.|$|E
60|$|Wednesday, September 13th.--There was a frost {{the night}} before last, {{according}} to George Prescott; but no effects of it were visible in our garden. Last night, however, there was another, which has nipped {{the leaves of the}} winter-squashes and cucumbers, but seems to have done no other damage.

60|$|I rose {{late and}} breakfasted at my leisure. The {{peace of the}} English country inn enveloped me as I tilted back my chair and smoked the first pipe of the morning.

The sun streamed in through the open window. In the yard below fowls made their soothing music. The thought of violence seemed very alien to such a morning.|$|E
60|$|At length, {{the time}} drew near when Caligula {{was to leave}} Rome to proceed to Alexandria in Egypt, and the conspirators {{perceived}} that they must prepare to act, or else abandon their design altogether. It had been arranged that {{there was to be}} a grand celebration at Rome previous to the emperor's departure. This celebration, which was to consist of games, and sports, and dramatic performances of various kinds, was to continue for three days, and the conspirators determined, after much consultation and debate, that Caligula should be assassinated on <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E

60|$|We {{were soon}} {{equipped}} and went out. It was a sombre day, and drops of chill rain fell at intervals. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> colourless <b>days</b> when everything looks heavy and harsh. The houses frowned at us, the dust rose at us, the smoke swooped at us, nothing made any compromise about itself or wore a softened aspect. I fancied my beautiful girl quite {{out of place}} in the rugged streets, and I thought there were more funerals passing along the dismal pavements than I had ever seen before.|$|R

[...] "Era la stagione nella quale la rivestita terra, più che tutto l' altro anno, si mostra bella," [...] he said, without other salutation, throwing his soft gray hat on a heap of magazines and newspapers in the corner, and finding what perch he could for himself on the window-sill.|$|R
