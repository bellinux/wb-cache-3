Depending on the mature {{size and the}} purpose for which the onion is used, these may be {{referred}} to as pearl, boiler, or pickler <b>onions,</b> but differ from true pearl <b>onions</b> which are a different species. Pearl and boiler <b>onions</b> may be cooked as a vegetable rather than as an ingredient and pickler <b>onions</b> are often preserved in vinegar as a long-lasting relish.|$|E
5|$|Common <b>onions</b> are {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown <b>onions</b> (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} <b>onions</b> of choice for everyday use. Yellow <b>onions</b> turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White <b>onions</b> are the traditional <b>onions</b> used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E
5|$|Cooking <b>onions</b> {{and sweet}} <b>onions</b> are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking <b>onions</b> have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet <b>onions</b> one to two weeks. Cooking <b>onions</b> will absorb odours from apples and pears.

5|$|This group {{contains}} {{shallots and}} potato <b>onions,</b> {{also referred to}} as multiplier <b>onions.</b> The bulbs are smaller than those of common <b>onions,</b> and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs. They are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. Shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. They form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. Potato <b>onions</b> differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened (onion-like) shape. However, intermediate forms exist.|$|E
5|$|Traces of <b>onions</b> {{recovered}} from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that <b>onions</b> {{were used as}} far back as 5000 BCE, not only for their flavour, but the bulb's durability to store and transport.

40|$|The <b>onion</b> thrips (Thrips tabaci Lindeman) {{has been}} {{known for a long time}} as a pest of <b>onion.</b> The damage hinders the {{development}} of the <b>onion,</b> causing the plant to end its development earlier than usual, so there may be a decrease in crop yield, too.

5|$|Most of the {{diversity}} within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. The majority of cultivars grown for dry bulbs, salad <b>onions,</b> and pickling <b>onions</b> belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour. Common <b>onions</b> range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet <b>onions,</b> such as the Vidalia from Georgia, USA, or Walla Walla from Washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.|$|E
