5|$|Greb (Alex Diakun) {{shares his}} tale, of a {{television}} censor called Waylon Figgleif. Figgleif's overzealous approach to censorship leads Greb to try pushing his limits. Greb assumed {{the form of a}} small demonic baby and reveals himself to Figgleif, who breaks down and starts attempting to censor everyday life. Greb repeats this trick, and encourages Figgleif to go on a killing spree—Figgleif takes a gun, bursts onto the taping of a science-fiction show about alien abduction, and kills several actors. Greb's methods and effectiveness are dismissed until he reveals the story's epigram. Figgleif's spree was caught <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> broadcast by another network as a found footage special. However, Greb also notes that he too was spotted by Black during this.|$|E
5|$|Thomas filmed a twelve-minute teaser for his {{new concept}} and {{presented}} it to The CW. The teaser was later released on the Veronica Mars third season DVD and the internet. The clip begins in medias res with Veronica, {{pretending to be a}} high schooler, talking to a teacher. The teaser flashes back to her first FBI meeting, and the viewers discover that she is investigating the teacher for sexual abuse allegations. She successfully catches the teacher <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> at the FBI, she runs into a former acquaintance named Seth. She investigates a potential bomber with another novice agent, and they speak to a man who appears to be innocent. However, he points a gun at Veronica's partner as the clip ends.|$|E
5|$|Vaseegaran prepares Chitti for an {{evaluation}} by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which {{is headed by}} Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's neural schema to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Chitti becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions.|$|E

25|$|On {{a memorable}} evening in 1953, up and coming New York TV {{personality}} Steve Allen was a last-minute replacement for Godfrey on Talent Scouts. When {{it came time}} to deliver the live commercial for Lipton tea and soups, Allen impulsively prepared the soup and tea <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> poured both into a ukulele. Shaking the mixture well, he played a few damp notes while reciting the rest of the commercial. Allen became a national celebrity and within the year he would become the first host of NBC's Tonight Show.|$|E
25|$|The setting {{has been}} heavily updated from its last event book series, Firestorm, which covered {{the opening of}} the Fourth Corporate War. The {{aftermath}} of the Fourth Corporate War has resulted in widespread corruption of the Net and major losses of hardcopied data, to the point that all data is intangible and recent recorded history is in doubt. An example that pops up in Pondsmith's demos at conventions, releases on the Internet, and in the finished game is that history has become so corrupted that many people in the world now believe Richard Nixon, instead of resigning over Watergate, committed suicide <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> that memes such as the moon landing being hoaxed become prevalent.|$|E

25|$|Vigo {{worked with}} {{established}} movie stars {{for the first}} time, who were hired by Gaumont but approved of by Vigo. Michel Simon had been a lead actor since appearing {{in the title role}} of Jean Renoir's Boudu Saved from Drowning. Simon stated that he accepted the role for the little-known and already controversial Vigo because he sympathized with Vigo and wanted to help his troubled career. Dita Parlo was a minor star who had just returned to France after six years in Germany. Jean Dasté had only appeared in Zero for Conduct and Boudu Saved from Drowning before his lead role, but went on to have a long career in France. Louis Lefèbvre had previously appeared in Zero for Conduct. Vigo was familiar with Lefèbvre's lack of acting training and awkwardness <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> worked those characteristics into his character in order to make Lefèbvre's performance work.|$|E
25|$|In {{the final}} scene, Rosie is {{waiting in the}} flat ready. She has been {{reassured}} {{that she will be}} watched <b>on</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> help will come if there's any trouble. She is in the company of Tommy Angel, an ex-SAS bodyguard who makes wildly optimistic passes at Rosie, such as suggesting that many people find this sort of danger arousing. Tommy then asks Rosie to hit him on the head to show how tough he is. Rosie does so, and Tommy instantly falls unconscious, out of view. Seconds later, Edna calls at the door. Rosie plays the part of Joanna well, and hands over the case of money from a hidden compartment in a table as soon as she sees the drugs. Unfortunately, when Edna inspects the briefcase, it is full of cut newspaper instead of money. Even though Rosie knows nothing about it, Edna tries to punish Rosie by spraying acid in her eyes. After a struggle, Edna catches her and is about to do the deed when Tracy comes in and brutally incapacitates her.|$|E
25|$|Immediately after Savile's death, Meirion Jones and Liz Mackean {{from the}} BBC {{programme}} Newsnight began to investigate {{reports that he}} had sexually abused children. They interviewed one alleged victim <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> talked {{to a number of}} others who were willing to be quoted about alleged abuse at Duncroft Approved School near London, the BBC, and Stoke Mandeville hospital. The headmistress of Duncroft was Meirion Jones's own aunt, Margaret Jones. The Newsnight team, which included former police detective Mark Williams-Thomas, also found out about the Surrey police investigation into Savile. The report was scheduled for broadcast on 7 December 2011, but a decision was taken to cancel its transmission, which ultimately developed into a major crisis for the BBC when the ITV documentary was screened in October 2012. The subsequent Pollard Review found that Jones and MacKean assembled cogent evidence that Savile had a history of abusing young women and Newsnight {{was in a position to}} break the story in 2011. No mention of the dropped Newsnight report was made in public at the time.|$|E

500|$|The author {{describes}} a 2004 event where Tom Cruise {{was awarded the}} organization's Medal of Valor from David Miscavige, the video of which was leaked to the Internet in January 2008. Initially, the video intended for the event featured Cruise and other celebrities including Will Smith appearing <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> praising the actor. Miscavige disapproved and instructed Scientology staff to create a video where Cruise would speak about himself and his views on being a Scientologist. [...] "Dave Miscavige later said that his Tom Cruise video {{was one of the}} most important videos that had ever been produced," [...] writes Headley.|$|E
500|$|The Stork Club was a {{television}} series hosted by Billingsley, who circulated among the tables interviewing {{guests at the}} club. Originally sponsored by Fatima cigarettes, the series ran from 1950 to 1955. The show was directed by Yul Brynner, who was {{a television}} director {{before he became a}} well-known actor. The program began on CBS Television with the network having built a replica of the Cub Room on the Stork Club's sixth floor to serve as the set for the show. [...] Billingsley was paid $12,000 each week as its host, but he was never really comfortable <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> it was noticeable. The television show moved to ABC by 1955.|$|E
500|$|... "Sally" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creators James Bobin, Jemaine Clement, and Bret McKenzie, the latter two {{starring}} as the titular Flight of the Conchords. Bobin directed the episode. The episode {{is the first of}} the series to feature Rachel Blanchard as Sally. The character returns to disrupt Bret and Jemaine's lives in the fifth episode, [...] "Sally Returns". In [...] "Sally", the character Mel shows Bret that she carries around a picture of Jemaine's lips in her wallet. This was inspired by an incident that happened to the band during the filming of their documentary A Texan Odyssey which covered their trip to the 2006 South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas. The incident was caught <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> is included in the documentary. Judah Friedlander has a cameo appearance in this episode, playing the role of the man who tries to sell Dave a cake.|$|E

500|$|While filming in St. Louis and Detroit, Reitman {{placed an}} ad in the paper asking if people who {{recently}} lost their job wanted to be in a documentary about job loss. He specified [...] "documentary" [...] in the ad so that actors would not respond. Reitman was amazed by how many people of different age, race, and gender were willing to speak frankly about what happened and what a cathartic experience it had been. The film crew received a startling 100 responses, including 60 people filmed (30 in Detroit and 30 in St. Louis). Twenty-two are seen in the film. The interviews ran for about ten minutes on {{what it is like to}} lose their job in this poor economy, and after that they would [...] "fire" [...] them <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> ask them to either respond the way they did the day they lost their job or, if they preferred, the way they wished they had responded.|$|E
500|$|Sarah Stegall {{proposed}} that the episode works on two separate layers. On the top-most superficial layer, it functions as an outright parody, mimicking both the stylings of The X-Files as well as Cops. However, on the other layer, she notes that [...] "it's a serious look at validation." [...] Throughout the episode, Mulder is attempting to capture the monster <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> expose it to a national audience. However, all of the witnesses to the monster function as unreliable narrators: a Hispanic woman with [...] "a history of medications", a homosexual [...] "Drama Queen", a prostitute, a [...] "terrified morgue attendant, and Deputy Wetzel. Stegall argues {{that all of these}} characters are from [...] "the wrong side of the tracks" [...] and would not be accepted, let alone believed, by [...] "a placid, middle-class society". In the end, the only reliable witness is the camera, but Stegall points out that [...] "the camera, suspiciously, never quite manages to find [...]" [...] Furthermore, she reasons that Mulder's biggest fear is not finding the monster. To back this idea up, she points out that Mulder not only fails to find what he is looking for, but he also fails before a live audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{witnesses}} uncovered {{during the}} production of [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] appeared at the inquest, which began on 6 September. One of the first civilians to give evidence was Allen Feraday, an explosives expert {{who worked for the}} Ministry of Defence (MoD); he confirmed Styles' contribution to the documentary—that the IRA had not been known to use a remote-detonated bomb without a direct line of sight to their target. The various expert witnesses at the inquest disagreed as to whether a detonation signal could have reached the parked Renault from the scenes of the shootings. Multiple eyewitnesses gave evidence {{over the course of the}} inquest. Four gave evidence which broadly supported the official version of events; in particular, none saw the soldiers shoot McCann, Savage, or Farrell while they were on the ground. The witnesses from [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] also appeared. Stephen Bullock told the coroner that he saw McCann and Savage raise their hands before seeing the SAS shoot them at point-blank range. Josie Celecia's evidence—that she saw a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground—was stringently challenged by government lawyers, who pointed out that her account had changed somewhat since she had appeared <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> that she was unable to identify the SAS soldiers from photographs taken by her husband.|$|E

500|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in London in May in {{what became}} known as the [...] "Victoria Station incident". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was {{captured}} <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> published in NME. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. [...] "I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism... I'd discovered King Arthur". According to playwright Alan Franks, writing later in The Times, [...] "he was indeed 'deranged'. He had some very bad experiences with hard drugs." [...] Bowie's cocaine addiction, which had caused these controversies, had much to do with his time living in Los Angeles, a city which alienated him hugely. Discussing his flirtations with fascism in a 1980 interview with NME, Bowie explained that Los Angeles was [...] "where it had all happened. The fucking place should be wiped off the face of the Earth. To be anything to do with rock and roll and go and live in Los Angeles is, I think, just heading for disaster. It really is." ...|$|E
