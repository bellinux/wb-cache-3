5|$|Still {{in pursuit}} of the debris <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges.

The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy.</b> Taking with him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E

On 19 February 1868, Brazilian ironclads successfully made a passage up the Paraguay River under heavy fire, gaining full control {{of the river and}} isolating Humaitá from resupply by water.|$|E

Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred.

On 12 July Nelson was {{at one of the}} forward batteries early in the morning when a shot struck one of the sandbags protecting the position, spraying stones and sand. Nelson was struck by debris in his right eye and was forced to retire from the position, although his wound was soon bandaged and he returned to action. By 18 July most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>enemy</b> positions had been disabled, and that night Stuart, supported by Nelson, stormed the main defensive position and captured it. Repositioning their guns, the British brought Calvi under constant bombardment, and the town surrendered on 10 August.
