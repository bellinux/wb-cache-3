Five {{days before the}} first show, Menza was {{replaced}} by Shawn Drover, who remained with the band as a regular member. The band toured the US with Exodus and Europe with Diamond Head and Dungeon.

5|$|The discography <b>of</b> <b>Iced</b> Earth, an American {{heavy metal}} band, {{consists}} of twelve studio releases, two live albums, three compilations, five singles, three videos, and ten music videos. Originally formed as Purgatory by guitarist Jon Schaffer on January 20, 1985, the band {{spent five years}} playing live locally and went through several line-up changes. After changing their name to Iced Earth, the band recorded the demo Enter the Realm(1989), which landed them {{a deal with the}} German label, Century Media Records. One year later, the band recorded their self-titled album Iced Earth, followed by 1991's Night of the Stormrider, which peaked at number60 on the Japanese Oricon charts. Three years later, Iced Earth released Burnt Offerings, featuring new vocalist Matthew Barlow, followed by The Dark Saga(1996).|$|E

40|$|Results of {{theoretical}} and experimental studies on failure <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> during short-time creep {{are reported in}} this work. Deformation and failure <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> under applied load are treated as a stochastic process composed of discrete events of the occurrence and development of microdefects in the crystal structure <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> Models <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> deformation have been developed in which the magnitude and duration of stresses and the dependence on temperature have been taken into account. The functional relation between the microprocess of the accumulation of brittle structural defects and the macroprocess <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> deformation has been confirmed. The possibility of monitoring and predicting the stress strain state <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> masses {{with the help of}} acoustic emission records has been demonstrated. It has been established that the fundamental theoretical propositions are applicable to vibrocreep and to failure <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> under cyclic loads. The results of dynamic loading experiments confirm that the processes <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> failure during static and dynamic loading are essentially similar, and that the maximum number of structural defects is the proper criterion <b>of</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> This monograph is intended for specialists dealing with physico-mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> under failure loads.

Her medical chart contained a note that [...] "she apparently has been trying to keep her weight down with dieting by herself, drinking liquids most of the time during the day and drinking about 10–15 glasses <b>of</b> <b>iced</b> tea." [...] Upon admission to the hospital, she was noted as suffering from hypokalemia (low potassium levels): her serum potassium level was an abnormally low 2.0mEq/L (the normal range for adults is 3.5–5.0mEq/L). Her sodium and calcium levels were normal. Electrolyte imbalance is often caused by drinking excessive fluids. A serious consequence of hypokalemia can be heart rhythm abnormalities, including sudden arrhythmia death syndrome. Terri was eventually switched from being fed by a nasogastric feeding tube to a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding tube.|$|E

500|$|Guy of Lusignan and Raynald {{were among}} the prisoners who were brought before Saladin. Saladin handed a cup <b>of</b> <b>iced</b> rose water to Guy. After {{drinking}} from the cup, the king handed it to Raynald. Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani (who was present) recorded that Raynald drank from the cup. Since customary law prescribed {{that a man who}} gave food or drink to a prisoner could not murder him, Saladin stated that it was Guy who had given the cup to Raynald. Saladin called Raynald to his tent. He accused him of many crimes (including brigandage and blasphemy), offering him to choose between conversion to Islam or death, according to Imad ad-Din and Ibn al-Athir. After Raynald flatly refused to convert, Saladin took a sword and struck Raynald with it. Raynald fell to the ground and Saladin beheaded him for the honour of Islam. The reliability of the reports of Saladin's offer to Raynald is subject to a scholarly debate, because the Muslim authors who recorded them may have only wanted to improve Saladin's image. Ernoul's chronicle and the Estoire de Eracles recounted the events ending with Raynald's execution in almost the same language as the Muslim authors. However, according to Ernoul's chronicle, Raynald refused to drink from the cup that Guy of Lusignan handed to him. [...] According to Ernoul, Raynald's head was struck off by Saladin's mamluks and it was brought to Damascus to be [...] "dragged along the ground to show the Saracens, whom the prince had wronged, that vengeance had been exacted". Baha ad-Din also wrote that Raynald's fate shocked Guy of Lusignan, but Saladin soon comforted him, stating that [...] "A king does not kill a king, but that man's perfidy and insolence went too far".|$|E

It {{was up to the}} patron to prepare the drink, as the inclusion or omission of sugar was strictly an individual preference, as was the amount of water used. [...] As the popularity of the drink increased, additional accoutrements of preparation appeared, including the absinthe fountain, which was effectively a large jar <b>of</b> <b>iced</b> water with spigots, mounted on a lamp base. This let drinkers prepare a number of drinks at once—and with a hands-free drip, patrons could socialise while louching a glass.|$|E

40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. The boundaries <b>of</b> land-fast <b>ice,</b> distribution <b>of</b> pack <b>ice,</b> and major polynya were {{studied in the}} vicinity of the Bering Strait. Movement <b>of</b> pack <b>ice</b> during 24 hours was determined by plotting the distinctly identifiable ice floes on ERTS- 1 imagery obtained from two consecutive passes. Considerably large shallow area along the western Seward Peninsula just north of the Bering Strait is covered by land fast ice. This ice hinders the movement <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> formed in eastern Chukchi Sea southward through the Bering Strait. The movement <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> along the Russian coast is relatively faster. Plotting of some <b>of</b> the <b>ice</b> floes indicated movement <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> in excess <b>of</b> 30 km in and south of the Bering Strait between 6 and 7 March, 1973.
