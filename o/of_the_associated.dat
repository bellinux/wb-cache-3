Florida received high wind gusts, heavy rainfall, and strong surf that resulted in the deaths of three swimmers. 20,000homes in the state lost electricity. The heavy rainfall progressed into Georgia, where significant flooding occurred. Crop damage was extensive, and about 335 structures were damaged by the flooding.
