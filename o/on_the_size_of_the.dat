5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form {{in the theory of}} modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved is complicated. Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E

5|$|The {{nationwide}} census {{conducted in}} 2 AD, listed 1,587 counties. The Han county was the smallest political division containing a centrally appointed official.

Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> county, the Prefect's salary-rank was 600-dan or 1,000-dan, while a Chief was ranked at 300-dan or 500-dan.

The county's head civil servants, usually respected scholars or elders in their local communities, were appointed directly by the Magistrate.|$|E

5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If the damage is early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E
