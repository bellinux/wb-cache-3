5|$|Cats {{who live}} <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander {{into the forest}} to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E

5|$|Fairywrens exhibit one of {{the highest}} incidences of extra-pair mating, and many broods are brought up a by male who is not the natural father.

In contrast, black-plumaged males on Barrow and Dirk Hartog islands often carry blue petals. While petal-carrying <b>outside</b> <b>of</b> clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females is occurring, further genetic analysis is necessary.|$|E
