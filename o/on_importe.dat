For the last 18 months or so I have been involved with planning and research for a museum exhibit on life in industrial villages and company towns, especially in the Middle Atlantic region. In its life and death Sparrows ' Point serves as a vivid illustration of the cardinal traits of the company town [...] the total involvement of the company in the affairs of the community and the subordination of community to corporate needs and goals.

It therefore begs a difficult but relevant question: why is the {{regional integration}} process stalling? The conventional answer lies in challenges such as inadequate financial resources and infrastructure for trade among others. However, this paper proposes an approach to regional integration refocused on resource-based industrialisation. A recent UNECA survey found that several Member states believed that regional integration does not contribute significantly to job creation and regional value chains. Resource-based industrialisation could contribute to job creation and inclusive growth if properly managed. We examine the industrialisation level in Africa using Balassa’s Revealed Comparative Advantage Indexes based on the BACI dataset. Further, we evaluate Kenya’s trade in intermediate inputs vital for industrialisation, using an input-output table analysis on production, based on GTAP 8 dataset. Regional analyses of five African Regions triangulated the Kenya results. The analysis finds that while the level of industrialisation is heterogeneous among African economies, the overall level is low. Also, {{in the case of}} Kenya, the manufacturing sector spends significant amounts <b>on</b> <b>importe...</b>|$|E
