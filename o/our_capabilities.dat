40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is to review the {{scientific}} researches carried out {{before and after the}} Umbria-Marche sequence related to the earthquake forecasting/prediction in Italy. In particular, I focus the attention on models that aim addressing three main practical questions: was (is) Umbria-Marche a region with high probability of occurrence of a destructive earthquake? Was a precursory activity recorded before the mainshock(s) ? What was <b>our</b> <b>capability</b> to model the spatio-temporal-magnitude evolution of that seismic sequence? The models are reviewed pointing out what we have learned after the Umbria-Marche earthquakes, in terms of physical understanding of earthquake occurrence process, and of improving <b>our</b> <b>capability</b> to forecast earthquakes and to track in real-time seismic sequences...|$|R

The minimum of scrutiny should have revealed that the structure of the bombs placed in Dublin and Monaghan were similar if not identical to those being placed in Northern Ireland on an almost daily basis.

To suggest that the UVF were not, or are not, capable of operating in the manner outlined in the programme is tempting fate to a dangerous degree.|$|E
60|$|Phineas, when {{he arrived}} at the hall door, almost doubted whether he had not been as wrong in visiting Lord Brentford as he had in going to Loughlinter. His {{friendship}} with the old Earl had been very fitful, and there had been quarrels quite as pronounced as the friendship. He had often been happy in the Earl's house, but the happiness had not sprung from any love for the man himself. How would it be with him if he found the Earl hardly more civil to him than the Earl's son-in-law had been? In former days the Earl had been a man quite capable of making himself disagreeable, and probably had not yet lost the power of doing so. Of all <b>our</b> <b>capabilities</b> this is the one which clings longest to us. He was thinking of all this when he found himself at the door of the Earl's house. He had travelled all night, and was very cold. At Leipsic there had been a nominal twenty minutes for refreshment, which the circumstances of the station had reduced to five. This had occurred very early in the morning, and had sufficed only to give him a bowl of coffee. It was now nearly ten, and breakfast had become a serious consideration with him. He almost doubted whether it would not have been better for him to have gone to an hotel in the first instance.|$|E

40|$|We {{have created}} {{practical}} simulation tools {{to examine the}} atomic scale processes involved in ion irradiation of materials, and we exemplify <b>our</b> <b>capability</b> with two examples relevant to semiconductor processing. The examples are based on silicon substrates; however <b>our</b> <b>capability</b> is flexible, and can therefore be applied to study similar processes in other materials. We have developed a `restricted' molecular dynamics (MD) code to simulate the ion implant process and directly calculate dopant profiles. This gives us the accuracy obtained by time integrating atom paths, whilst obtaining an efficiency far in excess of full MD simulation. The mechanical response of Si to ion-irradiation, has been examined by utilizing the method of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation. This enables us to determine mechanisms by which the material relaxes in order to accomodate the structural changes due to damage and amorphization by ion bombardment.
