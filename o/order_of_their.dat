The power struggle between the Finnish estates and the Russian administration gave a concrete role model and free space for the labor movement. On the other side, due to at least a century-long tradition and experience of administrative leadership, the Finnish elite saw itself as the inherent natural power.|$|E

5|$|Each NBA and WNBA {{franchise}} {{seeks to}} add new players through their respective annual draft. The NBA uses a draft lottery {{to determine the}} first three picks of the NBA draft; the 14teams that {{did not make the}} playoffs the previous year are eligible to participate. After the first three picks are decided, the rest of the teams pick in reverse <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> win–loss record. To be eligible for the NBA Draft, a player in the United States must be at least 19years old during the calendar year of the draft and must be at least one year removed from the graduation of his high school class. From 1967 until the ABA–NBA merger in 1976, the American Basketball Association (ABA) held its own draft. The WNBA Draft is similar to the NBA with a couple of exceptions. Only fourWNBA teams are eligible for the draft lottery, compared to the 14 eligible teams in the NBA. Also, all non-playoff teams that participate in the draft lottery select their picks in the order of the lottery outcome; the remainder of the league selects in reverse <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> win–loss record. The WNBA requires that players be at least 22years old during the calendar year of the applicable seasons, have either graduated from a four-year university or have completed their intercollegiate basketball eligibility, or have played at least two seasons for another professional basketball league.|$|E

While many actions the player takes are compulsory and central to the story, The Lost Age allows the player to complete many objectives in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> choice, visiting previous locations to advance story elements and complete gameplay objectives are given a stronger emphasis than in the previous game.|$|E

The exact dating is known only for Cave 3, which is a temple dedicated to Vishnu. An inscription found here records the dedication of the shrine by Mangalesha in Saka 500 (lunar calendar, 578/579CE). The inscription, written in the old Kannada language, has enabled the dating of these rock cave temples to the 6th century.|$|E
5|$|The first 14 {{picks in}} the draft belonged to teams that had missed the playoffs; the order was {{determined}} through a lottery.

The remaining first-round picks and the second-round picks were assigned to teams in reverse <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> win-loss record in the previous season. As it is commonplace {{in the event of}} identical win-loss records, the NBA performed a random drawing to break the ties on April 18, 2008.|$|E

5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, the life span of these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Contestants' {{responses}} are revealed in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. A correct response adds {{the amount of}} the contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it. The contestant with the highest score {{at the end of the}} round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.|$|E
5|$|Following {{this the}} routine of the {{battalion}} became more settled and time was found for the men of each company to spend a fortnight at a hotel on the Lignano beach. Afterwards, preparations began for the battalion's return to New Zealand. The war with Japan continued however, {{and at the time}} it was believed that the Māoris would take part in further operations in the Pacific. New Zealand policy at the time was that long serving men were to be repatriated and their places taken by men with less time in service. In this regard, commencing in late May, drafts of men departed in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> arrival at the battalion. This included the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Arapeta Awatere, who was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel James Henare.|$|E
