5|$|Nosanchuk then {{considered}} {{whether or}} not to call Lamb to the stand <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>behalf</b> at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.|$|E
5|$|On several {{occasions}} {{over the course}} of the trial, the prosecution showed films of the concentration camps and other atrocities. Everyone present, including Göring, found the contents of the films shocking; he said that the films must have been faked. Witnesses, including Paul Koerner and Erhard Milch, tried to portray Göring as a peaceful moderate. Milch stated it had been impossible to oppose Hitler or disobey his orders; to do so would likely have meant death for oneself and one's family. When testifying <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>behalf,</b> Göring emphasised his loyalty to Hitler, and claimed to know nothing about what had happened in the concentration camps, which were under Himmler's control. He gave evasive, convoluted answers to direct questions and had plausible excuses for all his actions during the war. He used the witness stand as a venue to expound at great length on his own role in the Reich, attempting to present himself as a peacemaker and diplomat before the outbreak of the war. During cross-examination, chief prosecutor Robert H. Jackson read out the minutes of a meeting that had been held shortly after Kristallnacht, a major pogrom in November 1938. At the meeting, Göring had plotted to confiscate Jewish property in the wake of the pogrom. Later, David Maxwell-Fyfe proved it was impossible for Göring not to have known about the Stalag Luft III murdersthe shooting of fifty airmen who had been recaptured after escaping from Stalag Luft IIIin time to have prevented the killings. He also presented clear evidence that Göring knew about the extermination of the Hungarian Jews.|$|E

Marsh went to Rome in 1213, to negotiate <b>on</b> both <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>behalf</b> and <b>on</b> <b>his</b> king's behalf, and succeeded in getting much more lenient terms from the pope than had originally been given. He served as Chancellor from 29 October 1214 until his death. However, his title was mostly honorary after his election as a bishop, for he no longer attended court all the time, and Ralph Neville, who had custody of the king's seal, {{did most of the}} actual work of {{the office of}} chancellor.|$|R

25|$|What, by contrast, can be {{established}} is that from 1911 onwards the term became commonplace and, initially confined {{as it was to}} the painters of Room 41, it was afterwards attributed to those who seemed, nearly or at a distance, to approach them, in appearance if not in spirit. Apollinaire himself was initially reticent about this label and it was not until later, after this opening at the Indépendants, during an exhibition which we held at Brussels, that he accepted definitively <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> and our <b>behalf,</b> the name 'Cubist' by which all sorts of people had designated us in irony.

He lost in the Indiana General Assembly by one vote and was defeated by former governor William Hendricks.|$|E

25|$|After {{having served}} with the French Navy in Indochina and in French Algeria, Denard served as a colonial {{policeman}} in Morocco from 1952 to 1957. In 1954, {{he was convicted of}} an assassination plot against Prime Minister Pierre Mendès-France, a left-wing member of the Radical-Socialist Party who was negotiating the end of the Indochina War and withdrawal from Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, and served 14 months in jail. An adamant anti-communist, Denard then took part in many anti-colonialist conflicts, simultaneously <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>behalf</b> and on the behalf of the French state. Once he was freed from jail, he worked for the French secret services during the war in Algeria.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to the weakening of the original fugitive slave act, the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 penalized officials who did not arrest an alleged runaway slave, and made them {{liable to a fine}} of $1,000 (about $ in present-day value). Law-enforcement officials everywhere were required to arrest people suspected of being a runaway slave on as little as a claimant's sworn testimony of ownership. The suspected slave could not ask for a jury trial or testify <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>own</b> <b>behalf.</b> In addition, any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was subject to six months' imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Officers who captured a fugitive slave were entitled to a bonus or promotion for their work.|$|R

In England and Wales they are known as litigation friends. When a relative who is next of kin acts as a next friend for a person, that person is sometimes instead described as the natural guardian of the person. A next friend has full power over the proceedings in the action as if he or she were an ordinary plaintiff, until a guardian or guardian ad litem is appointed in the case; but the next friend is entitled to present evidence only on the same basis as any other witness.|$|R

25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the prosecutor's closing argument, Judge Akubzhanov invited Chikatilo back into the courtroom, before formally asking him whether he would like to make a final statement <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>behalf.</b> In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute. Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass final sentence upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest. When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.|$|E
25|$|Rickhey was exonerated by {{statements}} of past employees and written interrogations of his engineering colleagues – only {{the testimony of}} one former engineer was incriminating. Witnesses offered by the prosecution made only vague statements about his activities in camp operations because they had generally not personally witnessed it. Written evidence of Rickhey's guilt was also lacking; only {{after the end of}} the trial were documents found showing his culpability in the inhumane working conditions in the Mittelwork. Rickhey testified <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>behalf</b> and put the entire responsibility for the inhumane conditions and forced labor on the late internment engineer Albin Sawatzki, who had died in American detention in 1945. Furthermore, he pointed to his cooperation with the U.S. Air Force (USAF) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

At the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885 the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving {{the lives of the}} native inhabitants. From the beginning, however, Leopold essentially ignored these conditions. He ran the Congo using the mercenary Force Publique for his personal enrichment. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death, to preserve them for Belgium.|$|E
50|$|The {{most serious}} charges {{involved}} coal {{development in the}} Chugach National Forest by a Seattle developer and Ballinger crony, Charles Cunningham, and financed by a corporation associated with J.P. Morgan and the Guggenheim family of New York City. The group had staked 33 claims, although Alaska land laws were designed to foster small farmers and prevent monopoly and thus required each claimant {{to prove that he}} or she was acting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>own</b> <b>behalf,</b> as well as limited each claimant to 160 acres. While land commissioner, Ballinger granted the developer special access to government files. During the several month gap in 1908 between his employment as land commissioner and interior secretary, Ballinger acted as an agent for the Cunningham/Morgan/Guggenheim development group with the federal government, lobbying then Interior Secretary Jim Garfield. Upon becoming Interior Secretary, Ballinger reassigned General Land Office investigator Louis R. Glavis, and ultimately fired him after he complained to Gifford Pinchot (head of the Forestry Bureau and thus responsible for the Chugach, although also subordinate to the Interior Secretary), President Taft and cooperated with the press.|$|R
50|$|In some {{countries}} with presidential or similar systems {{in which the}} roles of head of state and head of government are merged, the chief executive's annual speech to the legislative branch is imbued {{with some of the}} ceremonial weight of a parliamentary state opening. The most well-known example is the State of the Union Address in the United States. Other examples include the State of the Nation Address in the Philippines, a former American dependency. These speeches differ from a State Opening in at least two respects, however: they do not in fact open the legislative session, and they are delivered by the chief executive <b>on</b> <b>his</b> or her <b>own</b> <b>behalf.</b> In Poland, the President of Poland delivers his speech to Sejm and Senat at the First Sitting of these Houses which is similar to Speech from the Throne. It is rather a custom than a law. Most Presidents of Poland delivered the Speech to the Parliament. The exception was in 2007, when President Lech Kaczyński instead of addressing the Sejm he watched the First Sitting of the 6th term Sejm from the Presidential box in the Press gallery.|$|R

25|$|William Bolts (1739–1808) was a Dutch-born {{eighteenth-century}} merchant {{active in}} India. He {{began his career}} as an employee of the British East India Company, and subsequently became an independent merchant. He is best known today for his 1772 book, Considerations on India Affairs, which detailed the exploitation and despoliation of Bengal by the East India Company which began shortly after the Battle of Plassey in 1757. The observations and experiences he recorded offer a unique resource for scholars inquiring into the nature of early British rule in Bengal. Throughout his life, Bolts continued to propose and execute various trading ventures <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>behalf</b> and in conjunction with various commercial and governmental partners. The ventures of individual traders like Bolts did much to spur governments and large corporations into the expansion of their own interests and empires.|$|E

At the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885, the colonial nations of Europe authorized his claim by committing the Congo Free State to improving the lives of the native inhabitants. From the beginning, however, Leopold ignored these conditions and millions of Congolese inhabitants, including children, were mutilated and killed. He ran the Congo using the mercenary Force Publique for his personal enrichment. He used great sums of the money from this exploitation for public and private construction projects in Belgium during this period. He donated the private buildings to the state before his death.|$|E
25|$|Riggins was {{evaluated}} and found competent to stand trial, {{with one of}} the three evaluating psychiatrists dissenting. Riggins stated he planned to present an insanity defense and requested that the Mellaril be discontinued until after the trial so that the jury would see his mental state first hand rather than be given a false impression induced by the medication, which would deny him due process. The court heard testimony from three psychiatrists with differing opinions and then gave a one-page decision denying Riggins' request but giving no rationale for the denial. Riggins testified <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>behalf</b> during the trial, claiming that Wade was trying to kill him and that voices in his head told him that killing Wade was justified as self-defense. The jury found Riggins guilty of murder and robbery with a deadly weapon, and sentenced him to death.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{requirement}} that the profit be directly made from the fiduciary position, merely {{in a way that}} causes a conflict between the fiduciary's personal interests and his duties. If a trustee was informed by the trust's stockbroker that only one parcel of highly sought-after stocks remained and chose to purchase it for himself rather than for the trust, he would be taking advantage of the trust and causing a conflict of interest. On the second issue, Boardman confirmed a defence of authorisation; if the fiduciary has informed the beneficiaries that he is and will be acting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>behalf,</b> and received permission to do so, the property would not have been held on constructive trust. The third issue is who does the fiduciary owe duties to. In Boardman the case was concerning a trust, and it was held that the duties were towards the beneficiaries. Section 170 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that in situations concerning companies, the duties of the directors and other fiduciaries are to that company.|$|E

When he sought to have Fuller testify to back up his story, the trial judge blocked him on the basis of a Texas statute which provided that [...] "persons charged or convicted as co-participants in the same crime could not testify for one another".
