The first local Union In Western Australia was formed in York, with another five soon following. By August 1891, a Colonial Union with 155 members had been established. Anna Adams Gordon wrote: [...] "The Round-the-World White Ribbon Missionaries who have since gone out under the banner of the World's WCTU are Miss Jessie Ackermann, of California, who honeycombed Australasia with local Unions, federating them into a National WCTU of their own, of which she became President ..." [...] The Woman's Christian Temperance Union of Australasia (later renamed the National Women's Christian Temperance Union of Australia) was formed on the 25th May, 1891 at a meeting held in Melbourne for the purpose of federating the existing Colonial Unions. This was probably the first interstate gathering of women's organisations held in Australia and the Union was the first national women's organization in the country.

40|$|Abstract: Several {{approaches}} for formalising prerequisite structures on skills or competencies {{based on the}} psychological theory of knowledge space have been suggested and applied for adaptive eLearning. In this paper, we will discuss how these structures may be applied in skill management in a broader sense. After introducing some formal structures for prerequisite relationships between competencies, we will briefly present {{an example of an}} adaptive eLearning system based on this approach (APeLS). Several other aspects of the system which promise to be useful for advanced skill management are discussed. In the final part of this paper, we will discuss such broader applications of the model with respect to personal as well as to <b>organisational</b> <b>skill</b> management...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the managerial role of elite women {{from a range}} of Yorkshire country houses in the eighteenth century. This group provides a very rich number of cases for this analysis. It first sets contemporary views of elite women in light of the traditional constructions of gendered roles which established a woman's position as a moral and virtuous domestic being. As one of the elite women being studied, particular attention is given to Isabella Dowager Countess of Carlisle's authorship of a work of conduct literature intended for a female readership. Hence, the permanence of household management as a theme in this literary tradition is explored as well as its gendered dimensions and categorised responsibilities as perceived by other conduct authors of similar or contrasting social status to that of Carlisle. Following the conventional precepts of eighteenth-century conduct literature, the categories of responsibility within household management form the basis of each chapter. Throughout, the elite woman's managerial presence and performance is discussed using surviving documentation such as personal correspondence, bills and receipts, account books and more general housekeeping minutiae such as lists and inventories, and books of memoranda. From these arises a complex picture of authority and deftness with which the elite woman was expected to run the household within the wider departments of the country estate through a businesslike partnership with her husband. The purpose of the thesis is to challenge eighteenth-century contemporary criticisms of elite women's involvement in her marital home by proving it to have been one of difficult decision-making, influenced at all times by degrees of moral judgement over large numbers of people. It also demonstrates the expression of power elite women could exercise within a sphere traditionally thought of as a female space. The domestic space of the country house had long been associated with feminine accomplishment in the 'delicate' art of needlework or the knowledge of pickling and preserving. In her role as household manager, this space was more heavily imbued with command, authority and <b>organisational</b> <b>skill.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} a formal cross–sectional study {{undertaken}} over three years (starting in 2002). Since that the South African entrepreneurial scenario had only recently embraced the theories of entrepreneurship and its promotion, it sought to delineate the critical elements that one would link to developing a mid–sized venture, to venture growth (VG) and to leadership provided by the founder. Research within the Information Technology (IT) sector was driven by personal experience and by studies on strategic management, leadership, risk management, opportunity recognition, resource-leveraging and optimisation strategies. The researcher also sought empirical support in management and business strategy studies, in entrepreneurial organisational learning theories, “EOLT” (what this study terms “knowledge creation” and “knowledge – sharing”), and in scientific evidence that supports thinking on venture - creation, promotion or growth. The primary {{purpose of this study}} was to (a) ascertain the depth of leadership involved in venture growth (VG) and (b) investigate whether or not founding-entrepreneurs used their leadership abilities, management strategies and skills in VG. A primary and final respondent population (N = 186) of IT company General Managers/Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) was tested. Respondents also had to be active shareholders, founders and leaders, and operationally (i. e. managerially) involved, as well. Statistical considerations were applied to (i) sample-“validity and reliability” (VR), and (ii) sample-manipulation and prescription. Adoption of a two-pronged approach led to the refinement of assumptions, and to the formulation of initial entrepreneurial leadership and venture growth propositions and hypotheses. To accommodate the given research purposes, a pilot–test was initiated amongst a sample of 20 CEOs from five different industries. An analysis of the results of this test and the additional interviews conducted resulted in (a) the refinement of the initial propositions and (b) a topology and foundations for the final testing instrument. Discussions with a subset of the test respondents resulted in the final propositions. Guided by empirical research parameters, four fundamental hypotheses were derived and tested (within the context of the variables in the final testing instrument). Construct evolution resulted in these factors: Entrepreneurial Thinking/Risk perception (F 1); Entrepreneurial Persistence (F 2); and Unique Performance (F 3). Extensive factor analysis testing was applied. The following hypothesis for F 2 was also tested: [...] H 0 : The greater the specific and general competencies of a founding entrepreneur, with regard to <b>organisational</b> <b>skill,</b> business knowledge and general past experience, the stronger the business output (i. e. success). [...] The alternate hypothesis/Ha: The weaker the specific and general competencies of a founding entrepreneur, with regard to <b>organisational</b> <b>skill,</b> business knowledge and general past experience, the weaker the business output (i. e. success). For F 2, a high percentage of variance resulted, the mean = 4. 2, the standard deviation = 0. 4, and, with the existence of strong statistical significance represented, Ha was rejected. Responses to associated variables were highly polarised. These were interpreted to be indicative of differences in the manner in which founding entrepreneurs perceived vision-establishment as an enabling tool for VG and strategy. A strong prediction for N = 162 also resulted, which here indicated that a strong relationship existed between F 2 and F 3. In relation to F 1, F 2 and F 3, the prediction also seemed to indicate that motivation and specific competencies also have paths to VG (with significant coefficients; where t > 2; and p <. 05). Direct-effect domains, such as the specific skills associated with negotiating and contracting (IT deals), indicated the strongest relation to VG. Given the relevant age of most of the founding entrepreneurs in the population (36 – 45 years), this was not an unexpected result. Although some relationships were found to exist for the other relationships of factors to the tested overall hypothesis, these tended to yield somewhat weaker than expected significances. In relation to the above hypothesis, the study found that technical skill and industry experience exhibited reasonably significant relationships to and with VG. It was also found that in South Africa a very small number of authors have attempted to integrate their thinking concerning founding entrepreneurs into EOLT and VG strategies. No longitudinal studies on the relationship between these elements could be found, and even less research was also found were the topics were tackled in combination–form. The study also concludes that there is room for more research that integrates, links and shows the relationship between VG, founding entrepreneurs and leadership.
