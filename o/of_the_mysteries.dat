5|$|Several {{texts from}} Roman times refer {{to people who}} were {{initiated}} in the Isis cult. However, the only direct description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Isis comes from Metamorphoses, also known as The Golden Ass, a comic novel from the late second century CE by the Roman author Apuleius.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a rectal prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|It was {{difficult}} for the few priests who had accompanied the Christian emigrants to South Canara to look after them properly. Thus, the Gurkar system came into existence. Gurkars were Mangalorean Catholic men of good moral character who were selected as headmen in Christian settlements. They were entrusted with the social and religious supervision of the community. After migration, the only possible occupation of a Mangalorean Catholic was agriculture, since they were skilled farmers. Every farmer practised carpentry, but it was quite primitive and unskilled, and other crafts and industries were non-existent. The mass was celebrated in Latin; but the sermon, the catechism, and the explication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> were delivered to the congregation in Konkani.|$|E

5|$|Some aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Isis and {{of other}} mystery cults, {{particularly}} their {{connection with the}} afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The {{question of whether the}} mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|E
5|$|Project A119, {{also known}} as A Study of Lunar Research Flights, was a top-secret plan {{developed}} in 1958 by the United States Air Force. The aim {{of the project was}} to detonate a nuclear bomb on the Moon which would help in answering some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> in planetary astronomy and astrogeology. If the explosive device detonated on the surface, not in a lunar crater, the flash of explosive light would have been faintly visible to people on earth with their naked eye, a show of force resulting in a possible boosting of domestic morale in the capabilities of the United States, a boost that was needed after the Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race and was also working on a similar project.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{administration}} {{was marked by}} a relative absence of major military or political conflicts, Titus faced {{a number of major}} disasters during his brief reign. On August 24, 79, barely two months after his accession, Mount Vesuvius erupted, resulting in the almost complete destruction of life and property in the cities and resort communities around the Bay of Naples. The cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were buried under metres of stone and lava, killing thousands of citizens. Titus appointed two ex-consuls to organise and coordinate the relief effort, while personally donating large amounts of money from the imperial treasury to aid the victims of the volcano. Additionally, he visited Pompeii once after the eruption and again the following year. The city was lost for nearly 1700 years before its accidental rediscovery in 1748. Since then, its excavation has provided an extraordinarily detailed insight into the life of a city {{at the height of the}} Roman Empire, frozen at the moment it was buried on August 24, 79. The Forum, the baths, many houses, and some out-of-town villas like the Villa <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mysteries</b> remain surprisingly well preserved. Today, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions of Italy and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. On-going excavations reveal new insights into the Roman history and culture.|$|E

25|$|The Rosary is a devotion for the {{meditation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mysteries</b> of Jesus and Mary.‚ÄúThe gentle {{repetition of}} its prayers {{makes it an}} excellent means to moving into deeper meditation.

The first principle is that meditation is learned through practice. Many people who practice rosary meditation begin very simply and gradually develop a more sophisticated meditation.
