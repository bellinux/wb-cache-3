5|$|A {{post office}} was {{established}} at Randolph in 1827. In 1829, a mail line was routed between Nashville and Memphis. The route went through Jackson, Bolivar, Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to deliver mail {{to the post}} offices in these towns three times per week. Randolph was {{left out of the}} main route and put at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> route of the mail line. Mail on the branch route to Randolph was delivered only once weekly. On the segment from Bolivar through Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to Memphis, the mail route roughly coincides with modern-day U.S. Route 64 (Stage Road).|$|E
5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch.</b> The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on {{the fortunes of the}} town. When the mail route was established in 1829, Randolph was put at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E

5|$|During the Victorian era, Clevedon {{became a}} popular seaside town, having {{previously}} been an agricultural village. Due to improving transport links, via the Clevedon Branch Line, Clevedon {{was able to}} cater for the late 19th century craze for bathing in the sea with saltwater baths adjacent to the pier (since demolished, though the foundations can still be seen), and bathing machines on the main beach. Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists. At Clevedon tourism grew following the opening <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> line from Yatton railway station which connected it to the Bristol to Exeter Line, enabling travel {{from the rest of}} the country. It was also proposed that a pier could form part of a route from London to South Wales with the use of steamers to cross the Severn Estuary. An enabling act was submitted to parliament in 1864.|$|E

5|$|On 20 October 1871 two {{engineers}} traversed the {{two possible}} routes from Bergen to Voss; the one via Fana, Os and Hardangerfjord, the other via Dale and Sørfjord. Though covering a less populated area, the latter would be cheaper to build, and have less elevation. A railway committee was created on 25 January 1872 {{with a limited}} mandate, which was increased again 20 December. At {{the same time there}} was a dispute between the Ministry of Labour and Pihl about whether to prioritize the Bergen Line, but in July 1872 surveys were performed in person by Pihl and two engineers, and their report was positive.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branching</b> process is completely described by the generating function of the offspring law and its fixed points. Branching random walks are <b>a</b> natural generalization <b>of</b> <b>branching</b> processes: <b>a</b> <b>branching</b> process can be seen as <b>a</b> one-dimensional <b>branching</b> random walk. We define a multidimensional generating function associated to <b>a</b> given <b>branching</b> random walk. The present paper investigates the similarities and the differences of the generating functions, their fixed points and the implications on the underlying stochastic process, between the one-dimensional (branching process) and the multidimensional case (branching random walk). In particular, we show that the generating function <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branching</b> random walk can have uncountably many fixed points and a fixed point may not be an extinction probability, even in the irreducible case (extinction probabilities are always fixed points). Moreover, the generating function might not be a convex function. We also study how the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branching</b> random walk is affected by local modifications <b>of</b> the process. <b>As</b> a corollary, we describe a general procedure by which we can modify <b>a</b> continuous-time <b>branching</b> random walk which has a weak phase and turn it into <b>a</b> continuous-time <b>branching</b> random walk which has strong local survival for large or small values of the parameter and non-strong local survival for intermediate values of the parameter...|$|R
5|$|Royton {{railway station}} {{lay at the}} end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> from Royton Junction on the Oldham Loop Line, {{which was part of}} the route which {{connected}} Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale. The station was opened in 1864 and closed in April 1966. It featured steep gradients on the line up to Royton Junction, which, in October 1908, caused an accident when a goods train ran out of control on the gradient down to the station, killing a fireman. In February 1961, a four-coach runaway train crashed through the buffers at Royton railway station and continued on over High Barn Street. Five houses were damaged. The driver of the train was injured, but there were no fatal or severe injuries to the public. Five people from the damaged houses were taken to hospital suffering from shock and bruises, and in one case a fractured clavicle.|$|E
5|$|MD 410 {{follows the}} {{northern}} edge of the town of Chevy Chase and crosses Coquellin Run, then follows the southern edge of Columbia Country Club to its intersection with MD 185 (Connecticut Avenue). The highway leaves the town of Chevy Chase and passes through an unincorporated area of Chevy Chase, within which the highway meets the northern end of MD 186 (Brookville Road) and descends into the valley of Rock Creek. At the bottom of the hill, MD 410 intersects Jones Mill Road and Beach Drive, the main road through Rock Creek Park. The state highway crosses Rock Creek, passes to the north of Meadowbrook Park and leaves the valley as a four-lane road with narrow median and flanking service roads. MD 410 reaches {{the top of the hill}} at Grubb Road and descends into the valley <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> of Rock Creek. The highway becomes undivided at Sundale Drive and crosses the stream just west of the northern corner of the District of Columbia and its attendant boundary marker, then leaves the stream valley and ascends to an intersection with MD 390 (16th Street) at the western edge of downtown Silver Spring.|$|E
5|$|Planning for a {{light rail}} system on Portland's west side started in 1979, with a {{groundbreaking}} coming in 1993 on the Westside MAX project. The line originally was to terminate at Willow Creek/185th, but lobbying by Hillsboro mayor Shirley Huffman and others secured funding to extend the line to downtown. Plans for the station originally called for the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> of the Hillsboro Public Library at the stop. Due to cost overruns when building the Robertson Tunnel through the West Hills, the library was canceled and a Books by Rail program {{was added to the}} Hillsboro Central station. TriMet also canceled plans for security cameras at the station. The park-and-ride lot opened on March 3, 1997, served by two bus lines (61 and 88), because it was ready for use. The original planned opening date of September 1997 for Westside MAX as far as 185th Avenue had been postponed by one year, due to delays in constructing the Robertson Tunnel, resulting in Willow Creek park-and-ride's being completed far in advance of the start of MAX service and related bus-service expansion.|$|E

5|$|SR 20 rises {{into the}} Sierra {{along the north}} side of the Yuba River, {{crossing}} to the south side near Smartsville and then climbing through several ravines to the Penn Valley. The current alignment, built in the mid-1980s as a mostly two-lane freeway, continues east across rugged terrain to the city of Grass Valley, where it joins SR 49 on the Golden Center Freeway. The two routes travel northeast to Nevada City, where SR 49 turns northwest and SR 20 resumes its eastward course as a two-lane highway. The roadway climbs from Nevada City and follows Harmony Ridge and Washington Ridge before descending into the Bear Valley via a series of hairpin turns, and then climbing, just north of Emigrant Gap, to its end at I-80 at Yuba Pass. The Pioneer Trail, a National Recreation Trail, parallels SR 20 from a point on Harmony Ridge to the Bear Valley, and includes parts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> of the California Trail first used in 1850.|$|E
5|$|Wind blowing {{over the}} surface of the sea causes {{friction}} at the interface between air and sea. Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move {{in the same direction as}} the wind. Although winds are variable, in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed. Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid-latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics. When water moves in this way, other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed. There are five main gyres in the world's oceans: two in the Pacific, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38‰. Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica. These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia, guided by the topography of the land, the wind direction, and the Coriolis effect. The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. The water moving away from the equator is warm, while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat. These currents tend to moderate the Earth's climate, cooling the equatorial region, and warming regions at higher latitudes. Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean, so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere, land surfaces, aerosols, and sea ice. Ocean models make use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> of physics, geophysical fluid dynamics, that describes the large-scale flow of fluids such as seawater.|$|E
