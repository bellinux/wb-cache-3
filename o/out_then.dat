5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of an inning during which runs are scored after an error or passed ball, the official scorer attempts to recreate {{the events of the}} inning without the errors or passed balls. If in the official scorer's opinion a run would not have scored without the defensive lapses, then the run is unearned. If the scorer believes that a run would have scored anyway, the run is earned and charged to the pitcher. In one basic example, if the first batter reaches by an error, the second batter hits a home run, and the next three batters strike <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> one of the two runs which were scored are unearned. There are rules and restrictions which govern this general guideline.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Boston College {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's kickoff was returned to the Eagles' 35-yard line, and Boston College's offense began the first possession of the second half. An incomplete pass by Davis {{was followed by a}} short rush and another incomplete pass, and the Eagles were forced to punt after going three and out. The kick went out of bounds at Virginia Tech's 32-yard line, and the Hokies' offense had their first possession of the second half. Tech likewise went three and <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> returned the ball to the Eagles with a punt. The kick went out of bounds, and following the exchange, Boston College's offense started from its 31-yard line.|$|E

When a wrestler steals Homer's pretzel, he and Bart knock him <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> when the Emperor of Japan, Akihito, congratulates Homer, he throws {{him into a}} dumpster of worn mawashi. As a result, he and Bart are put in jail until Marge pays the bail. Consequently, the only money the family has left is a one-million yen bill, which Lisa loses in the wind after Homer created an origami crane from it.|$|E

5|$|Lead mining {{peaked in}} the 17th and 18th centuries; high {{concentrations}} of lead {{have been found in}} the area dating back from this period, as well as discovering peat on Kinder Scout suggesting that lead smelting occurred. Lead mining began to decline from the mid-19th century, with the last major mine closing in 1939, though lead remains a by-product of fluorite, baryte and calcite mining. Not all mines were deep underground; Bell pits were a cheap and easy way at getting at an ore that lay close to the surface of flat land. A shaft was sunk into the ore and enlarged at the bottom for extraction. The pit was then enlarged further until it became unsafe or worked <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> another pit would be sunk adjacent to the existing one.|$|E

5|$|The game {{world is}} filled with traps, laser defence {{mechanisms}} and security robots, all of which kill the astronaut on contact, resulting {{in the loss of}} one of his five lives. These defences must be shut down with objects obtained from gravity boxes in order to progress, as the player has no weapon to directly attack the robots with. The jet pack enables the astronaut to travel more quickly, but has a limited supply of nitro fuel. Should this fuel run <b>out</b> <b>then</b> the astronaut will lose a life. The spaceship contains points at which the jet pack can be refuelled, though these can be difficult to locate.|$|E

5|$|During spring {{training}} in 2005, Nathan signed a two-year deal {{that includes a}} club option for 2008. He picked up from where he left off in 2004, allowing no earned runs in 15 appearances from April 5 to May 10. He also had streaks of 13 and 12 consecutive save opportunities converted between April and July. As a result, Nathan was named the American League Player of the Week for the week of June 27. Nathan earned another All-Star appearance in 2005 for his pitching {{in the first half}} of the season. Although his record was 1–3 with a 3.57 ERA in 37 appearances, he had struck out 43 batters in 35 innings pitched, and lead the AL with 23 saves in 25 opportunities. Nathan pitched in the 2005 MLB All-Star Game alongside fellow pitcher Johan Santana. Pitching the eighth inning of the game, he got Morgan Ensberg to pop out for the first <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> gave out a double to Moisés Alou. Felipe López singled, and Nathan was able to get Miguel Cabrera and Luis Castillo out, but not before Alou scored. Nathan had a brilliant second half as he went 6–1 with 18 saves in 20 chances, and posted an ERA of 1.76. He finished the season with a 7–4 record, a 2.70 ERA, 43 saves in 48 opportunities, and 94 strikeouts. Nathan also became the third pitcher in club history to post consecutive 40 save seasons. The Twins however missed the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> {{the mature}} mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E

Distressed at having lost, Quinn slaps Rachel, though she {{immediately}} regrets it, while Santana is comforted by Brittany, who tells her to be herself rather than hide her lesbian identity. Kurt is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. Karofsky, abruptly faced with having to publicly dance with another boy in the traditional dance between King and Queen, cannot do it; rejecting Kurt's suggestion that he come <b>out</b> <b>then</b> and there, he instead leaves Kurt alone on the dance floor. Blaine asks Kurt to dance with him, and they are soon joined {{by the rest of}} the student body.|$|E

5|$|Pollet {{started the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three Brooklyn hitters. Eddie Stanky grounded out, Cookie Lavagetto flied out to center field, and Joe Medwick grounded out to end the inning. Branca took the mound {{in the bottom of}} the first, striking out Red Schoendienst and allowing a single to Terry Moore. After National League MVP Musial struck out, Enos Slaughter singled and Whitey Kurowski walked to load the bases. Joe Garagiola, Sr. brought in a run before being tagged out to end the inning with the score 1–0. In the second inning, Carl Furillo reached base on an error by Pollet. Pee Wee Reese singled, but Furillo was out at second. Another groundout brought the Cardinals back up, and the Dodgers got all three batters quickly out to end the inning. In the top of the third, Howie Schultz hit a home run on the first pitch he saw, tying the score at 1–1. After three more outs, St. Louis came back up to bat. Moore flied <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> Musial walked, and Slaughter singled. Musial scored on Kurowski's hit while Slaughter was called out, and after two more singles, the latter bringing in Kurowski, Branca was taken out of the game.|$|E
5|$|Similar to Capcom's various Street Fighter titles, X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a 2D {{fighting}} game {{in which}} players control various characters to engage in one-on-one combat, attempting to knock out the opponent by depleting their health. It is the first formal installment in the Marvel vs. Capcom series and features dual-character selection and tag team battles. Instead of the typical best-of-three round format, matches consist of a single round. Players select two characters {{at the beginning of}} a match, each sporting their own life gauge. Players control one character at a time, while the other awaits off-screen. The starting character can tag in the off-screen character at any time during the fight. The dormant character will also slowly recover a portion of their vitality while the current character is fighting. If one character loses all of their vitality, then the tag partner will automatically come into play. The match continues until both characters on either team are defeated. If the timer runs out before either team is knocked <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> the player with the most remaining health is declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|Soejima's {{first major}} {{work for the}} series was working on side {{characters}} for Persona 2 alongside Kaneko. Kaneko put Soejima {{in charge of the}} series' art direction after Persona 2 as Kaneko did not want to imprint his drawing style on the Persona series, and also wanted Soejima to gain experience. Soejima felt a degree of pressure when he was given his new role, as the series had accumulated a substantial following during Kaneko's tenure. In a later interview, Soejima said that although he respected and admired Kaneko, he never consciously imitated the latter's work, and eventually settled into the role of pleasing the fans of the Persona series, approaching character designs with the idea of creating something new rather than referring back to Kaneko's work. For his character designs, Soejima uses real people he has met or seen, looking at what their appearance says about their personality. If his designs come too close to the people he has seen, he does a rough sketch while keeping the personality of the person in mind. For his work on Persona Q, his first time working with a deformed Chibi style due to its links with the Etrian Odyssey series, Soejima took into account what fans felt about the characters. A crucial part of his design technique was looking at what made a character stand <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> adjusting those features so they remained recognizable even with the redesign.|$|E

5|$|The 1993 Independence Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 1993 in Shreveport, Louisiana. Indiana jumped {{out to an}} early lead {{courtesy}} of a 75-yard pass from quarterback John Paci. Virginia Tech equalized the score before the first quarter ran <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> took a 14–7 lead with a second-quarter touchdown run by fullback Joe Swarm. Indiana climbed back with two field goals that cut Tech's lead to 14–13. With Indiana in possession of the ball and time running down, it appeared that Indiana would {{have at least one}} more attempt on offense before halftime. Before the Indiana drive could get moving, John Paci fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech and returned 20yards for a touchdown. On Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, Indiana returned the ball deep into Virginia Tech territory, setting up a potential field goal by kicker Bill Manolopoulos. During the kick, Virginia Tech defender Jeff Holland broke through the Indiana offensive line and blocked the field goal attempt. Tech's Antonio Banks scooped up the ball and ran 80yards for another touchdown—Virginia Tech's second in less than 40seconds.|$|E
5|$|The Boers and {{the local}} Tswana and Basotho chiefdoms were in near-constant conflict, mainly over land. Kruger was elected field cornet of his {{district}} in 1852, and in August that year he {{took part in the}} Battle of Dimawe, a raid against the Tswana chief Sechele I. The Boer commando was headed by Pretorius, but in practice he did not take much part as he was suffering from dropsy. Kruger narrowly escaped death twice—first a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head but only knocked him <b>out,</b> <b>then</b> later a Tswana bullet swiped across his chest, tearing his jacket without wounding him. The commando wrecked David Livingstone's mission station at Kolobeng, destroying his medicines and books. Livingstone was away at the time. Kruger's version of the story was that the Boers found an armoury and a workshop for repairing firearms in Livingstone's house and, interpreting this as a breach of Britain's promise at the Sand River not to arm tribal chiefs, confiscated them. Whatever the truth, Livingstone wrote about the Boers in strongly condemnatory terms thereafter, depicting them as mindless barbarians.|$|E
