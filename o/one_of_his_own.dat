It also explores some of John Kramer's backstory, providing a partial explanation of his reason for becoming Jigsaw.|$|E
5|$|Allemand {{requested}} that Cotes come aboard Carmagnole, but Cotes responded {{that he was}} unable to do so as his ship's boats had all been destroyed. Allemand sent a boat from his own ship to Thames and brought Cotes to Carmagnole as a prisoner of war; Cotes used the delay to destroy his ship's documents. Allemand questioned Cotes intently about the nature of his recent combat and, on identifying Uranie as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> squadron, commented that Tartu should have defeated Thames in half the time the action had taken.|$|E
5|$|Basiliscus fled in {{the heat}} of the battle. One half of the Roman fleet was burned, sunk, or captured, and the other half {{followed}} the fugitive Basiliscus. The whole expedition had failed. Heraclius effected his retreat through the desert into Tripolitania, holding the position for two years until recalled; Marcellinus retired to Sicily, where he was reached by Basiliscus; the general was, however, assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer, by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves would remove from the world his most formidable antagonists.|$|E
60|$|Truly our Claus had wisdom, for {{his good}} fortune but {{strengthened}} his resolve to befriend the little <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> race. He knew his plan {{was approved by the}} immortals, else they would not have favored him so greatly.|$|R
50|$|Lupot {{was ordered}} by King Louis XVIII {{to make an}} {{orchestra}} of stringed instruments which were to be decorated/embellished with the coat of arms of France. He ambitiously undertook in 1820 to replace all the instruments of the royal orchestra with new <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> make, but death in 1824 prevented him from fulfilling this plan.|$|R
60|$|When I {{shall have}} opened the second scene <b>of</b> <b>his</b> peculation, and <b>his</b> new {{principles}} <b>of</b> it, {{when you see him}} either treading in old corruptions, and excelling the examples he imitated, or exhibiting new <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> in which <b>of</b> the two <b>his</b> conduct is the most iniquitous, and attended with most evil to the Company, I must leave your Lordships to judge.|$|R
5|$|Einarr was the {{youngest}} son of Rognvald Eysteinsson, Earl of Møre, Norway, by a concubine. According to the sagas and the Historia Norvegiae Rognvald's family conquered the Orkney and Shetland islands in the late ninth century. Rognvald's brother, Sigurd Eysteinsson, was made Earl of Orkney and after his death on campaign he was succeeded by his son, Guthorm, who died shortly afterward. Rognvald then sent <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> sons, Hallad, to govern the islands.|$|E
5|$|Homer, {{envious of}} Ned Flanders's new motor home, goes to Bob's RV Round-up to buy <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> {{but because of}} his poor credit rating, he is only {{qualified}} for a smaller dilapidated one, much to his family's disgust. Thrilled with the new RV, Homer takes his family on an excursion. Driving on remote back roads and ignoring Marge's suggestion to turn back on the main road, the Simpsons find themselves teetering over a precipice. The family escapes the RV before it plummets over the cliff, leaving themselves stranded in the wilderness.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Nikolai Zaremba {{resigned}} from the directorship of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. His successor, Mikhaíl Azanchevsky, was more progressive-minded musically and wanted new blood to freshen up teaching in the Conservatory. He offered Rimsky-Korsakov a professorship in Practical Composition and Instrumentation (orchestration), as well as leadership of the Orchestra Class. Balakirev, who had formerly opposed academicism with tremendous vigor, encouraged him to assume the post, thinking it might be useful having <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> {{in the midst of}} the enemy camp.|$|E
2500|$|In 1688, the joiner Roger Davis, {{citizen of}} London, removed the 13th century misericords and {{replaced}} them with two rows <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> work {{on each side of the}} choir. Some of Davis's misericords have a distinctly medieval flavour and he may have copied some of the original designs. When Sir George Gilbert Scott carried out renovations in the 19th century, he replaced the front row of Davis' misericords, with new <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> design, which seem to include many copies of those [...] at Gloucester Cathedral, Worcester Cathedral and New College, Oxford.|$|R

50|$|In 1833, James G. Barbadoes, Boston, {{a member}} of the New England Anti-Slavery Society Convention states, among five cases <b>of</b> {{kidnapping}} within <b>his</b> knowledge, <b>one</b> was <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> brother.|$|R
5|$|Kanaina married Miriam Auhea Kekāuluohi in 1821. Kekāuluohi {{had been}} one of several wives of both Kamehameha I and Kamehameha II. In 1819 Kamehameha I died. His son would take Kekāuluohi as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> queen consorts however, under the {{influence}} of Christian missionaries, Kamehameha II renounced all his other wives except one. Kekāuluohi was then free to marry Kanaʻina after they both took Christian first names. The couple was married on Kauaʻi.|$|E
5|$|Norreis {{has been}} {{described}} by modern historians as being unsuited for the religious positions to which he was appointed and by one of being completely unsuitable to hold any kind of spiritual role. Nevertheless, even his most severe contemporary critic, Thomas of Marlborough, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> monks at Evesham, conceded that Norreis was energetic, entertaining, and enterprising; during his time as abbot of Evesham Abbey he managed to complete the crossing tower of the monastic church. Roger Norreis died between 1223 and 1225.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1969, while {{paying a}} visit to the {{northern}} town of Las Anod, Somalia's then President Abdirashid Ali Shermarke was assassinated by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> bodyguards. His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d'état on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition— essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre, who at the time commanded the army.|$|E

5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{sold in the}} US {{was ordered}} for the newly built Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1872, and was named the [...] "Mountaineer". This was a smaller locomotive with four-wheel bogies, giving it a 0-4-4-0 configuration. The railroad's experience with the locomotive was typical, and {{an indication of the}} fact that, though Fairlie had eliminated several problems of the conventional locomotive, he had introduced new <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> At least <b>one</b> double Fairlie 0-6-6-0 (pictured above) was built by the Mason Machine Works in Taunton, Massachusetts.|$|R

5|$|Skinner remembers having seen, on {{numerous}} occasions, a bearded man {{who showed up}} suspiciously and who is actually running the scheme. He saves Skinner and sacrifices <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> men. The case is closed and Skinner is, once again, aggravated with the agents, ordering them to report exclusively to Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens Jr.). The bearded man was actually Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system.|$|E
5|$|The symphony's {{duration}} at {{its first}} performance was {{recorded by the}} critic-composer Julius Korngold as 85 minutes. This performance {{was the last time}} that Mahler conducted a premiere of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> works. Eight months after his Munich triumph, he {{died at the age of}} 50. His remaining works—Das Lied von der Erde ("The Song of the Earth"), his Symphony No.9 and the unfinished Symphony No.10—were all premiered after his death.|$|E
5|$|Abu Musa Isa ibn al-Shaykh ibn al-Salil al-Dhuhli al-Shaybani (died 882/83) was an Arab {{leader of}} the Shayban tribe. Taking {{advantage}} of the domestic turmoil of the Abbasid Caliphate, he created a semi-independent bedouin state in Palestine and southern Syria in ca. 867–870, before an Abbasid army forced him to exchange his domains with the governorship of Armenia and Diyar Bakr. In Armenia, he struggled to contain the rising power of the Christian princes, but after failing to suppress the revolt of <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> subordinates, he abandoned the country {{and returned to his}} native Jazira. There he spent his last years until his death in a struggle with a rival strongman, the ruler of Mosul Ishaq ibn Kundajiq.|$|E

Shedd (Shedd Aquarium, still standing on Chicago's Lake Michigan today), in taking over some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's business interests as well as establishing new <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> Shedd and Johnson jointly purchased the National Life Insurance Company at a foreclosure sale. Through a bargain with Shedd, Albert Johnson acquired 90% of publicly available National Life stock, and quickly became President of the company. Johnson's annual salary as President of National Life Insurance {{was said to have}} been approximately $1,000,000.|$|R
5|$|Back in Sweden, Smetana {{found among}} his new pupils a young housewife, Fröjda Benecke, who briefly became his muse and his mistress. In her honour Smetana {{transcribed}} two songs from Schubert's Die schöne Müllerin cycle, and transformed <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> early piano pieces into a polka entitled Vision at the Ball. He also began composing {{on a more}} expansive scale. In 1858 he completed the symphonic poem Richard III, his first major orchestral composition since the Triumphal Symphony. He followed this with Wallenstein's Camp, inspired by Friedrich Schiller's Wallenstein drama trilogy, and began a third symphonic poem Hakon Jarl, based on the tragic drama by Danish poet Adam Oehlenschläger. Smetana also wrote two large-scale piano works: Macbeth and the Witches, and an Étude in C {{in the style of}} Liszt.|$|E
5|$|Georg Emil Hansen (1833–1891) from Næstved {{came from}} a family of photographers. When his father, Carl Christian Hansen, opened a studio in Copenhagen, he decided to open <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> He {{became one of the most}} {{respected}} photographers of his day, with Christian IX of Denmark and the Danish Royal Family as customers in the early 1860s. He also excelled in adopting new techniques. He was the first to use paper prints and to make full-length portrait enlargements. He received awards for his exhibitions in London (1862) and Berlin (1865). In 1867, together with his brother, Niels Christian Hansen, and two other photographers, he set up a photographic firm which later became Hansen, Schou & Weller, suppliers to the royal Danish court.|$|E
5|$|Grassi's {{arguments}} and conclusions were criticised {{in a subsequent}} article, Discourse on Comets, published {{under the name of}} one of Galileo's disciples, a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci, although it had been largely written by Galileo himself. Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken. In its opening passage, Galileo and Guiducci's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner, and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work. The Jesuits were offended, and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own, The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance, under the pseudonym Lothario Sarsio Sigensano, purporting to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pupils.|$|E

50|$|He was {{a son of}} a priest, and had {{at least}} <b>one</b> son <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> Arthur by name. Evidence from the {{charters}} of Inchaffray Abbey shows that he was bishop-elect by some date between the years 1210 and 1214.|$|R
5|$|Henry was an intellectual. The first English king with {{a modern}} humanist education, he read and wrote English, French and Latin, and was {{thoroughly}} {{at home in}} his well-stocked library. He personally annotated many books and wrote and published <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> To promote the {{public support for the}} reformation of the church, Henry had numerous pamphlets and lectures prepared. For example, Richard Sampson's Oratio (1534) was an argument for absolute obedience to the monarchy and claimed that the English church had always been independent from Rome. At the popular level, theatre and minstrel troupes funded by the crown travelled around the land to promote the new religious practices: the pope and Catholic priests and monks were mocked as foreign devils, while the glorious king was hailed as a brave and heroic defender of the true faith. Henry worked hard to present an image of unchallengeable authority and irresistible power.|$|E
5|$|John wanted John de Gray, the Bishop of Norwich and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> supporters, to be {{appointed}} Archbishop of Canterbury {{after the death of}} Walter, but the cathedral chapter for Canterbury Cathedral claimed the exclusive right to elect Walter's successor. They favoured Reginald, the chapter's sub-prior. To complicate matters, the bishops of the province of Canterbury also claimed the right to appoint the next archbishop. The chapter secretly elected Reginald and he travelled to Rome to be confirmed; the bishops challenged the appointment and the matter was taken before Innocent. John forced the Canterbury chapter to change their support to John de Gray, and a messenger was sent to Rome to inform the papacy of the new decision. Innocent disavowed both Reginald and John de Gray, and instead appointed his own candidate, Stephen Langton. John refused Innocent's request that he consent to Langton's appointment, but the pope consecrated Langton anyway in June 1207.|$|E
5|$|Many {{film and}} {{television}} horses of the Golden Age of Hollywood were also Saddlebreds, including the horses used in lead roles in My Friend Flicka, National Velvet, Fury and one version of Black Beauty. A half-Saddlebred played the lead role in the TV series Mr. Ed, and a Saddlebred was used in {{a prominent role in}} Giant. In the 1990s, William Shatner, an actor and Saddlebred breeder, rode <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> horses, a mare named Great Belles of Fire, in his role as James T.

Durgabar Kayastha rendered Madhava Kandali's Ramayana into lyrics and made new <b>ones</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>own,</b> both totalling fiftyeight; and these songs were put to different classical ragas. Durgabar Kayastha composed the Ramayana in the lyrical style of composition to be sung by the Oja Pali.|$|R
