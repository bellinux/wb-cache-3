Theory was compared with empirical data from 1036 fields {{and a number of}} regions. Strong agreement between theory and practice was found, indicating that the framework is plausible. Both single fields and entire regions exhibit similar <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> patterns, showing the generality of the approach. The maximum <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> for fields were found to be well described by a Weibull distribution. <b>Depletion</b> <b>rates</b> were also found to strongly correlate with decline rates. In particular, the <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> at peak was shown to be useful for predicting the future decline rate. Studies of regions indicate that a <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> of remaining recoverable resources in the range of 2 – 3 % is consistent with historical experience. This agrees well with earlier “peak oil” forecasts and indicates that they rest on a solid scientific ground. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three parts of contributions. Systems of a fully penetrating pumping well in a confined aquifer near a fully penetrating stream with and without streambeds are discussed in Chapter II. In Chapter III, stream-aquifer systems with a fully penetrating pumping well in a confined aquifer between two parallel fully penetrating streams with and without streambeds are discussed. Stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> in Chapter II are solved using Laplace and Fourier transform methods, and stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> in Chapter III are solved using the potential method. Chapter II presents analytical solutions in the Laplace domain for general stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> caused by a pumping well and caused by stream stage fluctuations. For seasonal case, the stream stage {{is a function of}} time. For an individual flood wave, the stream stage is a function of time and distance along the stream. Semi-analytical solutions of seasonal stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> in time domain, using a cosine function to simulate stream stage fluctuations, are presented. The stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> caused by pumping is solved analytically, while the stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> caused by stream stage fluctuations is solved numerically. Various parameters affecting stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rates,</b> such as flood period and streambed, are analyzed. For a short-term case, the pumping rate is assumed to be constant, and a Gaussian function is used as an example of floodwaves. This part is solved using the same method as used in the seasonal case. Early time and late time approximations of the stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> are also presented. This approximation leads to an interesting finding that the stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> caused by seasonal stream stage fluctuations can be neglected if the stream aquifer system has a long time to equilibrate. In Chapter III, analytical stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> caused by a pumping well between two parallel streams with and without streambeds are presented. In this chapter, stream stage is assumed to be constant. Capture zone delineations were analyzed in the case without streambed. For the case with streambed, streambed conductance, which is an important factor controlling stream depletion, is analyzed. All solutions discussed in this dissertation can be used to predict stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> and to estimate parameters controlling stream <b>depletion</b> <b>rates,</b> which is crucial for water management. In addition to the stream depletion, the derived semi-analytical solutions in the Laplace-Fourier domain {{can also be used to}} predict drawdown in the aquifer near the stream. The derived solutions may also be used inversely to find the streambed and aquifer parameters if the stream stage fluctuation can be well described...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{on natural}} populations and {{harvesting}} biological resources {{have led to}} the view, commonly held, that (i) populations exhibiting chaotic oscillations run a high risk of extinction; and (ii) a decrease in emigration/exploitation may reduce the risk of extinction. Here we describe a simple ecological model with emigration/depletion that shows behavior in contrast to this. This model displays unusual dynamics of extinction and survival, where populations growing beyond a critical rate can persist within a band of high <b>depletion</b> <b>rates,</b> whereas extinction occurs for lower <b>depletion</b> <b>rates.</b> Though prior to extinction at lower <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> the population exhibits chaotic dynamics with large amplitudes of variation and very low minima, at higher <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> the population persists at chaos but with reduced variation and increased minima. For still higher values, within the band of persistence, the dynamics show period reversal leading to stability. These results illustrate that chaos does not necessarily lead to population extinction. In addition, the persistence of populations at high <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> has important implications in the considerations of strategies for the management of biological resources...|$|R

40|$|Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) {{is widely}} used to model {{sequential}} decision making process under uncertainty and incomplete knowledge of the environment. It requires strong computation capability and is thus usually deployed on powerful machine. However, as mobile platforms become more advanced and more popular, the potential has been studied to combine POMDP and mobile {{in order to provide}} a broader range of services. And yet a question comes with this trend: how should we implement POMDP on mobile platform so that we can take advantages of mobile features {{while at the same time}} avoid being restricted by mobile limitations, such as short battery life, weak CPU, unstable networking connection, and other limited resources. In response to the above question, we first point out that the cases vary by problem nature, accuracy requirements and mobile device models. Rather than pure mathematical analysis, our approach is to run experiments on a mobile device and concentrate on a more specific question: which POMDP implementation is the ``best'' for a particular problem on a particular kind of device. Second, we propose and justify a POMDP implementation criterion mainly based on battery consumption that quantifies ``goodness'' of POMDP implementations in terms of mobile battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate.</b> Then, we present a mobile battery consumption model that translates CPU and WIFI usage into part of the battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> in order to greatly accelerate the experiment process. With our mobile battery consumption model, we combine a set of simple benchmark experiments with CPU and WIFI usage data from each POMDP implementation candidate to generate estimated battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rates,</b> as opposed to conducting hours of real battery experiments for each implementation individually. The final result is a ranking of POMDP implementations based on their estimated battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rates.</b> It serves as a guidance for on POMDP implementation selection for mobile developers. We develop a mobile software toolkit to automate the above process. Given basic POMDP problem specifications, a set of POMDP implementation candidates and a simple press on the ``start'' button, the toolkit automatically performs benchmark experiments on the target device on which it is installed, and records CPU and WIFI statistics for each POMDP implementation candidate. It then feeds the data to its embedded mobile battery consumption model and produces an estimated battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> for each candidate. Finally, the toolkit visualizes the ranking of POMDP implementations for mobile developers' reference. Evaluation is assessed through comparsion between the ranking from estimated battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> and that from real experimental battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate.</b> We observe the same ranking out of both, which is also our expectation. What's more, the similarity between estimated battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> and experimental battery <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> measured by cosine-similarity is almost 0. 999 where 1 indicates they are exactly the same...|$|R

The study was also designed to determine which lead-free ballistic modifiers accelerated 2 -NDPA depletion. The increased <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> occurred in propellants containing monobasic copper salicylate. Four lead-free propellants were then formulated to improved aging characteristics over previous lead-free propellant formulations. The new formulations reduced or replaced the monobasic copper salicylate. The new formulations had improved aging characteristics. Their burn rates, however, were unacceptable for use in a 2. 75 inch rocket. To compare aging characteristics, stabilizer <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> of RPD- 422, AA 2, M 28, and RLC 470 / 6 A were measured or taken from the literature. The data were fit to a kinetic model.

Derivatives beyond the first nitrated or nitroso derivative of 2 -NPDA were not considered. The rate constants were fit to the Arrhenius equation and extrapolated to lower temperatures. The time to complete stabilizer depletion was estimated using the kinetic model. The four propellants were compared and the RPD- 422 depleted faster at 45 C than both A 22 and M 28.

The inputs to the model are standard monthly SeaWiFS products: chlorophyll concentration and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. Penetration of solar UV radiation to different depths in open ocean waters is calculated using the RT (radiative transfer) quasi-single scattering approximation (QSSA). The accuracy of the QSSA approximation in the water is tested using more accurate codes. The sensitivity study of the underwater UV irradiance to atmospheric and oceanic optical properties have shown that the main environmental parameters controlling the absolute levels of the UVB (280 - 320 nm) and DNA-weighted irradiance underwater are: solar-zenith angle, cloud transmittance, water optical properties, and total ozone. Weekly maps of underwater UV irradiance and DNA-weighted exposure are calculated using monthly-mean SeaWiFS chlorophyll and diffuse attenuation coefficient products, daily SeaWiFS cloud fraction data, and the TOMS-derived surface UV irradiance daily maps. The final products include global maps of weekly-average UVB irradiance and DNA-weighted daily exposures at 3 m and 10 m, and depths where the UVB irradiance and DNA-weighted dose rate at local noon are equal to 10 % of their surface values...|$|R

30|$|However, {{both the}} multi-cycle {{generalized}} Weng {{model and the}} multi-cycle Hubbert model lack a quantitative basis for choosing the number of cycles. Generally, the fitting effect of models {{would be better if}} the production cycles are increased. But meanwhile, excessive production cycles may cause overfitting. Overfitting could reduce the forecasting function of the model. Therefore, how to determine the optimal number of production cycle is very important. Wang and Feng (2016) proposed a quantitative method to quantify production cycle numbers, namely the F test. But this method has not been applied to multi-cycle generalized Weng models. In addition, many scholars have pointed out that the <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> of residual resources would also have significant impact on prediction. Therefore, the <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> of residual resource was suggested to be added into the model as a constraint parameter (Wang et al. 2013; Wang and Feng 2016).|$|R
40|$|We {{reveal an}} {{intriguing}} manifestation of topology, which {{appears in the}} <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> of topological states of matter {{in response to an}} external drive. This phenomenon is presented by analyzing the response of a generic 2 D Chern insulator subjected to a circular time-periodic perturbation: due to the system's chiral nature, the <b>depletion</b> <b>rate</b> is shown to depend on the orientation of the circular shake. Most importantly, taking the difference between the rates obtained from two opposite orientations of the drive, and integrating over a proper drive-frequency range, provides a direct measure of the topological Chern number of the populated band (ν) : this "differential integrated rate" {{is directly related to the}} strength of the driving field through the quantized coefficient η_ 0 =ν /ħ^ 2. Contrary to the integer quantum Hall effect, this quantized response is found to be non-linear with respect to the strength of the driving field and it explicitly involves inter-band transitions. We investigate the possibility of probing this phenomenon in ultracold gases and highlight the crucial role played by edge states in this effect. We extend our results to 3 D lattices, establishing a link between <b>depletion</b> <b>rates</b> and the non-linear photogalvanic effect predicted for Weyl semimetals. The quantized circular dichroism revealed in this work designates depletion-rate measurements as a universal probe for topological order in quantum matter.
