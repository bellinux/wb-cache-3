5|$|Water {{is needed}} by many birds {{although}} their mode of excretion and lack <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> glands reduces the physiological demands. Some desert birds can obtain their water needs entirely from moisture in their food.

Seabirds can drink seawater and have salt glands inside the head that eliminate excess salt out of the nostrils.|$|E

5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression <b>of</b> <b>sweat.</b> Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed {{from time to time in}} the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E

40|$|Females exhibit lower sudomotor {{response}} than males, {{which has}} been attributed to physiological differences between sexes. It is well accepted that non-thermal factors (i. e. baroreceptors and osmoreceptors) can influence thermoeffector responses. Even though there are sex-related differences in baroreceptor modulation of thermoeffector responses, it remains unknown if differences in osmoreceptor modulation could explain the lower sudomotor response in females. Therefore, we examined if there are sex-related differences in osmoreceptor modulation <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC). A group of nine males and nine females were passively heated while in an isosmotic and hyperosmotic state. The onset and thermosensitivity <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> and CVC were calculated and compared between groups and conditions. We show that the delay in onset <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> and CVC is similar between sexes. However, thermosensitivity <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> was lower in females than males. We conclude that hyperosmolality does not modulate the decreased sudomotor activity in females...|$|R

25|$|Central to {{the success}} of this is the ability of the human body, unlike that of the animals they hunt, to {{effectively}} remove muscle heat waste. In most animals, this is stored by allowing a temporary increase in body temperature. This allows them to escape from animals that quickly speed after them for a short duration (the way nearly all predators catch their prey). Humans, unlike other animals that catch prey, remove heat with a specialized thermoregulation based on sweat evaporation. One gram <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> can remove 2,598 J of heat energy. Another mechanism is increased skin blood flow during exercise that allows for greater convective heat loss that is aided by our upright posture. This skin based cooling has resulted in humans acquiring an increased number <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> glands, combined with a lack of body fur that would otherwise stop air circulation and efficient evaporation. Because humans can remove exercise heat, they can avoid the fatigue from heat exhaustion that affects animals chased in a persistent manner, and so eventually catch them.|$|E
25|$|Sebaceous gland {{activity}} (which is {{triggered by}} androgens) lessens, reducing oil production {{on the skin}} and scalp. Consequently, the skin becomes less prone to acne. It also becomes drier, and lotions or oils may be necessary. The pores become smaller because of the lower quantities of oil being produced. Many apocrine glands – a type <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> gland – become inactive, and body odor decreases. Remaining body odor becomes less metallic, sharp, or acrid, and more sweet and musky.|$|E
25|$|CF is {{inherited}} in an {{autosomal recessive}} manner. It {{is caused by}} the presence of mutations in both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Those with a single working copy are carriers and otherwise mostly normal. CFTR is involved in production <b>of</b> <b>sweat,</b> digestive fluids, and mucus. When CFTR is not functional, secretions which are usually thin instead become thick. The condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing.

25|$|Kirk's dik-diks {{are highly}} adapted to {{surviving}} in the arid regions of eastern Africa. They have a hairy proboscis with tiny slit-like nostrils, {{a feature that}} is most pronounced in the Guenther's dik-dik. This proboscis contains an enlarged nasal chamber that is supplied with a rich amount of blood that is cooled via rapid nasal panting. Panting through their snouts leads to airflow and evaporation that cools the blood before it is pumped back into the body.2 This process is also efficient, because it results in a minimal loss {{of water in the}} exhaled air. Water and energy conserving methods, such as fluctuating body temperatures, lowered metabolic rates, concentrated urine, and dry feces all contribute to the ability of the dik-dik to survive harsh arid climates. Further, as observed by Hoppe 1977b, Kamau 1988, and Maloiy et al., 1988, they also conserve fluids by licking dew from their nose and reabsorbing water from their feces. When compared to cattle, dik-dik have a significantly lower density <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> glands.|$|E
500|$|Sebaceous glands secrete the oily, waxy {{substance}} called sebum (...) {{that is made}} of triglycerides, [...] wax esters, squalene, and metabolites of fat-producing cells. Sebum waterproofs and lubricates {{the skin}} and hair of mammals. Sebaceous secretions in conjunction with apocrine glands also play an important thermoregulatory role. In hot conditions, the secretions emulsify the sweat produced by the eccrine glands and this produces a sheet <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> that is not readily lost in drops <b>of</b> <b>sweat.</b> This is of importance in delaying dehydration. In colder conditions, the nature of sebum becomes more lipid and in coating the hair and skin, rain is effectively repelled.|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> across {{human body}} segments {{has been investigated}} for many years (Weiner, 1945), and by numerous research groups. However, very few have reported localised differences in sudomotor function within separate body segments (e. g. Taylor et al., 2006). In this project, we focussed on the regional distribution <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> within the torso. Although representing about 40 % of the total body surface area, and accounting for approximately 50 % <b>of</b> the whole-body <b>sweat</b> secretion (Weiner, 1945), the torso has not been thoroughly examined with regard to its inter-site distribution <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> during rest and incremental exercise in the heat. Since this information forms essential background knowledge {{for the development of}} thermal manikins, and for improving clothing design, we set about obtaining these data, and quantified sweat secretion rates from twelve sites of the human torso across a wide range of thermal loads...|$|R

Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald noted, [...] "The producer's angular synthesizer crunch is all over it [...] at best on the single 'SexyBack' where they dispense with a chorus, leaving the song sustained by its vocal fireworks, electrofunk and Timberlake's repeated declaration that 'I'm bringing sexy back.

40|$|The {{influence}} of esophageal (Tes) and skin temperature (Tsk) variations, body heat storage, and individual parameters on the initiation <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> {{was investigated in}} 9 unacclimated subjects during thermal transients induced by exercise (25, 50, or 75 W) and by a step change in ambient temperature from 28 degrees C to 23, 28, 36. 5, 45, or 50 degrees C. Seventy-four onsets <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> were observed during the exposures, the sweating delay averaging 3 min at 45 and 50 degrees C, 6 min at 36. 5 degrees C, and 9. 5 min at 28 degrees C. In warm conditions (36. 5 to 50 degrees C), the onset <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> could mainly be related both {{to the level of}} Tsk and its rate component, whereas in cooler conditions (28 and 23 degrees C), the onset <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> could only be related to a positive rate of Tes variation, the Tsk level being low and steady. On the whole set of data, the Tes changes at the onset were inversely related to the Tsk changes. The cumulated heat storage at the onset <b>of</b> <b>sweating</b> was 37 kJ/m 2 (S. D. 25). It varied not only among subjects (range: 11 - 66 kJ/m 2) but also within subjects even when differences in thermal state prior to exercise were accounted for. Among the individual parameters investigated, the magnitude of the decrease in Tes observed in response to the start of exercise was found to {{have a significant effect on}} the sweating delay. The Tes decrease was inversely related to the subject's skinfold thickness, and in a given subject, inversely related to the preexercise Tsk. It is concluded that the results are in agreement with a summation model of internal and mean skin temperatures on the sweating drive but that they do not verify the hypothesis of a critical level of heat storage at the onset <b>of</b> <b>sweating.</b> Peer reviewe...|$|R

500|$|Springbok {{often go}} into bouts of {{repeated}} high leaps {{of up to}} [...] into the air – a practice known as pronking (derived from the Afrikaans pronk, [...] "to show off") or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent <b>of</b> <b>sweat.</b> Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking {{is that it is}} a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to get a better view of a concealed predator; it may also be used for display. Springbok are very fast antelopes, clocked at [...] They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding. Caracals, cheetahs, leopards, spotted hyaenas, and wild dogs are major predators of the springbok. Southern African wildcats, black-backed jackals, black eagles, martial eagles, and tawny eagles target juveniles. Springbok are generally quiet animals, though they may make occasional low-pitched bellows as a greeting and high-pitched snorts when alarmed.|$|E
500|$|In {{writing for}} Batman, Hill {{considered}} that a fundamental {{aspect of the}} character was how he interacts with his villains, allies, and the city around him. Hill said: [...] "You know, {{what does it mean}} to be Batman? ...How does it affect Batman when things happen to him? What is his psychological make up? Those are the influences behind the game... you actually delve into the psyche of what makes him what he is, which is where I think so much of the interest in Batman is." [...] Batman's armor was redesigned to match that of the Batmobile to make them appear visually similar—featuring the same shapes and material textures—and appear functionally compatible with the high-speed methods in which the character enters and exits the vehicle. The design also added armor over Batman's shoulders, covering the previously exposed cape, to make it appear more feasible that it could hold Batman's weight without failing during gliding. For other returning characters, art director David Hego said that the designs were conceived to keep them interesting after players had seen them several times before in previous games, while the game's autumnal setting also necessitated a change in character clothing over the winter setting of Arkham City. The Penguin lost his long coat, and was made to look dirtier, his clothing showing signs <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> and food stains, and his head was shaved. For Two-Face, the designers felt the character did not require changing significantly, and instead emphasized existing character traits, particularly his disfigured flesh, using references of burnt flesh as inspiration. Similarly, they wanted to retain the typical Riddler characterizations like green shirts emblazoned with question marks, but instead had the character design evolve throughout the game, modifying his own costume in response to the events of the plot.|$|E
