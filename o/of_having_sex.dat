500|$|Many in {{the city}} were angered by the broadcast. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors was outraged and sent a letter of protest to CBS. Feinstein wrote to the station manager of KPIX denouncing the episode. She {{compared}} the program to [...] "doing a documentary on Italians and only showing the Mafia". She asked for three minutes of national airtime to respond but CBS denied her request. Armistead Maupin, who had {{worked closely with the}} production team, repudiated the program, saying [...] "I had no idea they were doing a hit piece." [...] Jeff Jarvis of The San Francisco Examiner wrote, [...] "It's shocking that CBS News, home of Walter Cronkite, would partake of such bigotry." [...] Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Terrence O'Flaherty labeled the documentary [...] "a dreadful little program... deadly for everyone it touches". Nationally, a spokesperson for the National Gay Task Force condemned the documentary for its premise of gays wanting political power for purposes <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> in public, for ignoring lesbians and for failing to address issues of anti-gay discrimination.|$|E
500|$|On August 20, 1845, Griswold married Charlotte Myers, a Jewish woman; she was 42 {{and he was}} 33. Griswold {{had been}} {{pressured}} into the marriage by the woman's aunts, despite his concern about their difference in religious beliefs. This difference was strong enough that one of Griswold's friends referred to his wife only as [...] "the little Jewess". On their wedding night, he discovered that she was, according to Griswold biographer Joy Bayless, [...] "through some physical misfortune, incapable of being a wife" [...] or, as Poe biographer Kenneth Silverman explains, incapable <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>sex.</b> Griswold considered the marriage void and no more valid [...] "than {{there would have been}} had the ceremony taken place between parties of the same sex, or where the sex of one was doubtful or ambiguous". Still, the couple moved together to Charleston, South Carolina, Charlotte's home town, and lived under the same roof, albeit sleeping in separate rooms. Neither of the two was happy with the situation, {{and at the end of}} April 1846 she had a lawyer write up a contract [...] "to separate, altogether and forever,... which would in effect be a divorce". The contract forbade Griswold from remarrying and paid him $1,000 for expenses in exchange for his daughter Caroline staying with the Myers family. After this separation, Griswold immediately moved back to Philadelphia.|$|E
500|$|The film {{presents}} Ricky as its [...] "visionary, {{spiritual and}} mystical center". He sees {{beauty in the}} minutiae of everyday life, videoing {{as much as he}} can for fear of missing it. He shows Jane what he considers the most beautiful thing he has filmed: a plastic bag, tossing in the wind in front of a wall. He says capturing the moment was when he realized that there was [...] "an entire life behind things"; he feels that [...] "sometimes there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in." [...] Anker argues that Ricky, in looking past the [...] "cultural dross", has [...] " [...] the radiant splendor of the created world" [...] to see God. As the film progresses, the Burnhams move closer to Ricky's view of the world. Lester only forswears personal satisfaction at the film's end. On the cusp <b>of</b> <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> with Angela, he returns to himself after she admits her virginity. Suddenly confronted with a child, he begins to treat her as a daughter; in doing so, Lester sees himself, Angela, and his family [...] "for the poor and fragile but wondrous creatures they are". He looks at a picture of his family in happier times, and dies having had an epiphany that infuses him with [...] "wonder, joy, and soul-shaking gratitude"—he has finally seen the world as it is.|$|E

In response, Marsden described himself as a [...] "promiscuous homosexual" [...] but denied allegations of paedophilia.
