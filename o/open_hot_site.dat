40|$|For most {{animal and}} plant species, life traits {{strongly}} affect their species-specific role, function or position within ecological communities. Previous studies on ant communities have mostly focused {{on the role of}} dominant species and the outcome of interspecific interactions. However, life traits of ant species have seldom been considered within a community framework. This study (1) analyses life traits related to ecological and behavioural characteristics of dominant and subordinate ant species from 13 sites distributed throughout the Iberian Peninsula, (2) determines how similar the ant species are within each of the two levels of the dominance hierarchy, and (3) establishes the distribution patterns of these different groups of species along environmental gradients. Our results showed that the differences between dominants and subordinates fall into two main categories: resource exploitation and thermal tolerance. Dominant species have more populated colonies and defend food resources more fiercely than subordinates, but they display low tolerance to high temperatures. We have identified different assemblages of species included within each of these two levels in the dominance hierarchy. The distribution of these assemblages varied along the environmental gradient, shifting from dominant Dolichoderinae and cryptic species in moist areas, to dominant Myrmicinae and hot climate specialists mainly in <b>open</b> and <b>hot</b> <b>sites.</b> We have been able to identify a set of life traits of the most common Iberian ant species that has enabled us to characterise groups of dominant and subordinate species. Although certain common features within the groups of both dominants and subordinates always emerge, other different features allow for differentiating subgroups within each of these groups. These different traits allow the different subgroups coping with particular conditions across environmental gradients. © 2012 Springer-Verlag. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> is a {{duplicate}} {{of the original}} site of the organization, with full computer systems as well as near-complete backups of user data. Real time synchronization between the two sites {{may be used to}} completely mirror the data environment of the original site using wide area network links and specialized software. Following a disruption to the original <b>site,</b> the <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> exists so that the organization can relocate with minimal losses to normal operations in the shortest recovery time. Ideally, a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> will be up and running within a matter of hours. Personnel may have to be moved to the <b>hot</b> <b>site,</b> but {{it is possible that the}} <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> may be operational from a data processing perspective before staff has relocated. The capacity of the <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> may or may not match the capacity of the original site depending on the organization's requirements. This type of backup site is the most expensive to operate. <b>Hot</b> <b>sites</b> are popular with organizations that operate real time processes such as financial institutions, government agencies and eCommerce providers.The most important feature offered from a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> is that the production environment(s) is running concurrently with the main datacenter. This syncing allows for minimal impact and downtime to business operations. In the event of a significant outage event, the <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> can take the place of the impacted site immediately. However, this level of redundancy does not come cheap, and businesses will have to weigh the cost-benefit-analysis (CBA) of <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> utilization.Nowadays if the backup site is down and misses the [...] "proactive" [...] approach it may not be considered a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> depending on the level of maturity of the organization regarding the ISO 22301 approach (international standard for Business Continuity Management).|$|R

The goal of these cruises is to make hydrography, chemistry, and biology observations.

The locations of the three stations are Kahe, HOT, and Hale-ALOHA buoy. The routine HOT measurements are available during the summer following the year of the observations.

40|$|Analytical {{methods for}} RCRA listed {{elements}} on Portland cement type waste have been employed using both microwave and <b>open</b> <b>hot</b> plate digestions with subsequent analysis by {{inductively coupled plasma}} atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-AES), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), graphite furnace atomic absorption (GFAA) and cold vapor atomic absorption and fluorescence (CVAA/CVAFS). Four different digestion procedures were evaluated including an <b>open</b> <b>hot</b> plate nitric acid digestion, EPA SW- 846 Method 3051, and 2 methods using modifications to Method 3051. The <b>open</b> <b>hot</b> plate and the modified Method 3051, which used aqua regia for dissolution, were the only methods which resulted in acceptable data quality for all 14 RCRA-listed elements.

50|$|Choosing {{the type}} of backup site to be used is decided by an {{organizations}} based on a cost vs. benefit analysis. <b>Hot</b> <b>sites</b> are traditionally more expensive than cold sites, since much of the equipment the company needs must be purchased and thus people are needed to maintain it, making the operational costs higher. However, if the same organization loses {{a substantial amount of}} revenue for each day they are inactive, then it may be worth the cost. Another advantage of a <b>hot</b> <b>site</b> is that it can be used for operations prior to a disaster happening. This load balanced production processing method can be cost effective, and will provide the users with the security of minimal downtime during an event that affects one of the data centers.|$|R

5000|$|In the UK, the Zone of Influence was {{historically}} {{measured as}} anywhere within 100m {{of the boundary}} of the high voltage compound at a <b>Hot</b> <b>Site.</b> Since 2007, it is allowable to use the Energy Networks Association (ENA) Recommendation S34 [...] ('A Guide for Assessing the Rise of Earth Potential at Substation Sites') to calculate Hot Zone. This is now defined as a contour line marking where the Rise Of Earth Potential (ROEP) exceeds 430V for normal reliability power lines or 650V for high reliability lines. The Zone extends in a radius from any bonded metalwork such as the site earth electrode system and boundary fence. This may effectively reduce the overall size of the Hot Zone. However, strip earth electrodes, and any non-effectively insulated metallic sheath/ armouring of power cables which extend out of this zone {{would continue to be}} considered as 'hot' for a distance of 100m from the boundary, for a width of two meters either side of the conductor.

40|$|In this article, we have {{compared}} the metal-amino acid interactions in Tyr-Ag and Phe-Ag complexes through pH dependent SERS measurements. By analyzing {{the variation in}} relative intensities of SERS bands with the pH of the amino acid solution, we have obtained the orientation and conformation of the amino acid molecules on the Ag surface. The results obtained from our experimental studies are supported by the the energy minimized strucutres and the observed charge distributions in different terminals of the molecules. This, in a way, shows that SERS measurements not only exhibit {{the interaction of the}} amino acid molecules with Ag clusters but also demonstrate their orientation around it. We have addressed a long standing query on whether the amine group is directly attached with Ag surface along with the carboxylate group and π-electrons in these systems. In addition, pH dependent optical absorption and transmission electron microscopy measurements have been performed to understand the required conditions for the appearance of the SERS spectra {{in the light of the}} aggregation of metal particles and the number of <b>hot</b> <b>sites</b> in the sol. Our results confirm that the formation of <b>hot</b> <b>sites</b> in the sol plays a direct role to form a stable Ag-ligand complex.
