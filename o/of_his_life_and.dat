5|$|Chopin {{has figured}} {{extensively}} in Polish literature, both in serious critical studies <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> music and in fictional treatments.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leofric, as his cathedral town was not a centre of {{historical}} writing, and he took little part in events outside his diocese.

No official acts from his episcopate have survived, and there is just a brief death notice in the Leofric Missal, although no notice of his death occurs in the contemporary Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. He occurs as a witness to royal charters.|$|E

5|$|While {{living in}} London Hogg made the {{acquaintance}} of several well-known writers, and he published literary works of his own. He studied Greek literature for much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> published several {{articles on the}} subject, including two entries in the Encyclopædia Britannica. Most of the fiction he wrote was poorly reviewed. His best-known literary work was The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley, an unfinished biography of the poet. Although the book was well researched and painted {{a clear picture of}} Shelley as a young man, it was criticised for portraying him negatively.|$|E
5|$|A coinage commemorating Edmund was minted {{from around}} the time East Anglia was absorbed by the kingdom of Wessex and a popular cult emerged. In about 986, Abbo of Fleury wrote <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> martyrdom. The saint's remains were {{temporarily}} moved from Bury St Edmunds to London for safekeeping in 1010. His shrine at Bury was visited by many kings, including Canute, {{who was responsible for}} rebuilding the abbey: the stone church was rebuilt again in 1095. During the Middle Ages, when Edmund was regarded as the patron saint of England, Bury and its magnificent abbey grew wealthy, but during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his shrine was destroyed. Medieval manuscripts and works of art relating to Edmund include Abbo's Passio Sancti Eadmundi, John Lydgate's 14th-century Life, the Wilton Diptych and a number of church wall paintings.|$|E
