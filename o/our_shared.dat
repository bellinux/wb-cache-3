It has a collection, which was started in 1997, of heritage material covering the last four centuries, with over 5000 items including antique prints, paintings, maps, postcards, photographs, documents, books and press cuttings. Volunteers from the Friends of Richmond Park have been cataloguing them.

The trustees announced in 2014 {{plans for a new}} purpose-built heritage centre to provide full public access to the Collection. In April 2017 the Collection, in collaboration with The Royal Parks and Ireland's Office of Public Works, mounted an exhibition at Dublin's Phoenix Park entitled Parks, <b>Our</b> <b>Shared</b> Heritage: The Phoenix Park, Dublin & The Royal Parks, London, demonstrating the historical links between Richmond Park (and other Royal Parks in London) and Phoenix Park. This exhibition was also displayed at the Mall Galleries in London in July and August 2017.|$|E

25|$|In section one, Kant argues from {{common sense}} {{morality}} {{to the supreme}} principle of morality, which he calls the categorical imperative. Kant thinks that uncontroversial premises from <b>our</b> <b>shared</b> common sense morality, and analysis of common sense concepts such as ‘the good’, ‘duty’, and ‘moral worth’, will yield the supreme principle of morality, namely, the categorical imperative. Kant’s discussion in section one can be roughly divided into four parts: (1) The good will (2) The teleological argument. (3) The three propositions regarding duty and (4) The categorical imperative.|$|E

National Chief of the AFN, Phil Fontaine, said the package was meant to cover [...] "decades in time, innumerable events and countless injuries to First Nations individuals and communities". Justice Minister Irwin Cotler applauded the compensation decision noting that the placement of children in the residential school system was [...] "the single most harmful, disgraceful and racist act in our history".

500|$|The {{book has}} {{received}} mixed reviews. Some critics have praised the novel for {{its focus on}} underlying human decency. The New York Times Caroline Elkins felt that the pretext of the novel [...] "initially feels contrived", but assessed that [...] "in a world full of turpitude and injustice, it is [...] bold, impulsive choices that challenge the inevitability of despair, transforming a political novel into an affecting story of human triumph." [...] James Urquhart of The Independent called the book [...] "a powerful piece of art", writing: [...] "Besides sharp, witty dialogue, an emotionally charged plot and the vivid characters' ethical struggles, The Other Hand delivers a timely challenge to reinvigorate our notions of civilised decency". Equally, Andrew Rosenheim of Publishers Weekly found the book noteworthy for Cleave's [...] "ability to find a redemptive grace {{in the midst of}} almost inconceivable horror." [...] while Jeremy Jehu of The Daily Telegraph deemed it an [...] "elegant parable" [...] and a [...] "challenge to every cosy, knee-jerk liberal inclined to spout off about <b>our</b> <b>shared</b> humanity and global obligations." ...|$|E

Caffrey adds: [...] "For a piece inspired by {{the simple act of}} waiting for a friend to arrive at his Los Angeles home on a foggy night, 'Blue Jay Way' is a haunted house of a hit, adding an ethereal, creepy mythos to the City of Angels." [...] Writing for The A.V. Club, Chuck Klosterman describes the song as being among [...] "the trippiest... material [...] ever made", while Mark Kemp of Paste views it as [...] "wonderfully wobbly". Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork Media includes [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] among the EP's four [...] "low-key marvels", about which he opines: [...] "Few of them are anyone's all-time favorite Beatles songs... yet this run seems to achieve a majesty in part because of that: It's a rare stretch of amazing Beatles music that can seem like a private obsession rather than a permanent part of <b>our</b> <b>shared</b> culture." ...|$|E
