Curs acadèmic 2014 - 2015 The booming {{perovskite}} {{solar cells}} (PSCs) field {{has emerged from}} the solid-state dye-sensitized photovoltaic cells with significant advances in solar to electric power conversion efficiency {{in a relatively short}} time. However, a lot a research is currently trying to explain many poorly understood aspects of its <b>operating</b> <b>modes.</b> <b>Current</b> density-voltage () solar cells response has always been a fundamental photovoltaics characterization, and specifically on PSCs it presents an anomalous hysteretic behavior whose origin has been mainly addressed to ferroelectric or ionic effects.

Furthermore, we present a methodological review for the proper performance of Mott-Schottky analysis in PSCs stressing on the importance of complementary impedance spectroscopy characterization. On this issue we highlight our finds of an analogous hysteresis and an exponential capacitance excess on capacitance-voltage characteristics that can be associated with an exponential density of localized states below the conduction band.

40|$|The growing {{pervasiveness of}} {{broadband}} Internet expands both {{the range of}} rich media assets that can be delivered {{as well as the}} universe of possible receivers. This in turn, opens the door for the creation of new forms of delivering rich media content, establishing a diversity of associated value chains and Business Models (BMs). The full adoption of this new medium is something that is yet to be accomplished. It has been stalled by the hesitation of the key players in the content production and distribution industry which is closely related to the technical and legal difficulties in dealing with the free file sharing phenomenon. Their strategy for the adoption of the Internet medium has generally involved the employment of restrictive DRM enforcing technology to preserve pre-Internet (legacy) <b>operating</b> <b>modes.</b> <b>Current</b> approaches, within this context, have aimed at agilizing and facilitating the full adoption of this new medium by providing efficient, interoperable DRM enforcing tools to harness its power. However, the current resistance to DRM adoption, by some major Web media distributors, does not foretell a bright future for the use of restrictive DRM schemes for Internet based delivery of digital goods. New solutions are thus required to enable the creation of new BMs, taking advantage of the opportunities offered by broadband Internet. In this context, the work described here proposes an alternative approach to the use of DRM, aiming at optimizing content distribution and usability and promoting content usage governance. The logic behind this proposal is based on the use of DRM schemes that favor content governance over rigid access restriction. These changes permit the development of new BMs which are very much inline with upcoming Internet businesses.

Modula-tion rates are up to 3 kHz/ps. Each structure con-sists of two side-coupled buncher cavities, resonantly coupled to a ferrite-loaded tuner cavity. The needed frequency change df in the buncher cells is produced by a 50 x Af change in the tuner, accomplished by varying a magnetic field applied to the ferrite per-pendicular to the rf magnetic field. Fast modulation of this bias is provided by a low-inductance ferrite-core magnet excited by a special function generator.

A summary of applications of hybrid power amplifiers is then provided, giving a comprehensive idea of the diffusion of such systems and of their employment according to different power level and frequency bands at which they are required to operate.

Our aim is to extend SCT by introducing a mechanism for managing different <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> for the controlled system. An <b>operating</b> <b>mode</b> corresponds to a specific system structure (engagement or disengagement of different system components) and specified tasks.

Air ion physics and instrumentation are reviewed, including the historical context. A miniaturised Gerdien condenser for ion measurement, operating in situ to minimise inlet errors, is described. Two <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b> using independent <b>current</b> and voltage decay measurements are employed. A more sophisticated self-calibrating and fully programmable ion mobility spectrometer (PIMS) based on the same principles, is also discussed. Detailed analysis of error terms and application of new technology is demonstrated to greatly improve its capability. Self-consistent experimental approaches, including ionisation and ion concentration instruments, are used for calibration. In developing and characterising the individual components of the PIMS, favourable and unfavourable operating regimes are identified: this approach can also be applied to other aspiration ion counting techniques. Use of a sophisticated programmable electrometer permits compensation for leakage terms. Electrically-charged aerosol particles have been found to complicate the ion measurements. Consequently, conventional ion-aerosol theory, which neglects the particulate concentration, is thought to be incomplete. The polymodal ion mobility spectrum is also found to influence the instrument's operation.
