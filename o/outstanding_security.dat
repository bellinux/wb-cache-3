40|$|An initial {{security}} {{evaluation of}} the proposed International Monitoring System (IMS) suggests safeguards at various points in the IMS to provide reliable information to the user community. Modeling the IMS as a network of information processing nodes provides a suitable architecture for assessing data surety needs of the system. The recommendations in this paper {{include the use of}} public-key authentication for data from monitoring stations and for commands issued to monitoring stations. Other monitoring station safeguards include tamper protection of sensor subsystems, preservation of data (i. e. short-term archival), and limiting the station`s network services. The recommendations for NDCs focus on the need to provide a backup to the IDC for data archival and data routing. Safeguards suggested for the IDC center on issues of reliability. The production of event bulletins should employ {open_quotes}two-man{close_quotes} procedures. As long as the data maintains its integrity, event bulletins can be produced by NDCs as well. The effective use of data authentication requires a sound key management system. Key management systems must be developed for the authentication of data, commands, and event bulletins if necessary. It is recommended that the trust placed in key management be distributed among multiple parties. The recommendations found in this paper offer safeguards for identified vulnerabilities in the IMS with regard to data surety. However, several <b>outstanding</b> <b>security</b> issues still exist. These issues include the need to formalize and obtain a consensus on a threat model and a trust model for the IMS. The final <b>outstanding</b> <b>security</b> issue that requires in-depth analysis concerns the IDC as a potential single point of failure in the current IMS design...|$|E

As one of the enabling technologies, Advanced Metering Infrastructure refers to systems which measure, collect and analyze energy usage, and interact with advanced devices such as smart meters through various communication media either on request or on pre-defined schedules. This paper focuses on proposing the technical requirements imposed on the communications network for AMI. Then we examine each of the proposed AMI consumer application standards found in open literature based on these requirements. We will discuss the system engineering approach taken by NIST/EPRI to develop standards for smart grid and AMI and highlight <b>outstanding</b> <b>security</b> and interoperability issues concerned for deploying smart grid AMI.

40|$|Smart grids {{introduce}} many <b>outstanding</b> <b>security</b> {{and privacy}} issues, especially when smart meters {{are connected to}} public networks, creating an Internet of things in which customer usage data is frequently exchanged and processed in large volumes. In this research, we propose a cloud-based data storage and processing model {{with the ability to}} preserve user privacy and confidentiality of smart meter data in a smart grid. This goal is achieved by encrypting smart meter data before storage on the cloud using a homomorphic asymmetric key cryptosystem. By applying the homomorphic feature of the cryptographic technique, we propose methods to allow most of the computing works of calculating customer invoices based on total electricity consumption to be done directly on encrypted data by the cloud. One of the outstanding features in our model is the aggregation of encrypted smart meter readings using fixed-point number arithmetic. To test the feasibility of our model, we conducted many experiments to estimate the number of homomorphic additions to be performed by the cloud and the computation time in different billing periods using data from the Smart project, in which smart grid readings were continuously collected from different households in every second within two months and electricity usage data collected every minute from 400 anonymous houses in one day. We also propose a parallel version of our billing algorithm to utilize the processing capability of multi-core processors in cloud servers so that computation time is reduced significantly compared to using our sequential algorithm. Our research works and experiments demonstrate clearly how cloud services can strengthen the security, privacy and efficiency of privacy-sensitive data frequently exchanged and processed in an Internet of things where smart meters communicate directly with public networks...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly complex, integrated and distributed, {{in order to meet}} the escalating demands for functionality. This has given rise to concepts such as system-of-systems (SoS), which organise a myriad of independent component systems into a collaborative super-system, capable of achieving unmatchable levels of functionality. Despite its advantages, SoS is still an infantile concept with many <b>outstanding</b> <b>security</b> concerns, including the lack of effective behavioural monitoring. This can be largely attributed to its distributed, decentralised and heterogeneous nature, which poses many significant challenges. The uncertainty and dynamics of both the SoS’s structure and function poses further challenges to overcome. Due to the unconventional nature of a SoS, existing behavioural monitoring solutions are often inadequate as they are unable to overcome these challenges. This monitoring deficiency can result in the occurrence of misbehaviour, which is one of the most serious yet underestimated security threats facing SoSs and their components. This thesis presents a novel misbehaviour detection framework specifically developed for operation in a SoS environment. By combining the use of uniquely calculated behavioural threshold profiles and periodic threshold adaptation, the framework is able to cope with monitoring the dynamic behaviour and suddenly occurring changes that affect threshold reliability. The framework improves SoS contribution and monitoring efficiency by controlling monitoring observations using statecharts, which react to the level of behavioural threat perceived by the system. The accuracy of behavioural analysis is improved by using a novel algorithm to quantify detected behavioural abnormalities, in terms of their level of irregularity. The framework utilises collaborative behavioural monitoring to increase the accuracy of the behavioural analysis, and to combat the threat posed by training based attacks to the threshold adaptation process. The validity of the collaborative behavioural monitoring is assured by using the novel behavioural similarity assessment algorithm, which selects the most behaviourally appropriate SoS components to collaborate with. The proposed framework and its subsequent techniques are evaluated via numerous experiments. These examine both the limitations and relative merits when compared to monitoring solutions and techniques from similar research areas. The results of these conclude that the framework is able to offer misbehaviour monitoring in a SoS environment, with increased efficiency and reduced false positive rates, false negative rates, resource usage and run-time requirements...|$|E
40|$|This study explores Security Sector Reform as {{a concept}} to address peace {{building}} or post-conflict reconstruction in a country attaining independence or emerging from a major conflict {{as in the case}} of South Sudan. Although various descriptions for a security sector exist, it is a common term applied to refer to structures, institutions, and personnel who are responsible for managing, providing, and overseeing security within a state. In general it refers to the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, national intelligence agencies, border control agencies, and civil protection entities. SSR refers to actions aimed at strengthening legitimate institutions and governance to provide citizens security, justice, and jobs which is crucial to break the cycle of violence. SSR is also conceptualised within the enlarged definition of security which includes human security. This emphasises the approach that SSR is not only restricted to defence and the role of law and order, but is also included in wider political, economic, and social issues. Within the concept of SSR, various prerequisites are stated for the effective execution of SSR within a state. For an analysis of effective SSR in South Sudan, the following aspects were identified to apply as a theoretical model to analyse the execution of SSR in South Sudan. These aspects were the necessity of a formalised peace agreement; the execution of a clear and effective DDR programme; the importance of foreign involvement and international military involvement; the importance of the institutionalisation of security sector structures, and civil oversight. The study concludes that certain aspects of the SSR plan contributed to peace building and post-conflict reconstruction such as certain provisions of the peace agreement, the involvement of the international community, and financial support. However, SSR in South Sudan mainly failed due to a failure of the DDR process, the inability of the international involvement to address <b>outstanding</b> <b>security</b> issues, a failure to address border demarcations, and a total failure to install effective security sectors and civil oversight mechanisms over the military. The study on the other hand suggests SSR {{as a concept}} for post-conflict reconstruction, specifically within a state acquiring independence such as South Sudan, should be viewed as a workable concept. As a model to address peace building or post-conflict reconstruction, SSR can indeed be effective. It provides for a wide spectrum of measures to address security, political, and economic disparities within a state emerging from a conflict and aspiring to democratise as a new state such {{as in the case of}} South Sudan. The failure of the SSR concept in South Sudan is not ascribed to an insufficient SSR process or plan, but due to the non-adherence of the provisions of the plan by the signatories of the plan and the socioeconomic, ethnic, and security challenges in independent South Sudan that would have complicated any SSR attempt. SSR as a concept can be applied for peacebuilding if certain conditions such as enforced DDR, commitment by international role players, the enforcement of provisions of the peace agreement, and effective measures to institute the de-politisation of the military are provided.
