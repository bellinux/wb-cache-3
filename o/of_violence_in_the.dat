5|$|A February 1994 {{study by}} Samuel Robert Lichter, {{president}} of the Center for Media and Public Affairs, found that the second season of Highlander was the most violent syndicated show of the 1993-1994 season. According to it, there were 31 scenes <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> premiere episode.|$|E
5|$|In the film, {{most of the}} {{numerous}} acts of violence are committed off-screen. The violent acts were also designed to be quick, reflecting the actual speed <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real world. The focus {{was not on the}} direct victims of the perpetuated violence, but the impact of violence on the perpetrators or witnesses to the act.|$|E
5|$|From October 1988 to September 1994 {{the voices}} of representatives from Sinn Féin and several Irish republican and loyalist groups were banned by the British {{government}} from being broadcast on television and radio in the United Kingdom. The restrictions, announced by the Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, on 19 October 1988, covered eleven organisations based in Northern Ireland and followed a heightened period <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> history of the Troubles, {{as well as the}} government's belief in a need to prevent Sinn Féin from using the media for political advantage.|$|E

50|$|Several reports {{claim that}} there are no {{accurate}} representative numbers on <b>the</b> prevalence <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> DRC because <b>of</b> underreporting and lack of research. Moreover, so far, there are no reports to indicate differences <b>in</b> rates <b>of</b> sexual <b>violence</b> based upon education, income, or residence (urban or rural).

5|$|In April 1990, he {{arranged}} {{for several hundred}} Asháninka to make a five-day trek from the central highlands into the mountains of Peru at Tzibokiroato. During this time period, he was recalled by his religious superiors to Lima, where they questioned his arming the Asháninka, because of {{the view that the}} Catholic Church should not use violence. Gagnon responded that the Church had resorted to the use <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, and should not be hypocritical.|$|E
5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor is elected {{on the same}} election ticket as the Governor in a statewide election held every four years, concurrent with United States presidential elections. Should a {{lieutenant governor}} die while in office, resign, or succeed to the governorship, the constitution specifies no mechanism by which to fill vacancies in the lieutenant governor's office. Historically, the position has generally remained vacant during such events. The last attempt to fill such a vacancy in 1887 led to the outbreak <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state legislature known as the Black Day of the General Assembly. However, {{in recent years the}} Governor has appointed a Lieutenant Governor if a vacancy arises.|$|E
5|$|When the October journées took place, France's revolutionary decade, 1789–1799, {{had barely}} begun. The revolution's {{capacity}} for violence was as yet not fully realized. The storming of the Bastille had occurred {{less than three}} months earlier. Flush with newly discovered power, the common citizens of France – particularly in the teeming capital, Paris – felt a newly discovered desire to participate in politics and government. The poorest among them were almost exclusively concerned with the issue of food: most workers spent nearly half their income on bread. In the post-Bastille period, price inflation and severe shortages in Paris became commonplace, as did local incidents <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marketplaces.|$|E
5|$|The Rock Springs {{massacre}} {{was seen}} by observers at the time, and by historians today, as the worst, most significant instance <b>of</b> anti-Chinese <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century United States.

Among <b>the</b> events <b>of</b> anti-Chinese <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American west, the Rock Springs massacre is considered the most widely publicized.|$|R

5|$|Black Sabbath {{was made}} {{at the end of}} {{production}} of The Girl Who Knew Too Much during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. American International Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as {{it had to be done}} rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for American audiences which led to decreasing the amount <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. The film was first conceived under the title The Fear.|$|E
5|$|Jinnah {{rejected}} Gandhi's {{proposal and}} called for Direct Action Day, on 16 August 1946, to press Muslims to publicly gather in cities and support his proposal for partition of Indian subcontinent into a Muslim state and non-Muslim state. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, the Muslim League Chief Minister of Bengal – now Bangladesh and West Bengal, gave Calcutta's police special holiday to celebrate the Direct Action Day. The Direct Action Day triggered a mass murder of Calcutta Hindus and the torching of their property, and holidaying police were missing to contain or stop the conflict. The British government did not order its army to move in to contain the violence. The violence on Direct Action Day led to retaliatory violence against Muslims across India. Thousands of Hindus and Muslims were murdered, {{and tens of thousands}} were injured in the cycle <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> days that followed. Gandhi visited the most riot-prone areas to appeal a stop to the massacres.|$|E
5|$|The party's {{views on}} the United States and the Middle East have evolved over time. Despite the anti-American views of some right-wing forums in the 1970s and 1980s (that chiefly were rooted in worries over US {{cultural}} expansion and hegemonic role in world politics {{at the expense of}} Europe), the FPÖ were more positively inclined towards the United States under Haider's leadership in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, this changed in 2003 following Haider visiting Saddam Hussein {{on the eve of the}} Iraq War; he subsequently condemned US foreign policy and derided George W. Bush for not being very different from Hussein. This move was strongly criticised by the FPÖ, which was part of the then-current government. Nevertheless, in the mid- to late 2000s the FPÖ too criticised US foreign policy as promoted by Bush, which it saw as leading to increased levels <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East. The party also became more critical of Israel's part in the Israel-Palestine conflict.|$|E

5|$|Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, {{was well}} {{received}} by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty. Dissanayake explains that the audience {{was fascinated by the}} dialogues and mannerisms of the character, and this element of spectacle outweighed his actions, a first for Indian melodrama. He notes that the picturisation <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film was glamourised and uninhibited. He further notes that, unlike earlier melodramas in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male fetish, in Sholay, the male body becomes the centrepiece. It becomes the battleground where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay {{can be viewed as a}} national allegory: it lacks a comforting logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the devaluation of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and vigilante action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release. This tension culminated in the Emergency (rule by decree) declared by prime minister Indira Gandhi in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai Police {{announced}} its move to put Raj under their custody on 13 February, which created an upsurge <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state {{and led to}} two deaths. Attacks on North Indians were reported from Mumbai, Pune, Jalna, Beed, Aurangabad and Latur. Shops, offices and other business establishments were shut down {{in different parts of}} Mumbai, as MNS workers threatened violence in case their leader was arrested. Central Mumbai localities were most affected, especially around Dadar and Shivaji Park, the strongholds of both the MNS and the Shiv Sena. The police blocked roads in front of the residence of Raj in the Shivaji Park area. A civic activist named James John was assaulted by suspected MNS workers while he was attempting to photograph them forcing shop owners to down shutters in JB Nagar, Andheri. John suffered two rib fractures and bruises on his lungs. In Nashik, an employee of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, a Maharashtrian, died during a stone pelting on state-run buses by MNS supporters. A migrant from Bihar, who was a security guard with a private company at Igatpuri in Nashik district, was killed by a mob.|$|E
