Chromatophores are cells containing pigment, which can change their size {{to make their}} colour more or less visible. Some animals, including many butterflies and birds, have microscopic structures in scales, bristles or feathers which give them brilliant iridescent colours.

Animals <b>often</b> <b>use</b> {{two or more of}} these mechanisms together to produce the colours and effects they need.|$|E
5|$|Biochemistry {{laboratories}} <b>often</b> <b>use</b> {{in vitro}} studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes.

5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning.

For instance, adult speakers <b>often</b> <b>use</b> several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint.|$|E

This procedure is commonly performed by flight paramedics. Flight paramedics <b>often</b> <b>use</b> RSI to intubate before transport because intubation in a moving fixed-wing or rotary-wing aircraft {{is extremely difficult to}} perform due to environmental factors. The patient will be paralyzed and intubated on the ground before transport by aircraft.|$|E
