5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to at all <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the will. Instead, an agreement made between the testator and trustees elsewhere. The trustee will instead be named only a beneficiary. In {{the case of a}} half-secret trust, the fact that the beneficiary holds as trustee only is declared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the will, but not the other terms of the trust.|$|E

He also appeared in the 1942 film The Pride of the Yankees, as well as the 1948 film The Babe Ruth Story, as himself in a cameo role on both occasions.|$|E

5|$|Cormorants are {{medium to}} large aquatic birds with mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} {{coloured}} skin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> The bill is long, thin and sharply hooked for catching fish and aquatic invertebrates.

5|$|Ritter von Laurin, the Austrian {{consul-general}} in Egypt, {{was able}} to inspect a fragment of the Stone removed by Muhammad Ali in 1817 and reported {{that it had a}} pitch-black exterior and a silver-grey, fine-grained interior in which tiny cubes of a bottle-green material were embedded. There are reportedly a few white or yellow spots <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the Stone, and it is officially described as being white {{with the exception of the}} face.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in {{the skin}} that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair of mammals. In humans, they occur in the greatest number <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and scalp, but also on {{all parts of the}} skin except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The type of secretion of the sebaceous glands is referred to as holocrine.|$|E

5|$|The white fur on {{the chin}} and around the eyes is in sharp {{contrast}} with the black stripes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face.</b> The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are all white. Darkness typically increases as the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E
5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, familial trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> though they are more common in tuberous sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|A young {{specimen}} of the Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus species (TMP 94.143.1) shows bite marks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> that were inflicted by another tyrannosaur. The bite marks are healed over, {{indicating that the}} animal survived the bite. A full-grown Dinosaur Park Daspletosaurus (TMP 85.62.1) also exhibits tyrannosaur bite marks, showing that attacks to the face were not limited to younger animals. While {{it is possible that}} the bites were attributable to other species, intraspecific aggression, including facial biting, is very common among predators. Facial bites are seen in other tyrannosaurs like Gorgosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, as well as in other theropod genera like Sinraptor and Saurornitholestes. Darren Tanke and Phil Currie hypothesize that the bites are due to intraspecific competition for territory or resources, or for dominance within a social group.|$|E

5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} (BHD), also Hornstein–Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, Hornstein–Knickenberg syndrome, and fibrofolliculomas with trichodiscomas and acrochordons {{is a human}} {{autosomal dominant}} genetic disorder that can cause susceptibility to kidney cancer, renal and pulmonary cysts, and noncancerous tumors of the hair follicles, called fibrofolliculomas. The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas {{are the most common}} manifestation, found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%), but only 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax). Kidney tumors, both cancerous and benign, occur in 14–34% of people with BHD; the associated kidney cancers are often rare hybrid tumors.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face,</b> it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E
5|$|Collected in deposit, {{the spores}} of B. mirabilis are olive-brown. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are {{spindle-shaped}} to roughly elliptical, with smooth, thick walls, and have dimensions of 18–22 by 7–9µm. Overholts' 1940 publication on the species reported spore dimensions of 20–26 by 8–9µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), 4-spored, and have dimensions of 31–36 by 7–11µm. Cystidia (sterile cells <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of a gill) are thin-walled, and measure 60–90 by 10–18µm. There are no clamp connections {{present in the}} hyphae.|$|E

Hanigan went on the DL after he was hit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> mask by a foul tip and suffered a concussion; he returned on August 8, 2009. For the season, Hanigan had the best fielding percentage as a catcher (.998), and the second best caught stealing percentage (42.9) in the majors.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the United States Post Office {{issued the}} first U.S. Postage stamp to depict an actual {{historic}} event, {{and the subject}} that was chosen was the Pony Express. Until then only the faces of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson were found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of U.S. Postage. Sometimes mistaken for an actual stamp used by the Pony Express, the 'Pony Express Stamp' issue was released in 1869 (8 years after the Pony Express service had ended) to honor the men who rode the long and sometimes dangerous journeys and to commemorate the service they provided for the nation. In 1940 and 1960 commemorative stamps were issued for the 80th and 100th anniversaries of the Pony Express respectively.|$|E
