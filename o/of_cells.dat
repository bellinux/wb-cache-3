5|$|Patterns in Rule 184 {{typically}} quickly stabilize, {{either to}} {{a pattern in}} which the cell states move in lockstep one position leftwards at each step, or to a pattern that moves one position rightwards at each step. Specifically, if the initial density <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> with state 1 is less than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> in state 1, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> in state 0. Patterns of this type move rightwards. If, on the other hand, the initial density is greater than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> in state 0, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> in state 1, and patterns of this type move leftwards. If the density is exactly 50%, the initial pattern stabilizes (more slowly) to a pattern that can equivalently be viewed as moving either leftwards or rightwards at each step: an alternating sequence of 0s and 1s.|$|E

5|$|From the {{descriptions}} of the rules above, two important properties of its dynamics may immediately be seen. First, in Rule 184, for any finite set <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> with periodic boundary conditions, the number of 1s {{and the number of}} 0s in a pattern remains invariant throughout the pattern's evolution. Rule 184 and its reflection are the only elementary cellular automata to have this property of number conservation. Similarly, if the density of 1s is well-defined for an infinite array <b>of</b> <b>cells,</b> it remains invariant as the automaton carries out its steps. And second, although Rule 184 is not symmetric under left-right reversal, it does have a different symmetry: reversing left and right {{and at the same time}} swapping the roles of the 0 and 1 symbols produces a cellular automaton with the same update rule.|$|E
40|$|In their development, plants {{precisely}} {{control the}} patterns <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> size, cell shape and cell division, the position <b>of</b> differentiation <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types, {{and the position}} and number of organs.

These examples indicate that both the fate and shape <b>of</b> differentiated plant <b>cells</b> can be determined by the size of their undifferentiated precursors, and that the primary effect of mutations that alter cell fate and cellular shape can be on cell size.

Although two kinds <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> death, apoptosis and necrosis, are recognized, {{one of the major}} advances in our understanding <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> death has been the recognition that the pathways traditionally associated with apoptosis may be very critical in the form <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> injury associated with necrosis. Renal tubular epithelial cell injury from ischemia has been generally regarded as a result of necrotic form <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> death. We briefly describe recent evidence indicating that pathways generally associated with apoptosis, including endonuclease activation, role of mitochondria and caspases, are important in renal tubular injury.

40|$|Abstract: The precise {{coordination}} <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> {{death and}} cell differentiation during {{the formation of}} developing digits is essential for generating properly shaped limbs. Retinoic acid (RA) {{has a fundamental role}} in digit development; it promotes or inhibits the molecular expression of several critical genes. This control of gene expression establishes molecular cascades that enable both the commencement <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> death and the inhibition <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. In this review, we focus on the antagonistic functions between RA and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling in the control <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> death and between RA and transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²) signaling in the control <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation...|$|R

5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps the number <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> relatively constant in adults. There {{are two different}} ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosisâor programmed cell deathâis a normal healthy function <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes {{play a crucial role}} in this process.|$|E

40|$|Questions: What is the macroevolutionary {{relationship}} between body size, number <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types and metabolism? Furthermore, {{why does the}} {{relationship between}} body size and the number <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types hold between major metazoan clades but not within closely related taxa? Mathematical methods: Expand the allometric relationship between size and metabolism to include (1) the energetic costs of supporting an increased number <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types and (2) the phylogenetic constraints governing the number <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types. Key assumptions: An increase in organismal size selects for additional cell types. This is due to biophysical constraints and transport demands. The increase in cell types allows the organism to perform new functions. The extra cell types also require more intercellular networks. Therefore, {{the amount of energy}} required per unit of body mass should increase with the number <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types. Phylogeny may also constrain the number <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types within taxa. This constraint will limit the number <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types to be approximately constant within a bauplan (a unique organismal form comprised of an anatomical and physiological design). Predictions: Organismal size should be positively correlated to the number <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types across metazoan taxa. However, this relationship will not hold within clades due to energetic and phylogenetic constraints. The energetic constraint leads to a positive correlation between the number <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types and metabolic intensity (the mass-specific rate of energy processing standardized to a given body size) across metazoan bauplans. Available data support these predictions. Metabolic intensity is positively related to the number <b>of</b> <b>cell</b> types in metazoan clades...|$|R
