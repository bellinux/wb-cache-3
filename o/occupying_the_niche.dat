In order to do so, the authors explored how the Swales’ model is applied in writing a research article introduction. The exploration was approached through a library study on the Swales model application. Some previous studies applying Swales Model were gathered and categorized into three categories − application of Swales model on different types of genre besides the research article introduction, different discipline or field and the last is the application of Swales’ on the research article introduction across languages. Another three articles written by professional writers were also collected as samples of introductions that have successfully presented three obligatory moves – establishing a territory (Move 1), establishing a niche (Move 2) and <b>occupying</b> <b>the</b> <b>niche</b> or {{presenting the present work}} (Move 3) − proposed by Swales’ model. Those introductions were segmented into those three moves and analyzed based on a communication purpose in every step derived from each move. In order to add more comprehension about the model, an analysis was also conducted on introductions for seven articles in the English Education Journal (EEJ) published by the Graduate Program in English Language Education at Syiah Kuala University. The purpose of the analysis was to show the differences in structure of introductions organized without following the CARS Swales model. Conclusions are that the CARS Swales model is relevant for the teaching of introductions for research writing and it can be a guideline to teach students the moves and steps of this model for communication purposes...|$|E

40|$|Tese (doutorado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro Tecnológico, Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência e Engenharia de Materiais, Florianópolis, 2013. Abstract : The use of {{polished}} high gloss porcelain tile {{has become increasingly}} common in civil construction. One of the main factors that determine this choice is the great aesthetic call due to the high gloss, <b>occupying</b> <b>the</b> <b>niche</b> market previously dominated by natural stones, such as marble or granite, for example. The machining process to obtain that high gloss {{can be divided into}} several distinct stages, the first one is the flat grinding for roughing and removal of orthogonal defects from the top surface of ceramic plate. Commonly, the process parameters used into grinding are obtained directly on industrial line by "trial and error", depending strongly on the operator's experience and sensitivity to adjust the machinery. As a result of this empirical procedure, there are several problems that increase the cost of production and may injure the final gloss of the product. So this doctoral thesis aims to increase the knowledge of tribology and kinematics, optimizing the fragile grinding process for porcelain tile. It is considered in this study the physical interaction between the abrasive grain and the surface of the ceramic plate, as well the kinematic described by this one on the work piece. As a way to simulate the tribological effect during machining, tests were performed employing a surface grinding machine and sclerometry, using an abrasive well with a single diamond abrasive grain and a Vickers indenter as abrasive tool, respectively. The results were analyzed by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and optical perfilometry. In theoretical evaluation, the equations proposed in the literature for material removal by fragile scratching based on the basic characteristics of ceramic were compared to the experimental results obtained, in order to validate their representativeness. At the end, based on the conclusions presented in this work, adaptations are proposed to improve the mathematical modelling, as well process conditions are pointed to optimize the fragile grinding step for high gloss porcelain tiles, seeking a balance between the state of art and the economic viability of the process...|$|E

Temas como aquecimento global e a eminente perda da quantidade e qualidade da água são discutidos constantemente. Um outro problema ambiental mais específico tem preocupado especialistas no mundo todo, incluindo o Brasil. Trata-se da disseminação em grande escala de espécies exóticas. O tema tem sido tratado no meio científico e acadêmico como invasões biológicas e não se restringe somente às plantas. O estudo aqui apresentado trata de uma espécie arbórea com grande disseminação no país e utilizada em áreas urbanas e faixas de praia devido à sombra proporcionada na época do verão. A ocorrência do chapéu-de-sol em unidades de conservação de proteção integral pode representar uma ameaça às espécies autóctones pela ocupação do espaço. A identificação com metodologia científica das características germinativas e sucesso reprodutivo foram a forma de avaliar o grau de ameaça que a espécie representa para o ambiente de restinga. Assim, esse estudo teve o objetivo de determinar o potencial de contaminação biológica do chapéu-de-sol (Terminalia catappa L.) através da análise do índice de velocidade de germinação (IVG), tempo médio de germinação, velocidade média de germinação, freqüência germinativa, germinabilidade (G%) e análise da taxa de sobrevivência e de transição de plântulas, jovens e adultos. Os resultados indicam que as sementes da espécie podem germinar em ampla faixa de temperatura, principalmente, se estiver a pleno sol. Frutos despolpados apresentaram maior velocidade e taxa de germinação. Plântulas apresentaram elevada taxa de mortalidade comparada aos indivíduos jovens e adultos. Concluiu-se que a espécie precisa ser retirada da área de restinga, pois, apesar de ser considerada estabelecida, em condições favoráveis ela se desenvolverá ocupando o nicho de outras espécies locais. Current and {{the next}} decade they will be identified in the time as group of the most excellent concerns with the ambient quality of the planet. Subjects as global heating and the eminent loss of the amount {{and quality of the}} water are argued constantly. A more specific ambient problem has worried specialists in the world all, including Brazil. One is about the large-scale dissemination of exotic species. The subject has been treated in the half academic as biological invasions and it is not only restricted to the plants. The study presented here it at the time deals with a trees species with great dissemination in the country and used in urban areas and beach bands due to proportionate shade of the summer. The occurrence of the singapure almond in protect areas of integral protection can represent a threat to the species for the occupation of the space. The identification with scientific methodology of the germination characteristics and reproductive success had been the form to evaluate the threat degree that the species represents for the environment of restinga. Thus, this study it had the objective to determine the potential of biological contamination of the singapure almond (Terminalia catappa L.) through the analysis of the index of germination speed (IVG), average time of germination, average speed of germination, frequency of germination, germinability (G%) and analysis of the tax of survival and transistion of seedly, young and adults. The results indicate that the seeds of the species can germinate in ample band of temperature, mainly, will be the full sun. Pulped fruits had presented greater speed and tax of germination. Seedly had presented high tax of comparative mortality to adult and youngs. The necessary species was concluded that to be removed of the area of restinga, therefore, although to be considered established, in favorable conditions it will develop itself <b>occupying</b> <b>the</b> <b>niche</b> of other local species...|$|E
