5|$|Straczynski {{spent a year}} {{researching the}} story after hearing about the Wineville Chicken Coop case from a contact at Los Angeles City Hall. Almost all of the film's script was drawn from {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> documentation. His first draft became the shooting script; {{it was his first}} film screenplay to be produced. Ron Howard had intended to direct the film, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Eastwood. Howard and his Imagine Entertainment partner Brian Grazer produced Changeling alongside Malpaso Productions' Robert Lorenz and Eastwood. Universal Pictures financed and distributed the film.|$|E

5|$|Two expeditions between 1860 and 1869 by Charles Francis Hall, {{who lived}} among the Inuit near Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island and later at Repulse Bay on the Canadian mainland, found camps, graves, and relics on the {{southern}} coast of King William Island, {{but none of the}} Franklin expedition survivors he believed would be found among the Inuit. Though he concluded that all of the Franklin crew were dead, he believed that the official expedition records would yet be found under a stone cairn. With the assistance of his guides Ebierbing and Tookoolito, Hall gathered hundreds <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> Inuit testimony. Among these materials are accounts of visits to Franklin's ships, and an encounter with a party of white men {{on the southern}} coast of King William Island near Washington Bay. In the 1990s, this testimony was extensively researched by David C. Woodman, and was the basis of two books, Unravelling the Franklin Mystery (1992) and Strangers Among Us (1995), in which he reconstructs the final months of the expedition.|$|E

5|$|No single motive or {{pattern has}} emerged through the {{thousands}} <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> evidence gathered. The selection of works puzzles the experts, specifically since more valuable artworks were available. The FBI's lead agent {{assigned to the}} case, Geoffrey J. Kelly, finds it difficult to understand why this assortment of items was stolen despite the thieves being in the museum for enough time to take whatever they wished. On {{their way to the}} finial, the thieves passed by two Raphaels and a Botticelli painting. Titian's The Rape of Europa, {{which is one of the}} museum's most well-known and valuable pieces, was not stolen. Due to the brutish ways the criminals handled the robbery, cutting the painting from their frames and smashing frames for two Degas sketches, investigators believe the thieves were amateur criminals, not experts commissioned to steal particular works. Some investigators believe the works were destroyed, explaining why they have not reappeared. Theories on the theft include that it was organized by the Irish Republican Army in order to raise money or bargain for the release of imprisoned comrades. Another theory states Whitey Bulger was the ringleader of the theft. At the time of the heist, he was Boston's top crime boss and an FBI informant.|$|E

25|$|The Hall of Names is a {{memorial}} to the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust. The main hall is composed of two cones: one ten meters high, with a reciprocal well-like cone excavated into the underground rock, its base filled with water. On the upper cone is a display featuring 600 photographs of Holocaust victims and fragments <b>of</b> <b>Pages</b> <b>of</b> Testimony. These {{are reflected in the}} water {{at the bottom of the}} lower cone, commemorating those victims whose names remain unknown. Surrounding the platform is the circular repository, housing the approximately 2.2 million Pages of Testimony collected to date, with empty spaces for those yet to be submitted.|$|E
25|$|The {{stories are}} {{formatted}} so that, {{after a couple}} <b>of</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> reading, the protagonist faces two or three options, each of which leads to more options, and then to one of many endings.

Likewise, {{there is no clear}} pattern among the various titles regarding the number of pages per ending, the ratio of good to bad endings, or the reader's progression backwards and forwards through the pages of the book. This allows for a realistic sense of unpredictability, and leads to the possibility of repeat readings, {{which is one of the}} distinguishing features of the books.|$|E
