5|$|A {{junior and}} infant {{department}} opened in September 1997 after {{the closure of}} St Audrey's Convent school. St Audrey's was a feeder school, and its closure allowed the then headmaster, Robert Repper, to transfer most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> staff to the new junior school. The junior and infant school {{has now become a}} preparatory school for the senior school. It was retitled as Magdalene House in 2005, a reference to a 17th-century scholarship which allowed two Wisbech Grammar School pupils to study at Magdalene College, Cambridge. There were 177 pupils registered in 2008, of whom 23 were in reception and the rest in years 1 to 6.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the very}} good {{reaction}} of the studio audience, a second series was commissioned before the first had been broadcast. However, journalists were critical of the show, highlighting stylistic similarities to Fawlty Towers. Some members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> profession and its unions objected to the negative representation of teachers and the comprehensive system. The second series did not receive a stable broadcast slot, with many episodes aired after 10pm. The first series was released on DVD in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Foundational {{elements}} for a student's learning {{were having a}} concept of (principally diatonic) scales as music and a basis for harmony. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> tools often used by Tristano, including for scales, was the metronome. The student set the metronome at or near its slowest setting initially, and gradually increased its speed, allowing a sense of time to develop, along with confidence in placing each note.|$|E
5|$|From {{a famous}} school, Mercator {{moved to the}} famous University of Leuven, where his full Latin name appears in the {{matriculation}} records for 1530.

5|$|After Marcin Kromer died {{in early}} March 1589, Andrew became the Prince-Bishop of Warmia {{and a member}} of the Senate of Poland. He {{supported}} the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> of philosophy and theology in the Collegium Hosianum in Braniewo, because he wanted to develop it into a university. At the request of Sigismund III Vasa, Pope Sixtus made Andrew coadjutor bishop of Piotr Myszkowski, the elderly bishop of Kraków. However, the Habsburgs wanted to prevent Andrew from seizing the bishopric which was situated near Royal Hungary. The new papal nuncio, Annibale di Capua (who was their supporter) convinced the king to nominate Jerzy Radziwiłł to the see after Myszkowski died on 5 April 1591. Capua emphasized that Andrew had not been an ordained priest. Most Polish noblemen regarded the Lithuanian Radziwiłł's appointment to a Polish see unlawful, but Pope Gregory XIV confirmed the king's decision.|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar {{soon became}} a center of {{learning}} in the Islamic world, and official pronouncements and court sessions were issued from and convened there. Under Fatimid rule, the previously secretive teachings of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab (school of law) were {{made available to the}} general public. Al-Nu‘man ibn Muhammad was appointed qadi (judge) under al-Mu’izz and placed in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab. Classes were taught at the palace of the Caliph, as well as at al-Azhar, with separate sessions available to women. During Eid ul-Fitr in 973, the mosque was rededicated by the caliph as the official congregational mosque in Cairo. Al-Mu’izz, and his son—when he in turn became caliph—would preach at least one Friday khutbah (sermon) during Ramadan at al-Azhar.|$|E
5|$|During his 16-year stay at CRGS, student numbers {{increased}} from 29 to 180 boys under his guidance, particularly through {{the introduction of}} day pupils. Shaw Jeffrey is also credited {{with the introduction of}} many changes at the school, including the introduction of purple blazers, the setting up of the Old Colcestrian Society for former boys (and quite often honoured former masters), a preparatory school, a cadet corps, an orchestra, a bugle band and a series of school entertainments and theatrical performances, and the acquisition of several buildings on behalf of the school. He was a national pioneer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> of modern European languages through phonetics, employed language teachers from Germany and France, and set up arrangements for foreign study during holidays.|$|E
50|$|The {{strategy}} has been to move from standards battles, to curriculum writing, to textbook adoption, all the while undermining <b>the</b> central positions <b>of</b> evolution in biology and methodological naturalism in science. The CSC is the primary organizer and promoter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Teach</b> <b>the</b> Controversy campaign. Examples <b>of</b> <b>Teach</b> <b>the</b> Controversy in action were the Kansas evolution hearings, the Santorum Amendment, 2002 Ohio Board of Education intelligent design controversy, and the Dover Area School District intelligent design controversy.|$|R

5|$|Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also {{enrolled}} at the Polytechnic that year. She {{was the only woman}} among the six students in the mathematics and physics section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.|$|E
5|$|This period {{also saw}} a {{significant}} expansion in Georgia Tech's postgraduate education programs, driven largely by the Cold War and the launch of Sputnik; this effort received substantial support from the EES. Despite its slow start, with the first Master of Science programs in the 1920s and the first Doctorate in 1946, the program became firmly established. In 1952 alone, around 80 students earned graduate degrees while working at EES. Herschel H. Cudd, EES director from 1952 to 1954, created a new promotion system for researchers that is still in use. Many EES researchers held the title of professor despite lacking a doctorate (or a comparable qualification for promotion {{as determined by the}} Georgia Board of Regents), something that irritated members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>teaching</b> faculty. The new system, approved in spring 1953, used the Board of Regents' qualifications for promotion and mirrored the academic tenure track.|$|E
