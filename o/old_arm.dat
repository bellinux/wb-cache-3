500|$|Particularly {{after his}} fastball slowed, Young relied upon his control. Young was once quoted as saying, [...] "Some {{may have thought}} it was {{essential}} to know how to curve a ball before anything else. Experience, to my mind, teaches to the contrary. Any young player who has good control will become a successful curve pitcher long before the pitcher who is endeavoring to master both curves and control at the same time. The curve is merely an accessory to control." [...] In addition to his exceptional control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury. For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Young was in his leagues' top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five. Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games. By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in spring training. [...] "I figured the <b>old</b> <b>arm</b> had just so many throws in it", said Young, [...] "and there wasn't any use wasting them." [...] Young once described his approach before a game: ...|$|E

Drake was later rushed to the ER after aggravating an <b>old</b> <b>arm</b> injury during the dispute. Drake was also involved in a feud with Tyga, stemming from Tyga's negative comments towards him during an interview with Vibe.

[...] Heston {{developed a reputation}} as a [...] "hard, crunching runner who smashed through opposition when he couldn't outspeed his rivals." [...] He was known as [...] "a clever dodger in the open" [...] who [...] "used his hands with telling effect in warding off tacklers." [...] In 1929, a newspaper reporter recalled Heston's running style as follows:"A strong arm helped Willie, Sr., to move 'em. After cracking through that line the <b>old</b> <b>arm</b> would go out. [...] You can still pick out men who used to play football against Michigan in '02 and '03, they say, because their faces seem just a little out of kilter. The straight arm in the old days sometimes wasn't so straight." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Parlour music" [...] {{was popular}} music {{performed}} in the parlours of middle class homes by amateur singers and pianists. Disseminated as sheet music, its heyday came in the 19th century {{as a result of}} a steady increase in the number of households with enough surplus cash to purchase musical instruments and instruction in music and with the leisure time and cultural motivation to engage in recreational music-making. In contrast to the chord-based classical music, parlour music features melodies, which are harmonically independent or not determined by the harmony. Many of the earliest parlour songs were transcriptions for voice and keyboard of other music, such as Thomas Moore's Irish Melodies, which comprised traditional tunes with new lyrics. Other genres performed included arias from Italian operas, patriotic selections, religious songs and pieces written for the musical stage, including excerpts from blackface minstrel shows. As the 19th century wore on, more and more songs were newly composed specifically for use by amateurs at home and these pieces began to develop a style all their own: similar in melodic and harmonic content to art songs of the day, but shorter and simpler in structure and making fewer technical demands on singer and accompanist. The high point of the parlour song came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in North America and the British Isles. Songs became more complex and sophisticated in their melodic and harmonic vocabulary and, in addition to their continuing use in the parlour, were also often sung in public recitals by professional singers. Characteristic and popular parlour songs include [...] "Home, Sweet Home" [...] by Henry Bishop with lyrics by John Howard Payne, [...] "The <b>Old</b> <b>Arm</b> Chair" [...] by Henry Russell, [...] "The Lost Chord" [...] composed by Arthur Sullivan with lyrics by Adelaide A. Proctor and [...] "Take Back the Heart" [...] by Claribel (Mrs. Charlotte Barnard).|$|E

60|$|Without farther {{speech he}} descended the stairs, and never paused till {{he reached the}} buttery. Here he called like a lion for the {{controller}} of these regions, by the various names of Kammerer, Keller-master, and so forth, to which the old Reinold, an ancient Norman esquire, answered not, until the Netherlander fortunately recollected his Anglo-Norman title of butler. This, his regular name of office, {{was the key to}} the buttery-hatch, and the old man instantly appeared, with his gray cassock and high rolled hose, a ponderous bunch of keys suspended by a silver chain to his broad leathern girdle, which, in consideration of the emergency of the time, he had thought it right to balance on the left side with a huge falchion, which seemed much too weighty for his <b>old</b> <b>arm</b> to wield.|$|E

He called for the drinks, and, still dazed and pondering, held up his own arm, {{and looked at it}} as at some new strange thing. He did not know this arm. It certainly was not the arm he had carried around with him all the years. The <b>old</b> <b>arm?</b> Why, it would have been play to turn down that young husky's.

He had gone back on himself. He had gone back on Dede. She was right, a thousand times right, and she had sense enough to know it, sense enough to refuse to marry a money slave with a whiskey-rotted carcass.|$|E

6000|$|What weighed most {{upon the}} Colonel's mind, F.

J.'s money after he had persuaded old Ridley to place 200 pounds in Indian shares! Good God, he and his family should rather perish than he would touch a farthing of it! Many fierce words were uttered to him by Mrs. Mackenzie, for instance--by her angry daughter at Musselburgh--Josey's husband, by Mr. Smee, R.A., and two or three Indian officers, friends of his own, who had entered into the speculation on his recommendation. These rebukes Thomas Newcome bore with an affecting meekness, as his faithful F. B. described to me, striving with many oaths and much loudness to carry off bis own emotion. But what moved the Colonel most of all, was a letter which came at this time from Honeyman in India, saying that he was doing well--that of course he knew of his benefactor's misfortune, and that he sent a remittance which, D. V., should be annual, in payment of his debt to the Colonel, and his good sister at Brighton. [...] "On receipt of this letter," [...] said F. B., [...] "the old man was fairly beaten--the letter, with the bill in it, dropped out of his hands. He clasped them together, shaking in every limb, and his head dropped down on his breast as he said, 'I thank my God Almighty for this!' and he sent the cheque off to Mrs. Honeyman by the post that night, sir, every shilling of it; and he passed his <b>old</b> <b>arm</b> under mine--and we went out to Tom's Coffee-House, and he ate some dinner the first time for ever so long, and drank a couple of glasses of port wine, and F. B. stood it, sir, and would stand his heart's blood that dear old boy." ...|$|E
