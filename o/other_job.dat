Despite this, the employment situation in York remained fairly buoyant until the effects of the late 2000s recession began to be felt.|$|E
25|$|Although {{enrollment}} in technical schools {{of various kinds}} had not yet increased enough to compensate for decreasing enrollments in regular senior middle schools, the proportion of vocational and technical students to total senior-middle-school students increased from about 5 percent in 1978 to almost 36 percent in 1985, although development was uneven. Further, to encourage greater numbers of junior-middle-school graduates to enter technical schools, vocational and technical school graduates were given priority in job assignments, while <b>other</b> <b>job</b> seekers had to take technical tests.|$|E

25|$|Peter Taylor {{took over}} in 1996 and, {{although}} never winning a tournament, his teams had an excellent record. He was controversially removed from the position in early 1999, however, and replaced initially by Peter Reid, who resigned after just one match in charge to dedicate more time to his <b>other</b> <b>job</b> as manager of Sunderland. Howard Wilkinson took over afterwards, yet could only produce four wins in ten competitive matches and quit {{after a year and}} a half in charge. David Platt took charge leaving his job at Nottingham Forest. Platt was U21 boss from 2001 to 2004, but had little success before Taylor's return. Taylor left in January 2007, as the senior national manager Steve McClaren wanted the U21s to have a full-time manager. Taylor, at the time, was combining his duties with his role as Crystal Palace boss.|$|E
25|$|Lev and Natalia {{were married}} in the Soviet Union. Little {{is known about the}} couple in the months that {{followed}} the Nazi and Romanian attack on the Soviet Union. They escaped Bessarabia, and fled further inland: Răutu is said to have been a mere laborer at a sand quarry and a kolkhoz. He and Natalia had two children, both of whom died, probably of hunger, during the months of Soviet retreat. At some point (perhaps in 1943), Răutu became head of the Radio Moscow Romanian-language division, making him a favorite of exile faction leader Ana Pauker's, together with Valter Roman and Petre Borilă. This assignment placed Răutu in direct contact with some of Pauker's colleagues in the Comintern: he replaced Basil Spiru, of Marx University fame, and was supervised by Rudolf Slánský. His <b>other</b> <b>job</b> was as book editor for the Foreign Languages Publishing House.|$|E
500|$|Commander Keen was an {{immediate}} hit for Apogee: the company's previous sales levels had been around US$7,000 per month, but by Christmas Keen already had sales of almost US$30,000. Miller described the game as [...] "a little atom bomb" [...] to magazine editors and BBS controllers when asked about it; its success led him to recruit his mother and hire his first employee to handle sales and phone calls from interested players, and to quit his <b>other</b> <b>job</b> and move Apogee from his house into an office. By June 1991, the game was bringing in over US$60,000 per month. Chris Parker of PC Magazine later in 1991 referred to the game's release as a [...] "tremendous success".|$|E

On his role in the season, Dunn stated, [...] "And so I knew going in that I had a finite amount of episodes, so it was like any <b>other</b> <b>job.</b> It was week-to-week and then I went on my merry way." ...|$|E
500|$|After her divorce, Angelou earns {{a living}} {{for herself and}} her son with music and dance; this {{decision}} marks a turning point in her life. Angelou's new career seems, as Hagen asserts, to be propelled by a series of parties, evoking the title of this book. Hagen also calls her tour with Porgy and Bess [...] "the biggest party by far of the book". McPherson calls Singin' and Swingin [...] "Angelou's praisesong" [...] to the opera. Angelou has [...] "fallen hopelessly in love with the musical", even turning down <b>other</b> <b>job</b> offers to tour with its European company. McPherson also calls Porgy and Bess [...] "an antagonist that enthralls Angelou, beckoning and seducing her away from her responsibilities". As Lupton states, Porgy and Bess is Angelou's [...] "foundation for her later performances in dance, theater, and song".|$|E

[...] The museum's guest book includes comments such as, [...] "I've never seen so many penises–and I went to boarding school!" [...] (from a New Zealand visitor), [...] "They're bigger in the USA," [...] (from someone from Wisconsin) and [...] "Is there a vagina museum?" [...] On this point, Sigurður has said, [...] "I'm only collecting the male organ. Somebody else has to do the <b>other</b> <b>job.</b> I'd be interested in how they would preserve it.

500|$|Elsewhere, barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald investigates a {{disturbance}} outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by. He attempts to leave discreetly, but Clara follows {{him to a}} coach. Not wishing {{to become involved in}} matters, the Doctor instructs Strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of Clara's memories with just a touch. Before they can do so, they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group. The Doctor realises that Clara's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting. Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory, she will forget {{how to deal with the}} snowmen. The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS. Clara follows him and knocks on the door, but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers. Clara returns to her <b>other</b> <b>job</b> as governess for the children of Captain Latimer. She learns that Latimer's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead. Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess' body is the only thing still frozen around them. She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny, who takes her to see Vastra. Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help. Clara chooses the word [...] "Pond", which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest.|$|E

2500|$|At {{that time}} diplomats were {{recruited}} from public schools, and it was said of Bevin {{that it was hard}} to imagine him filling any <b>other</b> <b>job</b> in the Foreign Office except perhaps that of an old and truculent lift attendant. In praise of Bevin, his Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office (Alexander Cadogan) wrote, [...] "He knows a great deal, is prepared to read any amount, seems to take in what he does read, and is capable of making up his own mind and sticking up for his (and our) point of view against anyone." [...] An alternative view is offered by Charmley, who writes that Bevin read and wrote with some difficulty, and that examination of Foreign Office documents shows little sign of the frequent annotations made by Anthony Eden, suggesting that Bevin preferred to reach most of his decisions after oral discussion with his advisers.|$|E
2500|$|The Canton of Aargau {{school system}} {{requires}} students to attend 11 years of schooling (two kindergarten, six primary school and three lower secondary). [...] The lower secondary level {{is divided into three}} tracks, Realschule, Sekundarschule and Bezirksschule. [...] The Realschule has the lowest level of academic difficulty and typically leads to an apprenticeship or vocational school. [...] The Sekundarschule leads to an apprenticeship, vocational education or professional training at a Fachmittelschule. [...] Bezirksschule is the most demanding track and it usually leads to a Mittelschule or Gymnasium. [...] During the 2016/17 school year there were a total of 2,204 students attending mandatory schools in a total of 120 classes. [...] Of these students, 372 were in 22 kindergarten classes. [...] There were a total of 372 primary students in 51 classes (27 of which were multi-age classrooms).
