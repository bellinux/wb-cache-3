50|$|In the polychords in {{the image}} above, the first might suggest a thirteenth chord, the second may suggest a D minor ninth chord with upper extensions, but the <b>octave</b> <b>separation</b> of the 3rd makes the {{suggestion}} of two independent triads a minor ninth apart even more likely, and the fourth is a split-third chord.|$|E
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to measure the coordinated activity of populations of neurons in the central nervous system. Here, we use immunocytochemical localization of Fos protein, a nuclear transcription factor, as a metric for 2 ̆ 2 sound activation 2 ̆ 2 to examine the populational response in the rat auditory brainstem. Fos protein expression is intimately related to the rate and pattern of neuronal firing. ^ The first issue addressed is the threshold sensitivity of granule and non-granule neuronal cell types in the cochlear nucleus (CN). Our results show that most CN neuron types can upregulate Fos expression when sound activated, {{and the number of}} Fos-expressing neurons is directly related to sound level. The threshold for Fos activation in granule cells is lower than that for non-granule cells. The number of Fos activated granule cells saturates at high sound levels, while the number of Fos activated non-granule cells is a monotonic function. ^ The second issue addressed is the frequency resolution in the auditory brainstem. Fos expression was used to investigate the separation of neural populations in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and the inferior colliculus (IC) activated by alternating tones at two different frequencies. We show that tones a quarter-octave apart will activate a single population of neurons, while tones of one-half <b>octave</b> <b>separation</b> or more will activate largely separate populations of neurons in the IC and the DCN. The width of the bands broadens with increased sound intensities, more rapidly in the DCN than in the IC. ^ Consequently, the last issue addressed the basis for lateral inhibition in the IC. To study intrinsic ipsilateral connections, small injections of a fluorogold and biotinylated dextran mixture were made into the IC to identify local circuits. Immunocytochemistry was then used to identify GABAergic neurons. Similar methods with larger injections identified the commissural projections from the contralateral IC. Our results show that 93...|$|E
30|$|There {{exists a}} gap in the {{performance}} between polyphony 4 and polyphony 5. This is due to the octave and fifth relations between the notes in these chords. In this case, the octave and fifth test sometimes fail when the chord includes several octaves and perfect fifths all together, because of the overlapping between the partials of more than three notes. On the other hand, the NER for a polyphony number of 6 is smaller than for polyphony number 5, {{the reason for this is}} the following: these chords have been always played with both hands and with a minimum of two <b>octaves</b> of <b>separation</b> between the lowest note and the highest note. In most cases, this separation is four or five octaves, so the coincidences between partials with octave or fifth relation are smaller and the octave and fifth test attain better performance.|$|R
50|$|Adieu tout (Farewell all), {{a poem by}} Desbordes-Valmore,23 {{has three}} stanzas of quatrains in an A-B-B-A rhyme scheme with a two-line refrain. Duchambge's setting begins with an {{agitated}} section in F minor with tonic, dominant, and diminished broken chords over a dominant pedal (mm. 1-8). The melody descends stepwise through the minor scale, recalling the sweet memory of love, then leaps up an <b>octave,</b> proclaiming the <b>separation.</b> The three verses are set in F major, with complex harmonies using the submediant, secondary dominants, and diminished chords. The melodic line begins simply with an undulating major third, then ascends a sixth before descending in the D harmonic-minor scale. The melody then rises stepwise to E as verses 2 and 3 speak of going to heaven, then descends to the tonic. The final four measures, leading back to the F-minor opening, have scales in contrary motion and reaffirm the F-major tonic.|$|R
40|$|Background: This {{project was}} about design and {{implementation}} of an audio digital equalizer with digital control using computer as the controller. The equalizer had 2 / 3 <b>octave</b> band <b>separation</b> resulting into 15 bands across the entire audio spectrum frequency and with left and right channel with total of 30 bands. The band separation {{was based on the}} well-known standard defined by IEC 61260 / 1260 year 1995, ISO 266 year 1997 and ISO 3 year 1973. This specification also incorporated the filter ± 3 dB bandwidth for each filter band of the equalizer. The hardware to realize the equalizer was a special purpose digital signal processing system from Texas Instruments. The processor for the equalizer was the OMAP 137 {{in the form of a}} development board. This system had several features which were very essential for digital signal processing such as fast central processing unit to process both integer and floating point numbers, embedded analog to digital converter (ADC), digital to analog converter (DAC) and universal asynchronous receiver/ transmitter (UART) to connect to a computer The main part of this equalizer was the bandpass filters to manage the frequency response of the digital equalizer based on the second order Butterworth with transfer function of H(s) = (s 2 + 1) - 1. The transformation of the filter from the analog s-plane into the digital z-plane used the bilinear Z-transform which had been shown to have stable cut-off characteristics across all frequency with different sampling frequency. The filter coefficients were computed and adjusted using sampling frequency of 48 kHz and 16 - bit-ADC. Computation of the filters was implemented in 32 -bit integer formats to expedite the results and ensure there is no overflow and then truncated back into 16 -bit integer to match the capability of the 16 -bit-DAC. All of the 15 channels of the filters were computed in parallel and checked for the characteristics of the filters as an equalizer as opposed to single bandpass filter. DSP system was also checked for the capability to perform all 15 channels of the equalizer and see if the resulting system works as desired. This design approached was for both channels and then tested together to ensure real-time performance for all filters with the sampling rate of 48 kHz. Visual control of the equalizer was via UART port of the system connected to a computer mimicking similar to the view of a graphic equalizer with few added buttons such as bypass, duplicate left-right channel, and undo. The setting can be downloaded into the DSP system and stored permanently so when the equalizer was turned on, it would be at the condition of the last setting. The output of the DSP system was observed and compared using controlled input and then observed to ensure the performance was similar to the calculated value. The final test was to observe the performance for each bandpass filter at each different audio channel with music using auditory observation. The overall system performance was also evaluated using common music and the audio output evaluated and compared with common equalizer and the result was very similar...|$|R
