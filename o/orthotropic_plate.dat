40|$|The use {{of plates}} in {{industrial}} applications often requires {{the use of}} stiffeners, ribbs, corrugated forming or pressed shapes for increasing rigidity. Isotropic classical plate theory cannot be used directly for vibration and power flow analysis. It can however be described analytically by the thoery of orthotropic plates for a plate rib combination or corrugated plates with an equivalent constant thickness plate using the theory of elastic equivalence. Different elastic rigidities of the actual <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plate,</b> such as a plate-rib combination for example, as obtained from elastc equivalence are reviewed. The determinations of elastic rigidity constants for out of plane and in plane load behaviour are presented in this paper. The solution involved replacing actual <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plate</b> with an equivalent <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plate</b> of constant thickness for whcih appropriate properties are derived. Shape properties of the plates are treated separately since material or rigidity properties depend on the specfic shape of the <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plate.</b> Since it is not always possibe to determine the required elastic properties experimentally, analytical determinations are encouraged...|$|E

40|$|Exact {{solutions}} for static bending of symmetric laminated <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plates</b> with different Lévy-type boundary conditions are developed. The shear deformation plate theories of Mindlin-Reissner and Reddy {{as well as}} the three-dimensional elasticity theory are employed. Using the minimum total potential energy principle, governing equilibrium equations of laminated <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plates</b> and pertaining boundary conditions are derived. Closed-form Lévy-type solutions are obtained for the governing equations of both theories using separation of variables method and different types of classical boundary conditions, namely simply-supported, clamped and free edge, are exactly satisfied. Thereafter, 3 -D elasto-static equations for orthotropic materials are solved for bending analysis of laminated plates using two different approaches. First, the method of separation of variables is utilised and an exact closed-from solution is achieved for simply-supported laminated <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plates.</b> Next, a combined Fourier-Differential Quadrature (DQ) approach is employed to present a semi-numerical solution for bending of laminated <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plates</b> with Lévy-type boundary conditions based on the three-dimensional elasticity theory.

40|$|Most bridge decks are {{orthotropic}}, {{because of}} the orthotropic nature of their component parts (e. g. isotropic slabs, grillages, T-beam bridge decks, multi-beam bridge decks, multi-cell boxbeam bridge, and slabs stiffened with ribs of box section). Thus, the <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plate</b> theory {{plays an important role}} in the static and dynamic analysis of bridges. For example, a multicellular Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composite bridge deck can be modeled as an <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plate</b> with equivalent stiffnesses that account for the size, shape, and constituent materials of the cellular deck. Thus, the complexity of material anisotropy of the panels and orthotropic structure of the deck system can be reduced to an equivalent <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plate</b> with global elastic properties in two orthogonal directions – parallel and transverse to the longitudinal axis of the deck cell. This paper investigates a homogenization of composite, orthotropic, three-span, multi-girder bridge to explore the concept of the volumetric and mass fractions of a reinforced composite material. This homogenization takes into account all properties of this composite structure (deck slab, girders and diaphragms). From those, all the equivalent <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plate</b> properties were obtained. The work is highly relevant with respect to evaluating the dynamic interaction between bridges and vehicles...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, an {{exponential}} shear deformation theory {{is used to}} determine the natural frequencies and critical buckling loads of <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plates.</b> The theory accounts for a parabolic distribution of the transverse shear strains across the thickness, and satisfies the zero traction boundary conditions on the top and bottom surfaces of the plate without using shear correction factors. The in-plane displacement field uses an exponential function in terms of thickness coordinate to include the effect of shear deformation and rotary inertia. Governing equations and boundary conditions are derived from the dynamic version of principle of virtual work. The Navier type solution is employed for solving the governing equations of simply supported square <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plates.</b> The results obtained using present higher order shear deformation theory are found to be agree well with those obtained by other several existing higher order theories for analyzing the buckling and free vibration behaviour of <b>orthotropic</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R
