40|$|Although {{much has}} been written about the {{foundation}} and maturation of the early US public accountancy profession, little is known about the community of American accountants that existed prior to the main foundational events of the 1880 s and 1890 s. Using data extracted from the 1880 US Census, this study provides a contextualised review of American accountants in that year. Contextual factors include the population and manufacturing economy of the US in 1880, and <b>other</b> <b>accounting</b> <b>service</b> providers such as auditors and bookkeepers. The study reveals a very small community of accountants relative to the US population and manufacturing economy, occupational and economic distinctions between accountants, auditors and bookkeepers, little evidence of public accountancy as a significant occupation, the presence of a small female subset of the accountant community, and a significant proportion of accountants associated with lower socio-economic classifications and immigration. The evidence of the study is consistent with contemporary comments recorded by British public accountants and American bookkeepers.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the sourcing strategy for one business function (<b>accounting</b> <b>services),</b> by looking at the degree of outsourcing for each task of this function. Three research questions are addressed: (1) What sourcing strategy do SMEs use for <b>accounting</b> <b>services?</b> (2) What are the reasons? (3) Is there a link between sourcing strategy and company characteristics? The research design consisted of a postal survey sent out to 1200 managers of SMEs in Belgium. The main results showed that 53 % use selective outsourcing, i. e. combining both an inhouse accountant with an <b>accounting</b> <b>service</b> provider. The results also showed that 35 % use total insourcing and 12 % prefer total outsourcing. Surprisingly, cost reduction is not the main reason for outsourcing. External expertise is the main reason for selectively outsourcing. SMEs select a total insourcing strategy because they want the accounting information at hand. Finally, larger SMEs decide for a total insourcing strategy and prefer to keep the <b>accounting</b> <b>services</b> internal. The conclusions show that future research should focus on the degree of outsourcing. The practical implication of this study is that <b>accounting</b> <b>service</b> providers should highlight their expertise and overcome the disadvantage of remote data analysis to attract more SME-customers. status: publishe...|$|R
