5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea,</b> a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. In OHS, sleepiness may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> may be {{diagnosed}} by {{the evaluation of}} symptoms, risk factors and observation, (e.g., excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue) but {{the gold standard for}} diagnosis is a formal sleep study (polysomnography, or sometimes a reduced-channels home-based test). A study can establish reliable indices of the disorder, derived from the number and type of event per hour of <b>sleep</b> (<b>Apnea</b> Hypopnea Index (AHI), or Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI)), associated to a formal threshold, above which a patient is considered as suffering from <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea,</b> and the severity of their <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> can then be quantified. Mild OSA (<b>Obstructive</b> <b>Sleep</b> <b>Apneas)</b> ranges from 5 to 14.9 events per hour, moderate OSA falls in the range of 15-29.9 events per hour, and severe OSA would be a patient having over 30 events per hour.|$|R
5|$|When {{examining}} {{groups of}} people with <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea,</b> {{researchers have found that}} 10–20% of them meet the criteria for OHS as well. The risk of OHS is much higher in those with more severe obesity, i.e. a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2 or higher. It is twice as common in men compared to women. The average age at diagnosis is 52. American Black {{people are more likely to}} be obese than American whites, and are therefore more likely to develop OHS, but obese Asians are more likely than people of other ethnicities to have OHS at a lower BMI as a result of physical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) {{is a condition}} in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough, resulting in low blood oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for short periods of time during sleep (<b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea),</b> resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg swelling and various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E

40|$|IN THEORY, obstructive apneas can be {{terminated}} either by arousal or by increases in chemical drive that excite the upper airway dilating muscles (1).

This view is still so dominant that any increase in airflow seen {{during a period of}} obstruction is considered by some to be a sign of arousal. This view has been challenged by Younes and by others (7, 12). Younes has shown previously instances of the reestablishment of flow during a period of obstruction without any electroencephalographic evidence of arousal (12). Younes et al.

25|$|Diagnosis of <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> is {{significantly}} {{more common among}} people in relationships, who are alerted to their condition by being informed by their sleeping partner since individuals with <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> are often unaware of the condition. There is a stigma associated with loud snoring, {{and it is not}} considered a feminine trait. Consequently, females {{are less likely to be}} told by their partners that they snore, or to admit it to themselves or doctors. Furthermore, CPAP is also perceived negatively by females, and less likely to be utilized to its full extent in this group.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{treatments}} to modify airway anatomy, known as sleep surgery, are varied {{and must be}} tailored to the specific airway obstruction needs of a patient. Surgery is not considered a frontline treatment for <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea,</b> as prospective, randomized, comparative clinical evidence against current front line treatments is lacking. For those <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> sufferers {{unable or unwilling to}} comply with front line treatment, a properly selected surgical intervention will be the result of considering an individual's specific anatomy and physiology, personal preference and disease severity.

40|$|Introduction Laryngomalacia is {{the most}} {{frequent}} congenital anomaly of airways, and it may cause <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apneas.</b> The associated vocal cord paralysis may aggravate the symptoms of upper airway obstruction. Case report In a 14 month old boy severe laryngomalacia and bilateral vocal cord paralysis were diagnosed by flexible bronchoscopy. A sleep study showed a severe <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> apnoea (OSA). The patient was ventilated at home via the face mask with non invasive mechanical ventilation (CPAP) for a year. The level of pressure had to be set at 7 cm H 2 O to correct desaturation with an improvement in mean SpO 2. On the follow up bronchoscopic examination laryngomalatia was improved, vocal cord paralysis persisted and sleep study revealed significant improvement. Discussion In the patient with severe laryngomalatia and bilateral vocal cord paralysis with OSA conservative treatment with CPAP was used instead of a surgical intervention. Non invasive ventilation was used every night, for at least 6 hours, without adverse events. Invasive measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure {{is the best way}} of titrating of CPAP level. This case report suggests the efficacy of noninvasive titrating of CPAP level by the hemoglobin oxygen saturation trend measurement. Conclusion In case of severe laryngomalatia and associated vocal cord paralysis, followed by OSA non invasive ventilation by nasal CPAP represents an effective and safe alternative to surgery...|$|R
40|$|Snoring is {{the most}} {{characteristic}} symptom of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and recurrent wheezing {{is the most}} common clinical manifestation of asthma. The purpose of the present review is to outline the impact of SDB and recurrent wheezing/ asthma on sleep quality and to summarize the epidemiologic and pathophysiologic evidence supporting an association between the two disorders. Enlarged tonsils and adenoid or obesity predispose to <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apneas</b> and hypopneas which are accompanied by arousals, restless sleep, and frequently daytime sleepiness, inattention, hyperactivity, and academic difficulties. Subjects with history of wheezing are also at risk for sleep disturbance and daytime cognitive dysfunction. Asthmatic children have more frequent snoring, apneas, and hypopneas during sleep than non-asthmatic subjects and tonsillar hypertrophy mediates at least in part this epidemiologic association. In addition, preliminary evidence indicates that treatment of <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> with adenotonsillectomy results in improved control of coexisting asthma. Elevated concentrations of leukotrienes and oxidative stress markers have been detected in the exhaled breath condensate of children with asthma and probably contribute to bronchoconstriction. Moreover, sleep apneic children have increased expression of leukotrienes and leukotriene receptors in adenotonsillar tissue. Viral respiratory infections may induce inflammation and oxidative stress in the asthmatic airway enhancing not only bronchospasm, but also biosynthesis of leukotrienes within pharyngeal lymphoid tissues, which promote adenotonsillar enlargement and <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea.</b> In conclusion, taking under consideration the epidemiologic association between obstructive SDB and asthma, when one of the two disorders is diagnosed, the possibility of the other disease being present should be entertained.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{literature}} review is to explore how the neural control of breathing in neonatal rats is affected with the primary focus on DNE-induced changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission. All living organisms need to breathe in order to sustain life. This essential and complex phenomenon is a rhythmic process utilizing the lungs, muscles controlling lower and upper airways, the nerves the innervate these muscles, and the brainstem and cortex neural networks controlling them. Rhythmogenesis of respiration is generated and maintained by respiratory neurons in the medulla and pons of the brainstem. Nicotine is a primary focus of research obtained for this paper as studies suggest that disruptions to this rhythm generation affecting successful respiration are attributed to nicotine in cigarettes. The age group with {{the highest percentage of}} cigarette usage is those of childbearing age. Prenatal smoking allows toxins from cigarettes to damage various tissues in the unborn fetus resulting in an abundance of health problems including <b>obstructive</b> <b>sleep</b> <b>apneas</b> and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This review will concentrate on the effects of DNE on glutamatergic neurotransmission as alteration to excitatory neurotransmission impacting the brainstem regions responsible for controlling the tongue muscles that are essential for natural breathing...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Kleine–Levin Syndrome is a {{differential}} diagnosis {{for patients with}} diurnal excessive sleepiness and a suspicion of narcolepsy.

During crisis intervals, there are no symptoms. This pathology predominantly manifests itself in teenagers, being more frequent among males. The course of this disease is unpredictable, with variable duration and frequency. The most accepted physiopathology is that of a hypothalamic dysfunction, although and recently, there has appeared a hypothesis of a post-infectious autoimmune disorder. These patients show an elevated body mass index, which can predispose to association with comorbidities such as the <b>sleep</b> <b>obstructive</b> <b>apnea</b> syndrome.

We used MiniScreen 8 portable monitoring devices for polygraphy in 68 consecutive adults with Marfan syndrome (33 men, 35 women, 41 ± 14 years old) to investigate frequency of <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> and its relation to cardiovascular morbidity. The apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) was 6 to 15 /hour in 14 subjects (mild <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea,</b> 21 %), and AHI was > 15 /hour in 7 subjects (moderate or severe <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea,</b> 10 %). Among established risk factors for <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea,</b> only older age (Spearman rho = 0. 35, p = 0. 004) and body mass index (rho = 0. 26, p = 0. 03) were associated with increased AHI. Of all cases of apnea, 12 ± 27 were obstructive, 11 ± 25 central, and 3 ± 9 mixed. AHI was associated with decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (rho = − 0. 33, p = 0. 01), increased N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide levels (rho = 0. 35, p = 0. 004), enlarged descending aortic diameters (rho = 0. 44, p = 0. 001), atrial fibrillation (phi = 0. 43, p = 0. 002), and mitral valve surgery (phi = 0. 34, p = 0. 02). Of these, left ventricular ejection fraction, N-terminal pro–brain natriuretic peptide levels, atrial fibrillation, and mitral valve surgery were associated with AHI independently of age and body mass index. We found similar associations with oxygen desaturation index. In conclusion, <b>sleep</b> <b>apnea</b> exhibits increased frequency in Marfan syndrome and is not predicted by classic risk factors. <b>Obstructive</b> and central <b>sleep</b> <b>apneas</b> may relate to cardiovascular disease variables...|$|R
