25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. <b>Ozone</b> <b>cracking</b> {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate <b>ozone</b> <b>cracking.</b> The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|E
25|$|A static {{discharge}} {{in the presence}} of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to <b>ozone</b> <b>cracking.</b> Exposure to ozone creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and O-rings. Fuel lines are also susceptible to the problem unless preventive action is taken. Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. Fires from cracked fuel lines have been a problem on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where ozone can be produced by electrical equipment.|$|E

5000|$|The {{problem can}} be {{prevented}} by adding antiozonants to the rubber before vulcanization. <b>Ozone</b> <b>cracks</b> were commonly seen in automobile tire sidewalls, but are now seen rarely thanks {{to the use of}} these additives. A common and low cost antiozonant is a wax which bleeds to the surface and forms a protective layer, but other specialist chemicals are also widely used.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} form of degradation, however, is a {{decrease}} in polymer chain length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. <b>Ozone</b> <b>cracking</b> is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process very effectively, and {{can be as simple as}} a UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide or carbon black). Plastic shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of ozone, only a few materials may be used like stainless steel (quality 316L), titanium, aluminium (as long as no moisture is present), glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or polyvinylidene fluoride. Viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). Hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water {{come in contact with}} it, except for normal atmospheric levels. Embrittlement or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. <b>Ozone</b> <b>cracking</b> is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like O-rings.|$|E
25|$|Polymer {{oxidation}} {{has caused}} accidents involving medical devices. One {{of the oldest}} known failure modes is <b>ozone</b> <b>cracking</b> caused by chain scission when ozone gas attacks susceptible elastomers, such as natural rubber and nitrile rubber. They possess double bonds in their repeat units which are cleaved during ozonolysis. Cracks in fuel lines can penetrate the bore of the tube and cause fuel leakage. If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Ozone {{resistance}} of highly saturated nitrile rubber (HNBR) has been studied; {{the effect of}} hydrogenation progress of HNBR was evaluated at various ozone test conditions such as static, dynamic, and sequential condi-tions. Dependence of its hydrogenation progress on ozone resistance is discussed by using parameters of Ii, Iodine value which enhanced ozone {{resistance of}} base NBR, Io, Iodine value which demonstrates no cracks for 1000 hours, and &Delta;, the slope of <b>ozone</b> <b>crack</b> initiation time against Iodine value. Ozone resistance of HNBR was {{compared with that of}} typical specialty elastomers. Fully saturated HNBR exhibits excellent ozone resistance...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} blend ratio on {{properties}} of chloroprene rubber/natural rubber (CR/NR) blends was investigated. In {{addition to the}} mechanical properties, attention was also given to the resistance to thermal aging, oil and ozone of the blends. Silica was selected as a reinforcing filler in this study due to its unique characteristic to interact with CR. The results reveal that, due to the better filler dispersion and the greater crosslink density, the silica-filled CR possesses lower compound viscosity and better mechanical properties, compared to the silica-filled NR. The aging properties, oil and ozone resistance of the silica-filled CR are also significantly better {{than those of the}} silica-filled NR. The mechanical properties and the resistance to degradation of the silica-filled CR/NR blends are mainly governed by the blend morphology. It is found that good mechanical properties in association with adequately high resistance to degradation from thermal aging and oil are obtained when CR remains the matrix in the blends. Even though the <b>ozone</b> <b>cracks</b> are found in all blends, a thorough look at the results reveals that considerable improvement in ozone resistance is achieved with increasing CR content...|$|R
50|$|<b>Ozone</b> <b>cracks</b> form in {{products}} under tension, but the critical strain is very small. The cracks are always oriented {{at right angles}} to the strain axis, so will form around the circumference in a rubber tube bent over. Such cracks are very dangerous when they occur in fuel pipes because the cracks will grow from the outside exposed surfaces into the bore of the pipe, so fuel leakage and fire may follow. Seals are also susceptible to attack, such as diaphragm seals in air lines. Such seals are often critical for the operation of pneumatic controls, and if a crack penetrates the seal, all functions of the system can be lost. Nitrile rubber seals are commonly used in pneumatic systems because of its oil resistance. However, if ozone gas is present, cracking will occur in the seals unless preventative measures are taken.Ozone attack will occur at the most sensitive zones in a seal, especially sharp corners where the strain is greatest when the seal is flexing in use. The corners represent stress concentrations, so the tension is at a maximum when the diaphragm of the seal is bent under air pressure.The seal shown at left failed from traces of ozone at circa 1 ppm, and once cracking had started, it continued as long as the gas was present. This particular failure led to loss of production on a semi-conductor fabrication line. The problem was solved by adding effective filters in the air line and by modifying the design to eliminate the very sharp corners. An ozone-resistant elastomer such as Viton was also considered as a replacement for the Nitrile rubber. The pictures were taken using ESEM for maximum resolution.|$|R
25|$|The {{susceptibility}} of a polymer to degradation {{depends on}} its structure. Epoxies and chains containing aromatic functionalities are especially susceptible to UV degradation while polyesters are susceptible to degradation by hydrolysis, while polymers containing an unsaturated backbone are especially susceptible to <b>ozone</b> <b>cracking.</b> Carbon based polymers {{are more susceptible to}} thermal degradation than inorganic polymers such as polydimethylsiloxane and are therefore not ideal for most high-temperature applications. High-temperature matrices such as bismaleimides (BMI), condensation polyimides (with an O-C-N bond), triazines (with a nitrogen (N) containing ring), and blends thereof are susceptible to polymer degradation in the form of galvanic corrosion when bare carbon fiber reinforced polymer CFRP is in contact with an active metal such as aluminium in salt water environments.|$|E

40|$|The {{last few}} years have seen {{increasing}} interest on microchemical systems including micromixers microreactors and microseparators. The smart, integrated microchemical systems are expected to bring into realization a distributed, on site and on demand production network for high value added products {{in the form of}} miniature factories and micro-pharmacies. Such microchemical devices will enable the rapid implementation of new synthesis and process technologies for more efficient production under environmentally responsible and safe conditions. It has been acknowledged that microscale separation is one of the core technologies that needed to be developed for microchemical system. Most separation processes can benefit directly from the large surface area-to-volume ratio that can be obtained in a microseparator. In fact, extraction and membrane separation have been successfully miniaturized. It is expected that membrane will {{play an important role in}} microscale separation. Zeolites and molecular sieves are ideal materials for micromembranes. Zeolites are capable of separating molecules by their size, shape and polarity. Close boiling compounds, isomers and azeotropes were successfully separated using zeolite membranes. The crystalline zeolites also have excellent mechanical strength and thermal stability, and are resistant to most acids, bases and organic solvents. This work describe the successfully fabrication of freestanding zeolite micromembranes on silicon substrate. The procedure involves pre-fabrication of support structure, followed by selective seeding and growth of oriented zeolite films. Low temperature template removal using <b>ozone</b> avoids the <b>crack</b> and defect formations associated with high temperature treatment methods. The zeolite micromembranes were tested for single gas permeation using permanent gases and hydrocarbon vapors. Excellent permselectivity with evidence of molecular sieving was observed from the experiments. The thickness and composition (i. e., Si/Al ratio) of ZSM- 5 affects both the permeation and permselective of the membrane for the various gases. Binary (i. e., C 3 /N 2, C 4 /N 2), ternary (H 2 /CH 4 /CO 2) and quaternary (H 2 /CH 4 /CO 2 /CO) separation experiments were also conducted to demonstrate that the zeolite micromembranes are efficient separator...|$|R

It is also a serious problem, known as [...] "ozone cracking" [...] where traces of the gas in an atmosphere will cut double bonds in susceptible elastomers, including natural rubber, polybutadiene, Styrene-butadiene and Nitrile rubber. <b>Ozone</b> <b>cracking</b> creates small cracks {{at right angles to}} the load in the surfaces exposed to the gas, the cracks growing steadily as attack continues. The rubber product must be under tension for crack growth to occur.Ozone cracking is a form of stress corrosion cracking where active chemical species attack products of a susceptible material. <b>Ozone</b> <b>cracking</b> was once commonly seen in the sidewalls of tires but is now rare owing to the use of antiozonants.

The most common form is styrene-butadiene copolymer, which is a commodity material for car tires. It is also used in block copolymers and tough thermoplastics such as ABS plastic.

Ionizing radiation can disrupt crystal lattices in metals, causing them to become amorphous, with consequent swelling, material creep, and embrittlement.
