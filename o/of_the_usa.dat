5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover, {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>USA</b> and in Canada {{since the turn of the}} century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|E
