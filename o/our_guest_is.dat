5000|$|Several {{critics have}} awarded {{specific}} praise to [...] "Be Our Guest"s choreography, comparing it extensively {{to the work}} of director and choreographer Busby Berkeley. In addition to hailing [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] as [...] "delightful," [...] Candice Russel of the Sun-Sentinel wrote, [...] "In setting the table for Belle, Lumiere and friends concoct a Busby Berkeley song-and-dance extravaganza." [...] The Deseret News Chris Hicks described [...] "the Busby Berkeley-style Be Our Guest" [...] as [...] "first-rate." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly highlighted the scene, writing, [...] "The set pieces are narcotically pleasing, especially the Busby Berkeley-style dancing-kitchenware spectacular, Be Our Guest." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews coined [...] "Be Our Guest ... the animated equivalent of Broadway show-stoppers, with all the energy and audacity of something choreographed by Busby Berkeley." [...] Calling it a [...] "wonderful musical number," [...] Roger Ebert enthused, [...] "Be <b>Our</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>is</b> a rollicking invitation to Belle from the castle staff, choreographed like Busby Berkeley running amok." [...] In review of the 2011 3D re-release of Beauty and the Beast, Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger commented, [...] "The illusion of depth does add more life to the enchanted housewares — particularly the Be Our Guest number, with its Busby Berkeley geometrics." ...|$|E
5000|$|While Beauty and the Beasts several {{theatrical}} re-releases and reissues {{have been}} met with generally mixed reviews, critical response towards the [...] "Be Out Guest" [...] musical sequence has remained predominantly positive. Reviewing the 2001 IMAX re-release of the film, the Los Angeles Times Charles Solomon felt that {{the inclusion of the}} deleted song [...] "Human Again" [...] was unnecessary, preferring [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] and writing, [...] "a second major production number simply isnt needed; Be <b>Our</b> <b>Guest</b> <b>is</b> sufficient." [...] Similarly, the Seattle Post-Intelligencers William Arnold wrote, [...] "On the other hand, its understandable why Again" [...] was cut from the original. Its almost too similar to the films show-stopper, Be Our Guest." [...] Reviewing the films 2012 3D conversion, Todd Gilchrist of Boxoffice wrote that [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] is [...] "effective, immersive and maybe even memorable." [...] Meanwhile, Annlee Ellingson of Paste wrote, [...] "Its thrilling to experience this films major set pieces on the big screen again, especially the Broadway-infused Be Our Guest number." [...] The Times-Picayunes Mike Scott wrote, [...] "But then the 3-D all but disappears until the Be Our Guest number -- with its artfully surreal dance of the dishes." [...] Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, who otherwise criticized the films songs, praised [...] "Be Our Guest", writing, [...] "Apart from the spectacular Busby Berkeleyesque Be Our Guest, the film pretty much grinds to a halt whenever one of the songs ... starts up." [...] Likewise, Neil Smith of Total Film concluded that [...] "only ‘Be Our Guest’ and the ballroom swoop really benefit from a stereoscopic make-over that doesn’t do the hand-drawn remainder many favours." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 1912 {{essay in}} Le Monde Artiste Lefevre criticized the {{excessive}} cosmopolitanism of Paris, {{calling for more}} emphasis on French culture.

5000|$|Although vastly {{critically}} acclaimed, {{the song}} did receive some minor criticism. Lukewarmly, Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic commented, [...] "numbers like Be Our Guest provides evidence that Lumiere and co. are infinitely preferable as entertaining flatware." [...] On Lansburys performance, Tan joked, [...] "The singers delightfully personable contribution is almost {{reason enough to}} forgive Disney for thinking her English accent ... would not look {{out of place in}} a film set in 18th century France." [...] A more negative review was written by Pete Vonder Haar of The Houston Press. Observing that Beauty and the Beast [...] "was Disneys first stab at incorporating computer animation," [...] he felt that [...] "the results are, now, pretty primitive," [...] concluding, [...] "I recall thinking the dancing forks during Be Our Guest ... looked pretty bad and time has not been kind." [...] The song has also been compared to [...] "Under the Sea" [...] from The Little Mermaid, most of which have been mixed. Jay Boyar the Orlando Sentinel opined, [...] "Be <b>Our</b> <b>Guest</b> ... <b>is</b> the closest thing in Beauty and the Beast to the bubbly Under the Sea extravaganza in The Little Mermaid," [...] while Entertainment Weeklys Owen Gleibermans review was much more negative, describing the song as [...] "merely serviceable" [...] and concluding, Be Our Guest, ... sorry to say, is no Under the Sea." [...] Likewise, Desson Howe of The Washington Post panned both the song and Lumiere, writing, [...] "the Candelabrums Maurice Chevalier accent is clearly intended to substitute for the Caribbean-lilted lobster in Mermaid. And the ensemble song, Be Our Guest, in which the household gadgets enjoin Belle to live with them, is an obvious attempt to reprise a similar Mermaid number, Under the Sea. But its just under par." ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{evening the}} old man, as usual {{before going to}} sea, came into the hut which Archie and Sir James Douglas inhabited, {{and told him that}} he was going out early the next morning.

You have men enough to serve you without enlisting banditti, and your own honour is above taint.

No cause should induce me to tolerate such a character.' ...|$|R
60|$|Dinner <b>was</b> late; but <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> later. We waited {{as long as}} {{the state}} of the {{provisions}} and our appetites would permit, and then we sat down to the table and began to eat slowly. But they did not come. We finished our meal, and they were still absent. We now became quite anxious, and I proposed to Euphemia that we should go and look for them.|$|R
500|$|Additionally {{described}} as [...] "a spark of Gallic vaudeville that lights a flame to both [...] Maurice Chevalier and Yves Montand," [...] "Be Our Guest" [...] depicts both [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "humour." [...] Extending a warm, energetic invitation towards Belle, the first verse {{of the song}} is preceded by a spoken introduction. It reads, at first in French, [...] "Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight. And now {{we invite you to}} relax, let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly presents: your dinner," [...] immediately succeeded by the sung lyrics [...] "Be <b>our</b> <b>guest,</b> <b>be</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest,</b> put <b>our</b> service to the test," [...] continuing with [...] "Go on, unfold your menu / take a glance and then you'll / <b>be</b> <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> / oui, <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> / <b>be</b> <b>our</b> guest." [...] A nostalgic Lumiere muses about being human, pining for the [...] "good old days when we were useful." [...] Furthermore, Lumiere voices his need to serve, singing, [...] "Life is so unnerving/For a servant who's not serving." ...|$|R

60|$|Mrs Monnerie, I remember, was in {{an unusually}} vivacious humour at that meal; and devoured immense {{quantities}} of salmon mayonnaise. One might have supposed that Fanny's influence had added a slim crescent of silvery light to her habitual earthshine. None the less, when <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> <b>was</b> gone, she seemed to subside into a shallow dejection; and I into a much deeper.

6000|$|But we did {{not spend}} all our spare time in talking. An hour or two, every evening was {{occupied}} in what we called [...] "fixing the house," [...] and gradually the inside of our abode began {{to look like a}} conventional dwelling. We put matting on the floors and cheap but very pretty paper on the walls. We added now a couple of chairs, and now a table or something for the kitchen. Frequently, especially of a Sunday, we had company, and <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> always charmed with Euphemia's cunning little meals. The dear girl loved good eating so much that she could scarcely fail to be a good cook.|$|R
6000|$|By a happy coincidence, just as Good King Wenceslas {{had looked}} out on the Feast of Stephen, so Mr Crimble, the curate-in-charge at St Peter's, had looked in. By his [...] "Ah, Phelps!" [...] it <b>was</b> evident that <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> well acquainted with one another; and Fanny and I were soon enjoying a tea enriched by the cream of local society. Mr Crimble had mild dark eyes, gold spectacles, rather full red lips, and a voice that {{reminded}} me of raspberries. I think he had heard of me, for he was very attentive, and handled my small cup and saucer with remarkable, if rather conspicuous, ingenuity.|$|R
6000|$|... "But wait," [...] urged Rozales. [...] "Let the {{stranger}} ride in command, with a half-dozen picked men who {{will see that}} nothing goes wrong. An hour before dawn I will send two men--they will be our best shots--on ahead. They will stop at a place we both know, and about noon the Captain Byrne and his escort will ride back to camp and tell us that they were attacked by a troop of Villa's men, and that both <b>our</b> <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> killed. It will be sad; {{but it will not}} be our fault. We will swear vengeance upon Villa, and the Captain Byrne will hate him as a good Pesitista should." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could have}} no anticipation, and I had none, that {{something}} very startling {{to me at}} the moment, and ever memorable to me in what ensued from it, was to happen before this day <b>was</b> out. <b>Our</b> <b>guest</b> <b>was</b> in such spirits on the way home that I could do nothing but listen to him and wonder at him; nor was I alone in this, for Ada yielded to the same fascination.

60|$|I {{was then}} {{nine or ten}} years old, and <b>our</b> <b>guest</b> <b>was</b> a young Spanish gentleman, {{singularly}} handsome, with a most engaging expression and manner.
