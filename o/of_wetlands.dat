To ensure that these habitats are conserved, an efficient means <b>of</b> identifying <b>wetlands</b> at risk <b>of</b> conversion is needed, {{especially in the}} southern United States where the rate <b>of</b> <b>wetland</b> loss has been highest in recent decades. We used multivariate adaptive regression splines to develop a model to predict the risk <b>of</b> <b>wetland</b> habitat loss as a function <b>of</b> <b>wetland</b> features and landscape context.

5|$|The heavy toll on {{breeding}} birds, {{together with}} loss of habitat through drainage and collection by nineteenth-century trophy hunters and egg collectors, {{meant that the}} species became almost extinct in England by the 1880s, although recolonisation in small numbers has occurred since 1963. The draining <b>of</b> <b>wetlands</b> from the 1800s onwards in southern Sweden {{has resulted in the}} ruff's disappearance from many areas there, although it remains common in the north of the country. The use of insecticides and draining <b>of</b> <b>wetlands</b> has led to a {{decrease in the number of}} ruff in Denmark since the early 1900s. There are still areas where the ruff and other wetland birds are hunted legally or otherwise for food. A large-scale example is the capture of more than one million waterbirds (including ruffs) in a single year from Lake Chilwa in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} {{is listed as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

40|$|A novel wetland {{detection}} {{approach for}} multi-sources remote sensing images was proposed, which {{based on the}} probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). Firstly, spectral, texture, and subclass <b>of</b> <b>wetland</b> were extracted from high-resolution remote sensing image, and land surface temperature and soil moisture <b>of</b> <b>wetland</b> were derived from corresponding multispectral remote sensing image. The feature space <b>of</b> <b>wetland</b> scene was hence formed. Then, wetland scene was represented as a combination of several latent semantics using pLSA, and the feature space <b>of</b> the <b>wetland</b> scene was further described by weight vector of latent semantics. Finally, supporting vector machine (SVM) classifier was applied to detect the wetland scene. Experiments indicated that the adoption of pLSA is able to map the high-dimensional feature space <b>of</b> <b>wetland</b> to low-dimensional latent semantic space. Besides, the addition of subclass and quantitative environment features is able to characterize wetland feature space more effectively and improve the detection accuracy significantly...|$|R

Non-indigenous crayfish may pose a greater threat to P.fluviatile than native crayfish, although the greatest threats remain pollution, overfishing and the draining <b>of</b> <b>wetlands.</b>|$|E

A primary threat category is habitat loss in various forms. Related to water habitat, there is drying <b>of</b> <b>wetlands,</b> clearing of aquatic logs or rocks (basking sites), and clearing of shoreline vegetation, which allows more predator access or increased human foot traffic. Related to nesting habitat, urbanization or planting can remove needed sunny soils.|$|E
5|$|The American white ibis {{is found}} {{in a variety of}} habitats, {{although}} shallow coastal marshes, wetlands and mangrove swamps are preferred. It is also commonly found in muddy pools, on mudflats and even wet lawns. Populations that are away from the coast and shoreline, particularly in southern Florida, often reside in other forms <b>of</b> <b>wetlands</b> such as marshes, ponds and flooded fields. In summer, these move to more coastal and estuarine habitats as inland waterways become flooded with summer rains and the ibis find the water levels too deep to forage effectively.|$|E

5|$|The chief threats {{faced by}} the brolga, {{particularly}} {{in the southern part}} of its range, are habitat destruction, the drainage <b>of</b> <b>wetlands,</b> collision with powerlines, and predation by the introduced red fox. It is more secure in its northern habitat as the land is mostly unsuitable for farming and much of it is in national parks or private ownership, but changes in vegetation cover, encouraged by the rooting activities of feral pigs, may reduce the abundance of bulkuru sedge and may make the brolga more vulnerable by providing cover for predators.|$|E
