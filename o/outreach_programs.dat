5|$|Heathen {{influences}} were {{apparent in}} forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed {{a longing for}} a pre-Christian Northern past; the mass media typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre—which emerged from the fragmentation of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came {{to play an important}} role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world. That decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of <b>outreach</b> <b>programs</b> established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{university}} robotics-based education <b>outreach</b> <b>program</b> aimed at building teachers’ confidence and capacity, and encouraging students’ interest, in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the perceived value of the <b>outreach</b> <b>program</b> and the professional development (PD) workshops for the teachers participating in the program. The program was underpinned by constructionist theory of teacher PD; constructing knowledge through hands-on activities. The PD workshops focused not only on how teachers could learn to build and program robots but also how they could develop and implement engaging robotics-based STEM activities in their classrooms. Questionnaires were completed after each workshop and teachers also provided written comments regarding the <b>outreach</b> <b>program.</b> The data collected showed that the hands-on workshops helped the teachers build knowledge and confidence to implement engaging robotics-based STEM activities. The teachers reported the key benefits of partnering with the university <b>outreach</b> <b>program</b> were: the development of their robot building and programming skills; the sharing of ideas for STEM activities to engage their students; and the on-going support provided by the <b>outreach</b> <b>program...</b>|$|R
