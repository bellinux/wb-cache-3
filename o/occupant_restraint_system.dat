5000|$|An {{example of}} a {{component}} that passes all the tests is a car's <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system.</b> While we do not normally think of the primary <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system,</b> it is gravity.

Restraining the occupants during such an accident is absolutely critical to safety, so we pass the first test. Accidents causing occupant ejection were quite common before seat belts, so we pass the second test. The cost of a redundant restraint method like seat belts is quite low, both economically {{and in terms of}} weight and space, so we pass the third test. Therefore, adding seat belts to all vehicles is an excellent idea. Other [...] "supplemental restraint systems", such as airbags, are more expensive and so pass that test by a smaller margin.|$|E

40|$|Children {{with disabilities}} often cannot be seated in {{standard}} child seats or automobile seats because of physical deformities or poor trunk and head control. Therefore, when {{children with disabilities}} are transported to schools and developmental facilities, they often remain seated in their wheelchairs in vehicles such as school buses and family vans. Children who must travel seated in their wheelchairs are excluded from the protections dictated by {{the federal and state}} laws related to child protection in motor vehicle crashes. This dissertation investigated the safety of children in wheelchairs in transit, mainly using computer simulation software. Three pediatric manual wheelchairs were tested with a Hybrid III 6 -year-old ATD in accordance with the ANSI/RESNA WC- 19 standard. Using sled test data, a computer model representing a Zippie wheelchair seated with a Hybrid III 6 -year-old ATD subjected to a 20 g/ 48 kph frontal crash was developed and validated in MADYMO. The injury risks of 6 -year-old wheelchair occupants in a frontal impact motor vehicle crash was investigated by analyzing sled test data and by using the pediatric wheelchair computer model. The loads imposed on the wheelchair and <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> under 20 g/ 48 kph frontal impact conditions with varying wheelchair setup conditions was also investigated using the computer model. The study results showed that a 6 -year-old wheelchair seated occupant may be subjected to a risk of neck and chest injuries in a frontal impact motor vehicle crash.

To ensure a high safety rating, e. g. five or at least four stars in the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro-NCAP) rating system, which has been widely used to rate the different vehicles from different manufacturers, design optimization becomes essential. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of conventional mathematical programming methods directly integrated with numerical simulation and sensitivity analysis for optimization is of limited practical value, due to high complexity of structures, nonlinearity of materials and deformation involved.

40|$|Though a {{significant}} {{body of literature}} exists on the safety performance and effectiveness of various types of front seat <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems,</b> there is a paucity of data {{on the performance of}} rear seat <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems.</b> A research program was initiated to better understand rear seat restraint performance. Research included examining real world data using National Automotive Sampling System/Crashworthiness Data System (NASS/CDS) and Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) as well as conducting full frontal vehicle crashes into rigid barriers with dummies restrained in rear seats. Child dummies (Hybrid III 6 year-old) and adult dummies (Hybrid III 5 th percentile female and 50 th percentile male) were used for this purpose. The dummies were placed in rear outboard seats with lap/shoulder belts {{as well as in the}} center seating position where the lap/shoulder belts were integrated to the seat. A double-paired comparison study using FARS data files suggested that while occupants younger than 50 years of age benefit from sitting in rear seats in frontal crashes, restrained adult occupants older than 50 years are significantly better off in the front seats than the rear seats. The most injured body region for restrained children in rear seats is the head while that for restrained adults is the thorax. The major injury source for restrained occupants, not in child safety seats, is the seat belts while that for unrestrained occupants is the front seat back. The injury measures of restrained adult dummies in rear seats in frontal crash tests were generally higher than those of dummies of the same size in the driver and front passenger seat. The seat backs of integrated rear seats experienced excessive forward rotation in frontal crash tests, thereby causing the dummy’s head to hit the console or front seatback, resulting in high head and neck injury measures. The field and vehicle crash test data indicate that rear seat restraints could be further optimized to mitigate injury in frontal crashes for older rear seat occupants...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Belt and airbag are {{the most}} {{important}} protection devices in vehicle frontal crash, which can have the best protective performance when only they were well matched with vehicle body structure. In this paper the theoretical guidance for optimizing belt and airbag parameters is researched, in order to improve the effect and efficiency of parameters optimization of restraint system. Firstly, a simulation model for <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> is developed based on the finite element theory combined with multi rigid body theory, and its effectiveness for simulating the occupant dynamic response in frontal impact is validated.

Lastly, the adaptive level of restraint system parameters are evaluated according to the dissipation characteristics of occupant energy, and theoretical guidance for parameters optimization are summarized based on the evaluation. The analysis results indicate that: (1) airbag with low stiffness cannot fully utilize the deformation of vehicle body to dissipate the energy of occupant head, but may increase the risk of head injury; (2) belt with high stiffness would apply a big force to occupant, which could increase the compression amount of chest and may increase the risk of chest injury...|$|E
40|$|Occupant Restraint Systems (ORS) {{have been}} widely used in Public Service Vehicles (PSVs). A Wheelchair Tiedown and <b>Occupant</b> <b>Restraint</b> <b>System</b> (WTORS) has been {{developed}} to provide effective occupant protection for disabled people who are seated in wheelchairs. An international laboratory study had been conducted to produce a compliance test protocol that included specification of the sled deceleration versus time history and the crash pulse corridor. Currently effort at the international level is being focused through the International Standards Organisation (ISO) to produce standards for WTORS and transportable wheelchairs. Dynamic sled testing of WTORS was conducted in Middlesex University Road Safety Engineering Laboratory (MURSEL) to develop a test protocol in a WTORS System. This research has been concerned with the effects to which the occupant of a wheelchair secured by a WTORS is subjected in a frontal impact. Both occupant Forward Facing Frontal (FFF) and Rearward Facing Frontal (RFF) impact configurations have been considered. A Surrogate wheelchair with a tiedown restraint System, a Surrogate <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>System,</b> and an Anthropomorphic Test Dummy (ATD) were used to facilitate highly controlled tests. Production wheelchairs were also crash tested to validate the response of the Surrogate System. A 48 km/h- 20 g crash pulse falling within the ISO standard crash pulse corridor was specified. The Crash Victim Simulation (CVS), one of the computer modelling methods, and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models were designed to study the dynamic response of a restrained wheelchair and its occupant in a crash environment. Two CVS computer packages: MADYMO®, DYNAMAN® and one of FEA programs: PAFEC were used in WTORS models to predict the occupant response during impacts and hence provide data to optimise future system design. A modelling protocol for WTORS was developed {{based on the results of}} ninety (90) sled tests of WTORS Surrogate system and forty (40) dynamic tests of production wheelchairs. To illustrate the potential of these models the results of simulations were validated by sled tests. A random effects Statistical method was used to quantify the results. The load-time histories were also traced to qualify the test and model results. A literature review highlighted twenty years of wheelchair crash research. The correlation between computer model and experimental results was made more accurately. The modelling technique of interconnection of FEA models into CVS program was also introduced. The velocity profile and the natural frequency of WTORS analysis were used to explain why the wheelchair and dummy experienced acceleration amplifications relative to the sled. The shoulder belt load at floor-mounted configuration was found to be higher than that at B pillar configuration. Energy principles were also applied to show why more compliant wheelchair tiedown Systems subjected restraints to a less severe crash environment. A decomposition of forces using the computer model showed why quasi-static analysis is insufficient in WTORS design. It is concluded that the B pillar anchorage of the occupant diagonal strap is superior to the floor-mounted configuration...|$|E
40|$|The {{usage of}} the {{seatbelt}} {{as a part of}} the vehicle protection system has immensely promoted occupant safety. However, recent accident investigation shows that it is necessary to increase the chest injury protective e_ciency in frontal impact condition. This study aims to investigate the influence of seatbelt system design variables on occupant chest injury related physical parameters at varying impact conditions, especially concerning with the chest deflection and distribution of rib stress/strain. The study is conducted by using human body FE model in combination with post mortem human subjects tests. An FE model of the belted occupant is therefore established by using a baseline human body FE model (GHBMC), which is validated according to detailed experimental data regarding kinematics, seatbelt force and chest deflection. A parameter study is implemented in terms of seatbelt position, seatbelt angle and impact speed to determine the influence of seatbelt utilization on occupant thoracic injury in frontal impact. The results show that the influence of seatbelt position on chest deflection and distribution of rib stress/strain is greater than that of the seatbelt angle. Meanwhile, the trends of chest deflections are the same with the trends of the rib stress/strain responses while the changes of seatbelt design variables.

In this paper, we develop the three dimensional model named tsunami pod as a triangulated ellipsoid which can be folded fatly, conduct the numerical simulation by FEM software, and confirm the safety by the von Mises Equivalent value and Head Injury Criterion (HIC). As the result of the first simulation, it is proven that the initial model is weak to the impact force from rigid wall and obstacles and can be strained in the central part. On the other hand, an occupant hits against the internal wall and can be injured. So, the seat and upper and lower bars are added to the initial model. The von Mises equivalent value for the modified model is decreased, however is still over the one of the first simulation. While, HIC value is decreased largely which is much less than the HIC safety level. This is because an occupant does not hit on the internal wall for the <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system.</b> Moreover, we optimize the form and property for the tsunami pod by minimizing its weight.

A substantial number of these wheelchair users {{may not be able}} to transfer from their wheelchair to a motor vehicle seat during transit. It is necessary to afford these wheelchair users the same level of safety as occupants seated in motor vehicle seats. Therefore, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that LATVs be equipped with wheelchair securement and occupant restraint systems (WTORS). The four-point tiedowns and occupant restraints are the primary means of WTORS on LATVs. Recent research has shown extremely high disuse and misuse rates for this wheelchair and tiedown <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> (WTORS). However, to-date, no studies have investigated the underlying causes of WTORS disuse and misuse. Perhaps more importantly, the consequences of WTORS misuse and disuse for wheelchair passengers aboard LATVs have not been determined. This study had three major phases aimed at describing consequences of WTORS misuse and disuse for wheelchair passengers on LATVs: I) A case series of adverse events involving wheelchair seated passengers on LATVs, II) Driving experiments using a wheelchair seated anthropomorphic testing device onboard a LATV, III) Development, validation and verification of a computer simulation of a wheelchair passenger onboard a LATV. This study revealed that the vast majority of wheelchair related instabilities are associated with minor wheelchair excursions. We also found when WTORS are properly used, the wheelchair passenger does not appear to be at increased risk of injury, while WTORS disuse and misuse are associated with a high frequency of wheelchair passenger ejection from the wheelchair, especially during an emergency braking maneuver. We found that a manual wheelchair brake can play a major role in limiting wheelchair excursions when WTORS are not properly used and that lateral wheelchair excursions can be limited by the folded-seat side barrier under the window...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this deliverable is to describe the expected influence of the candidate test procedures developed in FIMCAR for frontal impact on other impact types. The other impact types of primary interest are front-to-side impacts, collisions with road restraint systems (e. g. guardrails), and heavy goods vehicle impacts. These collision types were chosen as they involve structures that {{can be adapted to}} improve safety. Collisions with vulnerable road users (VRU) were not explicitly investigated in FIMCAR. It is expected that the vehicle structures of interest in FIMCAR can be designed into a VRU friendly shell. Information used for this deliverable comes from simulations and car-to-car crash tests conducted in FIMCAR or review of previous research. Three test configurations (full width, offset, and moving deformable barriers) were the input to the FIMCAR selection process. There are three different types of offset tests and two different full width tests. During the project test procedures could be divided into three groups that provide different influences or outcomes on vehicle designs: 1. The ODB barrier provides a method to assess part of the vehicles energy absorption capabilities and compartment test in one test 2. The FWRB and FWDB have similar capabilities to control structural alignment, further assess energy absorption capabilities, and promote the improvements in the <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> for high deceleration impacts. 3. The PDB and MPDB can be used to promote better load spreading in the vehicle structures, in addition to assessing energy absorption and occupant compartment strength in an offset configuration. The consortium selected the ODB and FWDB as the two best candidates for short term application in international rulemaking. The review of how all candidates would affect vehicle performance in other impacts (beside front-to-front vehicle or frontal impacts with fixed obstacles) however is reported in this deliverable to support the benefit analysis reported in FIMCAR. The grouping presented above is used to discuss all five test candidates using similarities between certain tests and thereby simplify the discussion...|$|E
40|$|Proper {{securement}} of wheelchairs {{in motor}} vehicles {{is vital to}} providing wheelchair users an adequate level of safety in a crash. Thus far, wheelchair tiedown and <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> (WTORS) loading has mostly been examined under frontal impact conditions. Because of the inherent crash dynamic differences, rear-impact loading of WTORS is expected to differ greatly. In this study, three identical, reinforced, manual, folding, X-braced ANSI/RESNA WC 19 wheelchairs were subjected to an International Organization for Standardization-proposed rear-impact crash pulse. WTORS loads (front tiedowns, rear tiedowns, lap belt, and shoulder belt) were measured and compared with frontal impact WTORS loading. Rear impact produced substantially higher loads (up to 7, 851 N) in the front tiedowns than frontal impact. The rear tiedowns experienced relatively negligible loading (up to 257 N) in rear impact, while rear-impact dynamics caused the lap belt (maximum load of 1, 865 N) to be loaded substantially more than the shoulder belt (maximum load of 68 N). Considering differences in frontal and rear impact WTORS loading is important to proper WTORS design and, thus, protection of wheelchair-seated occupants subjected to rear-impact events...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the BOSCOS project was to initiate development {{of a system that}} can make an assessment of the bone characteristics of each vehicle occupant in order to estimate their skeletal strengths. By modifying the seatbelt and airbag performance characteristics to account for instance a weak chested <b>occupant,</b> the <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> can deliver optimum levels of protection specifically for each occupant. Recent analysis has shown that older people areat a greater risk of higher injury levels and are not fully considered in <b>restraint</b> <b>systems.</b> A system introduced into every UK vehicle has the capability of saving lives and reducing injury levels across the whole spectre of vehicle occupants...|$|R
40|$|Large {{accessible}} transit vehicles (LATVs, fixed-route intracity buses), {{generally considered}} safe, {{may not be}} as safe for wheelchair-seated passengers. Transit provider practices vary regarding use of wheelchair tiedown and <b>occupant</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> (WTORSs), while recent research suggests high levels of WTORS disuse and misuse. We sought to better understand wheelchair and wheelchair passenger instabilities related to WTORS disuse and misuse on LATVs. This article presents a retrospective review of 295 video surveillance records of wheelchair passenger trips on LATVs. Wheelchair trips involving disuse and misuse of WTORS were quantified and categorized based on WTORS configurations. Cases of wheelchair and wheelchair passenger instability were categorized based on severity, type, and direction. Three adverse events involving severe wheelchair and/or passenger instability were examined in greater detail. Results showed 20. 3 % of records involved wheelchair-related adverse events (95 % minor instabilities, 5 % severe instabilities). Scooters were most likely to be unstable, followed by manual and power wheelchairs. In most instability cases, no tiedowns were used to secure the wheelchair and no lap belt was used to restrain the wheelchair passenger properly. In many instances, the lap belt was misused in an attempt to secure the wheelchair, whereas the shoulder belt was never used...|$|R
