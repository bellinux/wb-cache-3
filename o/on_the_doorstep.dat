5|$|Thorpe {{was adopted}} as North Devon's Liberal {{candidate}} in April 1952. His political stance matched {{that of other}} young activists, who believed that the party should offer a radical non-socialist alternative to the Conservative government. He and others founded the Radical Reform Group, to drive the party in that direction. He {{spent much of his}} spare time cultivating the voters in North Devon; at rallies and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger, international issues such as colonialism and apartheid. When Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Winston Churchill as prime minister, called a snap general election in April 1955, Thorpe fought an energetic local campaign. He succeeded in halving the Conservative majority in the constituency, and restoring the Liberals to second place.|$|E
5|$|During the pouring rain, a {{young boy}} helps {{his mother and father}} leave a heavily chained toy box at the {{doorstep}} of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends with instructions to not be opened. The next day, Frankie has grown outraged about her job as the house caretaker; Mr. Herriman has been giving her endless chores to take care day after day without thanking her for any of it. When Frankie discovers the box left <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorstep,</b> Herriman instructs her to leave it in the attic. In a fit of anger toward Herriman, she intentionally ignores the instructions given in the box and peeks inside it. She falls inside, only to discover it is a vast world filled with anthropomorphic toys and delectable treats. She hears and sympathizes with {{a young boy}}'s voice (Max Burkholder), later revealed to be the imaginary friend named World (given the name by the crew of the show), who has been living alone in the toy chest since his family left the box at Foster's.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing flesh. With the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E

5|$|The Restoration is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Hugh Logan, a single father who leaves his little girl, May, at home when he goes on a business trip. On {{the way to the}} city he is attacked by robbers and left in the road. He is found and taken in, but he suffers from amnesia. He falls in love with Maud Neals and proposes to her. Due to the prolonged absence of her father, May is taken to an orphan asylum, but she escapes. May goes to the city and ends up stopping to sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> of the Neals' home. Maud finds her and takes her in, where Logan recognizes his daughter and his memory comes back. Little is known of the production credits, but the film does feature Marie Eline as the little girl. It was released on August 5, 1910 and was met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Yorkshire {{police officer}} Ronald Craven (Bob Peck) is {{returning}} {{home with his}} daughter Emma (Joanne Whalley) having picked her up from a meeting of an environmental organisation at her university campus. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorstep</b> of their home Emma is shot dead. The police concentrate their effort {{on the theory that}} her murder was a botched attempt on Craven's life by a criminal he had been responsible for convicting. However, as Craven goes through Emma's belongings, he discovers a geiger counter and a gun. He also learns that Emma's body and her possessions are radioactive. Travelling to London to assist with the inquiry, he is contacted by Pendleton (Charles Kay), a polished official “attached to the Prime Minister's office”, who informs him that Emma was known to them as a terrorist and that it may have been her, not Craven, who was the gunman's target.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to its title, Devils <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doorstep</b> {{is not at}} {{its core}} an anti-Japanese war film. In Jiang's own words, the film shows how Chinese {{literature}} and film has perpetuated an attitude of blaming the aggressor and casting the Chinese population as passive victims of aggression.
