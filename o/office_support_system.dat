40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} use of a brief provider-delivered alcohol {{counseling}} intervention of 5 to 10 minutes with high-risk drinking patients by primary care provider* trained in the counseling intervention and provided with an <b>office</b> <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> DESIGN: A group randomized study design was used. Office sites were randomized to either a usual care or special intervention condition, within which physicians and patients were nested. The unit of analysis was the patient. SETTING: Primary care internal medicine practices affiliated with an academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-nine providers were randomized by practice site to receive training and an <b>office</b> <b>support</b> <b>system</b> to provide an alcohol counseling special intervention or to continue to provide usual care. INTERVENTION: Special intervention providers received 2 1 / 2 hours of training in a brief alcohol-counseling intervention and were then supported by an office system that screened patients, cued providers to intervene, and made patient education materials available as tip sheets. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Implementation of the counseling steps was measured by patient exit interviews (PEI) immediately following the patient visit. The interval between the date of training and the date of the PEI ranged from 6 to 32 months. Special intervention providers were twice as likely as usual care providers to discuss alcohol use with their patients. They carried out every step of the counseling sequence significantly more often than did usual care providers (p 3 ̆c. 001). This intervention effect persisted over the 32 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians and other health-care providers trained in a brief provider-delivered alcohol intervention will counsel their high-risk drinking patients when cued to do so and supported by a primary care office system...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{need for}} primary care {{providers}} to have brief effective methods to intervene with high-risk drinkers during a regular outpatient visit. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether brief physician- and nurse practitioner-delivered counseling intervention is efficacious as part of routine primary care in reducing alcohol consumption by high-risk drinkers. METHODS: Academic medical center-affiliated primary care practice sites were randomized to special intervention or to usual care. From a screened population of 9772 patients seeking routine medical care with their primary care providers, 530 high-risk drinkers were entered into the study. Special intervention included training providers in a brief (5 - to 10 -minute) patient-centered counseling intervention, and an <b>office</b> <b>support</b> <b>system</b> that screened patients, cued providers to intervene, and made patient education materials available. The primary outcome measures were change in alcohol use from baseline to 6 months as measured by weekly alcohol consumption and frequency of binge drinking episodes. RESULTS: Participants in the special intervention and usual care groups were similar on important background variables and potential confounders except that special intervention participants had significantly higher baseline levels of alcohol usage (P =. 01). At 6 -month follow-up, in the 91 % of the cohort who provided follow-up information, alcohol consumption was significantly reduced when adjusted for age, sex, and baseline alcohol usage (special intervention, - 5. 8 drinks per week; usual care, - 3. 4 drinks per week; P =. 001). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that screening and very brief (5 - to 10 -minute) advice and counseling delivered by a physician or nurse practitioner as part of routine primary care significantly reduces alcohol consumption by high-risk drinkers...|$|E
40|$|The co-Director of Democratic Audit, Professor Patrick Dunleavy {{was asked}} by the leading Scottish newspaper, the Sunday Post, to write a report on the costs of {{transitioning}} to a new government {{in the event of a}} ‘Yes’ vote in Scotland’s independence referendum. The report argues that an independent Scotland would face immediate set-up costs of up to £ 200 million in creating new administrative structures that duplicate UK institutions, but could also streamline many public bodies. During the transition process, Scottish government could agree contracts or service deals with London to maintain existing back <b>office</b> <b>support</b> <b>system</b> (mainly involving IT) in collecting taxes, paying benefits and organizing complex defence systems. In the medium term (by 2018 to 20021) Scotland would need to build its own, new IT systems to allow policy control to be fully exercised from Edinburgh, in each of these areas. These tasks would certainly cost several hundred million pounds, but they would also be investments in modern systems, and not just “set up” costs. Significant policy savings may also accrue, and offset some of this burden. A key influence on Scotland’s costs would be the conduct of negotiations between Scottish ministers and the remaining UK (rUK) government. A hostile approach by London ministers would force rapid changes and greatly add to Scotland’s costs. A more careful, phased approach would make these costs a lot less. Every transition to a new state has some uncertainty and a degree of risk. But there are no bases for extreme anxiety about an independence transition in Scotland. The Scottish government’s record in public management is a good one, its published plans for transition are relatively specific and reasonable, and the long-run viability of a Scottish state looks strong. The main current uncertainties arise from the London government’s apparent reluctance to do any planning for, or to make clear to Scottish voters, how a transition to independence would be handled at their end. The report has already been covered extensively, including in the Scotsman, the Guardian, by the BBC, the Spectator and others...|$|E

40|$|This {{field study}} {{addressed}} behavioral and organizational {{issues related to}} office automation technology. The objective {{was to determine if}} the manner in which <b>office</b> <b>support</b> is designed and managed makes a difference in the job satisfaction and productivity of support personnel. Two underlying philosophies of organization were identified. The 2 ̆ 2 task-oriented 2 ̆ 2 approach applies the scientific management principles of work specialization to office systems. It corresponds to the authoritative management style of McGregor 2 ̆ 7 s Theory X or Likert 2 ̆ 7 s Systems 1 and 2. The 2 ̆ 2 people-oriented 2 ̆ 2 approach is characterized by job enrichment and greater autonomy for office employees. It corresponds to the participative management style of McGregor 2 ̆ 7 s Theory Y or Likert 2 ̆ 7 s Systems 3 and 4. The study hypothesized that job satisfaction and productivity would be higher in organizations using the people-oriented approach. ^ To test the hypothesis, this study analyzed the management pratices of <b>office</b> <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> among a national sample of 383 organizations. Management style was assessed with the Profile of Organizational Characteristics, completed by one <b>office</b> <b>support</b> manager and four <b>office</b> <b>support</b> personnel. Job satisfaction was measured by the Job Descriptive Index, completed by support personnel. Performance was reported by managers on a specifically designed instrument. Regression and multivariate analysis provided strong support for the hypothesis that satisfaction was higher among <b>support</b> staff in <b>offices</b> using participatory management practices, and provided weak, but positive, support for the productivity hypothesis. ^ It was concluded that organizations employing a people-oriented approach to office design and management are likely to have personnel who express higher satisfaction with their jobs and who have maintained a level of productivity at least equivalent to those organizations which have taken a task-oriented, scientific management approach. It is recommended that organizations devote at least as much time analyzing tasks and procedures to be performed by people as they devote to those which are to be automated. ...|$|R

This effects the change in functioning of equipment such as reduction in life of equipment, mal-operations and increase in power losses. So Power Quality is defined as how close the voltage we get matchs with ideal conditions like constant magnitude and frequency.

5000|$|There is {{no single}} defined {{standard}} for [...] "interoperable PTC systems". Several examples of interoperable systems illustrate this point. First, the UP and BNSF are interoperable across their systems. They are both implementing I-ETMS and will use different radio frequencies in different locations. In the second example, Amtrak is interoperable with Norfolk Southern in Michigan. Amtrak uses ITCS, while Norfolk Southern uses I-ETMS. To interoperate, two 220 MHz radios are installed in each wayside location and they both interface with a common PTC system through an interface device (similar to a network gateway or protocol converter) at each wayside location. One radio talks to freight trains using I-ETMS and one radio talks to passenger trains using ITCS. In this case interoperability stops at the wayside and {{does not include the}} wireless segment out to the rail vehicles or the onboard systems. In the third example, similar to the first, Metrolink, the commuter rail agency in Los Angeles, is implementing I-ETMS and will use the same PTC equipment as both the UP and BNSF. Metrolink is procuring their own 220 MHz spectrum so that trains on Metrolink territory (commuter and freight) will use other channels than those used by the UP and BNSF. Interoperability is achieved by directing the onboard radio to change channels depending on location. For SEPTA, the commuter operation in and around Philadelphia, Ansaldo is implementing ACSES, the Amtrak northeast corridor PTC protocol. For CSX all the ACSES PTC transactions will be handed to CSX at the SEPTA back office, and CSX will be responsible for deploying I-ETMS infrastructure that they will use to communicate with their freight trains. The SEPTA interoperability model is very {{similar to that of the}} public safety radio community wherein different radio systems that use different frequencies and protocols are cross-connected only in the back <b>office</b> to <b>support</b> <b>system</b> to system communications.|$|R
25|$|By {{the year}} 600, there were major build ups of silt {{on the bottom}} of the Hong Gou canal, obstructing river barges whose drafts were too deep for its waters. The chief {{engineer}} of the Sui dynasty, Yuwen Kai, advised the dredging of a new canal that would run parallel to the existing canal, diverging from it at Chenliu (Yanzhou). The new canal was to pass not Xuzhou but Suzhou, to avoid connecting with the Si River, and instead make a direct connection with the Huai River just west of Lake Hongze. With the recorded labor of five million men and women under the supervision of Ma Shumou, the first major section of the Grand Canal was completed in the year 605—called the Bian Qu. The Grand Canal was fully completed under the second Sui emperor, from the years 604 to 609, first by linking Luoyang to the Yangzhou (and the Yangzi valley), then expanding it to Hangzhou (south), and to Beijing (north). This allowed the southern area to provide grain to the northern province, particularly to troops stationed there. Running alongside and parallel to the canal was an imperial roadway and post <b>offices</b> <b>supporting</b> a courier <b>system.</b> The government also planted an enormous line of trees. The history of the canal's construction is handed down in the book Kaiheji ('Record of the Opening of the Canal').|$|R
