5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is,</b> however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E
25|$|Sun Lutang {{states in}} his {{autobiography}} that the legendary fight between Guo Yunshen and Dong Hai Chuan never happened. The book states that the truth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that Guo Yunshen actually fought one of his older xingyi brothers and lost. Sun Lutang was a student of both Guo Yunshen and Cheng Tinghua so this stance on the subject {{seems to be one}} of the most accurate.|$|E
25|$|ACTUAL COST SYSTEM : The {{importance}} of this subject, while being generally conceded, is nevertheless sadly neglected, and the only explanation that can be given is that either the business man and his assistants {{are not able to}} inaugurate such a system, or the expense that might be involved prevents him from taking any action in this direction. This is the only logical explanation that can be offered where the importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> conceded and admits of no argument or difference of opinion...|$|E

25|$|Finally, a {{case has}} been made that Kant wrote Dreams before, not after, the Knobloch letter {{and that this was}} {{accomplished}} by accidentally or deliberately falsifying the dates of the documents involved, notably that of the Knobloch letter. This alteration, if true, would strengthen the case for Swedenborg’s work being viewed by Kant, in the last analysis, positively. However, the fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> difficult to determine since the key date involved is that of the original of the Knobloch letter, which is lost.|$|E
25|$|The Meeting {{then moves}} to Public Business, where an invited guest, usually someone of {{expertise}} or {{involvement in the}} matter being debated, chairs the debate in which both student and guest speakers from the Proposition or Opposition bench take the floor. During speeches, Points of Information may be offered from the floor or opposing bench. Shorter, impromptu Floor Speeches may also be given if there is interest from the student audience. At the debate's conclusion, the motion is put to the House followed by a speech from the occupant of the Chair who usually offers his thoughts on how the debate proceeded. Students and guests then proceed to a reception where discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> usually continued.|$|E
25|$|The fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that we’re in our thirties now {{and that}} breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We {{did a lot of}} shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like {{to think of it as}} unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

There are elements of conceit and haughtiness.

500|$|Lee {{was quoted}} before the battle as saying Meade [...] "would commit no blunders on my front and if I make one ... will make haste to take {{advantage}} of it." [...] That prediction proved to be correct at Gettysburg. Stephen Sears wrote, [...] "The fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that George G.

500|$|There is an {{idealization}} of the [...] {{as presented}} in the film.

The one corpse {{that had not been}} found for several days is never shown on screen. No bodies show the gaunt figure of one who has died after a long illness, or the cuts and bruises of an accident victim. Japanologist Mark R. Mullins writes that the gratitude shown in Departures would probably not have occurred in real life; according to Coffinman, there [...] "is nothing lower on the social scale than the mortician, and the truth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that [...] fear the coffinman and the cremator just as much as death and the corpse".|$|E
500|$|Zappa {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as one of the most significant electric guitar soloists. In a 1983 issue of Guitar World, Jon Swenson declared: [...] "the fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that [...] is one of the greatest guitarists we have and is sorely unappreciated as such." [...] His idiosyncratic style developed gradually and was mature by the early 1980s, by which time his live performances featured lengthy improvised solos during many songs. A November 2016 feature by the editors of Guitar Player magazine wrote: [...] "Brimming with sophisticated motifs and convoluted rhythms, Zappa's extended excursions are more akin to symphonies than they are to guitar solos." [...] The symphonic comparison stems from his habit of introducing melodic themes that, like a symphony's main melodies, were repeated with variations throughout his solos. He was further described as using a wide variety of scales and modes, enlivened by [...] "unusual rhythmic combinations". His left hand was capable of smooth legato technique, while Zappa's right was [...] "one of the fastest pick hands in the business." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{video game}} version of Mona Sax was {{critically}} acclaimed for {{being one of}} [...] "relatively complex, non-stereotypical female game characters". She was included on the 2007 list of 50 greatest female characters in video game history by Tom's Games, where she was described as [...] "a stone-cold killer who's incredibly tempting but not entirely trustworthy" [...] and [...] "the perfect female accomplice to Max Payne." [...] In 2008, PC Games Hardware also listed her {{as one of the}} most important female characters in video games. In 2012, David Sanchez of GameZone proposed that Mona appear in her own spin-off game, calling her [...] "one of the sexiest femme fatales in all of gaming", and added, [...] "The fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that Mona Sax is one hell of a character — one that hasn't starred in her very own game, but one that could very well do so and deliver an unforgettable experience." [...] That same year, Austin Yorski of Blistered Thumbs listed Mona among his personal favorites while discussing the portrayals of video game female characters. In 2013, Complex ranked her as the 20th-best supporting character in video games.|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
500|$|Partly in {{reaction}} to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all. Morris's Age of Arthur prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that [...] "no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian's time". Gildas' 6th-century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur. Arthur is {{not mentioned in the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820. He is absent from Bede's early-8th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People, another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon. The historian David Dumville has written: [...] "I think we can dispose of him [...] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought... The fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books." ...|$|E

500|$|For the PlayStation version, IGN's David Zdyrko cited that [...] "Many of {{the games}} are quite enjoyable, but the truth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that it never quite matches {{the thrill of the}} real thing" [...] and criticized on how [...] "the visuals are very bland on the whole. It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all to get excited about". He also called the music [...] "boring and {{completely}} uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel {{of one of the most}} successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book that comes with the game [...] "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".|$|E
500|$|Before All My Children {{offered him}} {{the role of}} Dimitri Marick, Nader already planned on working in both Los Angeles and New York. [...] "My fiancee, Beth Windsor, had {{literally}} just worked into being bicoastal," [...] he said. [...] "She had an apartment here and I had been seeking out some theater here in New York {{and would have been}} spending time both here and in L.A. So after we made the decision to go ahead with that game plan, this offer (Dimitri) came on the table and when we worked out all the figures moneywise it was a great opportunity." [...] Despite Nader's prime time success as Dynasty's Dex Dexter, he did not look down on daytime television. [...] "The fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> we're in a different era," [...] he said. [...] "And {{if you look at the}} cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time." [...] Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York.|$|E
500|$|The university's SRC was {{affiliated}} with the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS). NUSAS had taken pains to cultivate a multi-racial membership but remained white-dominated {{because the majority of}} South Africa's students were from the country's white minority. As Clive Nettleton, a white NUSAS leader, put it: [...] "the essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> that NUSAS was founded on white initiative, is financed by white money and reflects the opinions of the majority of its members who are white". NUSAS officially opposed apartheid, but it moderated its opposition {{in order to maintain the}} support of conservative white students. Biko and several other black African NUSAS members were frustrated when it organised parties in white dormitories, which black Africans were forbidden to enter. In July 1967, a NUSAS conference was held at Rhodes University in Grahamstown; after the students arrived, they found that dormitory accommodation had been arranged for the white and Indian delegates but not the black Africans, who were told that they could sleep in a local church. Biko and other black African delegates walked out of the conference in anger. Biko later related that this event forced him to rethink his belief in the multi-racial approach to political activism: ...|$|E
