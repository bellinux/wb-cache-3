5|$|In the tropics, many {{amphibians}} breed continuously <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> time of year. In temperate regions, breeding {{is mostly}} seasonal, {{usually in the}} spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.|$|E
5|$|As of November 24, 2015 all {{citizens}} that possess the burgundy red Lebanese passport must submit {{them to the}} Lebanese Directorate General of General Security (DGGS) <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> Lebanese embassy {{as well as any}} of the various diplomatic missions and consulates of the Republic of Lebanon abroad. These passports will no longer be valid since they are not machine-readable. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has decided that November 24, 2015 will be the deadline to implement the use of machine-readable passports only in travel through airports. Those who possess the red Lebanese passport must apply for the navy blue (machine-readable) passport as soon as possible.|$|E

25|$|The {{fundamental}} change that the differential equation perspective brings is that, rather than computing a number (the present value now), one computes a function (the present value now <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> point in future). This function may then be analyzed—how does its value change over time—or {{compared with other}} functions.|$|E
25|$|His plan brought strong {{opposition}} from the cycling establishment, particularly from the veteran administrator and writer George Herbert Stancer.

25|$|When a {{misrepresentation}} {{has been}} made and an agreement was (<b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> rate appeared to be) concluded, the misrepresentee {{does not have to}} bring a halt to the deal. Misrepresentations generally do not render a contract void, as does the contractual doctrine of common mistake or frustration; it makes a contract voidable at the option of the misrepresentee. Not all contracts entered into on the strength of misrepresentations will be bad for the misrepresentee, who may choose not to void the contract.|$|E
25|$|The {{delivery}} of {{the large number of}} projectiles simultaneously makes the shotgun the most effective short range weapon commonly used, with a hit probability 45% greater than a submachine gun, and twice as great as an assault rifle. The ability to use shotgun slugs extends the range and penetration capability of the shotgun. Police officers in the US commonly secure a shotgun in their vehicles, for use when armed resistance is expected <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> time greater firepower than the officer's sidearm is needed.|$|E
25|$|Some attacks {{require an}} {{expensive}} preprocessing stage {{after which the}} cipher can be broken in minutes or seconds. Until recently, the weaknesses have been passive attacks using the known plaintext assumption. In 2003, more serious weaknesses were identified which can be exploited in the ciphertext-only scenario, or by an active attacker. In 2006 Elad Barkan, Eli Biham and Nathan Keller demonstrated attacks against A5/1, A5/3, or even GPRS that allow attackers to tap GSM mobile phone conversations and decrypt them either in real-time, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> later time.|$|E

25|$|Under Art. 54 (3) and 65 (3) of the constitution, the President {{may not be}} {{held liable}} for any alleged {{criminal}} acts while executing the duties of office. Such prosecution may not occur either while the president is in office <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> time thereafter. Furthermore, Art 65 (1) prevents trial or detention for prosecution of a criminal offense or tort while in office. The only sort of prosecution allowed for a sitting President is that of high treason, which can only be carried out by the Senate, and can only result in removal from office and a ban on regaining the office at a later date.|$|E

25|$|Nests may be {{built in}} a wide variety of places – on the ground, in dense {{floating}} vegetation, in bushes, <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> height in trees. They are bulky structures of rushes, sticks or other materials. Nest building is undertaken by the male initially, who will construct the nest in his territory prior to pair-bond formation. Unpaired females will visit a number of territories before settling on a male to breed with. Males may initially challenge and fight off prospective mates, and may not accept first-year females as mates. Pair-bond formation may take a few weeks. Courtship feeding is part of the bonding process, where males catch and process a snail and then feed it to the female.|$|E
25|$|With Oracle Solaris, the {{encryption}} capability in ZFS {{is embedded}} into the I/O pipeline. During writes, a block may be compressed, encrypted, checksummed and then deduplicated, in that order. The policy for encryption {{is set at}} the dataset level when datasets (file systems or ZVOLs) are created. The wrapping keys provided by the user/administrator can be changed at any time without taking the file system offline. The default behaviour is for the wrapping key to be inherited by any child data sets. The data encryption keys are randomly generated at dataset creation time. Only descendant datasets (snapshots and clones) share data encryption keys. A command {{to switch to a}} new data encryption key for the clone <b>or</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> time is provided—this does not re-encrypt already existing data, instead utilising an encrypted master-key mechanism.|$|E

The frog does not seem to see <b>or,</b> <b>at</b> <b>any</b> rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.|$|E
