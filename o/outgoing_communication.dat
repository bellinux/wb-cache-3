50|$|Many NAT {{implementations}} {{follow the}} port preservation design for TCP: {{for a given}} <b>outgoing</b> TCP <b>communication,</b> they use the same values as internal and external port numbers. NAT port preservation for outgoing TCP connections is crucial for TCP NAT traversal, because as TCP requires that one port can only be used for one communication at a time, programs bind distinct TCP sockets to ephemeral ports for each TCP communication, rendering NAT port prediction impossible for TCP.|$|R
40|$|Corporate network {{firewalls}} are well-understood and {{are becoming}} commonplace. These firewalls establish a security perimeter {{that aims to}} block (or heavily restrict) both incoming and <b>outgoing</b> network <b>communication.</b> We argue that these firewalls are neither effective nor appropriate for academic or corporate research environments needing to maintain information security while still supporting the free exchange of ideas. In this paper, we present the Stanford University Research Firewall (SURF), a network firewall design that is suitable for a research environment. While still protecting information and computing resources behind the firewall, this firewall is less restrictive of outward information flow than the traditional model; can be easily deployed; and can give internal users the illusion of unrestricted e-mail, anonymous FTP, and WWW connectivity to the greater Internet. Our experience demonstrates that an adequate firewall for a research environment can be constructed for minim [...] ...|$|R

The independence between traffic classes helps to improve the incremental design process, incremental certification and scheduling flows with mixed criticalities. DRR leads however to a less efficient use of hardware resources, {{this is why we}} also envisage the combined use of DRR and Static Priority (SP). We then provide a first quantitative assessment on a realistic case-study about the use of DRR, possibly combined with SP, in avionics networking and shed some light on its range of applicability...|$|R

50|$|Prior to Windows Vista, {{setting up}} and {{maintaining}} IPsec policy configuration in many scenarios required {{setting up a}} set of rules for protection and another set of rules for traffic exemptions. IPsec nodes in Windows Vista communicate while simultaneously negotiating protected communications and if a response is received and negotiation completes, subsequent communications are protected. This eliminates the need to set up IPsec filters for exemptions for the set of hosts that do not or cannot support IPsec, allows setting up required incoming protected initiated communication and optional <b>outgoing</b> <b>communication.</b> IPsec also allows securing traffic between domain controllers and member computers, while still allowing clear text for domain joins and other communication types. IPsec protected domain joins are allowed if using NTLM v2 and if both, the domain controllers and member computers are running Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista respectively.|$|E

For the 393 students with known chronotypes, personal network are built from all outgoing calls and texts. There are a total of 20, 841 social links for the 393 students; again we only kept social links which were active at least once in each direction.

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{to the design of}} collective communication operations in wormholerouted mesh networks is described. The approach extends the concept of dominating sets in graph theory by accounting for the relative distance-insensitivity of the wormhole switching strategy and by taking advantage of a multi-port communication architecture, which allows each node to simultaneously transmit messages on different <b>outgoing</b> channels. Collective <b>communication</b> operations are defined in terms of sets of extended dominating nodes (EDNs). The nodes in a set of EDNs can deliver (receive) messages to (from) a different, larger set of nodes in a single message-passing step under dimension-ordered wormhole routing and without channel contention among messages. The EDN model can be applied to different collective operations in 2 D and 3 D mesh networks. In this paper, we focus on EDN-based broadcast and global combine operations. Performance evaluation results are presented that confirm the advantage of t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{technologies}} {{not only}} provide {{a variety of}} communication modes, e. g., texting, cellphone conversation, and online instant messaging, but they also provide detailed electronic traces of these communications between individuals. These electronic traces indicate that the interactions occur in temporal bursts. Here, we study the inter-call durations of the 100, 000 most-active cellphone users of a Chinese mobile phone operator. We confirm that the inter-call durations follow a power-law distribution with an exponential cutoff at the population level but find differences when focusing on individual users. We apply statistical tests {{at the individual level}} and find that the inter-call durations follow a power-law distribution for only 3460 individuals (3. 46 %). The inter-call durations for the majority (73. 34 %) follow a Weibull distribution. We quantify individual users using three measures: out-degree, percentage of <b>outgoing</b> calls, and <b>communication</b> diversity. We find that the cellphone users with a power-law duration distribution fall into three anomalous clusters: robot-based callers, telecom frauds, and telephone sales. This information is of interest to both academics and practitioners, mobile telecom operator in particular. In contrast, the individual users with a Weibull duration distribution form the fourth cluster of ordinary cellphone users. We also discover more information about the calling patterns of these four clusters, e. g., the probability that a user will call the $c_r$-th most contact and the probability distribution of burst sizes. Our findings may enable a more detailed analysis of the huge body of data contained in the logs of massive users. Comment: 7 pages and 8 figue...|$|R
40|$|ARMI is a {{communication}} library {{that provides a}} framework for expressing fine-grain parallelism and mapping it to a particular machine using shared-memory and message passing library calls. The library is an advanced implementation of the RMI protocol and handles low-level details such as scheduling incoming communication and aggregating <b>outgoing</b> <b>communication</b> to coarsen parallelism when necessary. These details can be tuned for different platforms to allow user codes to achieve the highest performance possible without manual modification. ARMI is used by STAPL, our generic parallel library, to provide a portable, user transparent communication layer. We present the basic design {{as well as the}} mechanisms used in the current Pthreads/OpenMP, MPI implementations and/or a combination thereof. Performance comparisons between ARMI and explicit use of Pthreads or MPI are given on a variety of machines, including an HP V 2200, SGI Origin 3800, IBM Regatta-HPC and IBM RS 6000 SP cluster...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEffective {{communication}} during nurse handoffs is {{instrumental in}} ensuring safe and quality patient care. Much of the prior research on nurse handoffs has utilized retrospective {{methods such as}} interviews, surveys and questionnaires. While extremely useful, an in-depth understanding of the structure and content of conversations, and the inherent relationships within the content is paramount to designing effective nurse handoff interventions. In this paper, we present a methodological framework—Sequential Conversational Analysis (SCA) —a mixed-method approach that integrates qualitative conversational analysis with quantitative sequential pattern analysis. We describe the SCA approach and provide a detailed example as a proof of concept of its use {{for the analysis of}} nurse handoff communication in a medical intensive care unit. This novel approach allows us to characterize the conversational structure, clinical content, disruptions in the conversation, and the inherently phasic nature of nurse handoff communication. The characterization of communication patterns highlights the relationships underlying the verbal content of nurse handoffs with specific emphasis on: the interactive nature of conversation, relevance of role-based (incoming, <b>outgoing)</b> <b>communication</b> requirements, clinical content focus on critical patient-related events, and discussion of pending patient management tasks. We also discuss the applicability of the SCA approach as a method for providing in-depth understanding of the dynamics of communication in other settings and domains...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Traffic {{analysis}} (TA) is {{a powerful}} tool against the security and privacy of cryptographic primitives, permitting an adversary to monitor the frequency and timing characteristics of transmissions in order to distinguish the senders or the receivers of possibly encrypted communication. Briefly, adversaries may leak implementation-specific information even for schemes that are provably secure {{with respect to a}} classical model, resulting in a breach of security and/or privacy. In this work we introduce the notion of indistinguishability in the presence of traffic analysis, enhancing any classical security model such that no adversary can distinguish between two protocol runs (possibly implemented on different machines) with respect to a TA oracle (leaking information about each protocol run). This new notion models an attack where the adversary taps a single node of in- and <b>outgoing</b> <b>communication</b> and tries to relate two sessions of the same protocol, either run by two senders or for two receivers. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We first define a framework for indistinguishability in the presence of TA, then we (2) fully relate various notions of indistinguishability, depending on the adversary’s goal and the type of TA information it has. Finally we (3) show how to use our framework for the SSH protocol and for a concrete application of RFID authentication...|$|E

This thesis details ARMI, a parallel communication library that provides an advanced implementation of the remote method invocation protocol (RMI), which is well suited to object-oriented programs. ARMI is a framework for expressing fine-grain parallelism in C++, and mapping it to a particular machine using shared-memory and message passing library calls. It handles low-level details such as scheduling incoming communication and aggregating <b>outgoing</b> <b>communication</b> to coarsen parallelism when necessary. These details can be adapted for different platforms to allow user codes to achieve the highest possible performance without manual modification. ARMI is used by STAPL, a generic, object-oriented, parallel C++ library, to provide a portable communication infrastructure. The basic design decisions are described, as well as a detailed analysis of the mechanisms used in the current OpenMP/Pthreads, MPI, and mixed-mode implementations. ARMI's performance is compared with both hand-coded Pthreads and MPI on a variety of machines, including an HP-V 2200, Origin 3800, IBM Regatta and IBM RS 6000 SP...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the communications involved by the execution of a complex application, deployed on a heterogeneous platform. Such applications extensively use macro-communication schemes, for example to broadcast data items. Rather than aiming at minimizing the execution time of a single broadcast, {{we focus on the}} steadystate operation. We assume that there is a large number of messages to be broadcast in pipeline fashion, and we aim at maximizing the throughput, i. e. the (rational) number of messages which can be broadcast every time-step. We target heterogeneous platforms, modeled by a graph where resources have different communication speeds under the unidirectional one-port model (i. e. at a given time step, a processor can be involved in at most one (incoming or <b>outgoing)</b> <b>communication</b> with one of its neighbors). Achieving the best throughput may well require that the target platform is used in totality: we show that neither spanning trees nor DAGs are as powerful as general graphs. We propose a rather sophisticated polynomial algorithm for determining the optimal throughput that can be achieved using a platform, together with a (periodic) schedule achieving this throughput. The algorithm is based on the use of polynomial oracles and of the ellipsoid method [9, 13] for solving in linear programs in rational numbers. The polynomial compactness of the description comes from the decomposition of the schedule into several broadcast trees that are used concurrently to reach the best throughput. It is {{important to point out that}} a concrete scheduling algorithm based upon the steady-state operation is asymptotically optimal, in the class of all possible schedules (not only periodic solutions) ...|$|E
40|$|When westerners {{attempt to}} develop friendships with Japanese they often rely on an {{outgoing}} style that exudes friendliness. Such direct, outgoing friendliness from foreigners {{may be viewed}} with suspicion by the Japanese. In all actions, Japanese prefer kindness over friendliness. Friendships form through kindness, {{and it is important}} that foreigners understand that they cannot speed-up the friendship process through friendly communication. Data from a focus group show how Japanese label and respond to communication styles which violate expectations of appropriate communication and inhibit the friendship formation process. Friendliness Does Not Make Friends in Japan As we move into the 21 st century, increased mobility, increased economic interdependence, and ever-expanding communication technologies create cross cultural interaction in ways we are just beginning to understand and appreciate. Global travel is at an all-time high. And global travelers, even if they are visitors only for a short time in host countries, will have to adapt to the communication expectations of those host countries. U. S. travelers in Japan are often quick to observe the uniqueness of the Japanese way. Most realize that patience is needed when doing business in Japan. This need for patience is driven by cultural differences in style, not only for business decisions, but also for building friendships. As {{in other parts of the}} world, building friendships takes time. The U. S. traveler cannot speed-up the process of making friends in Japan with an outgoing, effervescent speaking style. This paper considers the problem of American <b>outgoing</b> <b>communication</b> styles in Japan. After sharing some personal background information, it articulates how kindness and friendliness are valued in Japan and how the friendly American may actually retard the friendship building process.
