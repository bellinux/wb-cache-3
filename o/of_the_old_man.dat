5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{publication}} <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> and the Sea (1952), Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in two successive plane crashes that left him in pain or ill health {{for much of his}} remaining life. Hemingway maintained permanent residences in Key West, Florida, (1930s) and Cuba (1940s and 1950s), and in 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho, where he killed himself in mid-1961.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe was astounded at the technique <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> and requested that he become his student.|$|E

Brown and his team attempt to track the activities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man</b> and Tito with the help of Brown's captive Milgrim, whom he has translate the volapuk-encoded Russian used by Tito's family to communicate. Milgrim is addicted to anti-anxiety drugs, and is kept docile and compliant by Brown, who controls his supply of Rize. Brown believes that Tito and the old man are in possession of information that would, if revealed, undermine public confidence in the U.S.'s participation in the Iraq War. In his attempts to capture them and their data, however, Brown is instead fed disinformation through the old man's intricate schemes.|$|E
25|$|In May 1953, {{the novel}} {{received}} the Pulitzer Prize and was specifically cited when in 1954 {{he was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Literature which he dedicated to the Cuban people.

25|$|The answer {{assumes a}} third level on which The Old Man and the Sea must be read—as {{a sort of}} allegorical {{commentary}} on all his previous work, by means of which it may be established that the religious overtones <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> and the Sea are not peculiar to that book among Hemingway's works, and that Hemingway has finally taken the decisive step in elevating {{what might be called}} his philosophy of Manhood {{to the level of a}} religion.|$|E

25|$|The {{central part}} of the Coniston range can be likened to an {{inverted}} 'Y' with Brim Fell at the connecting point of the three arms. The main spine of the ridge runs north over Swirl How and Great Carrs and south west to Dow Crag and the lower hills beyond. The third arm is a truncated spur, running only half a mile to the summit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> before tumbling away south eastward to the valley floor. This ridge end position gives the fell a sense of isolation and increased stature, with steep faces on three sides.|$|E
25|$|On several {{occasions}} the poet assumes {{a tone of}} lamentation, as {{at the end of}} Canto I, in parts of the speech <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> of the Restelo, the end of Canto V, {{the beginning and end of}} Canto VII, and the final strophes of the poem. Many times, da Gama bursts into oration at challenging moments: in Mombasa (Canto II), on the appearance of Adamastor, and in the middle of the terror of the storm. The poet's invocations to the Tágides and nymphs of Mondego (Cantos I and VII) and to Calliope (beginning of Cantos III and X), in typological terms, are also orations. Each one of these types of speech shows stylistic peculiarities.|$|E
25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man.</b> He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.|$|E

500|$|In 1948, Hemingway and Mary {{traveled}} to Europe, staying in Venice for several months. While there, Hemingway {{fell in love}} with the then 19-year-old Adriana Ivancich. The platonic love affair inspired the novel Across the River and into the Trees, written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews. The following year, furious at the critical reception of Across the River and Into the Trees, he wrote the draft <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> and the Sea in eight weeks, saying that it was [...] "the best I can write ever for all of my life". The Old Man and the Sea became a book-of-the-month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the Pulitzer Prize in May 1952, a month before he left for his second trip to Africa.|$|E
500|$|Vanger is {{a wealthy}} {{businessman}} who launches an extensive investigation into his family's affairs. Despite calling the Vanger family [...] "dysfunctional", Plummer {{said of the}} character: [...] "I love the character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>man,</b> and I sympathize with him. He's really the nicest old guy in the whole book. Everybody is a bit suspect, and still are at the end. Old Vanger has a nice straight line, and he gets his wish." [...] Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony, an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik. [...] "I think {{that the old man}} would have it," [...] he opined, [...] "because he's a very sophisticated old guy [...] used to a great deal of power. So in dealing with people, he would be very good [...] he would be quite jokey, and know how to seduce them." ...|$|E
500|$|Almost a {{year later}} in October 1955, he declared: [...] "Am passed 650 pages in the book. Am trying to write now like a good sorcer's (sic) apprentice... always start to write as an apprentice. By {{the end of the}} book you are a master but if you {{commence}} as master in writing anyway, you end as a bloody bore." [...] Two months later, Hemingway was bedridden with kidney disease. By January 1956, he acknowledged, in a letter written on the second anniversary of the accidents, [...] he was having trouble remembering the trip. [...] In 1956, Hemingway agreed to work on the filming <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Man</b> and the Sea and abandoned work on the Africa book. [...] He wrote to his editor, [...] "I found it impossible to resume writing on the Africa book." [...] Hemingway put the manuscript in a safe-deposit box in Havana, although after the 1959 [...] Cuban revolution he feared the manuscript lost.|$|E
