5|$|The 1999 season {{featured}} many strong individual {{performances by}} the Giants, especially on offense. Receiver Amani Toomer had a breakout season, accumulating over 1100yards receiving and six touchdowns. Fellow receiver Ike Hilliard {{also had a}} solid season, finishing just shy of 1000yards receiving <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Tight end Pete Mitchell contributed 58 receptions, and Tiki Barber emerged as a premiere pass-catching running back, catching 66 passes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The defense was also solid, ranking 11th {{in the league and}} sending Armstead and Strahan to the Pro Bowl again. Though the Giants stood at 7–6 after 13 games, they lost their final three games of the season to miss the playoffs for the second consecutive season.|$|E

5|$|Burrows had a forgettable 2013–14 season, scoring only 5 {{goals and}} 10 assists. In 49 games played, {{he did not}} score until game 36, where he potted two goals against the Winnipeg Jets. His 15 points <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> were the third-lowest of his career and his lowest since 2006–07.

5|$|Feller {{started the}} 1952 season with three wins {{in his first}} five starts; one of the losses was an April 23 one-hitter against Bob Cain, who also allowed only one hit. Feller {{struggled}} {{for the rest of}} the season, and after an argument with an umpire over a strike call in late August, manager Al López shut Feller down for the season. He finished the season with a 9–13 record and a 4.74 ERA. He improved the following year, winning 10 games and losing 7 in 25 starts after Lopez gave him extra days of rest between appearances. The Indians won 111 regular season games during 1954, beating an AL record previously held by the 1927 New York Yankees. The 35-year-old Feller finished 13–3 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> earning his 250th pitching victory in a May 23 win and his 2,500th career strikeout in a win on June 12.|$|E

5|$|Graham led the AAFC {{in passing}} and was voted the league's most {{valuable}} player. Pro Football Illustrated named Brown the AAFC {{coach of the}} year.

5|$|Heian {{women were}} {{traditionally}} excluded from learning Chinese, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised in her erudite father's household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics {{and managed to}} acquire fluency. She married in her mid-to late twenties and {{gave birth to a}} daughter before her husband died, two years after they were married. It is uncertain when she began to write The Tale of Genji, but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, Murasaki was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Shōshi at the Imperial court, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Shōshi to the Lake Biwa region. Scholars differ <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1031.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Holloman again {{spent the}} season with the Volunteers, posting a record of 17–10 with a 4.46 ERA. After the season ended, the Chicago Cubs signed him and gave him an {{invitation}} to spring training. Holloman's outgoing nature clashed with manager Frankie Frisch, who did not appreciate the pitcher's attitude. It was, partially, {{for this reason that}} Holloman did not make the major league roster. Holloman split the 1950 season between Nashville and the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League. Combined, he had 13 wins and 13 losses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> In 1951, he spent seven games with Nashville, but spent most of {{the season with}} the Augusta Tigers of the Sally League, where he posted an 11–9 record and a 3.87 ERA.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} year of his {{contract}} with the Lightning during the 2014–15 season, Brewer was traded after 17 games to the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for a third-round draft pick in 2015 on November 28, 2014. At the time, he was playing in his fifth season with the Lightning. He appeared in 17 games, and had four assists <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> Brewer played in 246 games with Tampa, scoring 10 goals and 46 assists.

5|$|Michigan's rushing {{touchdown}} {{in the fourth quarter}} snapped a streak of 24 quarters where Iowa hadn't allowed a rushing touchdown (dating back to the Orange Bowl vs. Georgia Tech). With his rushing performance, Denard Robinson surpassed 1,000 rushing yards for the season, becoming just the second Big Ten quarterback to accomplish the feat in conference history.

5|$|On November 11, Croyle again {{substituted}} for an injured Huard {{in the final}} half of a 27–11 loss to the Denver Broncos. Croyle finished the game 17-for-30 for 162 yards, with one interception, in the loss that dropped Kansas City to 4–5 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The following day, Croyle was named the starting quarterback for the Chiefs' upcoming game against the Indianapolis Colts, and made his first start on November 18 at the RCA Dome in a 13–10 loss. Croyle was the first quarterback drafted by Kansas City to start a game for the Chiefs since Todd Blackledge started a game in 1984. Croyle was 19-of-27 for 169 yards with one touchdown, but he lost a fumble that set up Adam Vinatieri's game-winning field goal.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 2005, in an 84–56 {{defeat of}} Southern University, Rolle made his collegiate debut, playing 14minutes and scoring six points while also {{grabbing}} three rebounds. Rolle shot 4-of-8 {{from the field}} and contributed season bests in rebounds (10) and points (8) to help lead LSU past Nicholls State. He equaled his season high in points against the Vanderbilt Commodores on February 2, 2006, in only nine minutes of playing time. The Tigers surprised many with a Final Four run, and in that game Rolle led the team in rebounds with eight, recorded two points from 1-of-1 shooting, and blocked a shot, all in 14minutes of playing time. Despite this performance, LSU's opponent UCLA ultimately prevailed, 59–45. During the 2005–06 season, Rolle averaged 2.2points, 2.5rebounds, and 8.7minutes per game as a freshman, picking up 21 blocks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
