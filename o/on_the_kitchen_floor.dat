5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> beside his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter {{from the airport to}} their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage. The man who had helped Dion stands to one side, watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E

Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and {{sleeping}} at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E

5000|$|The Chinese Legation {{continued}} renting Stewart's Castle until 1893 when Stewart was reelected to the Senate. The Legation {{had caused}} significant {{damage to the}} building. Staff smoking opium left burned holes in the expensive furniture, fish was cooked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> tile <b>floors</b> because staff were unaccustomed to using stoves and there were smoke stains in the rooms because the minister would burn red peppers when he wanted guests to leave. [...] Stewart sued the Chinese government for $15,000 for damages to the house. Chinese officials hired former Secretary of State John W. Foster to represent them in court and a settlement was reached {{in the amount of}} $3,000.|$|R
5000|$|<b>On</b> <b>The</b> Borscht Belt Writer Karen Schoemer {{reporting}} for DVEight writes, With The Borscht Belt, Scheinfeld {{has become the}} unofficial visual historian, documentarian, and diarist of the sad, dwindling flame of the Catskills’ once-thriving resort community. When I look at Scheinfeld’s photographs, I experience loss and disbelief. Graffiti and mildew streak the once-magnificent multi-tier lobby at Grossinger’s in Liberty. A moldering roll of paper towels lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flooded <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> Pines in South Fallsburg. A hallway overpass at the Pines is a wreck of drooping fiberglass insulation. And yet the work is compelling for more than its depiction of disaster and decay. As a photographer, Scheinfeld has a gentle touch: she uses natural light and never rearranges or stages objects for effect." ...|$|R
500|$|The novel {{opens in}} 1954 {{in the small}} logging {{settlement}} of Twisted River on the Androscoggin River in northern New Hampshire. A log driving accident on the river has just claimed {{the life of a}} young logger, Angel, who slipped and fell under the logs. Dominic Baciagalupo is the camp's Italian-American cook who lives above the kitchen with his 12-year-old son, Daniel. Dominic lost his wife, Rosie, 10 years previously when a drunk Dominic, Rosie and a logger and mutual friend, Ketchum, were dancing on the frozen river, and the ice broke and Rosie went under. Later another accident happens that changes the lives of Dominic, Daniel and Ketchum. [...] "Injun Jane", the kitchen's dishwasher and girlfriend of the local law officer, Constable Carl, is having an affair with Dominic. One night, mistaking her for a bear attacking his father, Daniel kills her with an eight-inch cast-iron skillet. Dominic takes Jane's body and deposits it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> of Carl's house, knowing that Carl will be passed out drunk and will probably believe he killed her, as he often beat her up. Early the next morning Dominic and Daniel tell Ketchum what happened and flee Twisted River in case the bad-tempered Carl finds out what really happened.|$|E
2500|$|About midnight, {{the police}} stormed 1395 Lakeview Road. They {{were able to}} get inside, but a locked and barricaded door {{prevented}} them from reaching the second floor. Police also say they saw a body lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor.</b> Shortly afterward, the house caught fire. The cause of the fire was never determined, and the Cleveland Fire Department did not fight the blaze since it was believed firefighters would come under attack. Police observers later said they heard the names [...] "Omar" [...] and [...] "Ali" [...] shouted from within the home. 1391 Lakeview Road also caught fire, and both homes burned to the ground.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an account}} first {{published}} in 1999 by the widely cited newsletter Taylorology, on October 21, 1964, while still living in Hollywood, Gibson suffered a heart attack. Sensing that she was dying, a highly distraught Gibson—a recently converted Roman Catholic—asked for a priest and then confessed to neighbors the February 1, 1922 murder of Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor. She may have made statements about a motive but in 1999, the only surviving witness to this incident wrote that at the time, he was young, distracted by the immediate crisis of her heart attack, {{had no knowledge of}} who William Desmond Taylor was or what she was talking about. As a result, he could not remember many further details about what Gibson said as she lay dying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> of her small house. The witness did recall Gibson also said she had been [...] "nearly caught" [...] and had [...] "fled the country".|$|E
50|$|The castle is {{a nearly}} square four-storey tower house, around 25 ft {{on each side}} and with walls up to 5 ft thick. In the {{south-east}} corner is a round staircase that protrudes from the building. Currently, the tower has a store at ground level, a living room <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>floor,</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second, and bedrooms and bathrooms <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third and fourth floors.

50|$|Gloria is {{settling}} {{into the home}} of Orson, Bree, Andrew, and Danielle, and they all realize that she is more than they can handle. She watches an old home movie which Alma appears in. Bree has banned alcohol from her, because Gloria can't mix alcohol with her medication. Gloria demands {{to be able to}} live in her own house, and tells Orson to buy it for her. Edie ends up showing them around a cheap house in the ghetto area of Fairview, but when Gloria ends up falling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unstable <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor,</b> Bree demands that she continues to live with them, over the objections of both Gloria and Orson. Gloria, in the hopes of destroying the lives of Orson and Bree, tells Bree that Orson cheated on Alma, and his mistress was Monique. Monique cheated on Orson, too. Bree tells Orson that it scares her that he had two women in his life before her; one's missing, and one's dead. She throws him out of the house.|$|R
5000|$|The club, whose owner Paul Jackson {{built on}} small beginnings, has hosted an eclectic range of {{national}} and international acts. The small intimate venue has remained shabby chic, ramshackle and idiosyncratic, but has retained a unique atmosphere as the colours of the interior walls changed from green to brown and back to green again. The venue contains a front room containing a pool table, and the bar area which is featured in CAMRA's 2015 version of the Good Beer Guide. This area remains open in the evening from 8 pm, irrespective of whether there is any live entertainment taking place. Otherwise the main concert room has hosted thousands of musicians over the years including those just commencing their careers such as Pulp, Green Day and Radiohead; plus local boys The Housemartins who first appeared there in 1988. Others appearing included The Stone Roses, Supergrass and Mumford & Sons. Oasis played at the Adelphi {{the day before the}} release of their first single, whilst Radiohead played there twice. Their second appearance was in 1992 around the time of their hit single, [...] "Creep". Uniquely, The Shamen once slept overnight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> venue's <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor,</b> after concluding their late evening's performance.|$|R
2500|$|The {{album is}} named after track four, [...] "Talk a Good Game" [...] which {{features}} Kevin Cossom. Over a [...] "snaky but sweet" [...] production from T-Minus Rowland sings [...] "I don’t think I can take another broken promise / Why do things the hard way when you can just be honest". Hampp said that Cossom's rap gave the song a [...] "street edge". It takes the listener on an emotional journey according to The Honesty Hour. The next song, [...] "Down on Love", is a midtempo production featuring another classic sample, this time the 1987 song [...] "Rock Steady" [...] by American R group The Whispers. Using her mezzo-soprano vocals, Rowland takes on a downtrodden romantic situation, [...] "We want two different things at two different times / You know how the story go / Easy come easy go". [...] "Dirty Laundry" [...] was co-written by Rowland, Carlos McKinney and The Dream, and is R [...] "confessional" [...] ballad, containing [...] "R jam spools" [...] and a piano-led melody. It details a [...] "frank and often poignant commentary" [...] on Rowland's life. The song is a [...] "brutal" [...] chronicle of {{the last ten years}} of Rowland's life, covering her envy of Beyoncé's solo success and the end of an abusive relationship. Amongst the lyrics, Rowland sings [...] "Kinda lucky I was in her shadow / Phone call from my sister what’s the matter / She said, 'Oh no / You gotta leave' / I’m <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor</b> / He took the keys." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three clues {{were found}} at the scene. The first was the caliber of bullets. The second was a {{flashlight}} found in the hedge underneath the window that Starks was shot from. The last clue was of bloody prints around the house; shoe-prints <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor,</b> and smudged fingerprints in other places. Sheriff Davis stated that although this murder could not be directly linked to the Phantom because the caliber was a [...]22, [...] "it {{is possible that the}} killer is one and the same man." [...] Those who had been driving in the area near the time of the slaying, along with several men found within the vicinity, were picked up for questioning. Early Saturday morning, bloodhounds were brought in from Hope by the Arkansas State Police. They found two trails that led to the highway before the scent was lost. That night, many officers patrolled lovers' lanes hoping to prevent another attack. By Sunday night, more State Police officers were called in to help in the investigation and to aid in protecting the local civilians. Officers had detained at least twelve suspects but only kept three for further questioning. Forty-seven officers were working around the clock to solve the mysteries. Among them were sheriffs of four counties, Captain Gonzaullas and his staff of Texas Rangers, and Chief Deputy Tillman Johnson. The flashlight was sent to Washington, D.C. for further inspection by the FBI. Meanwhile, Mrs. Starks was showing improvements at Michael Meagher Hospital. The unofficial theory for a motive amongst the majority of the 47 officers was that of [...] "sex mania", because large amounts of money in the home were not taken, nor was Mrs. Starks' purse, which was lying on the bed containing money and jewels, and because nothing was stolen from the home. The title {{on the front page of}} the Texarkana Gazette on Sunday, May 5, 1946 read: [...] "SEX MANIAC HUNTED IN MURDERS".|$|E

50|$|The Eighth Maine Memorial {{is located}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south coast of Peaks Island, a large island at the southeastern edge of Casco Bay east of {{downtown}} Portland. It {{is a large}} two-story rectangular structure, with a gabled roof whose sides are punctuated by large cross gables.

The walls are finished in a combination of clapboards, wooden and vinyl shingles, and asphalt shingles. <b>The</b> building rests <b>on</b> a fieldstone foundation that slopes down toward the shore, exposing part of the basement.

5000|$|The {{house was}} {{obviously}} meant for occupation, {{as it has}} a great hall and parlour <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first <b>floor,</b> <b>kitchen</b> and buttery in the basement, and a bedroom <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper floor. However, it was probably never intended for full-time occupation. Too close to the main house {{for use as a}} hunting lodge, it may have been intended for use as a [...] "Secret House" [...] - keeping a secret house was a custom of the 16th century. Often within a mile of the main house, the secret house was a place where the head of the household would retire for a few days with a minimum of servants, while the principal house was thoroughly cleaned and, bearing in mind the sanitation of the time, fumigated. Similar examples of [...] "secret houses" [...] exist at Leconfield and Warkworth, where their use for this purpose has been well documented.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Mark's younger sister, {{a rebellious}} 16-year-old, Alice Holden {{showed up in}} Selby Flats to live with Kathy, Mark and Robin. Right away {{it was clear that}} Alice and Robin mixed like water and oil, nearly not at all. Alice was resentful how spoiled Robin {{appeared}} to be, and Robin couldn't stand having the older more wordly-wise Alice living in the same household. Enter into all of this a just turned teenaged Mike Bauer, the [...] "cousin" [...] of Robin, who Robin had a crush on and Mike did allow her some flirtations. But for the 13-year-old Mike, his hormones made him fall under the spell of the older Alice. And Alice picked up on that. This stalemate of constant tension between Robin, Mike and Alice was going to soon lead to a tragedy that would just compound for the helpless Kathy. And all of this started just as Kathy found out she was pregnant, again, this time with Mark's child! One day to get back at Robin and to treat her as the spoiled brat she was, Alice took a kitchen chair that Mike, being the young gentlemen he was, would usually pull out for Robin and decided to screw out some of the bolts used to hold the chair together, so it would fall apart when Robin sat in it—so Robin would be embarrassed and perhaps keep her spoiled bratty mouth shut. Unfortunately at that exact time, a pregnant Kathy decided to use that chair to do some work in one of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> cabinets and when Kathy stood <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chair, sure enough as Alice had intended (but for the wrong victim), the chair gave way and Kathy fell hard <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>floor.</b> Kathy was taken to Cedars and it was clear the injury Kathy sustained was serious and she miscarried her and Mark's child! Kathy then developed another infection and soon found herself permanently restricted to a wheelchair as she developed paralysis. Alice was soon sent packing back to Mark's parents home, and then a year later to a school whose living arrangements were closer to where Mark lived with Robin. In March 1958, Kathy was killed when bicycling children accidentally pushed her wheelchair into oncoming traffic. Mark had to raise the now SORASed to a teenager Robin on his own.|$|R
