40|$|Collapses {{of timber}} {{structures}} are negative for <b>the</b> competitiveness <b>of</b> timber on <b>the</b> construction market. The {{question is what}} can be done to reduce <b>the</b> risk for <b>failure</b> in timber structures in the future. For this purpose a comprehensive survey and analysis of failures in 127 timber structures have been made. The present paper summarises the results from this survey with an analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying causes and associated conclusions and recommendations. The most common cause of failure is related to weaknesses in or lack of strength design (41. 5 %), followed by poor principles during erection (14. 1 %), on-site alterations (12. 5 %) and insufficient or lack of design with respect to environmental actions (11. 4 %). In total, about half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> are caused by the designer and about one fourth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures</b> are caused by the personnel working at the building site. Wood quality, production methods and production principles only cause a small part (together about 11 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failures...</b>|$|R
5|$|Monmouth then marched {{overnight}} to Frome {{arriving on}} 28 June.

5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he finally did attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was controversial {{in a number}} of ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the necessity for maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea that early experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E
5|$|At the Board Of Trade Inquiry {{into the}} accident, expert {{witnesses}} expressed {{doubts about the}} design of the roof, even though the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.|$|E
5|$|By 1258, Henry's {{rule was}} {{increasingly}} unpopular, the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of his expensive foreign {{policies and the}} notoriety of his Poitevin half-brothers, the Lusignans, {{as well as the}} role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the Provisions of Oxford. Henry and the baronial government enacted a peace with France in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for King Louis IX recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.|$|E

5|$|During a {{televised}} {{address to the}} nation on 7 September 2004, Lukashenko announced plans for a referendum to eliminate presidential term limits. This was held on 17 October 2004, the same day as parliamentary elections, and, according to official results, was approved by 79.42% of voters. Previously, Lukashenko had been limited to two terms and thus would have been constitutionally required to step down after the presidential elections in 2006. Opposition groups, the OSCE, the European Union, and the US State Department stated that the vote fell short of international standards. An example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure,</b> cited by the OSCE, was the pre-marking of ballots. Belarus grew economically under Lukashenko, but much of this growth was due to Russian crude oil which was imported at below-market prices, refined, and sold to other European countries at a profit.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Housing Act 1980 gave council tenants {{the right}} to buy their homes. In light of this, a group of 1500 {{properties}} in the area was given Conservation Area status, and Plumbe's northern section of the estate was granted Article Four Direction by Michael Heseltine, Secretary of State for the Environment, preventing any alterations to the external appearances of the properties without planning permission, in recognition of its architectural and historic interest. St Mark's Church was meanwhile Grade II listed. However, these measures have not been consistently enforced, and Noel Park has been cited in a report by English Heritage as a prominent example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of conservation areas.|$|E
5|$|In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> of the negotiations, {{the conspirators}} succeeded in overthrowing the {{democracy}} and imposing the oligarchic {{government of the}} Four Hundred, among the leaders of which were Phrynichus and Pisander. At Samos, however, a similar coup instigated by the conspirators did not go forward so smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians: the generals Leon and Diomedon, the trierarch Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a hoplite in the ranks. With the support of these men and the Athenian soldiers in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the 300 Samian oligarchs who attempted to seize power there. Further, the Athenian troops at Samos formed themselves into a political assembly, deposed their generals, and elected new ones, including Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus. The army, stating {{that they had not}} revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.|$|E
40|$|In the {{competitive}} environment, shipyards {{attempt to reduce}} failures in their production system {{in order to keep}} their com-petitive power. Failures cause some damages to the shipyard such as injuries, deaths and so on. Most of damages lead to <b>the</b> work loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shipyard.

STAe, having previously expressed doubts about returns on the project, in 1998 withdrew from the project out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure</b> between AIA and AVIC to reach an agreement; Airbus and AVIC would cancel the project in July that year.

5|$|New Zealand {{have won}} the World Cup three times, the only team to have done so. They beat France in {{the final of the}} 1987 inaugural {{competition}} held in New Zealand and Australia, defeated France again in the final of the 2011 tournament, also hosted in New Zealand, and most recently defeated Australia in England in 2015, making them the first and only team to win the World Cup in consecutive tournaments. In 1991, they lost their semi-final to Australia before winning the playoff for third. In 1995, they reached the final, before losing in extra time to hosts South Africa. They finished in fourth place in 1999, after losing their semi-final and then the third-place playoff game. In 2003, New Zealand were knocked out by hosts Australia in their semi-final, before finishing third. The 2007 World Cup saw their worst tournament, being knocked out in the quarterfinals by the host nation France; until this they were the only team to have reached the semifinals of every tournament. As a result of the poor performance in the 2007 World Cup the NZRU commissioned a 47-page report to detail the causes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure.</b> The All Blacks have never lost a World Cup pool match, and have finished top of their pool in all seven tournaments.|$|E
5|$|The failed {{offensive}} {{was investigated}} by the HV in 1991 and researched later by retired HV Brigadier Vlado Hodalj. He concluded that the offensive failed because of overall poor planning and preparation, specifically citing the lack of reconnaissance and reserves. Furthermore, Hodalj cited inadequate leadership by the Sisak OG as a cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>failure,</b> pointing to inaction in respect of the 10th Brigade's failure to advance and improper employment of the 2nd Guards Brigade in an auxiliary role, protecting the flank of an inexperienced brigade that was committed to the offensive with little, if any, training. Finally, the offensive itself had no clear goal. Croatian Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo also criticised the offensive as an unnecessary, purely tactical and politically counterproductive move, likely unauthorised by appropriate authorities.|$|E
