40|$|AbstractGPS {{measurements}} indicate rapid {{lateral extrusion}} of the NE Tibetan Plateau, which causes active NE-directed crustal shortening and has initiated <b>oblique</b> <b>shearing</b> along {{the margins of}} NE Tibet. However, the Tibetan highlands terminate around 103 °E longitude and topographic relief disappears to the northeast. The exact reasons for this drop in elevation remain obscure due to widespread Tertiary sediments and Quaternary loess, which obscure details of the lithospheric structure. This study describes a new 310 km-long deep seismic reflection line striking NE-SW across the interior of NE Tibet. Integrating its data with a previously described 165 km-long deep seismic profile of the Tibet–Ordos transition zone together, these datasets provide a complete picture of the crustal architecture of the north-easternmost Tibetan Plateau. Gravity anomaly and previous geological evidence also help constrain complex deformation pattern in the region. Interpretations of these patterns indicate {{the importance of the}} large-scale sinistral Haiyuan fault zone and inherited vertical variation in mechanical properties of the lithosphere in the overall tectonic evolution of the NE Tibetan Plateau. The overall crustal architecture obtained in this study provides spatial context for the neotectonic evolution of NE Tibet and helps constrain the interplay of geologic and geodynamic processes affecting NE Tibet and adjacent regions...|$|E
40|$|The Niğde Massif, at the {{southern}} tip of the Central Anatolian Crystalline Complex, consists of two structural units. Foliations in the lower unit define a dome cored by migmatites. The contact between the two units bears all the elements of a ductile to brittle extensional detachment. Hence the Niğde Massif represents an extensional metamorphic core complex. Top-to-NE/ENE shearing at higher levels of the lower unit relates to displacement along the detachment. Deeper levels of the lower unit display high-temperature top-to-SSW ductile shearing. The two shearing deformations show a difference in the mean trend of stretching lineations of up to 58 °. New 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages combined with previously published data enable us to infer that the two shears were contemporaneous. In our favored interpretation, <b>oblique</b> <b>shearing</b> in the core of the dome reflects lateral underflow, i. e., horizontal flowing of the lower crust in a direction highly oblique to the direction of extension. As a result of the interaction between lateral underflow and down-dip shearing along the overlying detachment, distinct structural domains are expected to exist within the migmatitic part of the core complex, with observed counterparts in the Niğde dome. Lateral underflow may reflect “inward ” flow on the scale of the core complex. Regional-scal...|$|E
40|$|Meta-sedimentary and {{igneous rocks}} {{preserved}} in the hanging wall of the Paralana Fault, northern Mount Painter Province, record a protracted (ca. 1600 Myr) multi-staged metamorphic and poly-deformational evolution related to Mesoproterozoic and Palaeozoic orogenic events. The Mount Painter Province was located near the margin of both the South Australian Craton and the North Australian Craton, which allows comparisons of the tectonic evolution of these margins and provides context {{for the evolution of}} the eastern Proterozoic Australia for both the Columbia and Gondwana supercontinents. Within the Mount Painter Province meta-sedimentary rocks form part of a basin system developed adjacent to the margins of the Gawler Craton and Curnamona Province following the Olarian-Wartakan orogenic system. Sedimentation was followed by ca. 1590 - 1552 Ma ductile deformation (D₁-D₃) at mid to upper crustal levels preserving a rapid (ca 6 Myr) burial and exhumation cycle. Initial deformation is characterised by the development of a layer parallel fabric (S₁). S₁ is overprinted by recumbent north-verging folds (F₂) formed during mid to upper amphibolite facies peak metamorphism (M₂), which are overprinted by tight, upright shallow NE-SW plunging folds (F₃). D₃ folds developed contemporaneous with sinistral <b>oblique</b> <b>shearing</b> and the development of proto-mylonitic to ultra-mylonitic fabrics along the Paralana Fault Zone. The timing of D₃ deformation is constrained by the development of a penetrative steeply dipping foliation (S₃) in the ca. 1585 - 1569 Ma shallowly emplaced Mount Neill Granite and relatively undeformed granites dated at ca. 1552 Ma. Further constraint on the absolute timing of Mesoproterozoic tectonism is provided through the dating of zircon growth from samples of the meta-sedimentary Radium Creek Metamorphics. This dating reveals a 1555 ± 16 Ma metamorphic event, interpreted to be the consequence of M₃ amphibolite facies, regional metamorphism and accompanying metasomatism. The transition between D₂ and D₃ is interpreted to reflect a shift from ca. 1591 - 1585 Ma N-S shortening to ca. 1585 - 1552 Ma NW-SE shortening. This episode of orogenesis is correlated with the ca. 1585 - 1540 Ma Kararan Orogeny in the northern Gawler Craton, which distinctly postdates the ca 1600 - 1590 Ma Olarian Orogeny as previously interpreted. The Mesoproterozoic structural architecture was reactivated during Neoproterozoic extension (D₄) and the ca. 500 Ma Delamerian Orogeny. Delamerian structures are formed in a predominantly brittle regime. Early thin-skinned thrusting was followed by thick-skinned deformation (D₅-D₆); during which open F₅ folds developed above oblique lateral ramps, and produced type 0 overprinting patterns with F₃ Mesoproterozoic folds. Steeply plunging F₆ buckle folds with SE-trending axial traces are the last phase of deformation recorded. Both Mesoproterozoic ductile deformation phases and the Palaeozoic ductile-brittle to brittle overprints were focussed along the Paralana Fault, emphasising the repeated long-lived evolution of this crustal scale fault system. 20 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Activation of motoneurons innervating leech muscles {{causes the}} {{appearance}} of a two-dimensional vector field of deformations on the skin surface that can be fully characterized using a new technique (Zoccolan et al., 2001) based on the computation of the optical flow, the two-dimensional vector field describing the point displacements on the skin. These vector fields are characterized by their origin (i. e., the singular point) and by four elementary components that combine linearly: expansion (or compression), rotation, longitudinal <b>shear,</b> and <b>oblique</b> <b>shear.</b> All motoneurons can be classified and recognized according to the components of the deformations they elicit: longitudinal motoneurons give rise almost exclusively to longitudinal negative shear, whereas circular motoneurons give rise to both positive longitudinal shear and significant negative expansion. Oblique motoneurons induce strong <b>oblique</b> <b>shear,</b> in addition to longitudinal shear and negative expansion. Vector fields induced by the contraction of longitudinal, circular, and oblique fibers superimpose linearly. Skin deformations can therefore be attributed rather reliably to the contraction of distinct longitudinal, circular, and oblique muscle fibers. We compared the deformation patterns produced by touching the skin with those produced by intracellular stimulation of P, T, and N cells: vector fields resulting from the activation of P cells were almost identical to those produced by mechanical stimulation. Therefore, motor responses triggered by light or moderate touch are almost entirely mediated by excitation of P cells, with minor contributions from T and N cells...|$|R

The felsic footwall is subject to a pronounced stretching lineation which increases in intensity to the north. The lineation orientation is a uniform 65 degrees toward 120 degrees. Approaching the CUU body, the lineation breaks down into a zone of heavy boudinage and <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> with a pronounced C-S shear fabric, especially in the remobilised massive sulfides and at {{the leading edge of the}} keel structure. This is interpreted to occur due to competency contrast between the felsic footwall and the ultramafic unit.|$|R
5000|$|In geology, transpression {{is a type}} of strike-slip {{deformation}} that deviates {{from simple}} shear because of a simultaneous component of shortening perpendicular to the fault plane. This movement ends up resulting in <b>oblique</b> <b>shear.</b> It is generally very unlikely that a deforming body will experience [...] "pure" [...] shortening or [...] "pure" [...] strike-slip. The relative amounts of shortening and strike-slip can be expressed in the convergence angle alpha which ranges from zero (ideal strike-slip) to 90 degrees (ideal convergence). During shortening, unless material is lost, transpression produces vertical thickening in the crust. Transpression that occurs on a regional scale along plate boundaries is characterized by oblique convergence. [...] More locally, transpression occurs within restraining bends in strike-slip fault zones.|$|R

40|$|A newly {{discovered}} northeast-trending subvertical shear zone, up to 3 kilometers wide, forms {{the backbone of}} the Virgin Mountains in southern Nevada. This zone, named for excellent exposure in Cabin Canyon, contains a well-developed mylonitic foliation that records a complex history of movement and strain within the Virgin Mountains. The overall movement history is interpreted to involve a combination of northwest shortening deformation and dextral, northwest-side-up, <b>oblique</b> <b>shear.</b> The mylonites within the zone are comprised of amphibolites, granodiorites, a variety of meta-sedimentary rocks, and leuco-pegmatite dikes. The oldest rocks involved in shearing are similar to ~ 1. 7 Ga of the Grand Canyon, but mylonitization is inferred to be ~ 1. 4 Ga based on relatively low temperature microstructures and similarity to other partitioned dextral/transpressive shear zones in northwestern Arizona. Mapping and microstructural analysis show that the dominant northeast-striking foliation (S 2) developed under relatively high temperatures within the upper amphibolite facies, likely at 1. 7 Ga. At a later time, likely 1. 4 Ga, these rocks underwent further shortening and <b>oblique</b> dextral <b>shear,</b> which boudinaged the amphibolites and original pegmatites causing dramatic grain size reduction (mylonitization). This transpressional deformation created sub-horizontal lineations and shear sense indicators such as delta and sigma porphyroclasts, shear bands, C-S fabrics, and bookshelf sliding. Pegmatites were intruded at various stages during mylonitization as shown by field relationships of folded pegmatites that have been cut by later pegmatite veins. These pegmatites were folded into tight and isoclinal folds via inhomogeneous shortening at a low metamorphic grade (< 500 degrees Celsius). Ultra-mylonites within the shear zone, which may represent high strain zones, have also been folded following shearing indicating continued transpression or a younger deformational event.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{inspections}} of buildings, {{it is common}} to find structures that, well before reaching its useful life longer require repairs and reinforcements. This study examined the bond strength between concrete of different ages and between steel and concrete, focusing on the recovery of reinforced concrete structures. To analyze the bond between concrete of different ages, trials with specimens receiving three different types of treatments at the interface between the concrete were performed: brushing; brushing and mortar equal to concrete of substrate and brushing and epoxy layer. Indirect tensile tests and <b>oblique</b> and vertical <b>shear</b> tests at the interface were made. The bond stress between steel and concrete was evaluated by pull out test under the conditions of the bar inserted in the still fresh concrete and when inserted in the hardened concrete with epoxy. Results showed increased bond strength by indirect tensile stress of 15 % and 37 %; 4 % and 12 % for the adherence test by <b>oblique</b> <b>shear,</b> and 108 % and 178 %, for the testing of vertical shear, respectively, for the specimens whose interfaces have received, in addition to brushing, layer of mortar and epoxy bridge, compared to those who received only brushing.

40|$|International audienceWe {{focus on}} the Iberian-European plate {{boundary}} (IEPB), whose nature, age, and evolution are strongly debated. In contrast to previous interpretations of the IEPB as a major lithospheric-scale left-lateral strike-slip fault, we propose a more complex deformation history. The mapping of rift domains at the transition between Iberia and Europe emphasizes the existence of spatially disconnected rift systems. Based on their restoration, we suggest that the deformation was partitioned between a set of distinct left-lateral transtensional rift systems from the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. A plate kinematic reorganization at Aptian-Albian time resulted in the onset of sea-floor spreading in the western Bay of Biscay and extreme crustal and lithosphere thinning in intra-continental rift basins to the east. The formation and reactivation of the IEPB is interpreted {{as the result of}} the polyphase evolution of a diffuse transient plate boundary that failed to localize. The results of this work may provide new insights on (1) processes preceding breakup and the initiation of segmented and strongly <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> margins, (2) the deformation history of nascent divergent plate boundaries, and (3) the kinematics of the southern North Atlantic and Alpine domain in western Europe...|$|R
30|$|We thus {{conclude}} that slip partitioning {{occurred during the}} 2016 Kumamoto earthquake. The term “slip partitioning” is used to describe oblique motion along a fault system that is accommodated on two or more faults with different mechanisms (Fitch 1972; McCaffrey 1992; Jones and Wesnousky 1992; Bowman et al. 2003). Slip partitioning is observed {{at a variety of}} scales. For example, Fitch (1972) observed that larger-scale (over 100  km) slip partitioning occurs along subduction systems. As shown in Fig.  1 a, an oblique subduction of the Philippine Sea plate underneath southwest Japan is accommodated not only by the megathrust earthquakes along the Nankai Trough but also by right-lateral slip along the Median Tectonic Line (MTL) active fault system. The separation distance between the Nankai Trough and the MTL is over 100  km, which is comparable with depth of the upper mantle and the thickness of the plate. Partitioned slip separated by several tens of kilometer distance was explained by deeper oblique driving motion in viscous lower crust (Bowman et al. 2003). Slip partitioning could be explained as a result of upward propagation of <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> at depth. The authors validated the model by applying it to parts of the San Andreas and Haiyuan faults.|$|R
40|$|The Separation Point Batholith is a late Cretaceous {{granitic}} intrusion outcropping in the north-west Nelson {{region of}} New Zealand. The batholith is elongate, oriented north / south, and stitches the Paleozoic Takaka Terrane to the arc-derived Median Tectonic Zone. It {{has been found}} to be related geochemically to high-Al trondhjemite-tonalite-dacite suites, and hence to be related to the Western Fiordland Orthogneiss. This study investigates the structural features of the northern segment of the Separation Point Batholith where they are exposed along the coastline of the Abel Tasman National Park. Extensive measurements of the pervasive foliation and lineation indicate a consistent planar structure dipping moderately to steeply to the east, and a linear structure plunging gently to the north-east. Jointing systems are approximately consistent with this structure. The western margin is marked by a zone of intense strain, also producing structures dipping steeply to the east, and by the mixing of granitic and dioritic magmas. A model for the emplacement of the Separation Point Batholith has been developed based upon tectonic reconstructions for magma genesis and later post-compressional events. The batholith was emplaced in an active tectonic environment under a transpressional regime, along a major north-south striking <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> zone with dextral strike-slip and east-over-west thrusting.

40|$|The Belluno {{syncline}} is {{a structure}} {{located in the}} Venetian fold-and-thrust belt in the Italian Southern Alps. This SSE-vergent chain mainly developed during the Neogene as a back-thrust belt of the Alps deforming the northern margin of the Adria plate. The syncline is asymmetric in shape, with a steep backlimb, as the forelimb of the paired Monte Coppolo Anticline; it {{is the result of}} fault-propagation folding during the development of the underlying Belluno thrust. In plan view the Belluno thrust shows a prominent curvature interpreted as reactivation of inherited Mesozoic extensional structures. The hinge of the Belluno syncline presents a similar curvature. Rocks cropping out in the syncline core are Upper Chattian to Langhian fine-grained molassic sediments, mainly siltstones and marls. Most fractures on the Belluno syncline have formed at high angles to bedding. The dominant fracture trends are subparaUel and orthogonal to the fold hinge. Sometimes these fractures show plumose structures revealing extension (Mode I) fracture mechanism and therefore they are referred to as longitudinal (bc) joints and cross (ac) joints respectively. Other fracture trends oblique to the hinge line are found in measurement stations located on limbs distant from the fold hinge. They are referred to as <b>oblique</b> (<b>shear)</b> fractures.

40|$|The Cenozoic Dali Basin, {{located at}} the {{northeast}} of Diancang Shan {{and south of the}} first bend of Yangtze River, is tectonically controlled by the Dali fault system in the southeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The basin is filled with late Miocene to Pleistocene fluviolacustrine sediments, which provide invaluable information about the tectonic deformation and drainage network reorganization in this area. In this study, we discuss the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) of the Dasongping section in the Dali Basin, which spans an interval from 7. 6 to 1. 8 Ma. Although rock magnetic experiments indicate that magnetite and hematite are the main remanence carriers, hysteresis loops, low values of bulk susceptibility and low temperature susceptibility suggest that paramagnetic minerals are major contributors to low-field AMS. The rock magnetic parameters indicate that the Dali Basin experienced four stages of infilling and the sediment sources may have changed at 4. 2 Ma. The clustering of the minimum principle axes (Kmin) nearly perpendicular to the bedding plane and the pronounced N–S magnetic lineation parallel to the bedding plane indicate that the AMS of the Dali Basin is a superimposed fabric consisting of a sedimentary-compaction and a mild initial deformation overprint. The well-defined N–S magnetic lineation is likely due to the NNW and NNE <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> caused by the Heqing and Red River faults...|$|R

With cessation or relaxation of the compression batholiths, plutons and porphyritic stocks, dykes and sills of granite to granodiorite composition intruded the folded greenstone sequence and broad contact metamorphic aureoles were formed. A period of vertically oriented, maximum compressive stress (Dn) succeeded the intrusive event.

Eighty posts were submitted to mechanical cycling (3 x 10 (6) cycles; inclination: 45 degrees; load: 50 N; frequency: 4 Hz; temperature: 37 degrees C) to assess the surviving under intermittent loading and other eighty posts were submitted to fracture resistance testing (resistance [N] and shear-stress [MPa] values were obtained). The eight posts types were 3 D modeled (Rhinoceros 4. 0) and the shear-stress (MPa) evaluated using FEA (Ansys 13. 0). One-way ANOVA showed statistically differences to fracture resistance (DT 2. 2 W and DT 2. 2 showed higher values) and shear stress values (DT 1. 4 showed lower values). Only the DT 1. 4 fiber posts failed after mechanical cycling. FEA showed similar values of shear stress between the groups and these values {{were similar to those}} obtained by shear stress testing.

40|$|The {{development}} of the 2004 - 05 eruption at Etna (Italy) is investigated by means of field surveys, to define the current structural state of the volcano. In 2004 - 05, a fracture swarm, associated with 3 effusive vents, propagated downslope from the SE summit crater towards SE. Such a scenario is commonly observed at Etna, as a pressure increase within the central conduits induces the lateral propagation {{of most of the}} dikes downslope. Nevertheless, some unusual features of this eruption (slower propagation of fractures, lack of explosive activity and seismicity, <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> along the fractures) suggest a more complex triggering mechanism. A detailed review of the recent activity at Etna enables us to better define this possible mechanism. In fact the NW-SE trending fractures formed in 2004 - 05 constitute the south-eastern continuation of a N-S trending fracture system which started to develop in early 1998, to the east of the summit craters. The overall 1998 - 2005 deformation pattern forms therefore an arcuate feature, whose geometry and kinematics are consistent with the head of a shallow flank deformation on the E summit of Etna. Similar deformation patterns have also been observed in analogue models of deforming volcanic cones. In this frame, the 2004 - 05 eruption was possibly induced by a dike resulting from the intersection of this incipient fracture system with the SE Crater. A significant acceleration of this flank deformation may be induced by any magmatic involvement. The central conduit of the volcano is presently open, constantly buffering any increase in magmatic pressure and any hazardous consequence can be expected to be limited. A more hazardous scenario may be considered with a partial or total closing of the central conduit. In this case, magmatic overpressure within the central conduit may enhance the collapse of the upper eastern flank, triggering an explosive eruption associated with a landslide reaching the eastern lower slope of the volcano...|$|R

40|$|Two {{examples}} of en echelon mining-induced fractures seen in hard-rock mines provided {{a basis for}} inferring that fracture zones and bedding plane separations immediately surrounding mine openings are promoted by <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> into the openings. It is hypothesized that initial fractures or separations form {{at the corners of}} openings as a result of high stress and physical constraint on the rock's ability to deform elastically toward the opening. These conditions result in a locally preferred direction of shearing. The shearing, in turn, generates tensile stress that initiates a progression of systematically offset fractures approximately parallel to the direction of greatest compressive stress. The fractures or bedding separations create tabular rock layers that amplify shearing displacement through bending and dilation. Such shearing effectively reduces and redistributes the compressive stress, but significant dilation is an inevitable consequence. The combination of dilation and shearing and the progressive development of fracture zones have important implications with respect to ground support. The concept of mining-induced fractures forming as a result of shear is illustrated by two examples from coal mines. First, fractures seen at longwall faces probably result from shear associated with subsidence. The fracture zone that develops approximates or possibly defines the draw angle of subsidence. As the face advances, fractures extend downward along the lower edge of the fracture zone, while upper extensions of the fractures are pressed closed. Fracture zones in entry roofs provide a second practical example. Here, mining-induced fractures typically follow bedding planes. The shear zone model suggests that the first bedding separations develop near the edges of the roof and successive separations progress upward and toward the center. However, if the direction of greatest stress is inclined with respect to the roof, a fracture or bedding separation zone may propagate from one side only and also extend higher. Because coal ahead of the face provides some support against lateral shear deformation, bedding separation is inhibited near the face. Rock bolts installed close to the face ultimately become more strained and bent than bolts installed a few meters from the face, and bolts installed through the more remote part of a separation zone may ultimately experience the greatest tensile and bending strains. This model is supported by field data documenting progressive bolt failures that rapidly propagated downward across the roof during face advance...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{traverses}} have been undertaken across a ca. 45 km {{section of the}} north-south oriented eastern margin of the Tanzanian Craton between Dodoma and Mpwapwa, Central Tanzania. The boundary is a SE-dipping zone of high strain between about 1 and 2 km wide. The rocks of the eastern craton are uniformly composed of coarse-grained, grey, migmatised granodiorite gneisses which are heterogeneous at outcrop scale but are regionally homogeneous. The orthogneisses have no regionally consistent fabric and foliations are variably oriented at outcrop scale. However, there is a gradual increase in strain eastwards towards {{the edge of the}} craton, manifest as an increasingly strong, regionally consistent, E to SE-dipping foliation. This strain increase eventually leads to mylonitic and porphyroclastic planar fabrics and strong, uniformly SE-plunging, linear fabrics. In most structural domains planar fabrics are predominant, but these alternate with minor domains dominated by linear fabrics, with fold mullions locally developed. The kinematics of the high-strain mylonites show a consistent, top-to-the-NW (oblique) sense of movement. The frontal thrust zone grades laterally into steep sinistral and dextral <b>oblique</b> strike-slip <b>shear</b> zones to the north and south respectively. The contact is a single wide deformation zone in the northern and southern segments of the study area, with a more complex imbricate belt in the central part. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} my Ph. D. {{project is the}} study of the neural coding of sensory-motor {{responses}} in the leech Hirudo Medicinalis. I have used a combination of multielectrode recordings, videomicroscopy and computer vision methods to quantify the leech behavior and simultaneously measure its underlying neuronal activity. Based on this experimental approach, I was able to characterize the motor pattern underlying reflexive behavior in the leech, addressing fundamental issues of systems neuroscience such as population coding and distributed organization of motor responses. In this context, the specific aims of my Ph. D. project can be summarized in three main goals: 1) to develop a new method to quantify the two-dimensional pattern of defmmation induced by muscle contraction on the leech body wall; 2) to investigate the distributed organization of leech reflexive behavior at the level of recruitment and activation of specific classes of motoneurons and muscle fibers; 3) to understand the neural basis of the reliability of leech motor responses, by quantifying their reproducibility at different levels of neural processing. In this scheme, the accomplishment of a specific aim was the starting point to address the next one. Quantitative analysis of defommtion occurring on leech body-wall was the necessary backdrop for characterizing leech sensory-motor responses at the behavioral level. This quantitative analysis of behavior, in tum, was fundamental for comparing reproducibility of leech motor responses with that of neural firing sustaining them. In the following paragraphs, I will summarize the major achievements of my Ph. D. project in relation to established main goals. The first aim of my research was to develop a reliable and innovative method to quantify the pattern of deformation that muscle contraction induces on the leech body-wall. Muscle contraction is usually measured and characterized with force and displacement transducers. The contraction of muscle fibers, however, evokes in the tissue a two and even three-dimensional displacement field, which is not properly quantified by these transducers because they provide just a single scalar quantity. I circumvented this problem by using videomicroscopy and standard tools of computer vision developed for the analysis of time varying image sequences. By computing the so called optical flow, i. e. the apparent motion of points in a time varying image sequence, it is possible to recover a two dimensional motion field, describing rather precisely the displacement caused by muscle contraction in a flattened piece of skin. The obtained two dimensional optical flow can be further analyzed by computing its migin (i. e. the singular point) and four elementary components that combine linearly: expansion, rotation, longitudinal <b>shear</b> and <b>oblique</b> <b>shear.</b> These elementary deformations provide a compact and accurate characterization of the contraction induced by different motoneurons. I demonstrated this technique by analyzing the displacement caused by muscle contraction on the leech body-wall. However, this method can be applied to monitor and characterize all contractions in almost flat tissues with enough visual texture. The second aim of my Ph. D. project was to apply the method described above in order to characterize the pattern of activation of different classes of motoneurons and muscles during leech reflexive behavior. Activation of motoneurons innervating leech muscles causes the appearance of a two dimensional vector field of deformations on the skin surface that can be fully characterized by computing the optical flow. I found that all motoneurons can be classified and recognized according to the elementary deformations of the contractions they elicit: longitudinal motoneurons give rise almost exclusively to longitudinal negative shear, whereas circular motoneurons give rise to both positive longitudinal shear and significant negative expansion. Oblique motoneurons induce strong <b>oblique</b> <b>shear,</b> in addition to longihidinal shear and negative expansion. These results clearly showed that contractions induced by different classes of motoneurons and muscle fibers form a set of basic behavioral units. I also investigated the way in which such behavioral units can combine to sustain motor responses and I found that optical flows induced by the contraction of longitudinal, circular and oblique fibers superimpose linearly. Complex patterns of skin deformation induced by mechanosensory stimulation can therefore be attributed rather reliably to the contraction of distinct longitudinal, circular and oblique muscle fibers. Based on this conclusion, I found that local bending, a motor response caused by local mechanical stimulation of the leech skin, is sustained by coactivation of two distinct classes of motoneurons: circular and longitudinal. I also compared the pattern of deformation produced by local bending with that produced by intracellular stimulation of mechanosensory pressure (P), touch (T) and nociceptive (N) cells: optical flows resulting from the activation of P cells were almost identical to those produced by mechanical stimulation. This confirmed that local bending is almost entirely mediated by excitation of P cells, with minor contributions from T and N cells. In conclusion, these results revealed the distributed nature of leech reflexive behavior at the level of muscle activation and motoneuron recruitment, showing that complex motor responses result from the linear sum of a small number of basic patterns of deformation. The final step in investigating distributed motor behavior in the leech was to characterize the reproducibility of local bending and that of neural firing sustaining it. I analyzed variability at different levels of processing: mechanosensory neurons, motoneurons, muscle activation and behavior. I found that spike trains in mechanosensory neurons were very reproducible, unlike those in motoneurons. However, the motor response was much more reproducible than the firing of individual motoneurons sustaining it. I showed that this reliability of the behavior is obtained by two distinct biophysical mechanisms: temporal and ensemble averaging. The former is guaranteed by the low pass filtering properties of the leech muscles that contract very slowly and therefore are poorly sensitive to the jitter of motoneuron spikes. The latter is provided by the coactivation of a population of motoneurons, firing in a statistically independent way. This statistical independence reduces the vm ability of the population firing. These results have a general significance, because they show that reproducible spike trains are not required to sustain reproducible behaviors and illustrate how the nervous system can cope with umeliable components to produce reliable action...|$|R
40|$|Feature mapping {{presents}} {{us with a}} novel {{philosophy in}} ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation that utilizes maximum information from different data acquisition and signal feature domains for possible complete material characterization and defect analysis {{in a variety of}} different materials and structures. Feature mapping is a powerful technique that covers a wide area of data acquisition and analysis techniques applying both physically and statistically based principles. This procedure, beyond standard normal beam applications, employs many seldom used but interesting data collection procedures such as critical angles, surface waves, plate waves and backscattering techniques. It forms these into an extremely versatile data acquisition protocol, followed by detailed analysis through a state of the technology signal processing, pattern recognition and expert system and /or artificial intelligence implementation practice. This Paper explains the various existing possibilities for clever physically based data collection, and the types of feature domains and features available for anomaly representation in materials. Typical results are discussed to illustrate the capabilities and utilities of the feature mapping techniques, including a normal beam longitudinal wave high frequency area ratio feature mapping (F-map) system, <b>oblique</b> incidence <b>shear</b> wave amplitude F-maps, and plate leaky wave amplitude F-map results for interfacial weakness in an adhesive bond structure. Also discussed are the results from a normal beam longitudinal wave amplitude and frequency bandwidth F-map for crack detection in a composite material, as well as a backscattered energy F-map for defect edge detection in composite materials...|$|R
40|$|A unified phenomenological {{framework}} is proposed for fracturing phenomena in pre-cracked brittle materials. The {{framework is}} developed based on experimental observations from gypsum specimens loaded in uniaxial compression, with either open or closed (frictional) pre-existing discontinuities (flaws). The existing database that included observations from open flaws {{has been completed}} with an extensive series of laboratory experiments on gypsum specimens with three closed flaws. ^ Similar types of cracks and coalescence patterns are observed in specimens with open or closed cracks. Three types of cracks can occur: wing cracks, coplanar, and oblique secondary cracks. Wing cracks are tensile cracks that initiate {{at or near the}} tips of the flaws, are stable, and propagate in the direction of maximum compression. Secondary cracks are shear cracks. They are initially stable but may become unstable near coalescence. Coalescence is produced by the linkage of two flaws through wing cracks, secondary cracks, or a combination of wing and secondary cracks. When coalescence occurs through wing cracks only or through a combination of wing and secondary cracks, the process is stable. When coalescence occurs through secondary cracks only, the phenomenon is unstable. Seven types of coalescence have been identified based on the types of cracks that produce linkage of the flaws. The types of coalescence are related to the distribution of the flaws. In left stepping geometries coalescence generally involves wing cracks and/or coplanar shear cracks, while right stepping geometries tend to favor coalescence through wing cracks and/or <b>oblique</b> <b>shear</b> cracks. The laboratory experiments show that coalescence through wing cracks takes precedence. When this type of coalescence is not possible, the mechanism that takes priority is a combination of shear and tensile cracks. The last priority is for coalescence through shear cracks only. Thus coalescence stresses are the smallest when the linkage is through wing cracks and they are the largest when the linkage is through shear cracks only. The principal difference between experimental results from open and closed flaws is that initiation and coalescence stresses are higher for closed flaws than for open flaws. This is due to the friction along the closed flaws, which must be overcome before a crack can initiate and by the capability of closed flaws of transmitting normal stresses. ^ A new crack initiation criterion has been proposed based on the critical energy release rate. The criterion states that a tensile crack will initiate when the mode I energy release rate reaches the critical energy release rate GIC, which is material dependent, and along the direction where the energy release rate is maximum. An analogous criterion applies for shear cracks, where initiation occurs when the mode II energy release rate reaches the critical value GIIC, also a material property. The criterion has been implemented into the code FROCK. Comparisons between predictions from the code and experiments show that the criterion is able to predict initiation of the wing cracks and of the two types of secondary cracks, as well as the types of coalescence. Initiation stresses and angles are simulated within experimental results. The types of coalescence are predicted well for open flaws with left stepping geometries, while larger differences are observed for closed flaws and in particular for right stepping geometries. ...|$|R

Orogen-normal compression was the final mechanism for deep burial and attainment of peak metamorphic conditions (500 - 680 °C at 6. 5 - 10. 3 kbar) of the study area between 91 - 86 Ma.

This also allows for direct calcula-tion of the components of the group velocity and the energy-flux vectors as functions of frequency and wave-vector components over an entire frequency band. The general results are illustrated using a two-phase and a three-phase unit cell with piecewise constant properties. It is shown that the directions of the group-velocity and energy-flux vectors are essentially indistinguishable for this class of problems, and that both the two-phase and the three-phase unit cells can display negative refraction on their second frequency pass-band, where the phase and group velocities are antiparallel (backward waves).

40|$|New U-Pb zircon SHRIMP {{dates are}} {{presented}} for two critical meta-igneous rock units from the Scottburgh area, central Mzumbe Terrane, Natal Sector of the Namaqua-Natal Metamorphic Province (“Natal belt”). A {{sample of the}} oldest syntectonic granitic orthogneisses of the Mzumbe Terrane, the Mzimlilo Granite, gave a date of 1147 ± 8 Ma. This is interpreted to represent the crystallisation age and thus gives a reliable minimum estimate {{of the age of}} the first, collision-related tectono-metamorphic episode (D 1) in the Mzumbe Terrane. The date is younger than the earliest foliation in the Tugela Terrane to the north, but is in accordance with previous Ar-Ar dating of shear zones in that terrane. This implies that the early fabrics in the Tugela Terrane were rejuvenated at this time. Magmatic zircons from melanorite of the Equeefa Suite provided a SHRIMP crystallisation date of 1083 ± 6 Ma. The Equeefa Suite comprises a large mafic-ultramafic body west of Scottburgh, associated with a swarm of deformed mafic (amphibolitic) dykes. The suite forms a valuable time marker, having been emplaced after D 1 but during {{the early stages of the}} major, long-lived <b>oblique</b> sinistral <b>shearing</b> episode, which led to the final juxtaposition of the Mzumbe and Margate Terranes. This event has been dated between ca. 1. 05 and 1. 0 Ga from previous studies. The Equeefa date is thus consistent with the previous data and defines a period of possible crustal extension between the major tectono-thermal events. Both dates obtained provide important constraints on tectono-magmatic events in this part of the Natal Belt and are consistent with previous data...|$|R

The resulting computational method yields the composite's frequency band structure and the associated mode shapes, in terms of the wave-vector components for any desired number of frequency bands. The general results are illustrated using a two-phase and a three-phase unit cell with piecewise constant properties. It is shown that on their second frequency pass-bands, only the components of the phase and group velocities normal to the layers are antiparallel, while the components along the layers are parallel. Therefore, both the two-phase and the three-phase composites display negative energy refraction with positive phase-velocity refraction and positive phase-velocity refraction with negative energy refraction, depending on how the composite is interfaced with a homogeneous solid.
