5|$|The {{indwelling}} cannula: Outside of the United States, many piercers use {{a needle}} containing a cannula (or catheter), a hollow plastic tube {{placed at the}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needle.</b> In some countries, the piercing needle favoured in the United States {{is regarded as a}} medical device and is illegal for body piercers. The procedure is similar to the piercing needle method, but the initial jewellery is inserted {{into the back of the}} cannula and the cannula and the jewellery are then pulled through the piercing. More bleeding may follow, as the piercing is larger than the jewellery.|$|E
5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight needles are useful for many body parts, curved needles are manufactured for areas where straight needles are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner needles. The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needle.</b> Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Brachytherapy (BT) is a {{modality}} {{to treat}} cancer by inserting needles into {{a patient to}} deliver radioactive sources direct to the diseased tissue. <b>The</b> efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treatment is determined by <b>the</b> positions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needles.</b> A robot {{can be used in}} order to increase <b>the</b> precision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needles</b> locations. This paper presents an approach for needle trajectory planning based on isomorphic mapping from a haptic device. A virtual reality environment has been modelled containing a 3 D reconstructed abdominal model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient. <b>Needle</b> insertion using <b>the</b> BT robot is controlled using a Force Dimension Omega haptic device.

40|$|Background: Acupuncture {{involves}} puncturing {{the skin}} with thin sterile needles at defined acupuncture points. Previous studies are inconclusive regarding <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> acupuncture on labour pain, but {{some studies have}} found a reduction in <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> pharmacological pain relief when acupuncture is administered. <b>The</b> appropriate dose <b>of</b> acupuncture treatment required to elicit a potential effect on labour pain has not been fully explored. The dose is determined by many different factors, including <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>needles</b> used and <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stimulation. In Sweden, manual stimulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needles</b> is common practice when acupuncture is used for labour pain, but electrical stimulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needles,</b> which gives a higher dose, could possibly be more effective. <b>The</b> overall aim <b>of</b> this thesis was to evaluate <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> acupuncture with manual stimulation (MA) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needles</b> as well as acupuncture {{with a combination of}} manual and electrical stimulation (EA) in reducing labou...|$|R

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol and puts a mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> after the piercing process, and protect the tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needle,</b> to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|E

40|$|Two-year-old {{seedlings}} of Norway spruce (Picea abies) {{during spring}} deacclimation {{were subjected to}} controlled reacclimation by exposure to low temperatures of 4 /− 3 °C (day/night) in a cold room. The highest increase in freezing tolerance (by 7 °C) was observed after 12 d of low temperature exposure, when shoot water potential (Ψ w shoot) decreased to 0. 64 MPa. <b>The</b> process <b>of</b> reacclimation was accompanied {{by an increase in}} <b>the</b> phospholipid content <b>of</b> <b>needle</b> cell membranes. This increase applied to total (PL) and individual phospholipids: phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidic acid (PA). After being exposed to the low temperature for 18 d, the seedlings were moved into the open air. This caused deacclimation, with an increase in Ψ w shoot to − 0. 36 MPa and a decrease in the total phospholipid content and freezing tolerance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needles.</b> Significant correlations were observed between freezing tolerance, the membrane permeability (MP) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needles</b> and <b>the</b> phospholipid content, Ψ w shoot and water content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needles.</b> <b>The</b> results show that during spring deacclimation, Norway spruce seedlings can be subjected to reacclimation, which is reflected in the phospholipid content, <b>the</b> biophysical changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> membranes, and <b>the</b> freezing tolerance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seedlings.

25|$|Notwithstanding the {{categorical}} {{assertion of}} a purely British origin, there is solid {{evidence of a}} connection between French tambour embroidery and crochet. The former method of production was illustrated in detail in 1763 in Diderot's Encyclopedia. The tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> shown there is indistinguishable {{from that of a}} present-day inline crochet hook and the chain stitch separated from a cloth support is a fundamental element of the latter technique. The 1823 Penélopé instructions unequivocally state that the tambour tool was used for crochet and the first of the 1840s instruction books uses the terms tambour and crochet as synonyms. This equivalence is retained in the 4th edition of that work, 1847.|$|E
25|$|A {{peripheral}} cannula is {{the most}} common intravenous access method utilized in both hospitals and pre-hospital services. A peripheral IV line (PVC or PIV) consists of a short catheter (a few centimeters long) inserted through the skin into a peripheral vein (any vein not situated in the chest or abdomen). This is usually {{in the form of a}} cannula-over-needle device, in which a flexible plastic cannula comes mounted over a metal trocar. Once the tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> and cannula are introduced into the vein via venipuncture, the cannula is advanced inside the vein over the trocar to the appropriate position and secured, the trocar is then withdrawn and discarded. Blood samples may be drawn directly after the initial IV cannula insertion.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{mechanism}} of stimulation of acupuncture points employs {{penetration of the}} skin by thin metal needles, which are manipulated manually or the needle may be further stimulated by electrical stimulation (electroacupuncture). Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel, making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking. Needles are usually disposed of after each use to prevent contamination. Reusable needles when used should be sterilized between applications. Needles vary in length between , with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needles in areas with thicker tissues; needle diameters vary from 0 to 0, with thicker needles used on more robust patients. Thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion. The tip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage, although blunt needles cause more pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{clothing}} industry in New York City was staffed by many immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Historian Witold Kula {{found that many}} Jewish immigrants, and to a much lesser extent, Italians, were identified upon their arrival to the United States as having work background as tailors {{even if they did}} not. Kula identified several letters written by Jewish immigrants back to their families in Poland indicating that they were just learning the trade, when in fact, they had papers stating that it was their native profession. The new immigrants generally did not speak English nor did the immigration agents speak any Polish, Yiddish, or Italian. Kula suggests that the Immigration agents were influenced by the demands of the workforce and essentially staffed the industries based on their expectations of each ethnic group. By 1912, the needle trades were the largest employer of Polish Jews in the United States, and 85% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> trade employees were Eastern European Jews.|$|E

500|$|This {{system was}} {{developed}} to replace the failing multi-wire telegraph on the Paddington to West Drayton line. [...] It required only two wires, but a more complex code and slower transmission speed. [...] Whereas the two-needle system needed a three-unit code (that is, up to three movements of the needles to represent each letter), the one-needle system used a four-unit code, but had enough codes to encode the entire alphabet. [...] Like the preceding two-needle system, the code units consisted of rapid deflections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>needle</b> to either left or right in quick succession. [...] The needle struck a post when it moved causing it to ring. [...] Different tones were provided for {{the left and right}} movements so that the operator could hear which direction the needle had moved without looking at it.|$|E
