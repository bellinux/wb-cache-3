50|$|The {{existing}} and defined biosimilar pathway, {{taking into consideration}} the complexity of biologics and its follow-on products, is neither applicable for NBCDs and its similars. Since NBCDs are by definition not biologicals but are rather synthetic. However, basic principles {{can be used for}} an NBCD similar evaluation. Since the NBCD follow-on versions are not identical but only similar to the <b>originator</b> <b>product,</b> they are never the same as it is with generic small molecule products. NBCDs and their similars containing nanoparticulate can also be referred to as nanosimilars (see figure 1). A stepwise quality, non-clinical and clinical approach is suggested for market approval of NBCD nanosimilars and to show comparability. There is a lack of non-clinical models to test such products like e.g. the rodent approach addressed by EMA in their reference paper for the NBCDs iron sucrose and its similars. Recently, the hatching egg model was used as an alternative model to study time-dependent iron concentrations in heart and liver avian tissues for various intravenous iron complexes applied in equimolar doses. Such models need in-depth evaluation and validation to demonstrate robustness and to further define potential use in an evaluation and comparison testing. When evaluated similar enough, the challenge then still is to define to either use them as a therapeutic alternative or as an equivalent product and if at the end the follow-on version can substitute the reference product or can be interchanged which also needs head-to-head comparisons in patients to prove therapeutic equivalence and comparable safety.|$|E
30|$|Similarities of the {{dissolution}} profiles with the corresponding <b>originator</b> <b>product</b> obtained during the QRED program were also examined for formulations {{listed in the}} Japanese Orange Book.

The use of two profiles is to account for possible changes occurring in the <b>originator</b> <b>product</b> profiles. Some generic formulations developed after the QRED program confirmed BE with the <b>originator</b> <b>product</b> in the different dissolution profiles. Thus, the Committee is now discussing ways to confirm consistency of {{the dissolution}} behavior within the development batch (i.e., biobatch).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} extent of competition between generic products and therapeutic substitutes under different regulatory regimes in the European Union (EU) pharmaceutical industry. In particular, this study investigates generic competition among the five largest European pharmaceutical markets; the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, with comprehensive IMS data for 10 years (1994 - 2003), in order to estimate the effect of generic entry on drug prices at the product level. This analysis finds that generic entry has a negative effect on prices in countries with free pricing originator market, whereas in EU countries with strict price and reimbursement regulation, generic competition is ineffective and/or counterproductive. Fewer generics and less competitive late entrants are consistent with incentives in regulated environments: low regulated prices for <b>originator</b> <b>products</b> discourage generic entry following patent expiration.

40|$|AbstractThe WHO {{guidelines}} on evaluating similar biotherapeutic products (SBPs) were {{adopted by the}} Expert Committee on Biological Standardization in 2009.

In view of these, the products which have not been subjected to a head to head comparison with the RBP should be referred to as another term, e. g. ‘non-innovator’ therapeutic products. In order to review the current situation in each country, a survey was planned in line with the implementation workshop of the guidelines in August 2010. The results show that the diversity of regulatory framework for licensing SBPs and the ambiguous use of the terms, ‘similar’ or ‘generic’, present considerable challenges for the future use of SBPs...|$|R

Policies implemented in the countries with a high rate of generic drug use, such as Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, are reviewed, with consideration of the market structures that facilitate strong competition. Savings in these countries are realized through increases in the volume of generic drugs used and the frequently significant differences in the price between generic medicines and branded originator medicines. Their policy tools include the mix of supply-side measures and demand-side measures that are relevant for generic promotion and higher generic use. On the supply-side, key policy measures include generic drug marketing regulation that facilitates market entry soon after patent expiry, reference pricing, the pricing of branded <b>originator</b> <b>products,</b> and the degree of price competition in pharmaceuticalmarkets. Onthe demand-side, measures typically encompass influencing prescribing and dispensing patterns as well as introducing a co-payment structure for consumers/ patients that takes into consideration the difference in cost between branded and generic medicines.

40|$|Introduction: Switching from <b>originator</b> <b>products</b> to generic {{equivalents}} {{is a key}} {{method used}} by governments to reduce costs and keep their healthcare systems sustainable. The aim {{of this article is}} to review generic medicine pricing in Europe by analysing the factors that influence them. Methods: The literature review focused on selected studies that highlighted generic medicine pricing in ambulatory care in Europe. PubMed, the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination databases, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and EconLit were searched up to August 2011. Search terms included, ‘pharmaceuticals’, ‘generic medicines’, ‘Europe’, ‘pricing’, ‘discount’, and ‘rebate’. Bibliographies of included studies were checked for relevant studies and the status of generic medicines pricing in Europe was also documented via accessing the European Generic medicines Association market survey. Results: Ex-manufacturer prices for generic medicines were found to vary substantially between European countries, which suggests that pricing not only reflects production costs, but is also influenced by the domestic regulatory environment. The penetration of generic medicines is more successful in countries that permit free pricing of medicines than in those that have price regulation. Although tendering systems may reduce (generic) medicine prices in the short term, little is known about the overall long-term impact of such systems. Conclusion: No single approach towards developing generic medicine pricing policies and attaining cost savings was evident...|$|R

MethodsEx-factory price data as of December 2012 from New Zealand and 16 European countries were compared for {{a basket of}} 14 medicines, {{most of which were}} at least partially funded by the state in the 17 countries. Five medicines had, at least in some countries, generic versions on the market whose prices were also analyzed. Medicine price data for the 16 European countries were provided by the Pharma Price Information service. New Zealand medicine prices were retrieved from the New Zealand Pharmaceutical Schedule. Unit prices converted into euro were compared at the ex-factory price level. ResultsFor the 14 medicines surveyed, considerable price differences at the ex-factory price level were identified. Within the European countries, prices in Greece, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Spain ranked at the lower end, whereas prices in Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden were at the upper end. The results for New Zealand compared with Europe were variable. New Zealand prices were found in the lowest quartile for five medicines and in the highest quartile for seven other products. Price differences between the <b>originator</b> <b>products</b> and generic versions ranged from 0 % to 90 % depending on the medicine and the country.

In a context of scarce resources, doctors are required to take opportunity cost into account when prescribing treatments, while cost containment policies cannot overlook their active role in determining health care resource allocation. This paper addresses this issue, investigating the effects of cost containment measures in the market of biosimilar drugs that represent a viable and cost-saving strategy for the reduction of health care expenditure. The analysis focuses on a particular region in Italy, where several timely policies to incentivize biosimilar prescribing were launched. Methods: Drugs were identified by the anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system. Information about biosimilar drugs and their <b>originator</b> biological <b>products</b> was extracted from the IMS Health regional database. Drug consumption was expressed in terms of counting units, while expenditure was evaluated in Euro (€). The market penetration of biosimilars was analyzed by year and quarterly. Results: In the Campania region of Italy, the effects of cost containment policies, launched between 2009 and 2013, showed the prescription of biosimilars strongly increasing in 2010 until prescribing levels reached and exceeded the market share of the reference biological products in 2012. After a slight reduction, a plateau was observed at the beginning of 2013. At the same time, the use of the <b>originator</b> <b>products</b> had been decreasing until the first quarter of 2011. However, after a 1 -year plateau, this trend was reversed, with a new increase in the consumption of the originators observed. Conclusion: Results show that the cost containment policies, applied to cut health expenditure "to cure and not to care", did not produce the cultural change necessary to make these policies effective in the long run. Therefore, top-down policies for cost containment are not successful; rather, a bottom-up approach based on consensus among professionals should become the preferred option.

40|$|AbstractBiotechnology derived {{medicinal}} products are presently the best characterized biologicals with considerable production and clinical experience, and have revolutionized {{the treatment of}} some of the most difficult-to-treat diseases, prolonging and improving the quality of life and patient care. They are also currently one of the fastest growing segments of the pharmaceutical industry market. The critical challenge that the biopharmaceutical industry is facing is the expiry of patents for the first generation of biopharmaceuticals, mainly recombinant DNA derived products, such as interferons, growth hormone and erythropoetin. The question that immediately arose was how should such copies of the <b>originator</b> <b>products</b> be licensed, bearing in mind that they are highly complex biological molecules produced by equally complex biological production processes with their inherent problem of biological variability. Copying biologicals is much more complex than copying small molecules and the critical issue was how to handle the licensing of products if relying in part on data from an innovator product. Since 2004 there has been considerable international consultation on how to deal with biosimilars and biological copy products. This has led to a better understanding of the challenges in the regulatory evaluation of the quality, safety and efficacy of “biosimilars”, to the exchange of information between regulators, as well as to the identification of key issues. The aim of this article is to provide a brief overview of the scientific and regulatory challenges faced in developing and evaluating similar biotherapeutic products for global use.

40|$|AbstractA biosimilar is an officially {{regulated}} {{and approved}} copy of an originator biologic therapy. Improved affordability and consequent wider patient access compared with biologics {{are a significant}} appeal of biosimilars. Regulatory guidelines for biosimilar development and approval are rigorous and undergoing constant refinement. The process of licensing approval for all biosimilars requires demonstration of comparability in quality, efficacy, and safety between the biosimilar and reference (<b>originator)</b> <b>product,</b> which is undertaken in a stepwise procedure of nonclinical and clinical evaluation. The approval of > 20 biosimilars in Europe in several drug classes, including the first monoclonal antibody biosimilar, bears testimony to the increasing regulatory acceptance of these agents. In contrast, the clinical application of biosimilars remains underrecognized by physicians across therapy areas. Therefore, this article aims to provide {{a comprehensive review of}} the biosimilar development process and to provide multidisciplinary guidance on the potential therapeutic utility of biosimilars in clinical practice. Specifically, experts discuss clinical developments in the introduction of biosimilars across the disciplines of gastroenterology, nephrology, oncology, and rheumatology, and from a payer perspective, and also highlight a common need for ongoing pharmacovigilance, robust head-to-head clinical studies, and real-world data to establish the long-term risk-benefit profile of biosimilars.

40|$|Abstract When {{the patent}} of a brand-name, marketed drug expires, new, generic {{products}} are usually offered. Small-molecule generic and <b>originator</b> drug <b>products</b> {{are expected to}} be chemically identical. Their pharmaceutical similarity can be typically assessed by simple regulatory criteria such as the expectation that the 90 % confidence interval for the ratio of geometric means of some pharmacokinetic param-eters be between 0. 80 and 1. 25. When such criteria are sat-isfied, the drug products are generally considered to exhibit therapeutic equivalence. They are then usually interchanged freely within individual patients. Biological drugs are com-plex proteins, for instance, because of their large size, intri-cate structure, sensitivity to environmental conditions, difficult manufacturing procedures, and the possibility of immunogenicity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent of generic {{competition}} in European countries, given an understanding of these countries' different pharmaceutical price regulations and health care structures. In particular, this study investigates generic competition among the five largest European pharmaceutical markets; the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Spain, with comprehensive IMS data set for 10 years (1994 - 2003), in order to estimate the effect of generic entry on drug prices at the product level. Both within and across these countries, different interventions are being applied to in-patent and off-patent markets during 10 years of the study period. For example, in Germany, markets for on-patent drugs are largely unregulated and prices are set relatively freely; however, once generics enter the market, the German government uses reference pricing to set reimbursement rates. In the UK, originator medicine prices are free from direct regulatory intervention, but are subject to a rate of return regulation. Additionally, once generics enter the market, the UK's government uses price caps. France, Italy, and Spain, on the other hand, use direct price controls for originator drugs and reference pricing system for generic drugs. Accordingly, this analysis finds that generic entry has a negative effect on prices in countries with free pricing originator market, whereas in European Union (EU) countries with strict price and reimbursement regulation, generic competition is ineffective and/or counterproductive. Low regulated prices for <b>originator</b> <b>products</b> do not encourage generic entry following patent expiration. This finding is consistent with less generic firms and less competitive late entrants in regulated environments. Thus, strict price regulation undermines price competition in the off-patent sector, and cost savings from post-patent competition are not realized in countries with strict pricing and reimbursement policies...|$|R
40|$|Background: In Europe, epoetin {{subsequent}} entry biologics (SEBs) {{have been}} in use since 2007. Canadian patents of erythropoietin stimulating agents are expiring in 2014, therefore it is predicted that epoetin SEBs will penetrate the Canadian market in the near future. Objective: To estimate the economic impact and costs offsets associated with the uptake and use {{of one or more}} epoetin SEBs in Canada for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. Design: A Canada-wide epidemiological-based budget impact analysis was conducted to estimate cost outcomes under two scenarios: with and without the availability of epoetin SEB. Setting: The analysis was conducted {{from the perspective of the}} Canadian healthcare payer, over a 5 -year time horizon from 2015 to 2019. Patients: Patients included in the model were those with chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5, who have renal anemia and require treatment with erythropoietin stimulating agents. Methods: Only direct medical costs pertaining to drug acquisition of currently available erythropoietin stimulating agents in Canada were incorporated in the model. Cost of epoetin SEBs, market shares, uptake rates, and other model inputs were estimated from published sources or databases. No discounting of future costs was applied. Results: Based on our analysis, under market phenomena similar to those seen in the Europe and without considering potential switching from originator epoetin to epoetin SEB, we could expect that Canadian adoption of epoetin SEBs could result in $ 35 million (2013 CAD, year 1) to $ 50 million (year 5) cost savings annually, with cumulative savings of $ 221 million after 5 years. In one-way sensitivity analyses, model variables with substantial impact on cost savings were the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and epoetin SEB uptake rates. Limitations: We did not take into account costs associated with overhead, administration, or adverse events. Conclusion: The advent of SEBs represents an opportunity to relieve financial pressure in our healthcare system. Under the assumption that the efficacy and safety of epoetin SEBs are non-inferior to <b>originator</b> <b>products,</b> we have shown that the adoption of epoetin SEBs can lead to cost savings for the Canadian payer...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} two filgrastim formulations for controlling chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and to evaluate the non-inferiority of the test drug relative to the originator. METHODS: This phase III non-inferiority study had a randomized, multicenter, and open-label design. The patients were randomized {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 1 with a follow-up period of 6 weeks for each patient. In both study arms, filgrastim was administered subcutaneously at a daily dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. The primary endpoint was the rate of grade 4 neutropenia in the first treatment cycle. The secondary endpoints were the duration of grade 4 neutropenia, the generation of anti-filgrastim antibodies, and the rates of adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, febrile neutropenia, and neutropenia of any grade. RESULTS: The primary efficacy analysis demonstrated the non-inferiority of the test drug compared with the originator drug; the upper limit of the 90 % confidence interval (CI) for the rate of neutropenia between the two groups (12. 61 %) was lower than the established margin of non-inferiority. The two treatments were similar with respect to the secondary endpoints and safety. CONCLUSION: The efficacy and safety profile of the test drug were {{similar to those of the}} <b>originator</b> <b>product</b> based on the rate of grade 4 neutropenia in the first treatment cycle.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A “biosimilar” is a {{biological}} medicine {{similar to a}} licensed biological medicine (“originator”). As of October 2014, six biosimilars are licensed and marketed in Great Britain (GB) (three biosimilar filgrastims, two biosimilar epoetins and one biosimilar somatropin). Biological medicines are highly costly to the NHS, so {{it is expected that}} biosimilars will have an increasing presence as a cost-saving mechanism. This study explored the uptake of biosimilars within GB formularies. METHODS: Websites of acute trusts in England and health boards in Scotland and Wales were searched for the most recent drug formularies. The presence of biosimilars in a formulary was examined for all six products. Formularies that listed at least one biosimilar were considered to have a positive recognition of these products. RESULTS: Of 158 acute trusts in England and 21 health boards in Scotland and Wales, 176 websites were available, providing 144 formularies (England: 127, Scotland: 9; Wales: 7; England/Scotland shared: 1). 17 formularies were shared across trusts and boards. At least one biosimilar was listed in 63 formularies. While 45 formularies listed at least one biosimilar filgrastim, 31 and 17 formularies listed biosimilar somatropin and epoetin, respectively. Five formularies listed at least one biosimilar from each of the three classes, 20 formularies listed at least one from two classes, and 38 formularies listed at least one from only one class. In 19 formularies, at least one biosimilar was listed in preference to an <b>originator</b> <b>product</b> as first line therapy (filgrastim: 16; somatropin: 5; epoetin: 1). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey suggest that 44...|$|E
40|$|Erythropoietin (EPO) {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{therapeutics}} used to treat anaemic patients, greatly improving their quality of life. In this study, biosimilars Binocrit and a development product, called here CIGB-EPO, were compared to the <b>originator</b> <b>product,</b> Eprex. All three are epoetin alpha products, reputed to have similar glycosylation profiles. The quality, safety and efficacy of this biotherapeutic depend on the following glycosylation critical quality attributes (GCQAs) : sialylation, N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid (Neu 5 Gc) content, branching, N-acetyl-lactosamine (LacNAc) extensions and O-acetylation pattern. Reverse-phase ultra high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-UHPLC) analysis of acid-released, 1, 2 -diamino- 4, 5 -methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) labelled sialic acid derivatives and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) in combination with mass spectrometry (HILIC-UHPLC-MS) of procainamide (PROC) labelled N-glycans were the analytical tools used. An automated method for enzymatic release and PROC labelling was applied for the first time to the erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) products, which facilitated novel, in-depth characterisation, and allowed identification of precise structural features including the location of O-acetyl groups on sialic acid (SA) moie-ties. Samples were digested by a sialate-O-acetylesterase (NanS) to confirm the presence of O-acetyl groups. It was found that Eprex contained the greatest relative abundance of O-acetylated derivatives, Binocrit expressed the least Neu 5 Gc, and CIGB-EPO showed the greatest variety of high-mannose-phosphate structures. The sialylation and LacNAc extension patterns of the three ESAs were similar, with a maximum of four N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu 5 Ac) moieties detected per glycan. Such differences in SA derivatisation, particularly O-acetylation, could have consequences for the quality and safety of a biotherapeutic, as well as its efficacy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBecause of {{the recent}} expiry {{of a large number}} of patents on the <b>originator</b> {{biological}} <b>products,</b> interest in the production and marketing of similar biotherapeutic products in Brazil has been increasing. The national producers have significant interest in this market and have been making a large amount of investments in these kinds of products. Since biotherapeutic products consume a large amount of the government health budget, the Brazilian government also has a big interest in the possibility that more affordable biotherapeutic products could be introduced into the market to improve access, but always is concerned with the quality, safety and efficacy of these products Accordingly, it was necessary to review the biological product regulations in Brazil and to establish specific pathways to license similar biotherapeutic products. The new Brazilian regulations, Resolution n° 55 / 2010, are based on different regulations and guidelines from around the world, including the WHO SBP Guidelines. They follow the same scientific principles as the WHO Guidelines but also have some differences which are due to specific country needs...|$|R
