Unlike the DAR (detection, alignment, and recognition) method, which handles clutter by detecting objects and cropping closely around {{them so that}} very little background remains, this approach accomplishes detection and alignment implicitly by storing transformations of training images (templates) rather than explicitly detecting and aligning or cropping faces at test time. This system is built according {{to the principles of}} a recent theory of invariance in hierarchical networks and can evade the clutter problem generally problematic for feedforward systems.

50|$|In the US and Canada most {{professional}} clubs {{are just one}} of many local clubs and community representation on the professional club is not inclusive. Local non-profit community clubs with paid coaches, technical directors, and staff often end up in adversarial commercial competition for facility usage and academy fees for example. In BC, local community clubs are the only full members of the BCSA and some clubs use this player registration monopoly to prevent their players from using <b>outside</b> <b>training.</b> The professional club cannot have all local players accessible to them to scout, include in their club structure, and develop into better players. The professional clubs basically have their own small youth development system that is cut off from much of the area's other players who play with other clubs and in other leagues. The Vancouver Whitecaps FC separate system outside the BC soccer mainstream is the USSDA, and the BCSA set up the BCSPL partly to make a league structure inclusive to the Whitecaps scouting efforts. Generally given the profile of the MLS Whitecaps, BC youth soccer clubs consider the Whitecaps too big to compete against especially given the Vancouver Whitecaps FC Residency programs are not pay-to-play. The smaller Highlanders club also scouts the BCSPL, and {{part of the reason for}} community club ownership is to prevent adversarial Highlanders-local community club relationships.|$|E

40|$|When {{performing}} speaker diarization, it {{is common}} prac-tice to use an agglomerative clustering approach where the acoustic data is first split in small segments and then pairs of these segments are merged until a particular stopping point is reached. The diarization performance can be greatly im-proved {{by the use of}} a speech/non-speech detector. The use of a speech/non-speech detector helps the diarization system by pre-venting non-speech frames from “confusing ” both the merging and the stopping processes. Over the years there has been ex-tensive research on speech/non-speech detectors. Often times, speech/non-speech detectors require training data and their ac-curacy is strongly dependent on setting various thresholds cor-rectly. In this work we present a hybrid speech/non-speech de-tector for use in our speaker diarization system within the meet-ings domain. Our proposed speech/non-speech system runs in two stages. The first stage performs an energy-based detection. The second stage performs a model-based decoding using the previous stage’s data as a bootstrap for the acoustic models, thus avoiding the need for any <b>outside</b> <b>training</b> data. We show an im-provement of 14 % and 10 % relative on a development and test set. 1...|$|E
