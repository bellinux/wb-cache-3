5|$|Based on {{computer}} models, {{the presence of}} the Moon appears to stabilize the <b>obliquity</b> of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes. This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the precession rate of the Earth's spin axis (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic), thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane relative to that of Jupiter. However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the <b>obliquity</b> of the Earth, and the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit.

40|$|Most {{of the old}} cratered {{highlands}} of Mars are dissected by branching river valleys that {{appear to have been}} cut by running water, yet liquid water is unstable everywhere on the Martian surface. In the equatorial region, where most of the valleys are observed, even ice is unstable. It has been suggested, therefore, that Mars had an early denser atmosphere with sufficient greenhouse warming to allow the existence of liquid water. Here, it is suggested instead that during periods of very high <b>obliquities,</b> ice could accumulate at low latitudes as a result of sustained sublimation of ice from the poles and transport of the water vapor equatorwards. At low latitudes, the water vapor would saturate the atmosphere and condense onto the surface, where it would accumulate until lower <b>obliquities</b> prevailed. The mechanism is efficient only at the very high <b>obliquities</b> that occurred before formation of Tharsis very early in the planet's history, but limited equatorial ice accumulation could also have occurred at the highest <b>obliquities</b> {{during the rest of the}} planet's history.

5|$|The tidal {{acceleration}} of the Moon slows the rotation rate of the Earth and increases the Earth-Moon distance.

40|$|Models are {{developed}} to simulate light curves of stars dimmed by transiting exoplanets {{with and without}} rings. These models are then applied to Kepler photometry to search for planetary rings {{in a sample of}} 21 exoplanets, mostly hot Jupiters, chosen to offer the best observational opportunity for discovering potential rings. We also examine what kinds of rings might be expected for these planets, in terms of both size and orientation, based on arguments involving the host planet's equilibrium temperature, its likely <b>obliquities,</b> and the formation and stability of possible ring systems. Finding no evidence for rings, for each of the 21 studied planets it is determined on an observational basis which potential rings can be rejected out of a representative set of fiducial rings, varying in both size and orientation. For 12 of the 21 planets, we determined that Saturn-like rings could be ruled out for at least certain orientations. Additionally, the detectability of rings is studied, and it is found that ringed planets with small <b>obliquities</b> (roughly 5 °– 10 °) can yield large signals, which is encouraging for future work, since such small <b>obliquities</b> are expected for hot Jupiters.

Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} <b>obliquity</b> of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in its apparent motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been {{cyclical}} ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents. Ice ages may occur because of changes in ocean circulation and continentality induced by plate tectonics. The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms. The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal orbital eccentricity, a low axial tilt (or <b>obliquity),</b> and the alignment of summer solstice with the aphelion. Each of these effects occur cyclically. For example, the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100,000 and 400,000 years, with the value ranging from less than 0.01 up to 0.05. This is equivalent to a change of the semiminor axis of the planet's orbit from 99.95% of the semimajor axis to 99.88%, respectively.|$|E

These results conform with a previously noted pattern among the stellar hosts of close-in giant planets: hotter stars have {{a wide range of}} <b>obliquities</b> and cooler stars have low <b>obliquities.</b> This, in turn, suggests that three-body dynamics and tidal dissipation are responsible for the short-period orbits of many exoplanets.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the dynamical paleoclimatology of Mars {{with a focus}} on three areas: large scale dynamics, atmospheric collapse, and controls on precipitation and aridity of a warm, wet Mars. We explored the changes, and lack of changes, in the large scale circulation over a range of atmospheric masses. We present the results here, with an emphasis on the response of the winds and the meridional transport. The conditions for continuous condensation of the CO 2 atmospheres in the polar re- gions, often called ’atmospheric collapse’, were explored by simulating the Martian atmo- sphere over a wide range of <b>obliquities</b> {{for a wide range of}} atmospheric thicknesses. As expected, atmospheric collapse occurs at low <b>obliquities,</b> but surprisingly, collapse occurs for high <b>obliquities</b> (up to 40 ◦) for moderate atmospheric thicknesses (100 ’s of millibars up to 1000 millibars). Using the MarsWRF model, we show that a competition between atmospheric heating feedbacks, including the greenhouse feedback and the heat transport feedback, and the condensation temperature feedback determines whether atmosphere col- lapse occurs. Finally, we explored the precipitation and aridity of a warm, wet Mars with an active hydrological system. Even an extremely wet climate with a northern hemisphere ocean produces an extremely dry, desert climate in the southern hemisphere, with an equatorial band of rain and run off. Cross-equatorial flows deliver moist air from the northern ocean into the southern region, but topography and the distribution of land versus ocean limit the extent of the rainfall. </p...|$|R
40|$|Many hot Jupiter (HJ) {{systems have}} been {{observed}} to have their stellar spin axis misaligned with the planet's orbital angular momentum axis. The origin of this spin-orbit misalignment and the formation mechanism of HJs remain poorly understood. A number of recent works have suggested that gravitational interactions between host stars, protoplanetary disks, and inclined binary companions may tilt the stellar spin axis {{with respect to the}} disk's angular angular momentum axis, producing planetary systems with misaligned orbits. These previous works considered idealized disk evolution models and neglected the gravitational influence of newly formed planets. In this paper, we explore how disk photoevaporation and planet formation and migration affect the inclination evolution of planet-star-disk-binary systems. We take into account planet-disk interactions and the gravitational spin-orbit coupling between the host star and the planet. We find that the rapid depletion of the inner disk via photoevaporation reduces the excitation of stellar <b>obliquities.</b> Depending on the formation and migration history of HJs, the spin-orbit coupling between the star and the planet always reduces and may even completely suppress the excitation of stellar <b>obliquities.</b> In particular, we find that HJs formed in-situ experience negligible excitation of spin-orbit misalignment. Our work constrains the formation/migration history of HJs. On the other hand, planetary systems with "cold" Jupiters or close-in super-earths may experience excitation of stellar <b>obliquities</b> in the presence of distant inclined companions.

For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow excited by the dominant tidal forces.

40|$|We provide {{evidence}} that the <b>obliquities</b> of stars with close-in giant planets were initially nearly random, and that the low <b>obliquities</b> that are often observed are a consequence of star-planet tidal interactions.

The low-obliquity (well-aligned) systems are those for which the expected tidal timescale is short, and likewise the high-obliquity (misaligned and retrograde) systems are those for which the expected timescale is long.

5|$|The astronomical {{phenomena}} {{of the solar}} eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the 'radiating influence' theory of Jing Fang's writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that {{the brightness of the}} Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape ('like a crossbow bullet'), not flat. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the 'flat earth' theory for celestial bodies. However, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun's light is slanting, the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small <b>obliquity</b> of their orbital paths.|$|E

40|$|Observed hot Jupiter (HJ) systems {{exhibit a}} wide range of stellar spin-orbit {{misalignment}} angles. The origin of these HJs remains unclear. This paper investigates the inward migration of giant planets due to Lidov-Kozai (LK) oscillations induced by a distant (100 - 1000 AU) stellar companion. We conduct a large population synthesis study, including the octupole gravitational potential from the stellar companion, mutual precession of the host stellar spin axis and planet orbital axis, tidal dissipation in the planet, and stellar spin-down in the host star due to magnetic braking. We consider a range of planet masses (0. 3 - 5 M_J) and initial semi-major axes (1 - 5 AU), different properties for the host star, and varying tidal dissipation strengths. The fraction of systems that result in HJs depends on planet mass and stellar type, with f_ HJ = 1 - 4 % (depending on tidal dissipation strength) for M_p= 1 M_J, and larger (up to 8 %) for more massive planets. The production efficiency of "hot Saturns" (M_p= 0. 3 M_J) is much lower, because most migrating planets are tidally disrupted. We find that the fraction of systems that result in either HJ formation or tidal disruption, f_ mig≃ 11 - 14 % is roughly constant, having little variation with planet mass, stellar type and tidal dissipation strength. This "universal" migration fraction can be understood qualitatively from analytical migration criteria based on the properties of octupole LK oscillations. The distribution of final HJ stellar <b>obliquities</b> exhibits a complex dependence on the planet mass and stellar type. For M_p = (1 - 3) M_J, the distribution is always bimodal, with peaks around 30 ^∘ and 130 ^∘.
