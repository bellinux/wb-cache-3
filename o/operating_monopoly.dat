40|$|Twenty-five train {{operating}} companies (TOCs) {{were created}} between 1994 - 1997, {{as part of}} the restructuring process of the railway industry in Great Britain. The TOCs <b>operate</b> <b>monopoly</b> franchises for the provision of passenger rail services over certain routes - some of which continue to receive government subsidies. This paper investigates how the efficiency of these train operating companies evolved prior to the October 2000 Hatfield crash (which caused significant disruption to the network) using data envelopment analysis and stochastic frontier analysis. Our data allows us to look at the relative efficiency and productivity through the privatisation, to control the efficiency scores for environmental data and to correlate these results with safety and quality indicators. The analysis sheds some light on the successes and failures of the UK’s most controversial privatisation to date.

2500|$|Trujillo and {{his family}} {{established}} a near-monopoly over the national economy. By {{the time of his}} death, he had accumulated a fortune of around $800 million; he {{and his family}} owned 50–60 percent of the arable land, some , and Trujillo-owned businesses accounted for 80% of the commercial activity in the capital. He exploited nationalist sentiment to purchase most of the nation's sugar plantations and refineries from U.S. corporations; <b>operated</b> <b>monopolies</b> on salt, rice, milk, cement, tobacco, coffee, and insurance; owned two large banks, several hotels, port facilities, an airline and shipping line; deducted 10% of all public employees' salaries (ostensibly for his party); and received a portion of prostitution revenues. World War II brought increased demand for Dominican exports, and the 1940s and early 1950s witnessed economic growth and considerable expansion of the national infrastructure. During this period, the capital city was transformed from merely an administrative center to the national center of shipping and industry, although 'it was hardly coincidental that new roads often led to Trujillo's plantations and factories, and new harbors benefited Trujillo's shipping and export enterprises.' ...|$|R

50|$|Firms <b>operating</b> as <b>monopolies</b> or in {{imperfect}} competition face downward-sloping demand curves. To sell extra units of output, {{they would have}} to lower their output's price. Under such market conditions, marginal revenue product will not equal MPP×Price. This is because the firm is not able to sell output at a fixed price per unit. Thus the MRP curve of a firm in monopoly or in {{imperfect competition}} will slope downwards, when plotted against labor usage, at a faster rate than in perfect specific competition.|$|R

40|$|Countries {{around the}} world are liberalizing their {{telecommunications}} networks by privatizing incumbent state-owned firms and introducing competition. For many, this change represents a return to private provision and competition-not a new phenomenon. The beginning of the 20 th century saw great variation in the structure of telecommunications sectors, with some countries <b>operating</b> state <b>monopolies</b> and others-especially in Scandinavia-allowing vigorous private competition. The author uses data on countries {{around the world}} in 1913 and on European countries in 1892 - 1914 to test the effects of government monopolies, private provision, and operating licenses on telephone development. Controlling for per capita income and, where possible, for country and year fixed effects, he finds that state monopoly provision is correlated with substantially lower telephone penetration and higher consumer prices for long-distance service than private provision. Contrary to conventional wisdom, rural service was also worse under state-owned <b>monopolies.</b> <b>Operating</b> licenses that gave the state the right to appropriate firms'assets similarly led to lower telephone penetration and higher prices.
