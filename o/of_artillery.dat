5|$|A variety <b>of</b> <b>artillery</b> {{guns were}} deployed, {{including}} heavier weapons, such as cannons, culverins and demi-cannons, and smaller pieces such as sakers, minions and falcons. Some older guns, for example slings and bases, were also deployed, but were less effective than newer weapons {{such as the}} culverin. With sites equipped with several tiers of weapons, the heaviest guns would typically be placed higher up in the fortification, with the smaller weapons closer to the ground. It is uncertain how far the guns of the period would have reached; analysis {{carried out in the}} 16th and 17th century on the ranges <b>of</b> <b>artillery</b> suggested that the largest weapons, such as a culverin, could hit a target up to between 1,600 and 2,743 metres (5,200ft and 8,999ft) away.|$|E

5|$|As the NK 9th Division {{approached}} Yongsan, its 1st Regiment was on {{the north}} and its 2nd Regiment on the south.

Crossing the river behind it came the 4th Division, a greatly weakened organization, far understrength, short of weapons, and made up mostly of untrained replacements. A captured North Korean document referred to this grouping of units that attacked from the Sinban-ni area into the Naktong Bulge as the main force of NK I Corps. Elements of the 9th Division reached the hills just west of Yongsan during the afternoon of September 1.|$|E

5|$|The Stewarts {{attempted}} to follow France and England in building up an artillery train. The abortive siege of Roxborugh in 1436 under James I {{was probably the}} first conflict in which the Scots made serious use <b>of</b> <b>artillery.</b> James II had a royal gunner and received gifts <b>of</b> <b>artillery</b> from the continent, including two giant bombards made for Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, one of which, Mons Meg, still survives. Although these were probably already outdated on the continent, they represented impressive military technology when they reached Scotland. James II enthusiasm for artillery cost him his life, and James III also experienced ill-fortune when artillery sent from Sigismund, Archduke of Austria, sank in a storm en route to Scotland in 1481. James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a foundry in 1511. Edinburgh Castle had a house <b>of</b> <b>artillery</b> where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign. However, 18 heavy artillery pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing army, proving ineffective against the longer range and smaller calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden.|$|E

This allowed the main columns to gather at Aconcagua valley, meeting at the slopes of Chacabuco. Royalist commander Rafael Maroto converged his armies on that location as well.
