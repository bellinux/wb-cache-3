40|$|Standard trade theory {{claims that}} free trade is welfare- enhancing. We {{show that this}} is not the case if at least one sector of the economy is a Cournot oligopoly. In a simple small open economy with one oligopolistic and one {{competitive}} sector, welfare is an inverted U-shaped function of tariffs. Hence, an optimal tariff rate can be determined. The optimal rate depends on the number of firms in the <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>sector.</b> Below the optimal level, the competitive sector overproduces, i. e. oligopolistic good have a higher marginal effect on welfare. Increasing tariff rates stimulate the production of the <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>sector</b> by dampening imports. Under balanced trade, this reduces exports and production in the competitive sector, thus shifting resources to oligopolistic goods production. We also find that given certain levels of protection, perfect competition is not welfare maximal and, hence, not desirable. The finding explains why developing economies with imperfect competition are often reluctant to embrace trade liberalization and why, conversely, countries with high levels of external protection may be unenthusiastic about competition theory...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{theoretical}} coherence and empirical validity (in the UK context) {{of the economic}} school whose main proponent is Alfred Eichner. The main questions addressed concern (1) the duality of pricing, savings and investment behaviour between competitive and oligopolistic sectors and (2) {{the implications of the}} cyclical financial surplus that emerges in the <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>sector</b> during the upturn. The cycle is explained as the outcome of government reaction to the consequences of this financial surplus, rather than as a reaction to capacity or trade constraints. The thesis investigates the role and effectiveness of policy instruments aimed at strengthening and prolonging the cyclical upswing so as to achieve an upward revision to the secular growth rate. The thesis makes original contributions by extending the formal treatment of the effect of the oligopolistic financial surplus. It also locates the theory in its historical theoretical context and demonstrates that it can apply also to the case of an open economy. It collates evidence on capacity and trade constraints on the UK economy to support the argument that they do not constitute sufficient reasons for government deflationary action. The duality of the UK economy is demonstrated in respect of pricing behaviour by collating the results of existing studies. Duality in respect of savings and investment behaviour is confirmed by an original study of Company Accounts data. Investment duality is confirmed as a by-product of two further studies which have the main aim of establishing that traditional investment-directed instruments are not effective in the short-run (-for the <b>oligopolistic</b> <b>sector</b> and thus cannot be relied on to reduce its financial surplus. These studies are supplemented by a survey of existing literature on investment.

We test the model on a firm-level panel dataset based on the last three waves of the innovation survey for Norway (CIS 3, CIS 4 and CIS 5).

Next, we explore the impact of this change on the labour market of the competitive non-tradable sector.

As a result, the positive employment impact is certain only if the demand for tradable goods is inelastic, while labour and tradable intermediate goods are complements.

The authors consider a two-sector Economic Union (EU) with a perfectly competitive agricultural sector and a unionized <b>oligopolistic</b> manufacturing <b>sector</b> in which there exist productivity asymmetries across firms. It is shown that efficient firms have an incentive to strategically opt for intercountry minimum-wage agreements high enough to raise their inefficient rivals' costs and thus gain business in equilibrium. The unions of workers in all countries also find these agreements in their best interest. As a consequence, the MWI may emerge as the equilibrium institutional resolution of alternative political processes (i. e., an EU-wide referendum or special-interest politics), despite its negative effect on aggregate employment.

Moreover, the potential for introducing countercyclical bank capital rules and aligning macroprudential tools with standard monetary policy tools is examined. In particular, the model results highlight the importance of operating with a protracted implementation schedule of new regulatory requirements for smoothing out the transitional costs to the economy arising from a more capital-constrained banking sector...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{publication}} of Keynes' “General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money” in 1936 many new ideas and solution concepts for macroeconomic problems emerged, disappeared, and were combined in order to appropriately describe macroeconomic phenomena. Nowadays, New Keynesian frameworks are the workhorse models for monetary macroeconomics. These models combine elements of the Real Business Cycle literature such as rational expectations, microfoundations, {{and the concept of}} the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium with Keynesian elements such as nominal price rigidities and market imperfections. However, we claim that New Keynesian models still have some weaknesses. Therefore, this thesis contributes to the literature by providing - to our mind - important extensions of the baseline New Keynesian model and by analyzing new aspects of monetary and fiscal policy. First, we provide a New Keynesian framework which incorporates an <b>oligopolistic</b> banking <b>sector</b> where banks endogenously enter and leave the market. The resulting model generates significant amplification and persistence effects and depicts the empirically observed counter-cyclical nature of bank mark-ups. Second, we develop a New Keynesian framework where the mass of firms is endogeneously determined. In contrast to the recent literature, the entry and exit mechanism {{is based on the assumption}} of heterogeneity across firms. The resulting model performs better than existing frameworks with an endogenous mass of firms with respect to the generated second moments. Third, we incorporate the time-inconsistency problem a la Kydland/Prescott-Barrro/Gordon in a New Keynesian framework. In contrast to the original framework, this enables us to consider the demand side of the economy and to abstract from the assumption that the central bank can directly control for the inflation rate. Fourth, traditional New Keynesian approaches analyze the impacts of fiscal stimuli on standard measures of economic activity such as GDP, employment, and capital investment but neglect their impact on the mass of firms operating in the market. However, we show that the mass of firms is an important dimension for evaluating fiscal policy...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that a {{preponderance}} of past studies in corporate finance mainly focus on capital structure decision of firms, the problems of “what factors determine the capital structure choice of firms and how firms adjust their capital structure dynamically” are still riddling. Hence, the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the determinants of capital structure and capital structure adjustment dynamics of banks. To this end, the study employed a quantitative research approach. Specifically, secondary data have been collected through document review of annual reports of selected banks for longitudinal/panel research design. Besides, primary data have been collected through a self- administered questionnaire distributed to the selected Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) for the cross-sectional survey research design of the study. As the method of data analysis, the study estimates both static and dynamic panel models using fixed effect and GMM estimators respectively. Besides, in analyzing the cross-sectional survey responses, appropriate statistical techniques for order-ranked and nominal/categorical items of the responses have been employed. Specifically, in the univariate analysis of survey responses, mean scores and percentage of categorical responses have been computed for order-ranked and nominal items respectively. Moreover, to test the significance of differences of mean scores of order-ranked and percentage of responses of nominal items conditional on bank characteristics, the study employed the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test and the likelihood ratio test respectively. As the result, the tax shield from interest tax deductibility, profitability and/or size of free cash flows, growth opportunities and regulatory pressure factors are found to be significant determinants of capital structure decisions, consistently in estimations of panel models and cross-sectional survey. In iii examining the capital structure adjustment dynamics, both the regression estimation and survey results revealed the tendency of banks in Ethiopia to set target capital structure and adjust towards it at a relatively faster speed of adjustment. Besides, both regression model estimation and survey results disclose the asymmetrical target capital structure adjustment of banks. To be specific, overleveraged or undercapitalized banks adjust more quickly than underleveraged or overcapitalized banks. Further, the speed of target capital structure adjustment is found to be heterogeneous across banks that differ in their absolute deviations from target capital structure, size, regulatory pressure for capital adequacy and ownership. Hence, by empirically examining the determinants and dynamics of capital structure of banks in Ethiopia, the study contributes to the existing body of knowledge on the subject under study, and/or it fills a gap in the existing reference literature on the subject. Most importantly, the study tries to untangle the capital structure issues of banks, especially the dynamics, in the context of the least developed financial system where there are no secondary market and <b>oligopolistic</b> banking <b>sector.</b> Graduate School of Business Leadership (SBL) D.
