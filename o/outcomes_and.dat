As the Babylonians had no biomedical {{understanding of the nature}} of disease, they attributed the seizures to possession by evil spirits and called for treating the condition through spiritual means.

40|$|Affective {{forecasting}} {{with respect}} to two environmental risks (ozone depletion, air pollution) was investigated by studying tourists who travelled to either Australia or Bangkok and were thus confronted {{with one of these}} risks. We measured anticipated <b>outcome</b> <b>and</b> anticipated emotions before the journey, actually experienced <b>outcome</b> <b>and</b> actually experienced emotions during the journey, <b>and</b> anticipated <b>outcome</b> <b>and</b> emotions concerning a future encounter with the same risk after the journey. Results indicate that tourists underestimate (air pollution) or correctly predict (ozone depletion) both the seriousness of the <b>outcome</b> <b>and</b> their emotional reactions. The relationship between actual <b>outcome</b> <b>and</b> actual emotions is stronger than that between anticipated <b>outcome</b> <b>and</b> anticipated emotions. Furthermore, tourists learn from their travel experience and adjust their anticipations concerning future encounters with the environmental risk. Findings suggest that the domain of environmental risks differs from personal outcomes {{with respect to}} the process of affective forecasting. anticipated emotions, affective forecasting, environmental risks, risk perception. ...|$|R

5|$|About 222million {{women who}} want to avoid {{pregnancy}} in developing countries are not using a modern birth control method. Birth control use in developing countries has decreased the number of deaths during or around the time of pregnancy by 40% (about 270,000 deaths prevented in 2008) and could prevent 70% if the full demand for birth control were met. By lengthening the time between pregnancies, birth control can improve adult women's delivery <b>outcomes</b> <b>and</b> the survival of their children. In the developing world women's earnings, assets, weight, and their children's schooling and health all improve with greater access to birth control. Birth control increases economic growth because of fewer dependent children, more women participating in the workforce, and less use of scarce resources.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as <b>outcomes,</b> <b>and</b> draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E

Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group cohesiveness, teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E

30|$|The paper {{sets out}} to answer the {{following}} question: How do process <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> attributes interrelate with each other in the EO sub-dimensions of innovativeness, risk-taking, and proactiveness? A core insight from the empirical observations is that there is an important difference between process <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> in the EO sub-dimensions. For example, the illustrative data point to the possibility that innovativeness of <b>outcome</b> <b>and</b> process can be completely different. This is in contrast to Covin and Miller (2014), who suggest that innovativeness can be seen from a process <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> view. In fact, they even argue that process <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> can help to “triangulate” innovativeness, thus labeling both <b>outcome</b> <b>and</b> process in a “catchall.” This study, in contrast, shows that there can be important differences between process <b>and</b> <b>outcome,</b> <b>and</b> therefore, it can be valuable to investigate these separate from each other, which is more in line with the innovation literature, which points to considerable differences between <b>outcome</b> <b>and</b> process (Garcia and Calantone 2002). The empirical data in this study illustrate that innovative processes <b>and</b> <b>outcomes</b> are salient attributes. The process <b>and</b> <b>outcome</b> attributes can be related, but by making a distinction between them and treating them separately, we can arrive at a more clarified understanding of innovativeness. For example, the results show that a firm can act with high innovativeness in processes and actions and still have an outcome that is not very innovative.|$|R
