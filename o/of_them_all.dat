Kate spikes his smoothies with an estrogen to swell his nipples, has their dog lick his toothbrush before soaking it in their toilet, and adds hair-removal cream into his shampoo; Carly spikes his water with a laxative to cause him to defecate heavy diarrhea; Amber has an ugly fake three-way sexual partner against him.|$|E
5|$|Moran {{finished}} {{his career with}} the Bulldogs, retiring after the NHA's last season. He played four more seasons, during which he played 69games, winning 34 of them. Over his career, Moran's teams often had losing records, or they had a winning percentage barely over 50%. Some hockey legends often recalls that he was the best goaltender <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b> He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1958, with the help of Senator Chubby Power, once a teammate. He is still the earliest goaltender in HHOF, starting his senior hockey venture in 1901.|$|E
5|$|Sigmund asks Odin why {{he would}} expect Eric {{more than any other}} king, to which Odin {{responds}} that Eric has reddened his gore-drenched sword with many other lands. Eric arrives, and Sigmund greets him, tells him that he is welcome to come into the hall, and asks him what other lords he has brought with him to Valhalla. Eric says that with him are five kings, that he will tell them the name <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> and that he, himself, is the sixth.|$|E

5|$|The Inns of Chancery {{sprung up}} around the Inns of Court, and took their name and {{original}} purpose from the chancery clerks, who used the buildings as hostels and offices where they would draft their writs. As with the Inns of Court the precise dates of founding of the Inns of Chancery are unknown, but the one commonly {{said to be the}} oldest is Clifford's Inn, which existed from at least 1344. Thavie's Inn, founded in 1349, is considered to be the next oldest, and several legal historians mistakenly considered it the oldest <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E
5|$|Underestimating the {{strength}} of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, which at that time numbered about 11,000 personnel, Ichiki's unit conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek {{on the east side}} of the Lunga perimeter. Ichiki's assault was defeated with heavy losses for the Imperial attackers. The Marine units counterattacked Ichiki's surviving troops after daybreak, killing many more <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>All</b> but 128 of the original 917 of the Ichiki Regiment's First Element were killed in the battle.|$|E
5|$|When Prince Alfred {{arrives in}} the kingdom and {{falls in love with}} Snow White, Elspeth is furious to {{discover}} that images of Snow White are appearing in her mirrors, which means that her stepdaughter is the fairest <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b> Driven with jealousy, Elspeth orders Hector, a hunter, to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, and then return with Snow White's heart for her to consume. In the meantime, Elspeth transforms Alfred into a bear. Unable to kill Snow White, Hector presents Elspeth with the heart of a wild boar instead. When she learns the truth, Elspeth kills Hector, imprisons John in her mirrors, and stifles Snow White with an enchanted ribbon.|$|E

5|$|Actinides {{are typical}} metals. All {{of them are}} soft and have a silvery color (but tarnish in air), {{relatively}} high density and plasticity. Some {{of them can be}} cut with a knife. Their electrical resistivity varies between 15 and 150 µOhm·cm. The hardness of thorium {{is similar to that of}} soft steel, so heated pure thorium can be rolled in sheets and pulled into wire. Thorium is nearly half as dense as uranium and plutonium, but is harder than either <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>All</b> actinides are radioactive, paramagnetic, and, with the exception of actinium, have several crystalline phases: plutonium has seven, and uranium, neptunium and californium three. The crystal structures of protactinium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more similar to those of the 3d-transition metals.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Hawaiian {{religious}} practice {{holds that the}} five volcanic peaks of the island are sacred, and regards Mauna Loa, the largest <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> with great admiration; but what mythology survives today consists mainly of oral accounts from the 18th century first compiled in the 19th. Most of these stories agree that the Hawaiian volcano deity, Pele, resides in Halemaʻumaʻu Crater on Kilauea; however a few place her home at Mauna Loa's summit caldera Mokuʻāweoweo, and the mythos in general associates her with all volcanic activity on the island. Regardless, Kīlauea's lack of a geographic outline and strong volcanic link to Mauna Loa led to it being considered an offshoot of Mauna Loa by the Ancient Hawaiians, meaning much of the mythos now associated with Kīlauea was originally directed at Mauna Loa proper as well.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, one of {{her cousins}} was {{forcibly}} conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army as a punishment for celebrating the Constitution of 3 May; this incident {{is said to be}} one of the key events in her life, and one that galvanized her pro-Polish and anti-Russian attitude. In 1829, Plater began a grand tour throughout the historical Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, visiting Warsaw and Kraków, and the battlefield of Raszyn. Her mother died a year later; her father remarried and refused to even meet his daughter. After the outbreak of the November Uprising against Imperial Russia, she became a vocal supporter of the anti-Tsarist sentiments in the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. She became one of a dozen or so females to join the Uprising, and the most famous <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} days {{there were several}} failed attacks and counter-attacks by both sides. The Turks {{were the first to}} try during the Second attack on Anzac Cove on 27 April, followed by the ANZACs who tried to advance overnight 1/2 May. The Turkish Third attack on Anzac Cove on 19 May was the worst defeat <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> with around ten thousand casualties, including three thousand dead. The next four months consisted of only local or diversionary attacks, until 6 August when the ANZACs, in connection with the Landing at Suvla Bay, attacked Chunuk Bair with only limited success. The Turks never succeeded in driving the Australians and New Zealanders back into the sea. Similarly, the ANZACs never broke out of their beachhead. Instead, in December 1915, after eight months of fighting, they evacuated the peninsula.|$|E
5|$|John's wishes come true, {{though he}} is unaware that the Green-Eyed One owes Elspeth, his hideous spellcasting sister, a wish of her own. In order to fulfill her ambitions, the Green-Eyed One {{transforms}} Elspeth into {{a beautiful young woman}} who can now marry John and become his queen, second and new wife, and Snow White's stepmother. The creature also provides Elspeth with a magical mirror that allows her to see others unseen and to deceive John. As years pass, Elspeth forms a good relationship with her new husband, John, and stepdaughter, Snow White (who now becomes a beautiful princess 16 years later). However, Elspeth is vain and keeps a room full of magical mirrors which assure her each day that she is the fairest <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> whenever she asks.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping {{to make more money}} that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with {{the fact that most of}} the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds. The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>all</b> against relatively weak opposition.|$|E

5|$|The {{negative}} attitude towards Schubert's piano sonatas persisted {{well into the}} twentieth century. Only around the centennial of Schubert's death did these works begin to receive serious attention and critical acclaim, with the writings of Donald Francis Tovey, and the public performances of Artur Schnabel and Eduard Erdmann. During the following decades, the sonatas, and especially the final trilogy, received growing attention, {{and by the end}} of the century, came to be regarded as essential members of the classical piano repertoire, frequently appearing on concert programs, studio recordings, and musicological writings. Some late twentieth century scholars have even argued that Schubert's last sonatas should rank together with Beethoven's most mature sonatas. The B-flat Sonata, the last <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> has gained the highest acclaim and popularity among the three.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. <b>Of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E
5|$|Undoubtedly while negro slavery {{alone was}} {{in the mind of}} the Congress which {{proposed}} the thirteenth article, it forbids any other kind of slavery, now or hereafter. If Mexican peonage or the Chinese coolie labor system shall develop slavery of the Mexican or Chinese race within our territory, this amendment may safely be trusted to make it void. And so if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply, though the party interested may not be of African descent. But what we do say, and what we wish to be understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all,</b> the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.|$|E

5|$|Yerkes' final {{purchase}} was the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS) in March 1902 for £360,000 (£ today). The BS had {{permission to}} construct a line from Paddington to Elephant & Castle and, unlike his other tube railway purchases, construction work had started in 1898. Substantial progress had been made before it was stopped following {{the collapse of the}} BS's parent company, the London & Globe Finance Corporation, due to the fraud of its managing director Whitaker Wright in 1900. With a varied collection of companies under his control, Yerkes established the UERL in April 1902 to take control <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>all</b> and manage the planned works, and took the position of chairman. On 8 June 1902, the UERL took over the MDETC and paid off the company's shareholders with cash and UERL shares.|$|E
