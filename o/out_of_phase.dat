5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E
5|$|The term rear wobble {{is used to}} {{describe}} a mode of oscillation in which lean angle (roll) and heading angle (yaw) are almost in phase and both 180° <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> with steer angle. The rate of this oscillation is moderate with a maximum of about 6.5Hz. Rear wobble is heavily damped and falls off quickly as bike speed increases.|$|E
5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase.</b>|$|E

5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} {{in a corner of the}} room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> with another.|$|E
5|$|The {{manipulation}} {{of time at}} higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock. DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight {{in the course of}} the year. The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone.|$|E
5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} {{back down to the}} sea. It has been shown that this is not simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down to the sea on their particular beach.|$|E

5|$|Iridescence, as {{explained}} by Thomas Young in 1803, is created when extremely thin films reflect {{part of the}} light falling on them from their top surfaces. The rest of the light goes through the films, and a further {{part of it is}} reflected from their bottom surfaces. The two sets of reflected waves travel back upwards in the same direction. But since the bottom-reflected waves travelled a little further – controlled by the thickness and refractive index of the film, and the angle at which the light fell – the two sets of waves are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase.</b> When the waves are one or more whole wavelength apart – in other words at certain specific angles, they add (interfere constructively), giving a strong reflection. At other angles and phase differences, they can subtract, giving weak reflections. The thin film therefore selectively reflects just one wavelength – a pure colour – at any given angle, but other wavelengths – different colours – at different angles. So, as a thin-film structure like a butterfly's wing or bird's feather moves, it seems to change colour.|$|E
25|$|To {{appreciate}} how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> by one quarter of a wavelength.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of thin films and coatings is {{directly affected by}} interference effects. Antireflective coatings use destructive interference to reduce the reflectivity of the surfaces they coat, {{and can be used}} to minimise glare and unwanted reflections.

The reflected wave {{from the top of the}} film and the reflected wave from the film/material interface are then exactly 180° <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase,</b> causing destructive interference. The waves are only exactly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> for one wavelength, which would typically be chosen to be near the centre of the visible spectrum, around 550nm.
