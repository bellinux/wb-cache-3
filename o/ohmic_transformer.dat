50|$|Lower hybrid {{current drive}} (LHCD) (based on Lower hybrid oscillation) {{is used to}} {{supplement}} the current driven by the <b>Ohmic</b> <b>transformer.</b> The LHCD system is capable of delivering 1.0+ MW of microwave power (planned upgrade to 2 MW or more with addition of a second antenna in 2013) to the plasma at 4.6 GHz. Power is provided by 250 kW klystron microwave amplifiers manufactured by CPI, Inc. Non-inductive operation for up to 0.5 s pulses at 500 kA was achieved. Lower hybrid waves are launched preferentially in the direction opposite the plasma current (i.e. {{in the direction of}} electron travel) and deposit energy on electrons moving at approximately three times the thermal velocity via Landau damping. A major area of LHCD research has been in the area of current drive at the high densities (ne > 1020 m−3) required for a fusion power plant.|$|E
30|$|Tokomaks are {{axisymmetric}} devices with toroidal and equilibrium (also called poloidal) fields. There {{are four}} basic magnet {{systems in the}} tokomak: (1) the toroidal field coils, which produce the large toroidal field; (2) the <b>ohmic</b> <b>transformer,</b> which induces the toroidal plasma current required for equilibrium and ohmic heating; (3) the vertical field system, which is required for toroidal force balance; and (4) the shaping coils, which produce a noncircular cross section to improve the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability limits and alleviate plasma-wall impurity problems.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The main ECRH {{scenarios}} for the W 7 -X Stellarator are described. Both X 2 (low and moderate densities) and O 2 scenarios (high density) have been studied. Since O 2 scenario cannot be realized without pre-heating, transition from X 2 to O 2 scenarios has been discussed. Due {{to a lack}} of <b>Ohmic</b> <b>transformer,</b> only ECCD is available for compen-sating the bootstrap current and for controlling the edge rotational transform value. The efficiency of ECCD for all main scenarios has been estimated. All simulations have been performed by a 1 D transport code coupled self-consistently with ray-tracing code. ...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the energy-transfer {{efficiencies}} of opening switch and closing switch <b>Ohmic</b> heating <b>transformers</b> differ significantly, and that the efficiency of an opening switch transformer can be optimized by using an iron core with a substantial air gap (gap comparable to the plasma minor radius). A demonstration on the Caltech Encore gapped iron core tokamak is cited...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a tokamak design concept which could provide solutions {{to some of}} the possible problems of using a pulsed tokamak as a commercial power reactor, namely effects of pulsed operation, complexity and maintainability. The design concept is a device which provides very long pulses (several hours- 1 day) with the voltsecond capability of the <b>ohmic</b> heating <b>transformer.</b> It operates at low beta with a near circular plasma and a simple equilibrium field system. The superconducting toroidal field coils are individually removable and the tokamak is completely modularized. Illustrative parameters are a major radius of 15 m, an aspect ratio of 6, magnetic field on axis of 7. 2 T, an average toroidal beta of 0. 017, and a pulse length of 14 hours. ...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of eddy {{currents}} in the vacuum vessel walls and nearby conducting support structures can significantly {{contribute to the}} accuracy of Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equilibrium reconstruction in toroidal plasmas. Moreover, the magnetic fields produced by the {{eddy currents}} could generate error fields that may give rise to islands at rational surfaces or cause field lines to become chaotic. In the Compact Toroidal Hybrid (CTH) device (R 0 = 0. 75 m, a = 0. 29 m, B ≤ 0. 7 T), the primary driver of the eddy currents during the plasma discharge is the changing flux of the <b>ohmic</b> heating <b>transformer.</b> Electromagnetic simulations are used to calculate eddy current paths and profile in the vacuum vessel and in the coil frame pieces with known time dependent currents in the ohmic heating coils. MAXWELL and SPARK codes were used for the Electromagnetic modeling and simulation. MAXWELL code was used for detailed 3 D finite-element analysis of the eddy currents in the structures. SPARK code was used to calculate the eddy currents in the structures as modeled with shell/surface elements, with each element representing a current loop. In both cases current filaments representing the eddy currents were prepared for input into VMEC code for MHD equilibrium reconstruction of the plasma discharge. _________________________________________________...|$|R
40|$|We have {{designed}} and modeled a simple, efficient circuit for delivering {{power to the}} CDX-U <b>ohmic</b> <b>transformer</b> solenoid. Inexpensive electrolytic capacitors are used to provide {{the bulk of the}} stored energy. One small high-voltage oil-filled capacitor bank is used in the ignitron-based circuit. Several design objectives are met, including the production of a solenoid current waveform well suited to the breakdown and ohmic current-drive of a tokamak plasma, making efficient use of the available loop volt-seconds. The electrolytic capacitors are protected from reverse-bias conditions, and the ohmic solenoid is protected from voltages above 1 kV, well within the voltage rating, under normal operation and any forseeable fault conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The configurational {{flexibility}} of the TJ-II Heliac has been upgraded with the commissioning of a mode of operation that allows changing the magnetic configuration dynamically: the currents feeding the different coil sets can be ramped during the discharge, which allows for, e. g., moving up or down the offset of the rotational transform profile. In these experiments the <b>Ohmic</b> <b>transformer</b> is also activated so as to counteract the induced currents. This capability {{can be used to}} investigate the effect of low order rational values of the rotational transform, ι/ 2 π, in transport magnitudes, like the effective diffusivities, without altering considerably the magnetic shear. The experiments in plasmas created and sustained with Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating show, in agreement with previous experience from the TJ-II, that such low order rational values of ι/ 2 π do not deteriorate the effective heat diffusivity. 1...|$|E
40|$|Experiments in NSTX {{have now}} {{demonstrated}} the coupling of toroidal plasmas {{produced by the}} technique of Coaxial Helicity Injection (CHI) to inductive sustainment and ramp-up of the toroidal plasma current. In these discharges, the central <b>Ohmic</b> <b>transformer</b> was used to apply an inductive loop voltage to discharges with a toroidal current of about 100 kA created by CHI. The coupled discharges have ramped up to > 700 kA and transitioned into an H-mode demonstrating compatibility of this startup method with conventional operation. The electron temperature in the coupled discharges reached over 800 eV and the resulting plasma had low inductance, which is preferred for long-pulse high performance discharges. These results from NSTX {{in combination with the}} previously obtained record 160 kA non-inductively-generated startup currents in an ST or tokamak in NSTX demonstrate that CHI is a viable solenoid-free plasma startup method for future STs and tokamaks...|$|E
40|$|The winding hot-spot {{temperature}} {{is an extremely}} important factor limiting the loading capability of a power transformer. High temperature also accelerates the aging of paper insulation and thus reduces the lifetime of a <b>transformer.</b> <b>Ohmic</b> losses in the winding are {{the main source of}} heat inside a transformer. Precise knowledge of these losses is very important to determine the winding temperature distribution. Furthermore, in an oil-immersed power transformer, oil is used both as insulation and as liquid coolant. In a disc-type winding, a non-uniform coolant flow, in horizontal ducts, can contribute to local overheating. This article describes a new approach to estimate the winding temperature distribution, in which losses are computed by the finite element method whereas the coolant circulation and the temperature distribution are obtained from a thermal-hydraulic network representation of the winding...|$|R
40|$|Plasma with Induction, Reconnection, and Injection Techniques (SPIRIT) {{concept has}} been {{continuously}} advanced both theoretically and experimentally. The main {{features of this}} concept are: (1) formation of large-flux Field Reversed Configuration (FRC) plasmas by merging two spheromaks with opposite helicities; (2) flexibility to assess FRC stability by varying the plasma shape and kinetic parameter, by using passive stabilizers, and by injecting energetic ions; (3) sustainment of the FRC for a time significantly longer than the energy confinement time using an <b>ohmic</b> <b>transformer</b> and/or neutral beam injection. Experiments carried out in TS- 3 / 4 and SSX and more recently in Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) have further verified {{the effectiveness of this}} formation scheme for large-flux FRCs. An improved understanding of FRC stability over plasma shape and kinetic parameter has been obtained in MRX. New numerical simulations showed that FRC plasmas can be globally stabilized by injecting energetic ions. Many of these aspects of the SPIRIT concept can be further studied in the current MRX device.

40|$|The {{time varying}} {{currents}} in the <b>Ohmic</b> <b>transformer</b> in the SST- 1 tokamak induce voltages that drive large eddy currents in the passive structures like the vacuum vessel and cryostat. Since the vacuum vessel and the cryostat are toroidally continuous without electrical breaks in SST- 1, {{this leads to}} a shielding effect on the flux penetrating the vacuum vessel. This reduces the magnitude of the loop voltage seen by the plasma as also delays its buildup. Also the induced currents alter the null location of magnetic field. This will have serious implications on the plasma breakdown and startup and corrective measures may be required in case of an insufficient loop voltage or an improper null. Further, the eddy currents distribution will be vital for the plasma equilibrium and need to be considered while reconstructing the equilibrium. Evolution of the toroidal eddy currents in SST- 1 passive structures has been studied using a toroidal-filament model. The model calculations are compared with the measured signals in the magnetic diagnostics like the toroidal flux loops and magnetic pick-up coils installed on the SST- 1.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we write the O-D energy balance {{in terms of}} the {{parameters}} W 2, N, and I E PR. The minimum value of W required to achieve ohmic ignition (i. e. II = 0) in the generic case (i. e. no n or T dependance on r), and for various dependencies of T on n and T is W ~ 15 in all cases. Also the value of W below which no access, even with the aid of auxiliary power, to high temperature alpha dominated operation is possible is W ~ 2 in all cases. Optimized designs are obtained by minimizing the ratio of the auxiliary power pa to the ohmic power pn at the Cordey pass. The optimization is consistent with the physics requirements, the toroidal field coil volume and stress constraints, and with the volt-second and stress constraints of the <b>ohmic</b> <b>transformer.</b> Results under various r dependencies are presented. 1 Inroduction The zero dimensional power balance can be written in the compact form. dT C 2 W (1) rET =-T +W [NT 32 + N (C.
