The airline was initially overseen and controlled by South African Railways and Harbours Administration. Anti-apartheid sanctions by African countries deprived the airline of stopover airports during apartheid, forcing it to bypass the continent with long-range aircraft. During this time, it was also known by its Afrikaans name, Suid-Afrikaanse Lugdiens (SAL), which has been dropped by the airline, but many South Africans tend to still use it today. In 1997 SAA changed its name, image and aircraft livery and introduced <b>online</b> <b>ticketing</b> services. In 2006, SAA split from Transnet, its parent company, to operate as an independent airline.|$|E
