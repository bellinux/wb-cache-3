40|$|For the {{thermochemical}} performance {{implementation of}} Mg(OH) 2 as a heat storage medium, several hybrid materials have been investigated. For this study, high-performance hybrid materials {{have been developed}} by exploiting the authors’ previous findings. Expanded graphite (EG) /carbon nanotubes (CNTs) -Mg(OH) 2 hybrid materials have been prepared through Mg(OH) 2 deposition-precipitation over functionalized, i. e., oxidized, or un-functionalized EG or CNTs. The heat storage performances of the carbon-based hybrid materials have been investigated through a laboratory-scale experimental simulation of the heat storage/release cycles, carried out by a thermogravimetric apparatus. This study offers a critical evaluation of the thermochemical performances of developed materials through their comparison in terms of heat storage and <b>output</b> <b>capacities</b> per mass and volume unit. It was demonstrated that both EG and CNTs improves the thermochemical performances of the storage medium in terms of reaction rate and conversion with respect to pure Mg(OH) 2.

From a passing loop at Summit, the Garratt would continue to Chelsea unassisted whilst the helper returned down the hill to Loerie.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, mesophilic vs. thermophilic temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a thermophilic system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas <b>output</b> <b>capacity</b> and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion.

25|$|Many {{existing}} hydroelectric dams {{are fairly}} old (for example, the Hoover Dam {{was built in}} the 1930s), and their original design predated the newer intermittent power sources such as wind and solar by decades. A hydroelectric dam originally built to provide baseload power will have its generators sized according to the average flow of water into the reservoir. Uprating such a dam with additional generators increases its peak power <b>output</b> <b>capacity,</b> thereby increasing its capacity to operate as a virtual grid energy storage unit. The United States Bureau of Reclamation reports an investment cost of $69 per kilowatt capacity to uprate an existing dam, compared to more than $400 per kilowatt for oil-fired peaking generators. While an uprated hydroelectric dam does not directly store excess energy from other generating units, it behaves equivalently by accumulating its own fuel – incoming river water – during periods of high output from other generating units. Functioning as a virtual grid storage unit in this way, the uprated dam {{is one of the most}} efficient forms of energy storage, because it has no pumping losses to fill its reservoir, only increased losses to evaporation and leakage.|$|E

McDonald's most prominent apparatus was a fish ladder that enabled salmon and other migrating fish species to ascend the rapids of watercourses, thus increasing {{the extent of their}} spawning grounds. In 1871, McDonald devised [...] "automatic hatching jars" [...] which revolutionized the field of fish farming and were widely utilized by the United States Fish Commission, several state commissions, and commissions in Europe and Japan. The hatching jar apparatus enabled the [...] "vast extension" [...] of the propagation of shad accomplished in the 1880s and 1890s and rendered the work of the Fish Commission practicable commercially. In 1880, he designed a cod box that produced the tidal motion necessary for the hatching of floating eggs. McDonald further perfected his design of the cod box in 1888. In the winter of 1883, McDonald developed a tidal apparatus for the hatching of floating halibut eggs and those of other marine species. The vast production and distribution of fish eggs by the Fish Commission was possible through the utilization of this tidal apparatus. Through the usage of this apparatus, the process of hatching eggs was made cheaper and increased the fish farming <b>output</b> <b>capacity</b> of the commission.|$|E

Natural resources are also abundant with large deposits of coal, natural gas, and more than 40 kinds of minerals such as strontium and manganese. Coal reserves ≈ 4.8billion tonnes. Chuandong Natural Gas Field is China's largest inland gas field with deposits of around 270billion m3 – more than 1/5 of China's total. Has China's largest reserve of strontium (China has the world's 2nd biggest strontium deposit). Manganese is mined in the Xiushan area. although the mining sector has been criticised for being wasteful, heavily polluting and unsafe. Chongqing is also planned to be the site of a 10million ton capacity refinery operated by CNPC (parent company of PetroChina) to process imported crude oil from the Sino-Burma pipelines. The pipeline itself, though not yet finished, will eventually run from Sittwe (in Myanmar's western coast) through Kunming in Yunnan before reaching Chongqing and it will provide China with fuels sourced from Myanmar, the Middle East and Africa. Recently, there has been a drive to move up the value chain by shifting towards high technology and knowledge intensive industries resulting in new development zones such as the Chongqing New North Zone (CNNZ). Chongqing's local government is hoping through the promotion of favorable economic policies for the electronics and information technology sectors, that it can create a 400billion RMB high technology manufacturing hub which will surpass its car industry and account for 25% of its exports.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two major}} issues. The {{first is the}} introduction of uncertainty into the framework of classical deterministic regional input-output (I-O) analysis. Secondly, {{the role of the}} use of measurable flow data on the fundamental structure of the models is explored. The opening section uncovers an anomaly in the classical approach when flows between regions of final demand products, external exports and imports are neglected in comparison to the flows of internal intermediate inputs. Next, we introduce uncertainty into the analysis by extending an entropy formulation developed by Wilson, which itself evolved from the formalism established by Leontief-Strout (L-S). The main enhancements include (i) the introduction of regional <b>output</b> <b>capacities</b> to capture spillovers from regions operating close to capacity, (ii) the inclusion of flows of external imports and exports and (iii) the use of total measurable flows as input which are readily available from surveys, yielding as output not only the total flows of each sector between each pair of regions, but (optionally) the further disaggregation of these flows to include their final destination sector or their use as final demand. In fact, a key objective is to structurally account for the joint influence of technology, <b>output</b> <b>capacities</b> and transportation costs on the pattern of intermediate and final demand flows between regions. Further extensions of the approach lead to the generation of probabilistic supply functions as tools within a potential CGE analysis. This option requires the introduction of prices, permitting a profit constraint to replace the simple transport cost constraint of the earlier models. Copyright Springer-Verlag 2004 R 15, 014,...|$|R
