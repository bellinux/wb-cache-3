5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories <b>of</b> <b>Resilience</b> in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of the King or {{government}} in occupied Belgium, Mercier became the predominant figure in the country and a symbol <b>of</b> <b>resilience.</b> Because of his status, he could not be arrested without an outcry and, although lured back to the Vatican in 1915 to remove him from the country, he soon returned. His writings were banned, however, and copies of their work confiscated. In 1916, Mercier was officially prohibited from publishing pamphlets but continued to campaign against the deportation of workers and various other German policies. Initially opposed by Pope Benedict XV, who was anxious to remain neutral, the Pope was supportive of the Belgian church but encouraged it to moderate its stance to avoid confrontation.|$|E

Previous investigations by using self-report questionnaires have focused exclusively on explicit aspects <b>of</b> psychological <b>resilience.</b> The present study investigated the relationship between implicit and explicit aspects <b>of</b> psychological <b>resilience.</b> We used a self-report questionnaire consisting of four types <b>of</b> psychological <b>resilience</b> scales {{as a measure of}} explicit aspects <b>of</b> psychological <b>resilience.</b> At the same time, we measured implicit aspects <b>of</b> psychological <b>resilience</b> by employing an implicit association test (IAT) that was designed to reveal participants’ implicit associations between closely related people (family member, companion, and friend), and calm/anxiety attitudes.

25|$|Psychological {{resilience}} {{is defined}} as an individual's ability to successfully adapt to life tasks {{in the face of}} social disadvantage or highly adverse conditions.

25|$|Temperamental and {{constitutional}} disposition is {{considered as a}} major factor in resilience.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{self-help}} approaches to resilience-building have been developed, drawing {{mainly on the}} {{theory and practice of}} cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT).

40|$|Denial <b>of</b> service <b>resilience</b> is an {{important}} practical consideration for key agreement protocols in any hostile environment such as the Internet.

Many protocols have been argued to be denial-of-service-resilient, only to be subsequently broken or shown ineffective. In this work we propose a formal definition of denial <b>of</b> service <b>resilience,</b> a model for secure authenticated key agreement, and show how security and denial <b>of</b> service <b>resilience</b> can be considered in a common framework, with a particular focus on client puzzles. The model accommodates {{a variety of techniques}} for achieving denial <b>of</b> service <b>resilience,</b> and we describe one such technique by exhibiting a denial-of-service-resilient secure authenticated key agreement protocol. Our approach addresses the correct integration of denial of service countermeasures with the key agreement protocol to prevent hijacking attacks that would otherwise render the countermeasures irrelevant. ...|$|R

25|$|Brad Evans and Julian Reid criticize {{resilience}} {{discourse and}} its rising popularity in their book, Resilient Life.

25|$|Another {{criticism}} regarding resilience is its definition.

25|$|The idea of 'resilience building' is debatably at {{odds with}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> as a process, since it is used to imply that it is a {{developable}} characteristic of oneself. Those who view resilience as a description of doing well despite adversity, view efforts of 'resilience building' as method to encourage resilience. Bibliotherapy, positive tracking of events, and enhancing psychosocial protective factors with positive psychological resources are other methods for resilience building. In this way, increasing an individual's resources to cope with or otherwise address the negative aspects of risk or adversity is promoted, or builds, resilience.|$|E
25|$|Transgender youth {{experience}} {{a wide range}} of abuse and lack of understanding from the people in their environment and are better off with a high resilience to deal with their lives. A study was done looking at 55 transgender youths studying their sense of personal mastery, perceived social support, emotion-oriented coping and self-esteem. It was seen that around 50% of the variation in the resilience aspects accounted for the problematic issues of the teens. This means that transgender youths with lower resilience were more prone to mental health issues, including depression and trauma symptoms. Emotion-oriented coping was a strong aspect <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> in determining how depressed the individuals were.|$|E
25|$|Contrasting {{research}} {{finds that}} strategies to regulate and control emotions, {{in order to}} enhance resilience, allows for better outcomes in the event of mental illness. While initial studies <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> originated with developmental scientists studying children in high-risk environments, a study on 230 adults diagnosed with depression and anxiety that emphasized emotional regulation, showed that it contributed to resilience in patients. These strategies focused on planning, positively reappraising events, and reducing rumination helped in maintaining a healthy continuity. Patients with improved resilience were found to yield better treatment outcomes than patients with non-resilience focused treatment plans, providing potential information for supporting evidence based psychotherapeutic interventions that may better handle mental disorders by focusing on the aspect of psychological resilience.|$|E
30|$|This paper aims {{to narrow}} the {{existing}} research gap by answering the following questions: (1) What role does diversity play in the development <b>of</b> organizational <b>resilience?</b> (2) What {{does this mean for}} resilience-enhancing diversity management? Our paper addresses these questions conceptually and uses quotes from interviews with diversity experts as illustration. First, we offer the theoretical background for both resilience and diversity in organizations. Second, we build on a process-based conceptualization <b>of</b> organizational <b>resilience</b> to examine the role of diversity in the development <b>of</b> organizational <b>resilience.</b> We develop a conceptual framework by linking the existing literature on elements <b>of</b> organizational <b>resilience</b> and outcomes <b>of</b> diversity within organizations. Our study shows how diversity in work units can enhance resilience capabilities that underlie three resilience process stages (anticipation, coping, and adaptation). Furthermore, as diversity does not offer positive outcomes per se, our study exemplifies the main components of resilience-enhancing diversity management, which can serve as a moderator for raising the resilience-enhancing potential of diversity. By formulating propositions, the paper contributes to future empirical research and provides useful insights into successful management <b>of</b> organizational <b>resilience.</b>|$|R

25|$|While some {{research}} indicates that psychological resilience is a relatively stable personality trait, new research suggests that positive emotions are critical to trait resilience. This {{is not to say}} that positive emotions are merely a by-product <b>of</b> <b>resilience,</b> but rather that feeling positive emotions during stressful experiences may have adaptive benefits in the coping process of the individual. Empirical evidence for this prediction arises from research on resilient individuals who have a propensity for coping strategies that concretely elicit positive emotions, such as benefit-finding and cognitive reappraisal, humor, optimism, and goal-directed problem-focused coping. Individuals who tend to approach problems with these methods of coping may strengthen their resistance to stress by allocating more access to these positive emotional resources. Social support from caring adults encouraged resilience among participants by providing them with access to conventional activities.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} this group is shaped by several forces. A major {{influence}} is the fact of frequent moves, as the family follows the military member-parent (or in some cases, both parents who are military members) who is transferred from military base to military base, each move usually being {{hundreds or thousands of}} miles in distance. Other shaping forces include a culture <b>of</b> <b>resilience</b> and adaptivity, constant loss of friendship ties, a facility or knack for making new friends, never having a hometown, and extensive exposure to foreign cultures and languages while living overseas or {{to a wide range of}} regional cultural differences due to living in a variety of different American regions. Additional influences include living in a series of military bases serving as community centers, the pervasive military culture on those bases, the absence of a parent due to deployments, the threat of parental loss in war, stresses associated with the psychological aftermath of war (living with war-affected returning veteran parents) and the militarization of the family unit (children being treated to some degree like soldiers and being subjected to military regimentation, inculcation into a warrior code of honor and service, frequent exposure to patriotic ideas and symbols, experience of free medical care, and military discipline). Military brats receive completely free medical care until their soldier-parent leaves the service (without a full combat related disability) or they reach the age of 21 or age 23 (depending on the parent's branch of service) if enrolled in college full-time.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{alcoholism}} within families has leaned towards exploring {{issues that}} are wrong in the community rather than potential strengths or positives. When researchers conduct research that helps communities, it can be easier for community members {{to identify with the}} positives and work towards a path <b>of</b> <b>resilience.</b> Flawed research design in adult children of alcoholics (ACOA) research showed ACOAs were psychologically damaged. Some flawed research designs include using ACOAs as part of the control group and comparing them to other ACOAs within the same study. This may have caused some limitations in the study that were not listed. When comparing ACOAs to other ACOAs, it is difficult to interpret accurate results that show certain behaviors in the group studied. Research that has been conducted more recently has used control groups with non-ACOAs to see whether the behaviors align with prior research. This research has shown that behaviors were similar between non-ACOAs and ACOAs. An 18 year-long study compared children of alcoholics (COA) to other COAs. In failing to use non-COAs as controls, we miss an opportunity to see if the negative aspects of a person are related to having an alcoholic parent, or are they just simply a fact of life. For example, in Werner’s study, he found that 30% of COAs were committing serious delinquencies. This data would have been more usable if they had viewed the percentage of those committing crimes when compared to non-ACOAs. In a study conducted in a midwestern university, researchers found that {{there was no significant difference}} between ACOA and non-ACOA students. One of the main differences was the student’s views on how they connect their past experiences with their current social-emotional functioning. Students who were ACOAs did not demonstrate issues with their perspective on their interpersonal issues any more than the non-ACA students. However, this study did show that there were other underlying problems in the family structure that may attribute to the perception of not being well adjusted in life.|$|E

Ibrahim met Rashid Vally at the latter's Johannesburg record shop, Kohinoor, in the early 1970s. Vally produced two of Ibrahim's albums in the following years. The pair produced a third album in 1974, titled Underground in Africa, in which Ibrahim abandoned his financially unsuccessful folk-infused jazz of the previous albums. The new album was instead a fusion of jazz, rock music, and South African popular music; it sold much better than Ibrahim's previously collaborations with Vally. While recording Underground, Ibrahim collaborated with Oswietie, a local band of which Robbie Jansen and Basil Coetzee were saxophonists, and who played a large role in creating the album's fusion style. After the success of Underground, Ibrahim asked Coetzee to bring together a supporting band for his next recording: the group Coetzee put together included Jansen, as well as others who had not worked on Underground.|$|E
