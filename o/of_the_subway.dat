5|$|Since the 2000s, the New York City Subway has {{undergone}} its biggest expansion program {{since the late}} 1960s, with five stations opened since 2009. There are up to 15 more subway stations definitively planned. Still, the 21st-century expansion plan {{pales in comparison to}} some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system's other previous plans, {{as well as to the}} ambitious expansion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> in the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|This station {{opened on}} October 29, 1989 {{along with the}} entire IND 63rd Street Line. The opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> {{resulted}} in a steep decline in Roosevelt Island Tramway ridership.|$|E
5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, but having the most services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E
25|$|Today, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> {{are owned}} by New York City and leased to the Transit Authority for operation.|$|R
50|$|At <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{district}} lies Bupyeong Station. The station lies at <b>the</b> intersection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Incheon <b>Subway</b> Line 1 and Seoul Subway Line 1, instantly {{making it}} one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> busiest <b>subway</b> stations in all of Korea.|$|R
25|$|On June 25, 1923 {{two cars}} {{of a train}} coming from 65th Street Terminal derailed and fell towards Flatbush Avenue. Eight {{passengers}} died and many were injured. With increased use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subways</b> compared to <b>the</b> elevated lines, and <b>the</b> completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's three <b>subway</b> systems, <b>the</b> Fifth Avenue Line was closed at midnight on June 1, 1940, and was demolished in 1941.|$|R
5|$|During July 2017, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed who has control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system. Cuomo {{claimed that}} since the subway system was owned by New York City and leased to the MTA, the city had {{to pay more for}} its capital needs. However, de Blasio argued that his large $2.5 billion {{contribution}} was enough.|$|E
5|$|East of Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike, another flying {{junction}} {{ties the}} eastward tracks to Jamaica Yard. The {{other side of}} the wye curves west to become a lower level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> just west of Kew Gardens–Union Turnpike. After passing through 75th Avenue, those tracks join the local and express tracks at another flying junction.|$|E
5|$|In Elmhurst, the {{destruction}} of {{almost all of the}} century-old buildings {{in the heart of the}} village were destroyed for the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b> Land was taken on the west side of the Broadway to avoid the demolition of the Saint James Episcopal Church and the Reformed Church. Many nineteenth century residences and the Wandowenock Fire Company buildings had to be torn down. To allow the subway line to curve into Queens Boulevard from Broadway, the northeast corner of the two streets was removed, in addition to some stores and an old Presbyterian chapel. New buildings were built behind a new curb line once the subway was completed, bringing a new face to Elmhurst. The introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> stimulated local growth in Elmhurst. Commercial buildings and apartment houses replaced existing structures.|$|E

50|$|Grand {{opened in}} 1951 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Milwaukee-Dearborn <b>Subway.</b> <b>The</b> Milwaukee-Dearborn <b>Subway</b> was <b>the</b> second <b>subway</b> line in Chicago's Loop since <b>the</b> State Street <b>Subway</b> opened 8 years earlier in 1943.|$|R
5|$|Soon after Bloomberg's {{ceremonial}} ride, {{the opening}} date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> extension was pushed back from June to early fall 2014, then to November 2014, then to February 2015, {{and then to}} May 2015. Most of the problems were attributed to the incline elevators being installed in the station, and to the ventilation fans along the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The Great Blizzard of 1888 helped {{demonstrate}} {{the benefits of}} an underground transportation system. A plan for the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> was approved in 1894, and construction began in 1900. The first underground line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> opened on October 27, 1904, almost 36 years after {{the opening of the}} first elevated line in New York City, which became the IRT Ninth Avenue Line. The fare was $0.05 and on the first day the trains carried over 150,000 passengers. The oldest structure still in use opened in 1885 as part of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line in Brooklyn and is now part of the BMT Jamaica Line. The oldest right-of-way, {{which is part of the}} BMT West End Line near Coney Island Creek, was in use in 1864 as a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Rail Road.|$|E
5|$|The Rockaway Beach Branch of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) {{would be}} {{acquired}} by the City and an embankment would be created with two bridges for the right-of-way over Jamaica Bay. To provide {{a connection to the}} rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system, a track connection would be built to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} boom was {{not limited}} to express stations, with fifteen-story apartment buildings built by Cord Meyer, an eighty-family apartment house built by the Rego Park Construction Corporation, and 300 one-family homes built along Woodhaven Boulevard by Pherbus Kaplan, all surrounding the 63rd Drive local station. These development companies all sought out to continue to increase the value of their properties in anticipation of the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{extensively}} reconstructed {{in the early}} 2000s, undergoing a $50 million overhaul to connect the subway station to the new AirTrain JFK. The project was designed by STV Group and financed by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. During {{the reconstruction of the}} station, the original subway platforms were demolished and temporary platforms were erected in the center trackways while the new platforms and mezzanine were built. During off-peak hours, trains utilized a single track. The AirTrain structure around the station was completed in 2001, and the AirTrain station opened on December 17, 2003, at which time the shuttle bus was discontinued. The transfer was popular, with 4 million people transferring between the subway and the AirTrain from 2003 to 2007. The AirTrain was designed with the same track height and track gauge as those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway,</b> to facilitate a future extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> over the AirTrain system.|$|E
5|$|About 40% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system runs {{on surface}} or {{elevated}} tracks, including steel or cast iron elevated structures, concrete viaducts, embankments, open cuts and surface routes. All of these construction methods are completely grade-separated from road and pedestrian crossings, and most crossings of two subway tracks are grade-separated with flying junctions. The sole exceptions of at-grade junctions of two lines in regular service are the 142nd Street junction, the Rogers junction and the Myrtle Avenue junction, whose tracks both intersect {{at the same}} level.|$|E

50|$|By 1903, Washington Heights was on <b>the</b> verge <b>of</b> urbanization. <b>The</b> Broadway <b>subway</b> {{line was}} begun in 1900. It opened for service from City Hall to 145th Street on October 27, 1904 and to 157th Street on November 5, 1904, and would extend to 242nd Street in 1908. As a direct {{consequence}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway’s</b> opening, between 1905 and 1920 <b>the</b> population <b>of</b> Manhattan above 125th Street grew by 265 percent. <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> “high class” elevator apartments to house <b>the</b> influx <b>of</b> new residents to Washington Heights and other neighborhoods soon followed.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the subway}} was built, the Bloor {{streetcar}} line operated {{along the route}} between Jane Street and Luttrell Avenue. Paired PCC streetcars or multiple units (MUs) operated from 1950 to the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> line in 1966. The TTC favoured this route because the Prince Edward Viaduct {{made it easier to}} build a subway across the Don Valley, and the streetcar that ran along the route was filled with passengers travelling from East York and Scarborough. To provide relief to this streetcar line and {{to make it easier to}} expand into the suburbs, the line was built under Bloor street and Danforth Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Connections to San Francisco's local {{light rail}} system, the Muni Metro, are {{facilitated}} primarily through the twin-level Market Street subway. Plans from 1960 called for BART trains to traverse the Twin Peaks Tunnel, but {{the upper level}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> {{was turned over to}} Muni and both agencies share the Embarcadero, Montgomery, Powell and Civic Center stations. Some Muni Metro lines connect with (or pass nearby) the BART system at the Balboa Park and Glen Park stations.|$|E
5|$|Due to cost increases, several {{features}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> {{were cut}} back soon after construction started. Notably, the 72nd Street Station was truncated from a three-track, two-platform design to a two-track, single island platform design, {{paired with a}} simplification of the connection to the Broadway Line spur. This design change was done before the actual construction started. The MTA also pushed back its completion date to 2014. In its 2008 capital improvement budget proposal, the MTA further postponed completion of Phase 1 to 2015, and in 2009, the MTA rescheduled it again to 2016.|$|E

5|$|Early {{on in the}} project, it was {{announced}} that the new stations would feature platform screen doors. The stations (along with the new South Ferry station on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line and the three Phase 1 Second Avenue Subway stations in the Upper East Side) would include special air-cooling systems to reduce the temperature along platforms. Due to its depth, the extension has ventilation towers, rather than the ventilation grates ubiquitous in the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the station}} there is a flying {{junction}} that connects to the Jamaica Yard via a wye that curves east from the yard towards Briarwood. A second side of the wye curves west to become a lower level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> just west {{of the station}}. The yard itself is situated just north of the station in the southern portion of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, between the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway.|$|E
