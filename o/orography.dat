5|$|The vast {{area of the}} National Park and {{the present}} lack of road {{infrastructure}} make remote sensing the only means for monitoring the human activities {{in the area and}} their impact on the ecosystem. An analysis has begun by taking a detailed picture of the territory covering at least the following items: <b>orography</b> and slopes, road networks, land cover and use, human settlements, and tourist sites. The use of remote sensing and geographic information system techniques is of essential value for the park's management and constitutes the basis for further evaluations and impact analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of the cyclone {{resulted}} in several days of very heavy, continuous rainfall in the mountainous region on Réunion island. The island is the location for several tropical cyclone rainfall records; due to the <b>orography</b> of the island, tropical moisture will travel upward to the volcanic peaks, where it cools and codifies into rainfall. The heaviest totals occurred from February 24 through February 28. Commerson's Crater, located at an elevation of 2.3km (1.4mi), reported 2463mm (97in) in 48hours, which is {{just short of the}} worldwide record set by an unnamed tropical cyclone in April 1958. Gamede broke worldwide rainfall records between three and nine days, with its total precipitation amounting to 5512mm (217in) in Commerson's Crater; Cyclone Hyacinthe in 1980 remains the wettest tropical cyclone on record, having produced greater totals after ten days. Several locations on the island reported great totals. In a 24‑hour period, Hell-Bourg reported 1489mm (58.6in), and in a 72‑hour period, Cilaos reported 2321mm (91.4in).|$|E
25|$|<b>Orography</b> {{from the}} {{volcanic}} islands of Fiji {{has led to}} significant rainfall during tropical cyclone passages, which occur roughly once a year.|$|E
25|$|The highest {{flows of}} the river {{generally}} occur in spring and autumn of every year, when rainfall in the Apennines is at its greatest. The intensity of the 1966 flood was further increased by both the <b>orography</b> of the Apennines, which contributed to the high run-off rates and river discharges, and urban development. Roads, such as the Via de Calzaiuoli, served as narrow channels for floodwaters, allowing for their greater speed and destruction within the city; bridges, on the other hand, hindered river flow where it was needed, allowing water to pour over the floodplain with great force.|$|E
25|$|The uneven {{and steep}} <b>orography</b> {{of the island}} and its variety of climates has {{resulted}} in a diversity of landscapes and geographical and geological formations, from the Teide National Park with its extensive pine forests, juxtaposed against the volcanic landscape at the summit of Teide and Malpaís de Güímar, to the Acantilados de Los Gigantes (Cliffs of the Giants) with its vertical precipices. Semidesert areas exist in the south with drought-resistant plants. Other areas range from those protected and enclosed in mountains such as Montaña Roja and Montaña Pelada, the valleys and forests with subtropical vegetation and climate, to those with deep gorges and precipices such as at Anaga and Teno.|$|E
25|$|The {{island of}} Tenerife has a {{remarkable}} ecological diversity {{in spite of}} its small surface area, which is a consequence of the special environmental conditions on the island, where its distinct <b>orography</b> modifies the general climatic conditions at a local level, producing a significant variety of microclimates. This diversity of natural microclimates and, therefore, habitats, means that a rich and diverse flora (1400 species of plants) exists on the island, with well over a hundred entirely endemic to Tenerife. Endemic species include Viper's bugloss, Teide white broom, Teide violet etc. The fauna of the island has many endemic invertebrates and unique reptile, bird and mammal species. The fauna of Tenerife includes some 400 species of fish, 56 birds, five reptiles, two amphibians, 13 land mammals and several thousand invertebrates, along with several species of sea turtles, whales and dolphins.|$|E
25|$|The {{telecommunications}} industry is mostly dominated by Telmex (Teléfonos de México), privatized in 1990. By 2006, Telmex had expanded its operations to Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and the United States. Other {{players in the}} domestic industry are Axtel and Maxcom. Because of Mexican <b>orography,</b> providing a landline telephone service at remote mountainous areas is expensive, and the penetration of line-phones per capita is low compared to other Latin American countries, at 40 percent; however, 82% of Mexicans {{over the age of}} 14 own a mobile phone. Mobile telephony has the advantage of reaching all areas at a lower cost, and the total number of mobile lines is almost two times that of landlines, with an estimation of 63 million lines. The telecommunication industry is regulated by the government through Cofetel (Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones).|$|E

2500|$|Its <b>orography</b> and {{geological}} structure are imperfectly known. One {{theory is}} that Sakhalin arose from the Sakhalin Island Arc. Nearly two-thirds of Sakhalin is mountainous. Two parallel ranges of mountains traverse it from north to south, reaching [...] The Western Sakhalin Mountains peak in Mount Ichara, , while the Eastern Sakhalin Mountains's highest peak, Mount Lopatin , is also the island's highest mountain. Tym-Poronaiskaya Valley separates the two ranges. Susuanaisky and Tonino-Anivsky ranges traverse the island in the south, while the swampy Northern-Sakhalin plain occupies most of its north.|$|E
