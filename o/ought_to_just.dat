6000|$|Well, {{one thing}} was dead sure, {{and that was that}} Tom Sawyer was in earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery. That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up; and had a {{character}} to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was, without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before everybody. I COULDN'T understand it no way at all. It was outrageous, and I knowed I <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> up and tell him so; and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself.

5000|$|... "Salty" [...] Salton - [...] "Salty" [...] Salton was a USMC World War II flying ace who was beamed {{aboard a}} Justice-class air carrier {{while working as}} the {{director}} of his own flying circus. He's rough, tough and usually gruff to the younger Ring Raiders — never letting them forget that [...] "I've been a pilot longer than most of you've been alive!". He frequently trades verbal abuse with [...] "Never" [...] Evers in particular. Salton has forgotten more about dogfighting, and about air-sea combat in particular, than most of his fellow Ring Raiders know. He thinks anybody who depends on radar and computers <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> stay down on deck. Despite all his bluster, Salton backs it up with phenomenal flying ability. Salton refuses to trade in his old Corsair, souped-up though it may be, for a plane that would bring him into the jet age. He pilots the Sea Dragon, a customized F4U Corsair fighter that can split its gull-shaped wings, dragonfly-style, doubling its speed and firepower. With all this, in a dogfight, Sea Dragon seems to actually breathe fire. Salton did not appear in the cartoon or the toy line.|$|E

5000|$|Gernreich had {{predicted}} in a September 1962 issue of Women’s Wear Daily that [...] "Bosoms will be uncovered within five years." [...] At {{the end of}} 1963, editor Susanne Kirtland of Look called Gernreich {{and asked him to}} submit a design for the suit to accompany a trend story along futuristic lines. He resisted the idea at first, but said, [...] "It was my prediction. For the sake of history, I didn't want Pucci to do it first. Gernreich found the design more difficult than the expected. His initial designs looked like trunks or boxer shorts. He felt the swimsuit <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> be bikini bottoms, but realized that this wouldn't constitute a unique design. He initially designed a Balinese sarong that began just under the breasts, but Kirtland didn't feel the design was bold enough and needed to make more of a statement. Gernreich finally chose a design that ended around mid-torso and then added two straps that rose between the breasts and were tied around the neck. [...] The first two initial attempts to cut the design failed. When a photo shoot was arranged on Montego Bay in the Bahamas, all five models hired for the session refused to wear the design. The photographer finally persuaded a local prostitute to model it.|$|E
5000|$|The song is in strophic form: it {{consists}} of 17 verses sung to essentially the same music, all with a similar last line. In Part 1, Phillips gently mocks several Christian denominations for their particular obsessions (Primitive Baptists, Missionary Baptists, Amity Methodists, African Methodists, Holiness People, and Church of God); and in Part 2, several types of people he felt were insincere in their beliefs (preachers who want your money, preachers who insist that a college education is needed to preach the gospel, and people who [...] "jump from church to church"). Phillips {{is known to have}} attended several churches of different denominations, and the lyrics likely reflect his personal experience. His own faith was uncomplicated, as these extracts from the lyrics show: I want to tell you, an actual fact,Every man don't understand the Bible alike,But that's all, I tell you that's all,But you'd better have Jesus, I tell you that's all.Well, denominations have no right to fight,They <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> treat each other right. That's all....You're fightin' each other, and think you're doing well,And the sinners on the outside are going to hell. And that's all....It's right to stand together, it's wrong to stand apart,'Cause none's going to heaven but the pure in heart. And that's all.|$|E

40|$|Many {{consumers}} are {{keenly aware of}} gasoline prices, and consumer responses to gasoline prices have been well studied. In this paper, by contrast, we investigate how gasoline prices affect the automobile industry: manufacturers and dealerships. We estimate how changes in gasoline prices affect equilibrium prices and sales of both new and used vehicles of different fuel economies. We investigate {{the implications of these}} effects for individual auto manufacturers, taking into account differences in manufacturers ’ vehicle portfolios. We also investigate effects on manufacturers ’ affiliated dealership networks, including effects implied by the changes in used vehicle market outcomes.

40|$|Does anybody really {{ever give}} {{anything}} away? Well, yes and no. Consider our sayings about gifts—what {{is the most}} famous one? I think it must be, 2 ̆ 2 Don 2 ̆ 7 t look a gift horse in the mouth. 2 ̆ 2 This old chestnut suggests {{that if you get}} something for nothing, you <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> be satisfied. The presumption is that, yes, people do give things away sometimes, just out of niceness, and that the appropriate reaction is gratitude and not nitpicking. But this adage tells us something else too—that some people do look in the gift horse 2 ̆ 7 s mouth, presumably because they think (sometimes rightly) that it really may be a pretty decrepit old nag. In short, yes, Don Donor might sometimes make a free gift out of just plain niceness, but there is no denying Doris Donee 2 ̆ 7 s suspicion that Don is really just {{trying to get rid of}} a piece of junk, and get (unjustified) credit for doing so...|$|E
5000|$|The {{party has}} also {{been accused of being}} [...] "both too ambitious and not ambitious enough", that, in order to {{maintain}} traction, it <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on <b>just</b> one issue, e.g., quotas in the boardroom.|$|R

40|$|How is what {{an agent}} <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do related to what an agent <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> prefer that she does? More precisely, suppose {{we know what}} an agent’s {{preference}} ordering <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be over the outcomes of performing the various courses of action open to her. Can we infer from this information how she <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> act, and if so, how can we infer it? One view (which, for convenience, I will call ‘actualism’) is that an agent <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> φ <b>just</b> in case she <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> prefer the outcome that would result from her φ-ing to the outcome of that would result from her not φ-ing. 2 Another view (which, for convenience, I will call ‘possibilism’) is that an agent <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> φ <b>just</b> in case all of her options (in the relevant domain) with maximally preferable outcomes involve φ-ing. I will discuss actualism and possibilism in parts 1 and 2, respectively. I will argue, in part 1, that actualism is very far from the truth. And I will argue, in part 2, that while the standard version of possibilism faces significant problems, there are much better versions of possibilism that avoid the objections to the standard view. Ultimately, however, I will argue that even the best forms of possibilism are not acceptable. Then, in part 3, I will offer a diagnosis of why the existing theories fail, and I will offer an alternative theory that is neither actualist nor possibilist in form, and that avoids the difficulties with the other theories...|$|R
