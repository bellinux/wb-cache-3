5|$|The issues <b>of</b> <b>federalism,</b> {{ethnicity}} {{in politics and}} state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed {{to a decline in}} support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government {{is one of the reasons}} that the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism.|$|E

5|$|A {{nationalist}} {{movement in the}} Belgian Congo demanding the end of colonial rule led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as the questions <b>of</b> <b>federalism</b> and ethnicity, remained unresolved. In {{the first week of}} July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites and two areas of the country, Katanga and South Kasai, seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but the UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to use these troops to help the central government in Léopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisors and other support.|$|E
5|$|The Anahuac Disturbances {{coincided with}} a Mexican civil war. Texians aligned {{themselves}} with proponents <b>of</b> <b>federalism</b> advocating a stronger role for state governments, in opposition to a centralized government that set most policies at the national level. The federalists prevailed, and their favored general, Antonio López de Santa Anna, was elected president. In 1835, Santa Anna began consolidating power; in response federalists launched armed rebellion in several Mexican states. Travis, an ardent foe of centralism, led an attack on Anahuac in June 1835 and forced the Mexican garrison to surrender. Many Texas settlers thought Travis's action was imprudent, and {{he was forced to}} apologize. Although the Mexican government issued a warrant for his arrest, local authorities did not enforce it.|$|E

40|$|Predicting the {{intergovernmental}} future is hazardous. The idea <b>of</b> cooperative <b>federalism</b> {{emerged in the}} 1930 s as a hopeful prediction (Clark 1938; Corwin 1950), but did not become regnant until the 1960 s (for example, Elazar 1984; Grodzins 1966), just as an era <b>of</b> coercive <b>federalism</b> was dawning (Kincaid 1990, 1993 a). Federal aid {{to state and local}} governments, a key char acteristic <b>of</b> cooperative <b>federalism,</b> had increased by 154 percent after World War II (1945 - 1957) in constant dollars. It skyrocketed by 223 percent during the heyday <b>of</b> cooperative <b>federalism</b> (1957 - 1967) and by another 140 percent during the closing years of the cooperative era (see Figure 1. 1). However, aid declined by 19 percent from 1977 to 1987, prompting the prediction of an era <b>of</b> “fend-for-yourself <b>federalism</b> ” (Shannon 1987). This metaphor enjoyed wide currency for about a decade even though a year after it was proffered federal aid increased, for a total of 58 percent from 1987 to 1997 and 46 percent fro...|$|R

The quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that the systemic duality <b>of</b> Belgian <b>federalism</b> largely explains the preferences of political actors: French-speaking parties overall oppose the broad state reform that the Dutch-speaking parties collectively support. Yet, each party has a specific position on the decentralization cleavage and a vision <b>of</b> Belgian <b>federalism</b> that cannot be reduced to its linguistic affiliation...|$|R
5|$|According to {{historian}} Philippe Leymarie, the French crushing of the Uprising {{resulted in}} the near annihilation of the managerial class in Madagascar, with consequences that continued to reverberate for decades after the country's independence. Many of the leading figures in the Uprising went on to dramatically shape {{the political and social}} landscape of Madagascar after independence. Monja Jaona, who was jailed by the French for nine years, founded the Madagascar for the Malagasy Party (MONIMA) in 1958 shortly after his release. His party was key in leading the rotaka peasant uprising against President Philibert Tsiranana which brought down his neo-colonial administration the following year. After initially supporting Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, Tsiranana's successor, in 1992 Jaona led demonstrations against it and in favor <b>of</b> <b>federalism,</b> being severely wounded in the process. His son, Monja Roindefo, is also an active member of MONIMA and served as Prime Minister under Andry Rajoelina.|$|E

This article develops testable hypotheses based on the rationalist and constructivist perspectives and pres-ents a set of initial plausibility probes. The article shows that there is considerable room for dia-logue between rationalist and constructivist perspectives and together they can provide a more comprehensive explanation for the dynamics <b>of</b> EU <b>federalism...</b>|$|R
