The {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the list are officially recognized symbols created by an act of the Maryland General Assembly and signed into law by the governor. However, two of the more famous symbols of Maryland, the state motto and the state nicknames, were never made official by the state government. While the state seal derives from the colonial heritage of the state, the majority of official state symbols were designated in the last few decades.|$|E
5|$|The game {{implements}} {{an inventory}} system to allow Sam to store any items that the player picks {{up during the}} course of the game. The player may select any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the inventory and can then attempt to use them on objects in the game world or give them to other characters simply by clicking on the desired target. Unlike Save the Worlds predecessor, Sam & Max Hit the Road, inventory items are context specific, and cannot be used together or combined to create new items. Typically, Sam carries a gun that may be used to solve several puzzles.|$|E

500|$|Marcel {{provided}} Warren with a filming slot on {{the wooded}} backlot of Shepperton Studios, {{located on the}} River Ash. Several scenes feature a bridge that had previously appeared in Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965). In addition, production designer Hayden Pearce secured {{the use of the}} manor house in Littleton Park (the studios' original site) to serve as the location of Jessica and Jo's country home. Of the filming arrangements, Warren comments: [...] "This really was quite a unique situation because ... here we were in a studio looking at a real house and real rooms as if shooting on location." [...] The crew were permitted to redecorate the rooms as necessary and, to this end, make use of any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the studios' prop store. Warren states that this resulted in a [...] "crazy" [...] mixture of decors that [...] "certainly helped create the right atmosphere" [...] for the film.|$|E

30|$|A second {{focus group}} {{meeting with the}} same {{previously}} consulted experts was carried out to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>items</b> included <b>in</b> NutriQoL® version 0. For each <b>item,</b> participants rated <b>the</b> clarity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wording, <b>the</b> frequency <b>of</b> occurrence in routine clinical practice, <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HRQoL and <b>the</b> relevance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> therapeutic decisions. Participants scored clarity, frequency, importance and relevance on a 5 -point Likert scale (1 [*]=[*]not clear/ frequent/important/relevant and 5 [*]=[*]very clear/ frequent/important/relevant). <b>The</b> <b>items</b> remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire if clarity, frequency, relevance and importance were high, or if clarity, relevance and importance were high even though the frequency was low. In cases of high score for frequency, relevance and importance with a low score for clarity, <b>the</b> wording <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> was modified to improve this feature [15, 17]. High scores were those above the 25 th percentile. Based on this assessment, version 1 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire was issued.|$|R

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{documentary record}} {{of the church is}} in 1180, when it was a chapel of ease to St Gregory's church. [...] The church was built in three stages, beginning with the first two bays of the chancel and the base of the tower in about 1330–48. [...] The later stages of building were in about 1360, and in about 1425–50. [...] In 1643, during the Civil War, the iconoclast William Dowsing damaged many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>items</b> <b>in</b> the church. [...] A restoration took place in 1685, which included some alterations to the nave roof. [...] A clock was installed in 1701, and {{during the first half of}} the 18thcentury a spire of metal and wood was added; this was replaced by another spire in 1810. [...] The church was restored again in 1858–59 by William Butterfield; this included removal of the three galleries and the box pews, re-laying the chancel floor, and replacement of the pulpit. [...] Stained glass made by Hardman & Co. was installed in some of the windows, and more stained glass by Hardman was installed later in the century.|$|E
