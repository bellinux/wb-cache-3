In recent years, a treatment <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> as “ disease” has developed because of the progress of medical technology as well as the diffusion of knowledge about it. However, a treatment <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> as “illness” is not enough, and the attention of a treatment <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> as “illness” is growing. This study focuses on how patients experience a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> as subjective “ illness ”. Twelve Japanese adults were interviewed to explore the experience of “illness” of patients.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{family history}} <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> is {{reported}} to be an independent predictor of cardiovas-cular death in men. In a 9 year follow-up of 4014 adults from 40 to 79 years old in the Rancho Bemardo Study, men under 60 years of age with a family history <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> were at fivefold increased risk. In this study, we sought to determine whether modifiable risk factors, i. e., blood pressure, plasma cholesterol, obesity, and cigarette smoking, have a differential effect on cardiovascular risk in those with and without a family history <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack.</b> For both sexes, cigarette smoking was a stronger predictor of cardiovascular disease in those with a family history <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> (relative risk <b>of</b> smokers vs nonsmokers was 2. 5 for men and 4. 0 for women) than in those with no such family history (relative risk of smokers vs nonsmokers was 1. 1 for men and 1. 7 for women). Conversely, an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in men with a family history <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> was present predominantly in smokers (relative risk related to positive family history was 1. 2 in nonsmokers, and 3. 3 in smokers). An estimated 68 % of the excess deaths in men with a family history <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> were attributable solely to the interaction of family history with smoking habit and were therefore potentially avoidable. The risk of cardiovascular disease associated with an apparently inherited predisposition appears to be profoundly affected by modifiable behavior...|$|R

25|$|The {{limbic system}} can also {{significantly}} impact HR related to emotional state. During periods of stress, {{it is not}} unusual to identify higher than normal HRs, often accompanied by a surge in the stress hormone cortisol. Individuals experiencing extreme anxiety may manifest panic attacks with symptoms that resemble those <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks.</b> These events are typically transient and treatable. Meditation techniques have been developed to ease anxiety and have been shown to lower HR effectively. Doing simple deep and slow breathing exercises with one’s eyes closed can also significantly reduce this anxiety and HR.|$|E

25|$|An Australian-led {{international}} {{study of}} patients with cardiovascular disease has shown that heart beat rate is a key indicator for {{the risk of heart}} attack. The study, published in The Lancet (September 2008) studied 11,000 people, across 33 countries, who were being treated for heart problems. Those patients whose heart rate was above 70 beats per minute had significantly higher incidence <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> hospital admissions and the need for surgery. Higher heart rate is thought to be correlated with an increase in heart attack and about a 46 percent increase in hospitalizations for non-fatal or fatal heart attack.|$|E

(Levesque, 2005). Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not statistically significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not statistically significant.
