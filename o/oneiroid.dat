40|$|A {{patient with}} comorbid {{intellectual}} disability, catatonic schizophrenia, and recurrent <b>oneiroid</b> {{state of consciousness}} improved on long-acting risperidone and remains well at the three-year follow-up. We report a case treated with 50 [*]mg long-acting risperidone administered every 14 days, who has been followed-up for three years. We studied his regional cerebral blood flow through technetium- 99 [*]m hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography {{after two years of}} treatment. Symptoms of catatonic schizophrenia improved after two months of treatment, followed suit by <b>oneiroid</b> syndrome remission. Two years later, his brain perfusion was normal. No side effect has occurred since the patient was started on long-acting risperidone. Long-acting risperidone proved to be safe and effective in treating symptoms of catatonia and <b>oneiroid</b> syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} in the field of Near-Death-Experiences (NDE) shows us various reports of the process of dying which contradict the widely shared medical opinions in the past. Based on these observations, Raymond Moody developed and differentiated specific stages in the process of dying. Although these stages cannot be empirically proven, for some of the described stages scientific ex-planations can be found. For example, NDE {{have been reported in the}} terminal phase of life-threatening diseases, which can be explained by neurobiological changes of transmitter substances in dying personâ€™s brains. Further explanatory models fall back on other influences, e. g. side effects of sedative medication, psychedelic drugs, meditation, epilepsy, migraine or <b>oneiroid</b> psychosis. The large number of different visual experiences (tunnel vision, encounter with close relatives, bright lights, God, flowering gardens etc.) which appear in the course of a NDE, can be interpreted as visu-al hallucinations or <b>oneiroid</b> dreams as a consequence of medication or endogenous opioid production; in addition, a genetic predisposition could play an essential role. A NDE possibly is a final protective mechanism of the brain in agonizing patients, which leads to feelings of euphoria and experiences of hallucinations, caused by the explosive release of neurotransmitters. Positive emphasis should be given to the fact that in periods of increasing secularization the investigations of NDE have provide...|$|E
