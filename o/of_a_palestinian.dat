5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Palestinian</b> descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
