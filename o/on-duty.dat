5|$|FMCSA rules {{prohibit}} drivers from {{operating a}} CMV {{after having been}} <b>on-duty</b> 60hours in 7 consecutive days (if the motor carrier does not operate CMVs {{every day of the}} week), or after having been <b>on-duty</b> 70hours in 8 consecutive days (if the motor carrier operates CMVs every day of the week).|$|E
5|$|FMCSA rules {{prohibit}} {{driving a}} passenger-carrying CMV (e.g., commercial and city buses, passenger vans, and school buses) {{for more than}} 10hours, or to drive after having been <b>on-duty</b> for 15hours. The 5-hour difference between the 10-hour driving limit and the 15-hour <b>on-duty</b> limit gives drivers {{the opportunity to take}} care of non-driving work-related duties such as loading and unloading of passengers and luggage, and fueling the vehicle, as well as non-working duties such as meal and rest breaks. After completing a 10 to 15-hour <b>on-duty</b> period, the driver must be allowed 8hours off-duty.|$|E
5|$|FMCSA rules {{prohibit}} {{driving a}} property-carrying CMV (e.g., trucks) more than 11hours or to drive {{after having been}} <b>on-duty</b> for 14hours. The 3-hour difference between the 11-hour driving limit and the 14-hour <b>on-duty</b> limit gives drivers {{the opportunity to take}} care of non-driving working duties such as loading and unloading cargo, fueling the vehicle, and required vehicle inspections, as well as non-working duties such as meal and rest breaks. After completing an 11- to 14-hour <b>on-duty</b> period, the driver must be allowed 10hours off-duty.|$|E
5|$|Off-duty time is {{any time}} not spent <b>on-duty,</b> driving, {{or in the}} sleeper berth.|$|E
5|$|Parts of a driver's {{work day}} are defined in four terms: <b>On-duty</b> time, off-duty time, driving time, and sleeper berth time.|$|E
5|$|After accumulating, for example, 60hours {{of driving}} and <b>on-duty</b> time within {{a period of}} 7days, a driver's daily driving limit may be reduced (60 / 7 = 8.57 driving hours per day). The driver of a passenger-carrying vehicle may not use the 34-hour restart provision.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{is served}} by the firefighters of the Cleveland Division of Fire. The fire {{department}} operates out of 22 active fire stations, located throughout the city in five battalions. Each Battalion is commanded by a Battalion Chief, who reports to an <b>on-duty</b> Assistant Chief.|$|E
5|$|<b>On-duty</b> time is {{all time}} from when a driver begins {{to work or}} is {{required}} to be in readiness to work until the driver is relieved from work and all responsibility for performing work.|$|E
5|$|Up to 2 hours {{either side}} of a sleeper-berth period while in the {{passenger}} seat will count as off-duty. Drivers inside a parked CMV who are not in the sleeper berth must log it as <b>on-duty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records the same information as a manual paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only for reporting <b>on-duty</b> and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E
5|$|The rally began peacefully under a {{light rain}} {{on the evening of}} May 4. August Spies, Albert Parsons, and Samuel Fielden spoke to a crowd {{estimated}} variously between 600 and 3,000 while standing in an open wagon adjacent to the square on Des Plaines Street. A large number of <b>on-duty</b> police officers watched from nearby.|$|E
5|$|Within {{six months}} of the {{original}} ruling, the ICC ultimately decided to change the 12-hour work limit in 24hours to a 10-hour driving limit in 24hours, and the 15-hour <b>on-duty</b> limit was rescinded. Motor carriers were required to give drivers 8, rather than 9, consecutive hours off-duty each day. These rules allowed for 10hours of driving and 8hours of rest within a 24-hour day.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 2003, {{there were}} {{numerous}} proposals to change the HOS again, but none were ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes applied only to property-carrying drivers (i.e., truck drivers). These rules allowed 11hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours of rest. These changes would allow drivers (using the entire 14-hour <b>on-duty</b> period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, the now-abolished Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) {{enforced}} {{the first}} HOS rules. Drivers {{were limited to}} 12hours of work within a 15-hour period. Work was defined as loading, unloading, driving, handling freight, preparing reports, preparing vehicles for service, or performing any other duty pertaining to the transportation of passengers or property. The ICC intended the 3-hour difference between 15hours <b>on-duty</b> and 12hours {{of work to be}} used for meals and rest breaks. The weekly maximum was limited to 60hours over 7days (non-daily drivers), or 70hours over 8days (daily drivers). These rules allowed for 12hours of work within a 15-hour period, 9hours of rest, with 3hours for breaks within a 24-hour day.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany had {{a strong}} anti-tobacco {{movement}} as pioneering research by Franz H. Müller in 1939 demonstrated a causal link between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets. Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains and among <b>on-duty</b> members of the military. Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides. As {{part of a general}} public health campaign, water supplies were cleaned up, lead and mercury were removed from consumer products and women were urged to undergo regular screenings for breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|Wail al-Shehri, {{his brother}} Waleed, and Satam al-Suqami arrived {{together}} at Logan Airport at 06:45 {{on the morning}} of September 11, 2001. Upon check-in, all three men were selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) for further screening of their checked baggage. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint. One of the five Globe Aviation security screeners <b>on-duty</b> later reported that either Wail or Waleed had been using a crutch when they passed through security, and that the crutch had been X-rayed as per regulations.|$|E
5|$|FMCSA rules {{require that}} a log book (or ELD) must record for each change of duty status (e.g., {{the place of}} {{reporting}} for work, or starting to drive), {{the name of the}} city, town or village, with state abbreviation. If a change of duty status occurs at a location other than a city, the highway number and nearest milepost or the nearest two intersecting roadways followed by the name of the nearest city must be recorded. In addition to the time grid, a log book must record the date, total miles driven for the day, truck and trailer number, name of carrier, bill of lading number, and the driver's signature. The driver is required to retain a copy of each log page for the previous seven consecutive days which must be in his/her possession and available for inspection while <b>on-duty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parmelly {{is blamed}} for the murders. The agents start to leave Florida, but Mulder soon pulls over. He remains frustrated, since Parmelly was <b>on-duty</b> during only one murder, and {{was not one of}} the three men who knew Perry Simon's {{confidential}} identity. He also points out inconsistencies in the actions of Parmelly and Roque, who was also assumed {{to be part of the}} plot. Mulder believes that Parmelly was not responsible for the deaths, and that Neech had indeed been reincarnated to exact his revenge. However, Scully convinces Mulder that the case is over, and that they should return home. Just then, Brodeur passes them in his car. Looking in his rear view mirror, he sees Neech, who attacks Brodeur and causes his car to crash into a tree, claiming his last victim.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} noise of explosions, the <b>on-duty</b> U.S. {{technicians}} rushed {{out the front door}} of their operations building where they were met by North Vietnamese gunfire. Blanton, the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other U.S. technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to {{the west side of the}} mountain, where they hid on the edge of the cliff. From their hideout, the U.S. technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M-16 rifles and hand grenades. At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the U.S. technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting. Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{international}} {{airports in}} Russia have consuls <b>on-duty,</b> {{who have the}} power to issue visas on the spot.|$|E
25|$|Some {{aggravating}} circumstances are nearly universal, such as robbery-murder, murder involving rape of the victim, {{and murder of}} an <b>on-duty</b> police officer.|$|E
25|$|The Crew Ready Room is a {{pyramidal}} {{hipped roof}} building where the <b>on-duty</b> crew would wait. The building has {{lost much of}} its historical integrity, and is considered non-contributing to the historic district.|$|E
25|$|Pardo was the <b>on-duty</b> live booth {{announcer}} for WNBC-TV in New York and the NBC network on November 22, 1963, {{and he was}} {{the first}} to announce to NBC viewers that President John F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas, Texas.|$|E
25|$|The Chicago Police Department {{played a}} major role in 1993's The Fugitive, showing them in a semi-brutal fashion after Kimble is {{incorrectly}} believed to have killed an <b>on-duty</b> police officer. The use of actual Chicago Police Department vehicles and uniforms is extensive and can be see throughout the film.|$|E
25|$|The NYPL {{maintains}} {{a force of}} NYC special patrolmen, who provide security and protection to various libraries, and NYPL special investigators, who oversee security operations at the library facilities. These officials have <b>on-duty</b> arrest authority granted by the New York Penal Law. Some library branches contract for security guards.|$|E
25|$|The {{process that}} IOS used to design their {{test for the}} job {{analyses}} portion included interviews of incumbent captains and lieutenants and their supervisors, and ride-along observations of other <b>on-duty</b> officers. Using that information, IOS wrote job-analysis questionnaires and administered them {{to most of the}} incumbent battalion chiefs, captains, and lieutenants in the Department.|$|E
25|$|As of November 2007 the {{university}} had spent $125,000 for private security {{guards at the}} grove, $100,000 in covering costs incurred by the University of California Police Department (UCPD) that {{were not part of}} their normal <b>on-duty</b> operations, and $117,000 in building two fences around the grove. As of April 5, 2008, the cost to UCPD had reached $300,000.|$|E
25|$|TTC {{buses and}} streetcars are {{operated}} {{out of a}} number of garages and carhouses located around the city and are serviced at several other facilities. The surface routes are divided into several divisions. Individual divisions have a manager, an <b>on-duty</b> mobile supervisor, a CIS communications centre, and a garage facility tasked with managing the division's vehicle fleet and routes.|$|E
25|$|Pharmacies are {{typically}} {{required to have}} a pharmacist <b>on-duty</b> at all times when open. It is also often a requirement that {{the owner of a}} pharmacy must be a registered pharmacist, although {{this is not the case}} in all jurisdictions, such that many retailers (including supermarkets and mass merchandisers) now include a pharmacy as a department of their store.|$|E
25|$|The {{day shift}} ended, {{and the night}} shift started with 62 men running Piper Alpha. As he found the <b>on-duty</b> {{custodian}} busy, the engineer neglected to inform him of the condition of Pump A. Instead he placed the permit in the control centre and left. This permit disappeared and was not found. Coincidentally there was another permit issued for the general overhaul of Pump A {{that had not yet}} begun.|$|E
25|$|On 21 April 2015 40 masked {{and armed}} ethnic Albanians wearing the {{insignia}} of Kosovo Liberation Army {{took control of}} the Gosince border post. Threatening to kill the four <b>on-duty</b> police officers unless they leave the border area immediately, they said that they want to have their own state and that they do not accept the Ohrid Agreements. After a few hours, Macedonian forces regained control of the village.|$|E
25|$|The Camden Fire Department {{currently}} operates {{out of six}} fire stations, located {{throughout the}} city in two Battalions, commanded by two Battalion Chiefs per shift, {{in addition to an}} <b>on-duty</b> Deputy Chief. The CFD fire apparatus fleet consists of five Engine Companies, three Ladder Companies, one Squad Company, one Rescue Company, and several other special, support, and reserve units. Since 2010, the Camden Fire Department has suffered severe economic cutbacks, including company closures and staffing cuts.|$|E
25|$|Deputy sheriffs and {{criminal}} investigators are New York State peace officers with limited {{authority to make}} warrantless arrests, issue summonses, conduct vehicle stops, carry and use firearms, batons, pepper spray, handcuffs, and use physical and deadly force. Deputy sheriffs {{and criminal}} investigators have peace officer status both <b>on-duty</b> and off-duty. Deputy sheriffs receive their peace officer status pursuant to the New York State Criminal Procedure Law (CPL) §2.10 subdivision 2, while criminal investigators receive their peace officer status from CPL §2.10 subdivision 5.|$|E
25|$|Two {{condensate}} pumps, designated A and B, displaced the platform's condensate {{for transport}} to the coast. On {{the morning of}} 6 July, Pump A's pressure safety valve (PSV #504) was removed for routine maintenance. The pump's two-yearly overhaul was planned but had not started. The open condensate pipe was temporarily sealed with a disk cover (flat metal disc also called a blind flange or blank flange). Because the work could not be completed by 6:00p.m., the disc cover remained in place. It was hand-tightened only. The <b>on-duty</b> engineer filled in a permit which stated that Pump A was not ready and must not be switched on under any circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Firefighting {{has long}} been {{associated}} with poor cardiovascular outcomes. In the United States, {{the most common cause}} of <b>on-duty</b> fatalities for firefighters is sudden cardiac death. In addition to personal factors that may predispose an individual to coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular diseases, occupational exposures can significantly increase a firefighter's risk. Historically, the fire service blamed poor firefighter physical condition for being the primary cause of cardiovascular related deaths. However, over the last 20 years, studies and research has indicated the toxic gasses put fire service personnel at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular related conditions and death. For instance, carbon monoxide, present in nearly all fire environments, and hydrogen cyanide, formed during the combustion of paper, cotton, plastics, and other substances containing carbon and nitrogen. The substances inside of materials change during combustion their bi-products interfere with the transport of oxygen in the body. Hypoxia can then lead to heart injury. In addition, chronic exposure to particulate matter in smoke is associated with atherosclerosis. Noise exposures may contribute to hypertension and possibly ischemic heart disease. Other factors associated with firefighting, such as stress, heat stress, and heavy physical exertion, also increase the risk of cardiovascular events.|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{for reasons}} it never clearly explained, the ICC {{eliminated}} the 24-hour cycle rule, and reinstated the 15-hour <b>on-duty</b> limit. With 10hours of driving and 8hours of sleep, drivers {{were allowed to}} maintain an 18-hour cycle, disrupting the driver's natural 24-hour circadian rhythm. This change allowed up to 16hours of driving per day, allowing the driver to exhaust their weekly limits {{in as little as}} fivedays. Later, an added exception for trucks equipped with sleeper berths meant drivers were allowed to [...] "split" [...] their 8-hour off-duty time into two parts. With the new splitting provision, a driver could take two 4-hour periods of rest. Using one of these short rest periods would effectively [...] "stop the <b>on-duty</b> clock", allowing the driver to split the 15-hour <b>on-duty</b> time limit into two parts as well. These rules allowed for 10hours of work within a 15-hour time limit, and 8hours of rest within an 18-hour day.|$|E
