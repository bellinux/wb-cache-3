5|$|According to {{personal}} {{accounts of the}} battle, after dismounting Dodge offered his men a chance {{to back out of}} the <b>operation.</b> <b>No</b> one opted out, and 21 men advanced with Dodge in an extended firing line, unsure of the enemy's location. The remaining eight soldiers were posted as guards on high grounds and near the horses. Unlike the disorganized and undisciplined troops at Stillman's Run, the volunteers at Horseshoe Bend adhered to military discipline; they waited for Dodge to give the order before they entered the thicket and swampland in search of their enemy, and once searching they awaited their commander's order to attack.|$|E
5|$|At 04:45, 7 November No. 4 Commando {{were ready}} to start their assault, with No. 3 Troop on the left, the two French troops {{in the middle and}} No. 2 Troop on the right. The commandos moved forward, winning a number of small skirmishes, when at 08:15 three German {{officers}} appeared and offered the surrender of all the remaining German forces in the area. Lieutenant Colonel Dawson met with the German commander and a formal surrender was agreed and 900 prisoners were taken. Other Germans surrendered to some of the Royal Marine commandos at the same time. In the whole <b>operation</b> <b>No.</b> 4 Commando had suffered 13 dead, 21 wounded versus about 200 German dead and the capture of 1,200 prisoners and large amounts of weapons and equipment.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the landing orders were issued to ensure everyone was fit and to concentrate on weapons firing and street fighting. The two French troops were still under command and just for this <b>operation</b> <b>No.</b> 4 Commando took command of a section from the Dutch Troop, No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, and groups from the Special Boat Section (SBS), Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery to call for artillery fire support. For some reason the old method of calling troops by {{letters of the alphabet}} was dropped and the troops were now numbered. The No.1 to No.4 Troops were British and No.s 5 and 6 French. The heavy weapons troop was No. 4 Troop. The final plan for the assault was for the SBS and a section from No. 1 Troop, to go first and reconnoitre a suitable landing point. Following them, the rest of No.1, No. 2 Troop and commando headquarters would secure the beachhead. They would then be joined by the remaining troops, passing through the beachhead and into the town. No.1 Troop would secure the left flank and No. 2 Troop the right.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 1942 a major landing {{took place}} at the French coastal town of Dieppe. The main force was {{provided}} by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, supported by No. 3 and No. 4 Commandos. The mission of No. 3 Commando was to neutralize a German coastal battery near Berneval-le-Grand that {{was in a position to}} fire upon the landing at Dieppe. The landing craft carrying No. 3 Commando ran into a German coastal convoy. Only a handful of commandos, under the second in command Major Peter Young, landed and scaled the barbed wire laced cliffs. Eventually 18 Commandos reached the perimeter of the battery via Berneval and engaged the target with small arms fire. Although unable to destroy the guns, they prevented the Germans from firing effectively on the main assault by harassing their gun crews with sniper fire. In a subsidiary <b>operation</b> <b>No.</b> 4 Commando landed in force along with the French Troop No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando and 50 United States Army Rangers and destroyed the artillery battery at Varengeville. Most of No. 4 Commando safely returned to England. Captain Patrick Porteous of No. 4 Commando was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the raid.|$|E

25|$|On November 1, 1943, the Marine amphibious {{landing at}} Cape Torokina, Bougainville, was {{strongly}} resisted by the sole piece of artillery {{available to the}} Japanese defenders, a well-camouflaged 75 millimeter regimental gun. Strategically placed and protected within a coconut log bunker, the gun had already destroyed four landing craft and damaged ten others, seriously threatening {{the success of the}} <b>operation.</b> <b>No</b> boats could approach the beach without passing within 150 yards or less from the muzzle. The emplacement was so situated that it could only be attacked from the front and also in a position whereby rifle fire and grenades could not reach the gun crew.|$|E
25|$|Though {{much safer}} than hydrogen, the greatly added expense, lack of availability, and overall {{degradation}} in lifting performance that converting to helium would impose on the Graf Zeppelin made its continued <b>operation</b> <b>no</b> longer commercially viable.

2500|$|Following the British {{attack on}} the French fleet at Mers-el-Kebir a pro-Vichy {{government}} had been installed on the island, and the British concern about the island being occupied by the Axis grew.

For this <b>operation,</b> <b>No.</b> 5 Commando, numbering some 365 men {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel W.

2500|$|The {{squadron}} rapidly {{developed a}} formidable reputation in operations against German forces; {{in one month}} it was credited with shooting down 22 German Bf-109 fighters. It was involved in {{many different kinds of}} operation, including offensive patrols, convoy escort and bomber escort missions over Europe. One of the most unusual occurred on 19 August 1941, when the Kenley Wing—among others—had to escort a formation that included a Blenheim bomber that—with the co-operation of the Germans—dropped an artificial leg by parachute, for British ace Douglas Bader, who was a prisoner of war. The bombers then flew on to bomb the Gosnay power plant. In the dogfighting that took place during the <b>operation,</b> <b>No.</b> 452 Squadron was heavily engaged, shooting down one aircraft and scoring [...] "probable" [...] victories over two others; several of its aircraft were damaged.|$|E
