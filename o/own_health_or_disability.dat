40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{contrast}} between describing {{the benefit of a}} healthcare intervention as gain in <b>health</b> (QALY-type ideas) <b>or</b> a <b>disability</b> reduction (DALY-type ideas). The background is an apparent convergence in practice of the work conducted under both traditions. In the light of these methodological developments, we contrast a health planner who wants to maximise health and one who wants to minimise disability. To isolate the effect of framing the problem from a <b>health</b> <b>or</b> a <b>disability</b> perspective, we do not use age-weighting in calculating DALY and employ a common discounting methodology and the same set of quality of life weights. We find that interventions will be ranked in a systematically different way. The difference, however, is not determined by the use of a <b>health</b> <b>or</b> a <b>disability</b> perspective but by the use of life expectancy tables to determine the years of life lost. We show that this feature of the DALY method is problematic and we suggest its dismissal in favour of a fixed reference age rendering the use of a <b>health</b> <b>or</b> a <b>disability</b> perspective merely stylistic.

In self-funded health care, the employer assumes the direct risk for payment of the claims for benefits.

40|$|Abstract. Unpaid caring {{is defined}} as any help or support {{provided}} to family members, friends, neighbours or others because of their long-term physical <b>or</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>or</b> <b>disability,</b> <b>or</b> problems related to old age. It is estimated that there are over 6 million unpaid carers in the UK. In this paper we examine geographic and social variations {{in the amount of}} unpaid caring across England and Wales with a particular focus on carers aged 40 and over. Using the Samples of Anonymised Records from the 2001 Census we analyse individual sub-national geographic variations in the amount of unpaid caring in England and Wales. We make a distinction in terms of whether an unpaid carer provides care within or outside of their own household since there might be different geographies and characteristics of carers. As would be expected, we find a strong geographical relationship between levels of illness and of unpaid care. However, when this is disaggregated by whether the care is provided within or outside of the household we find that care away from the home is likely to be outside the geographical area in which the carer lives. Our individual level analyses suggest an association between rates of unpaid caring and a person’s age, social class categorisation, their ethnicity and the carer’s <b>own</b> <b>health</b> status. Moreover, thes...|$|R

The findings are based on empirical research conducted with 17 statutory complaint bodies with legislative remit to conciliate complaints about <b>health</b> <b>or</b> <b>disability</b> services, <b>or</b> discrimination. The research explored the statutory bodies’ models and approaches to conciliation, their decision-making processes, criteria used in decision making, legislative and contextual factors affecting referrals to conciliation, and approaches to power imbalances, capacity and participation of people with disabilities. On the basis of these findings, an ‘enabling model of decision making’ is proposed to address the important issues of equal and effective access to conciliation...|$|R

In 1971 it provided first tier universal needs-based cash transfers via its Supplementary Benefit program. It provided somewhat higher second tier cash transfers via its Unemployment Benefit program for those expected to work. Great Britain’s major social insurance program for working age people with disabilities between 1971 and 1995 was its Invalidity Benefit (IVB). All those of working age who were deemed unable to work in their usual occupation on grounds of ill <b>health</b> <b>or</b> <b>disability</b> (determined largely by the claimant’s family doctor) and who had a record of sufficient social insurance contributions (paid during employment) were eligible, initially for Sickness Benefit (the first 28 weeks) and subsequently for IVB.|$|R

However, it also includes concepts of health equity, economic equality and other social securities. It also includes equal opportunities and obligations, and so involves the whole of society. Social equality requires the absence of legally enforced social class or caste boundaries and the absence of discrimination motivated by an inalienable part of a person's identity. For example, sex, gender, race, age, sexual orientation, origin, caste or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, <b>health</b> <b>or</b> <b>disability</b> must not result in unequal treatment under the law and should not reduce opportunities unjustifiably.|$|R

40|$|This article takes a long-view of {{the huge}} rise in {{disability}} claimant numbers in the UK since the early 1980 s and looks ahead to the trends that can now be expected to emerge {{in an era of}} fiscal austerity and welfare reform. The article's central thesis is that disability numbers are best understood as part of a triangular relationship between levels of employment, unemployment and sickness. In particular, the big decline of industrial employment in many places has often resulted in large-scale 'hidden unemployment' on disability benefits, especially among low-skilled workers. Looking ahead, the UK's welfare reforms are set to reduce disability claimant numbers but principally by restricting access to Employment and Support Allowance, the new disability benefit. The main effect will be to divert substantial numbers of men and women with ill <b>health</b> <b>or</b> <b>disability</b> onto unemployment benefits instead or, more often, out of the benefits system altogether...|$|R
