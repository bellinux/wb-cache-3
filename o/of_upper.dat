40|$|To {{achieve the}} {{efficiency}} and specification <b>of</b> the flat-knitted <b>uppers</b> design, the basic patterns <b>of</b> <b>uppers</b> are made from shoe lasts based on the research {{on the characteristics of}} human’s feet and wearability requirements on uppers. The knitting technology for half-shaped and fully shaped uppers was formed after the shear deformation of basic pattern and combination with flat knitting technology. As regards to the functional requirements on key parts <b>of</b> <b>uppers,</b> the structures <b>of</b> flat-knitted shaped <b>uppers</b> were intensively analysed and studied, dividing them into two categories (functional structure and decorative structure), discussing the knitting methods and advantages of different structure, and finally experimentally proving that the planar pattern <b>of</b> flat knitted <b>uppers</b> can apply to the design <b>of</b> flat-knitted <b>uppers</b> and achieve the combination of functionality and artistry of sneakers after combining with structural changes, with a great significance on the achievement of the efficient production <b>of</b> <b>uppers</b> and the enhancement of its commercial value...|$|R

5|$|Domitian {{probably}} {{wanted a}} new {{war against the}} Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia.

Eventually the Romans achieved a decisive victory against Decebalus in 106. Again, the Roman army sustained heavy losses, but Trajan succeeded in capturing Sarmizegetusa and, importantly, annexed the Dacian gold and silver mines.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Lima was {{adversely}} affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and the important mining region <b>of</b> <b>Upper</b> Peru was transferred to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This economic decline made the city's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence. In the 1810s, the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led by a strong viceroy, José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa.|$|E
5|$|Free {{from their}} loyalties to the pharaoh, local rulers began {{competing}} {{with each other}} for territorial control and political power. By 2160BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control <b>of</b> <b>Upper</b> Egypt in the south. As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable. Around 2055BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands. They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.|$|E
