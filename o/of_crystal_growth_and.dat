40|$|Electromagnetic {{fields were}} used in twin-roll casting (TRC) of {{aluminum}} alloy 5052 (AA 5052) for improvement of the microstructure and mechanical properties. A static magnetic field induces an inhibiting effect on the melt in the cast-rolling area and reduces diffusion of the solutes. It also results in more nucleating opportunities and less segregation, thus enhancing the mechanical properties. However, the static magnetic field {{does not change the}} orientation <b>of</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> columnar crystals still exist in microstructure. On the other hand, an oscillating magnetic field can refine the suspended particles and induce strong convection. This leads to more uniform distribution of temperature and solute elements, simultaneously increasing nucleating opportunities and decreasing segregation, thereby enhancing the mechanical properties. An oscillating magnetic field also inhibits the orientation <b>of</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>growth</b> <b>and</b> makes finer and equiaxed grains...|$|E

40|$|The {{process of}} {{structural}} transformation f electrodeposited amorphous Ni-P alloy (hereafter {{referred to as}} a-Ni-P) was investigated. Heat-treated a-Ni-P sample films were etched and examined with an optical microscope and three kinds of characteristic crystalline patterns were observed. Using an x-ray diffractometer and a wavelength dispersive x-ray spec-troscope, they were identified as NisP 4 crystals containing Ni, NiP crystals containing Ni, and Ni~P and NiP 2 crystals con-taining Ni. Their existence ratios were obtained by measuring {{the areas of the}} respective crystalline patterns which ap-peared {{on the surface of the}} sample films. In addition, the existence ratios in the process of quantitative <b>growths</b> <b>and</b> disappearances <b>of</b> the <b>crystals</b> during heat-treatment <b>of</b> electrodeposited a-Ni-P under constant heating rate were calcu-lated as functions of temperature.
