5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, but Paul and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there. Reverend Sampson (Howard Bell) then invites {{everyone}} to stand as Charlene and Henry begin their walk up the aisle.

500|$|... (1993) {{shows the}} {{aftermath}} of Tessa's death. MacLeod tells Richie, [...] "She was part of our lives, Richie. Never pretend she wasn't." [...] MacLeod also advises Richie {{to get used to}} her loss, because it [...] "won't be the last time it happens to you." [...] Later, while MacLeod trains Richie roughly so that he can face Immortal Annie Devlin (Sheena Easton), Richie angrily tells MacLeod, [...] "You can't get past it, Mac. I know.

But you had to be the hero, you sent us <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> that night, you could have been there ...You look me in the eyes and you tell me you don't blame yourself for her death."

5000|$|They {{had three}} tours {{in the state}} of Texas, and got into some trouble with {{authorities}} there. D-loc would not give a lot of information on this topic, but Richter said this, [...] "Me and D was just rhymin... after the show we headed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> not knowing that police would be waiting for us. One of the girls that were at the concert had gotten hit by the falling speaker me and D were playin with." ...|$|R

500|$|Back in Scranton, Jim and Dwight (Rainn Wilson) {{have been}} named the {{reluctant}} heads of the Party Planning Committee by Michael due to previous fights between Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Angela (Angela Kinsey). Jim and Dwight prove terrible at the job, especially when an upset Kelly (Mindy Kaling) chastises them for forgetting her birthday. They {{try to make it}} up to her by throwing a party but they do a poor job, choosing horrible decorations and forgetting Kelly's age. Dwight reads her file and learns Kelly spent time in juvenile hall, but is disappointed to learn it does not affect her job performance. Meanwhile, Andy (Ed Helms) finds himself attracted to Julia, a female potential client who is talking with Stanley (Leslie David Baker). Andy repeatedly acts awkwardly in front of Julia, and accidentally sets off her car alarm while trying to look inside and find out what music she likes. Andy admits his attraction to her to Stanley, who then gives the potential client over to Andy in exchange for two of his clients. [...] After walking her <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> Andy tries to kiss her, but is immediately rebuked. Andy apologizes and mentions that he just got out of a relationship. The client claims she also just got out of a relationship and Andy starts feeling a connection, but she still rejects him and he loses the account.|$|E

60|$|The youth drained his glass, {{watched it}} replenished, and drained it again. Then they went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "And they'll {{hear from}} me," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "and {{the fellow who}} sent them <b>out</b> <b>to</b> run <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> for us will hear from me, too," [...] he added.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport is}} {{connected}} with Moose Jaw by Highway 301 (connecting with Trans Canada Highway-Saskatchewan Highway of Heros) <b>to</b> westside of <b>the</b> airport.

60|$|Though {{this time}} he heard his own voice and {{knew that it was}} curt, though she was looking at him with wide-eyed reproach, he stumped into the hall, jerked on his ulster and furlined gloves, and went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> start <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Cerebos salt," [...] she said. [...] "One gets {{carried away}} a little. I just {{got hold of}} it and carried it <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> I thought {{we might have to}} salt things later." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lee {{followed}} him <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> eager to secure {{all she could}} of his wisdom. He repeated his instructions. [...] "Medicine can't help her much," [...] he said, [...] "but diet can do a great deal. Get her out of that rut she's in. Good-bye." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus it {{came about}} that, three days later, I descended from the train at Styles St. Mary, an absurd little station, with no {{apparent}} reason for existence, perched up {{in the midst of}} green fields and country lanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform, and piloted me <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
60|$|Together they {{descended the}} stairs, and passed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waiting <b>car.</b> <b>The</b> Russian was shaking with rage. The hotel {{servants}} surrounded them.

50|$|Damon {{fights with}} Frederick {{and two other}} vampires when Alaric shows up to help him. Frederick escapes and Damon {{searches}} <b>the</b> house <b>to</b> find him {{but he is not}} there. They try <b>to</b> get <b>out</b> <b>to</b> head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> but a bunch of vampires appear and they return in. Pearl and Anna return home to find them inside. Damon explains what happened before he and Alaric walk out the door, leaving Pearl and Anna behind with all the vampire bodies.|$|R
50|$|In February 1932 Rover Coventry {{announced}} {{strengthening of}} their Family Ten chassis by using heavier gauge material and re-designed cross members to improve torsional rigidity.

6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] she cried. [...] "This man {{was very}} kind. Just {{get us out}} of here, David, as quickly as you can." [...] And, turning to Jimmy: [...] "How can I ever repay you?

6000|$|Kurt tingled {{all over}} as he {{followed}} the official <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and took the seat given him beside the driver. [...] "Back to Glencoe," [...] was the order. And then, even if conversation had been in order, it would scarcely have been possible. That driver could drive! He had no fear and he knew his car. Kurt could drive himself, but he thought {{that if he had}} been as good as this fellow he would have chosen one of two magnificent services for the army--an ambulance-driver at the front or an aeroplane scout.|$|E
6000|$|The {{customers}} were served. While they ate and drank, {{and talked about}} what they had eaten and drunk at lunch at an inn, they were unconscious of two old pairs of eyes that watched them from the kitchen door, as brightly, as furtively, as excitedly as two birds in a secret thicket. The host paid without remarks what seemed to the Applebys an enormous bill, a dollar and sixty cents, and rambled <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> still unknowing that two happy people wanted to follow him with their blessings. This history is unable to give any further data regarding him; when his car went round the bend he disappeared from {{the fortunes of the}} Applebys, and he was not to know how much blessing he had scattered. I say, perhaps he was you who read this--you didn't by any chance happen to be motoring between Yarmouth and Truro, May 16, 1915, did you? With five in the party; coffee-colored car with one mud-guard slightly twisted? ...|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Franchitti {{finished}} second at the Twelve Hours of Sebring in the Highcroft Racing Honda Performance Development ARX-01e, which turned <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> {{first and only}} race. He made an end-of-year start with Level 5 Motorsports {{in one of its}} Honda Performance Development ARX-01g's at the Petit Le Mans.|$|R
50|$|A {{group of}} riders caught the vehicle, broke its rear windshield, slashed the tires, and {{assaulted}} the motorist {{when he got}} <b>out.</b> Damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> was estimated at $1,500.

Two cyclists were arrested for vandalism <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Seattle police did not charge the motorist.|$|R
25|$|Charlie Babbitt is in {{the middle}} of {{importing}} four Lamborghinis to Los Angeles for resale. He needs <b>to</b> deliver <b>the</b> vehicles <b>to</b> impatient buyers who have already made down payments in order <b>to</b> repay <b>the</b> loan he took <b>out</b> <b>to</b> buy <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> but <b>the</b> EPA is holding <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> at <b>the</b> port due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> failing emissions regulations.

50|$|The VIC {{was not a}} {{check on}} any repairs carried <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> and did not certify its {{roadworthiness}} or mechanical safety, {{which was part of}} the MOT test.|$|E
50|$|Kramer's itch has healed and {{he plans}} to break up with Olive by pretending that the {{mannequin}} (which is outside in Jerry's car) is his new girlfriend. However, when he goes <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and pretends to make out with it, it falls apart in his hands.|$|E
50|$|When Glen discovers this, he attacks Bone at her Aunt Alma's house, {{breaking}} {{her arm and}} raping her on {{the kitchen}} floor. Anney walks in on him and fights him off. Glen follows the two <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> begging Anney to kill him rather than abandon him. To Bone's disgust and amazement, Anney ends up crying and throwing her arms around Glen.|$|E
50|$|At trial, Johnson did not {{testify in}} his own defense but later told reporters that Vest had murdered Wetterman. Johnson {{maintained}} that he had been driving but had remained in <b>the</b> <b>car</b> while Vest got <b>out</b> <b>to</b> fill <b>the</b> <b>car</b> with petrol. Johnson said he did not even see Wetterman. He claimed that Vest shot the attendant and then yelling, “Go, go, go!”, jumped back into <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He was too languid {{to respond}} as he desired. He said {{what was to}} be said about the Christian bearing of crosses, and went <b>out</b> <b>to</b> clean <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Dully, patiently, he scraped linty grease from the drip-pan, gouged at the mud caked on the wheels. He used up many minutes in washing his hands; scoured them with gritty kitchen soap; rejoiced in hurting his plump knuckles. [...] "Damn soft hands--like a woman's. Aah!" ...|$|R
25|$|Instead {{of a pair}} of {{horizontal}} bolts that allow <b>the</b> caliper <b>to</b> move straight in and <b>out</b> respective <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> body, a swinging caliper utilizes a single, vertical pivot bolt located somewhere behind the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole caliper inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper's piston angle changes relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower on the front on the inside.|$|R

5000|$|The manager {{gets back}} behind his counter and almost sees the {{suitcase}} moving several times (Bean being in it changing). Matthew then {{comes back and}} locks the suitcase, and brings it <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> dropping it on the stairs. Just then, Mr Bean {{shows up at the}} counter in a sparkly gown and wig and lipstick, saying [...] "426 please", and the manager replies [...] "certainly, madam".|$|E
50|$|The gang, {{along with}} hostages Edward A. Lundgren and a teller named Everett Kesinger, headed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> by {{a back door}} and roared out of town. After fending off the sheriff in a car chase that ended at a {{crossing}} on Sand Creek northeast of Lamar, where the robbers used rifles to disable the sheriff's car, the gang made good its escape. Ralph Fleagle was driving the 1927 blue Buick Master Six getaway car.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Lane Dixon (Jared Leto), a hitchhiker, {{is picked}} up by Bob (Danny Glover), a drifter driving a white Cadillac Eldorado {{upholstered}} with pictures of naked women. Unnerved by the pictures, Dixon asks <b>to</b> be let <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> at a miners' bar, which Bob warns against. Dixon is in the bar {{for a few minutes}} before getting beat up by a group of miners. Bob rescues Dixon and sends him <b>out</b> <b>to</b> retrieve <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> As Dixon drives them away, Bob reveals that he has slashed all the tires in the parking lot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's the Hill Country express now!" [...] said Birkwall. [...] "You won't {{change your}} mind? Well, your Kent Harbor train backs down after this goes out.
