40|$|THESIS 10822 This thesis {{presents}} a comparative reading {{of place in}} selected works by Jean Rhys and Elizabeth Bowen in the context <b>of</b> settler <b>colonialism.</b> In arguing that Anglo- Irish and Creole identities were formed out of the dynamics <b>of</b> settler <b>colonialism</b> in places where settler states never emerged, the crisis <b>of</b> settler <b>colonialism</b> is understood here {{to be one of}} belonging, emanating from a tension between identity and place, encapsulated in the refrain ?Who am I, and where do I belong?...|$|R
5|$|While sculptors Eric Schilsky (1898–1974) and Hew Lorimer (1907–93) {{worked in}} the {{existing}} tradition of modelling and carving, sculptor and artist Eduardo Paolozzi (1924–2005) was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world. George Wyllie (1921–2012), produced works {{of social and political}} commentary including the Straw Locomotive (1987), an event which raised questions about the decline of heavy industry and the nature <b>of</b> <b>colonialism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the ethics <b>of</b> <b>colonialism.</b> Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|Historian Jean-Claude Willame {{argued that}} the speech {{was the result of}} Lumumba's growing {{frustration}} with the process of independence which he believed might represent a purely nominal change in government with no real effects. Lumumba blamed Kasa-Vubu and his colleagues for failing to publicly oppose this situation. Gender historians have therefore {{argued that the}} speech was the result of Lumumba's growing feeling of emasculation. Others have pointed to the influence of Belgian Socialist delegates and representatives of the Guinean President, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who had a strongly Marxist ideology, all of whom hoped a public and international denouncement <b>of</b> <b>colonialism</b> would help them politically.|$|E

5|$|While in Lagos, Achebe {{started work}} on a novel. This was challenging, since very little African fiction had been written in English, {{although}} Amos Tutuola's Palm-Wine Drinkard (1952) and Cyprian Ekwensi's People of the City (1954) were notable exceptions. While appreciating Ekwensi's work, Achebe worked hard to develop his own style, even as he pioneered {{the creation of the}} Nigerian novel itself. A visit to Nigeria by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956 brought issues <b>of</b> <b>colonialism</b> and politics to the surface, and was a significant moment for Achebe.|$|E
5|$|A general {{perception}} on Narayan {{was that}} he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of The New Yorker, although Narayan's writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader's mind. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context of his subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book Modern South Asian Literature in English, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence <b>of</b> <b>colonialism.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1928, Nasser went to Alexandria to {{live with}} his {{maternal}} grandfather and attend the city's Attarin elementary school. He left in 1929 for a private boarding school in Helwan, and later returned to Alexandria to enter the Ras el-Tin secondary school and to join his father, who was working for the city's postal service. It was in Alexandria that Nasser became involved in political activism. After witnessing clashes between protesters and police in Manshia Square, he joined the demonstration without being aware of its purpose. The protest, organized by the ultranationalist Young Egypt Society, called for the end <b>of</b> <b>colonialism</b> in Egypt {{in the wake of the}} 1923 Egyptian constitution's annulment by Prime Minister Isma'il Sidqi. Nasser was arrested and detained for a night before his father bailed him out.|$|E

5|$|Specific {{proposed}} high-risk transmission channels, {{allowing the}} virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence <b>of</b> <b>colonialism</b> and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including {{a higher degree of}} sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of genital ulcer diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities. While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are typically low, they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection resulting in genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers to the degree that as of 1928 as many as 45% of female residents of eastern Leopoldville were thought to have been prostitutes and as of 1933 around 15% of all residents of the same city were infected by one of the forms of syphilis.|$|E
5|$|The British government's {{refusal to}} grant {{independence}} to Southern Rhodesia under the 1961 constitution was largely {{the result of}} the geopolitical and moral shifts associated with the Wind of Change, coupled with the UK's wish to avoid opprobrium and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. The issue gained international attention in Africa and worldwide as a flashpoint for questions of decolonisation and racism. By the early 1960s, general consensus in the post-colonial UN—particularly the General Assembly, where the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby were collectively very strong—roundly denounced all forms <b>of</b> <b>colonialism,</b> and supported communist-backed black nationalist insurgencies across southern Africa, regarding them as racial liberation movements. Amid the Cold War, Britain opposed the spread of Soviet and Chinese influence into Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly expressed reservations or backed down on NIBMAR in the Southern Rhodesia question. Once the topic of Southern Rhodesia came to the fore in the UN and other bodies, particularly the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), even maintaining the status quo became regarded as unacceptable internationally, causing the UK government a great deal of embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|The {{leader of}} the Congolese {{province}} of Katanga, Moise Tshombe, requested British and Rhodesian forces to enter the country to restore order. Welensky was sympathetic to the situation but unable to act; the British government, which had ultimate jurisdiction over the federation, disallowed him from mobilising the armed forces. Tshombe declared Katanga unilaterally independent on 11 July, one day after requesting British and Rhodesian assistance. Welensky pleaded with Macmillan to deploy the Rhodesian forces but Macmillan rebuffed him, telling Welensky their hopes were pinned on the United Nations being able to restore order, and hoping for a wholly neutral or anti-communist Congo. United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, hoping to negotiate a solution to Katanga's secession, agreed to meet Tshombe at Ndola. However, Hammarskjöld's plane crashed close to Ndola, and he was killed. Welensky was subsequently blamed for the accident throughout the communist and Afro-Asian world, becoming a hated figure and a lingering symbol <b>of</b> <b>colonialism.</b> Welensky's attitude towards Katanga and the Congo would strain relations between the federation and the British until its dissolution.|$|E

5|$|Following the Hong Kong {{handover}} ceremony, {{when the}} Union Jack and the Hong Kong blue ensign were lowered to symbolise {{the end of}} British rule in Hong Kong, the blue ensign lost its official status {{and was replaced by}} the current flag of Hong Kong. In the 2010s, the former flag of Hong Kong was used by protesters to represent the cultural differences between Hong Kong and China; the flag was also used to protest Chinese interference in Hong Kong, as well as perceived Chinese breaches of Hong Kong's universal suffrage (granted by the Sino-British Joint Declaration). The first high-profile use of the old flag in protests came in 2011 during pro-democracy protests. Protesters often stated that they did not use the blue ensign to endorse Hong Kong independence or the return of Hong Kong to British control, but rather because they felt that Hong Kong had greater freedom under British rule. The protesters also said that they used the flag to express the contrasting values of China and Hong Kong. Advocates of the Hong Kong Independence Movement and the Hong Kong Autonomy Movement use a derivative of the blue ensign, without the Union Jack and with the Chinese characters for Hong Kong (香港) in the centre of the arms. The right to display the old flag is protected under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance and the Hong Kong Basic Law as an expression of free speech. Despite this, when the old flag began appearing in protests, pro-Beijing newspapers called for it to be banned. The pro-Beijing camp views the flag as a symbol <b>of</b> <b>colonialism</b> and a reminder of China's losses during the era of New Imperialism.|$|E
