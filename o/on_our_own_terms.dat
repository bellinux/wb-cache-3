Every wave that breaks on her shore rattles the keys of her prison. I am no fire-eater, Herr Rebinok, but I confess that when I am at Dover, say, or Southampton, and see those dark blots on the sea and those grey specks in the sky, our battleships and cruisers and aircraft, and realise what they mean to us my heart beats just a little quicker. If every German was flung out of England to-morrow, in three weeks' time we should be coming in again <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> <b>terms.</b> With our sea scouts and air scouts spread in organised network around, not a shipload of foodstuff could reach the country.

40|$|In {{this paper}} 1 {{we present a}} new {{approach}} for automatic summarization of rushes, or unstructured video. Our approach is composed of three major steps. First, based on shot and sub-shot segmentations, we filter sub-shots with low information content {{not likely to be}} useful in a summary. Sec-ond, a method using maximal matching in a bipartite graph is adapted to measure similarity between the remaining shots and to minimize inter-shot redundancy by removing repetitive retake shots common in rushes video. Finally, the presence of faces and motion intensity are charac-terised in each sub-shot. A measure of how representative the sub-shot is {{in the context of the}} overall video is then proposed. Video summaries composed of keyframe slideshows are then generated. In order to evalu-ate the effectiveness of this approach we re-run the evaluation carried out 1 The original publication is available at www. springerlink. com. DOI: 10. 1007 /s 11042 - 009 - 0398 - 1 1 by TRECVid, using the same dataset and evaluation metrics used in the TRECVid video summarization task in 2007 but with <b>our</b> <b>own</b> assessors.
