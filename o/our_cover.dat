2500|$|Pre-release {{comments}} of Dragon Age: Inquisition were positive. Kotaku writer Jason Schrier had very good first impressions, noting the game's apparent ambition and BioWare's ability {{to listen to}} fans. GamesRadar listed the game as their second best shown at PAX 2013, commenting on its openness and combat. John Walker of Rock, Paper, Shotgun was pleased to hear of the top-view camera coming back, though remained cautious; after playing the demo, {{he said he was}} [...] "left optimistic, but uninformed". Game Informers [...] Kimberley Wallace listed it {{as one of the most}} anticipated RPGs to be released in 2014, saying [...] "Dragon Age: Inquisition has a lot to prove after BioWare received plenty of feedback from disappointed fans about Dragon Age II. However, if <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> trip was any indication, BioWare is up for the challenge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Special Operations: In the mid-1980s, R set up two covert groups, Counterintelligence Team-X(CIT-X) and Counterintelligence Team-J(CIT-J), {{the first}} {{directed}} at Pakistan {{and the second}} at Khalistani groups. Rabinder Singh, the RAW double agent who defected to the United States in 2004, helped run CIT-J in its early years. Both these covert groups used the services of cross-border traffickers to ferry weapons and funds across the border, much as their ISI counterparts were doing. According to former RAW official and noted security analyst B. Raman, the Indian counter-campaign yielded results. [...] "The role of <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> action capability in {{putting an end to}} the ISI's interference in Punjab", he wrote in 2002, [...] "by making such interference prohibitively costly is little known and understood." [...] These covert operations were discontinued during the tenure of IK Gujral and were never restarted. As per B Raman the former RAW cabinet secretary, such covert operations were successful in keeping a check on ISI and were [...] "responsible for ending the Khalistani insurgency". He also notes that a lack of such covert capabilities, since they were closed down in 1997, has left the country even more vulnerable than before and says that developing covert capabilities is the need of the hour.|$|E
60|$|We {{slept in}} the bed of our wagon-box that night while the crew rode away to fight a prairie fire. We heard them come quietly in toward dawn, and when we awoke and looked out of <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> we saw them lying all about us on the ground each rolled up in his {{tarpaulin}} like a boulder. Altogether it was a stirring glimpse of ranch life for my city-bred wife.|$|E
6000|$|... “The Major {{is going}} to draw <b>our</b> <b>covers</b> to-morrow,” {{announced}} the lady, with a certain heavy satisfaction. “Smithers is confident that we’ll {{be able to show}} him some sport; he swears he’s seen a fox in the nut copse three times this week.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The April, 1978 {{issue of}} Mad Magazine {{featured}} a giant barcode on the cover, with the blurb [...] "Mad Hopes this issue jams up every {{computer in the}} country...for forcing us to deface <b>our</b> <b>covers</b> with this yecchy UPC symbol from now on!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then let us give Tom Potts some shootin at any rate; the ruffian {{is always}} poachin about <b>our</b> <b>covers</b> as it is.

6000|$|... "This is {{the best}} cover I ever yet got into," [...] said the Pathfinder, with his quiet laugh, after having been on the outside to reconnoitre; [...] "the leaves of our new trees fairly touch those of the bushes over our heads. Hist!--yonder comes Eau-douce, wading, like a {{sensible}} boy, as he is, to leave his trail in the water; and we shall soon see whether <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> is good for anything or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are a good}} girl, Mabel, {{and very}} like the Dunhams. But you must halt here.

We are about to go into the channel used by the French, where we shall lie in wait, perhaps a week, to {{intercept}} their supply-boats, which are about to pass up on their way to Frontenac, loaded, in particular, with a heavy amount of Indian goods." ...|$|E
60|$|I submitted, in all things, to the {{directions}} of my Indian guide. The latter had selected the dark shadows {{of two or}} three young pines for <b>our</b> <b>cover,</b> where, by getting within their low branches, we were completely concealed from any eye that was distant from us eight or ten feet. No sooner were we thus posted, than the Onondago pointed to the trunk of a fallen tree, and we took our seats silently on it. I observed that my companion kept his thumb on the cock of his rifle, while his fore-finger was passed around the trigger. It is scarcely necessary to say that I observed the same precaution.|$|E

60|$|We were to {{pass the}} night on the mountain. Our beds were none of the best, as the reader may suppose, and <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> slight; yet I do not {{remember}} to have opened my eyes {{from the moment they}} were closed, until I awoke in the morning. The fatigue of a forced march did that for us which down cannot obtain for the voluptuary, and we all slept as profoundly as children. Consciousness returned to me, by means of a gentle shake of the shoulder, which proceeded from Susquesus. On arising, I found the Indian still near me, his countenance, {{for the first time since}} I had known him, expressing something like an animated pleasure. He had awoke none of the others, and he signed for me to follow him, without arousing either of my companions. Why I had been thus particularly selected for the scene that succeeded, I cannot say, unless the Onondago's native sagacity had taught him to distinguish between the educations and feelings of us three young men. So it was, however, and I left the rude shelter we had prepared for the night, alone.|$|E
60|$|Neb gave a half-suppressed, negro-like cry of exultation, as we {{shot out}} from <b>our</b> <b>cover,</b> and ascertained {{that there was}} a {{pleasant}} and fair breeze blowing. In three minutes we had the jib and mainsail on the boat, the helm was up, the sheet was eased off, and we were gliding down-stream at the rate of something like five miles an hour. I took the helm, almost as a matter of course; Rupert being much too indolent to do anything unnecessarily, while Neb was far too humble to aspire to such an office while Master Miles was there, willing and ready. In that day, indeed, it was so much a matter of course for the skipper of a Hudson river craft to steer, {{that most of the people}} who lived on the banks of the stream imagined that Sir John Jervis, Lord Anson, and the other great English admirals of whom they had read and heard, usually amused themselves with that employment, out on the ocean. I remember the hearty laugh in which my unfortunate father indulged, when Mr. Hardinge once asked him how he could manage to get any sleep, on account of this very duty. But we were very green, up at Clawbonny, in most things that related to the world.|$|E
60|$|We went at {{a terrific}} pace down the coast, keeping well inshore {{so as to}} avoid, if possible, being seen from the south. Just north of Ilsin a rocky {{headland}} juts out, and that was <b>our</b> <b>cover.</b> On {{the north of the}} peninsula is a small land-locked bay, with deep water. It is large enough to take the yacht, though a much larger vessel could not safely enter. We ran in, and anchored close to the shore, which has a rocky frontage--a natural shelf of rock, which is practically the same as a quay. Here we met the men who had come from Ilsin and the neighbourhood in answer to our signalling earlier in the day. They gave us the latest information regarding the kidnapping of the Voivode, and informed us that every man in that section of the country was simply aflame about it. They assured us that we could rely on them, not merely to fight to the death, but to keep silence absolutely. Whilst the seamen, under the direction of Rooke, took the aeroplane on shore and found a suitable place for it, where it was hidden from casual view, but from which it could be easily launched, the Vladika and I--and, of course, my wife--were hearing such details as were known of the disappearance of her father.|$|E

5000|$|Three Imaginary Boys was {{released}} on 8 May 1979 by record label Fiction.

The [...] "Foxy Lady" [...] soundcheck, with vocals sung by Michael Dempsey, was not supposed to be on the album, and was removed for the American release.

OOTB worked with Defining Movement, Duke's premier multicultural dance group. The video was produced by Freewater Productions Duke and directed by Stephen So.|$|R
5000|$|Dave Wyndorf {{describes}} the album as [...] "a {{return to our}} roots in terms of vibe and recording style. It's full-on psychedelic space-rock with a '60s garage feel, recorded almost exclusively with vintage guitars, amps and effects in our hometown of Red Bank, New Jersey. The songs {{are a kind of}} space-noir, tales of cosmic revenge, peaking libidos, alienation and epic strangeness. It's a weird trip through the back alleys of a dark, retro-future, which not by coincidence very much resembles my own life. laughs The lyrics aren't fantasy really, rather a recounting of my musings on, observations of and general emotional reaction to my life and environment during a 1 week writing period in February of 2013. But I tend to use the vernacular and imagery of science fiction and surrealism to express myself and that's where these lyrics get trippy. There's also <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> version of Donovan's 'Three Kingfishers', which I thought fit the mood of the album." ...|$|E
5000|$|Muscle Insider broke its own rule {{to display}} Pakulski {{on the cover}} of its {{magazine}} in 2012. Scott Welch, its President, stated that the move was to support Pakulski as Canada's #1 IFBB bodybuilder. Welch admitted, [...] "This {{was the first time we}} chose a non-Olympia winner for <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> but as a Canadian magazine, we felt it was very fitting to have Ben on it." [...] Welch explicitly told a writer in 2011 that its cover page was reserved to Mr. Olympia winners, saying, [...] "To get {{on the cover of}} the best bodybuilding magazine in the industry, you need to win the best bodybuilding competition in the industry! Only winners of the Olympia make it on the cover of Muscle Insider." [...] Welch defended the change in decision, saying that amazing bodybuilders would need to be recognized and he felt that Pakulski was not far from winning the Mr. Olympia crown someday.|$|E
5000|$|According to Matt Skiba, {{the band}} were: [...] "doing the photo shoot {{and we had}} a {{completely}} different idea of what the record was going to look like. And Monica was there doing our styling; she got a bunch of outfits and she did the styling for pretty much all the new pictures for the record. She was there and the photographer was just doing all these different things and he had her stand in. He was toying with these different ideas with just a small portion of her face in the picture and then, lo and behold, she's <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> star. So we thought it looked cool and the people at the art department are in cahoots with the photographer who is amazing. Everybody who worked on the thing was cool and hands on and saw these pictures of her and were asking “who is that?” I said “that's my girlfriend” and they said “that's perfect, we have to use her." [...] I think it looks very cinematic, and that's what we were going for. Once it was coming together, it was like film noir.|$|E

5000|$|Edwards joined Yeovil Town for {{a second}} loan spell on 21 September 2012, signing for an initial month. This came after manager Gary Johnson had ruled out a move for Edwards in August 2012, {{remarking}} that [...] "we have got <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> for that position". He was brought on {{as a substitute for}} Sam Foley in Yeovil's 1-0 home defeat by Sheffield United the following day. He received the first red card of his career on 13 October in Yeovil's 3-2 defeat at Tranmere Rovers after collecting two yellow cards for clumsy fouls. He scored his first goal of the season on 10 November as Yeovil beat Hartlepool United 1-0 at Huish Park. Having made 15 loan appearances for Yeovil and with the end of his loan edging closer, Edwards announced that he [...] "would be happy to come back" [...] to the club in January. Having been utilised across the defence and in the centre of midfield, Edwards' loan ended following the 4-1 win over Oldham Athletic on 22 December after making 16 League One appearances and one appearance in the Football League Trophy.|$|E
5000|$|Purves was {{optimistic about}} his invention's prospects. As {{reported}} in a 1932 Popular Science magazine article, after a filmed test drive in 1932 {{on a beach in}} Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, he stated that the Dynasphere [...] "reduced locomotion to the simplest possible form, with consequent economy of power", and that it was [...] "the high-speed vehicle of the future". An article in the February 1935 issue of Meccano Magazine noted that though the Dynasphere was only at an experimental stage, [...] "it possesses so many advantages that we may eventually see gigantic wheels similar to that shown on <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> running along our highways in as large numbers as motor cars do to-day." [...] According to the 2007 book Crazy Cars, one reason the Dynasphere did not succeed was that [...] "while the vehicle could move along just fine, it was almost impossible to steer or brake." [...] Another aspect of the vehicle that received criticism was the phenomenon of [...] "gerbiling"—the tendency when accelerating or braking the vehicle for the independent housing holding the driver within the monowheel to spin within the moving structure.|$|E
