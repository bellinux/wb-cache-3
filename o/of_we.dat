5|$|Night of January 16th was {{the last}} {{theatrical}} success for either Rand or Woods. Rand's next play, Ideal, went unsold, and a 1940 stage adaptation <b>of</b> <b>We</b> the Living flopped. Rand achieved lasting success and financial stability with her 1943 novel, The Fountainhead. Woods produced several more plays; none were hits and {{when he died in}} 1951, he was bankrupt and living in a hotel.|$|E
5|$|Rand's work on The Fountainhead was {{repeatedly}} interrupted. In 1937, {{she took a}} break from it to write a novella called Anthem. She also completed a stage adaptation <b>of</b> <b>We</b> the Living that ran briefly in 1940. That same year, she became active in politics. She first worked as a volunteer in Wendell Willkie's presidential campaign, and then attempted to form a group for conservative intellectuals. As her royalties from earlier projects ran out, she began doing freelance work as a script reader for movie studios. When Rand finally found a publisher, the novel was only one-third complete.|$|E
