5|$|Besides chairing the House Business Affairs Committee {{during the}} regular {{legislative}} session, in November 2008, Rice was named vice-chair of a special legislative Committee on Job Creation and Economic Growth, tasked with developing recommendations on bolstering Colorado's economy before the 2009 legislative session. The committee presented a slate of jobs-related legislation {{at the start of}} the 2009 session; <b>one</b> <b>measure,</b> sponsored by Rice, would offer tax credits to companies that create 20 jobs in urban areas or 10 jobs in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>measure</b> of an instrument's {{usefulness}} {{is to see}} {{how closely}} it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown {{to have a high}} one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).|$|E
5|$|The dating of recessions {{during this}} period is controversial. Modern {{economic}} statistics, such as gross domestic product and unemployment, were not gathered {{during this period}}. Victor Zarnowitz evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions. From 1834 to 1929, <b>one</b> <b>measure</b> of recessions is the Cleveland Trust Company index, which measured business activity and, beginning in 1882, an index of trade and industrial activity was available, {{which can be used}} to compare recessions.|$|E

50|$|A 6 m deep Submarine Escape Training Tank for diving and escape-training {{was built}} at Galärvarvet in Stockholm in 1934. Later, two other diving tanks were constructed: a first <b>one</b> <b>measuring</b> 6 m depth in Göteborg, built in 1943, {{and a second}} <b>one</b> <b>measuring</b> 21 m depth (including a 2 m deep escape chamber) in Karlskrona.|$|R
5|$|Predators of waders {{breeding}} in wet grasslands include birds such {{as large}} gulls, common raven, carrion and hooded crows, and great and Arctic skuas; foxes occasionally take waders, {{and the impact}} of feral cats and stoats is unknown. Overgrazing can increase predation by making nests easier to find. In captivity, the main causes of chick mortality were stress-related sudden death and twisted neck syndrome. Adults seem to show little evidence of external parasites, but may have significant levels of disease on their tropical wintering grounds, including avian malaria in their inland freshwater habitats, and so they might be expected to invest strongly in their immune systems; however, a 2006 study that analysed the blood of migrating ruffs intercepted in Friesland showed that this bird actually has unexplained low levels of immune responses on at least <b>one</b> <b>measure</b> of resistance. The ruff can breed from its second year, and the average lifespan for birds that have passed the chick stage is about 4.4 years, although a Finnish bird lived to a record 13 years and 11 months.|$|E
25|$|There is only <b>one</b> <b>measure</b> of entropy in thermodynamics, {{and this}} <b>one</b> <b>measure</b> applies to both energy and to {{microscopic}} matter {{at the molecular}} level (kinetic gas theory); but the measure does not apply to macroscopic matter (matter in bulk, material resources), though it frequently appears so in the ecological economics literature and elsewhere.|$|E

50|$|The more {{precisely}} <b>one</b> <b>measures</b> {{the duration of}} a sequence of events, the less precisely <b>one</b> can <b>measure</b> the energy associated with that sequence, and vice versa.

25|$|The {{trade volume}} with Tibet's {{southern}} neighbours, India, Nepal and Bhutan, was much smaller. The Tibetan traders mainly exchanged salt and wool for grain (including rice) with these countries. Traditionally <b>one</b> <b>measure</b> of salt was traded for <b>one</b> <b>measure</b> of grain {{at the border}} with Nepal and India. Other, less important export goods were yak tails, musk and live animals (goats and sheep). For the 17th century, the export of falcons to India is also recorded.|$|E

50|$|Infrared spectra and Raman spectra {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the M-O {{stretching}} frequency in metal aqua ions. Raman spectroscopy is particularly useful because the Raman spectrum of water is weak whereas the infrared spectrum of water is intense. Interpretation of the vibration frequencies is somewhat complicated by the presence, in octahedral and tetrahedral ions, of two vibrations, a symmetric <b>one</b> <b>measured</b> in the Raman spectrum and an anti-symmetric <b>one,</b> <b>measured</b> in the infrared spectrum.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{amendments}} {{were made to}} address issues related to record keeping and financial reporting. <b>One</b> <b>measure</b> was a new requirement that anyone who does business file a report for any coin and foreign currency receipts that are over US$10,000 and made it illegal to structure transactions {{in a manner that}} evades the BSA's reporting requirements.|$|E
25|$|Determining {{the cycle}} {{length of a}} {{pseudorandom}} number generator is <b>one</b> <b>measure</b> of its strength. This is the application cited by Knuth in describing Floyd's method. Brent describes the results of testing a linear congruential generator in this fashion; its period {{turned out to be}} significantly smaller than advertised. For more complex generators, the sequence of values in which the cycle is to be found may not represent the output of the generator, but rather its internal state.|$|E
25|$|The Personal {{consumption}} expenditures price index, {{also referred}} to as simply the PCE price index, is used as <b>one</b> <b>measure</b> of the value of money. It is a United States-wide indicator of the average increase in prices for all domestic personal consumption.

During this period, Zamboanga City earned the appellation as the cleanest city in the Philippines. <b>One</b> <b>measure</b> he enacted to earn such a reputation for his city was a directive requiring all horses in horse-drawn carriages to be tied with diapers beneath their tails as they plied their routes.|$|E
25|$|At its peak, a {{total of}} 19 RAF squadrons flew the Vampire FB.5 in Europe, the Middle East and the Far East. By far, the theatre in which {{the largest number of}} Vampires were {{stationed}} was Germany; this extensive deployment by the RAF has been viewed as <b>one</b> <b>measure</b> of the emerging Cold War climate between West and East Europe, as well as being a reaction to events such as the Korean War and the Berlin Blockade. Vampires were also operated by a number of active and reserve squadrons stationed in the UK.|$|E

It was the first of at least {{fourteen}} children (including two sets of twins) she would bear over the next twenty-three years. The next day, 1 December, Pius gave Marcus the tribunician power and the imperium—authority over the armies and provinces of the emperor. As tribune, Marcus had the right to bring <b>one</b> <b>measure</b> before the senate after the four Pius could introduce. His tribunican powers would be renewed, with Pius', on 10 December 147.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>measure</b> of {{the quality}} of the fossil record is {{obtained}} by comparing the date of first appearance with the order of branching of a cladogram based on the shape of fossil elements. Close correspondence exists for ornithiscians, saurischians and subgroups. The cladogram link between coelophysids and ceratosaurs is an exception, it would place the origin of coelophysids much too late. The simplest explanation is convergent evolution - ceratosaur bones evolved independently into a shape that resembles that of the earlier coelophysids. The other possibility is that ceratosaurs evolved much earlier than the fossil record suggests.|$|E
25|$|While the SPD {{was founded}} in the 19th century to defend the {{interests}} of the working class, its commitment to these goals has been disputed by some since 1918, when its leaders supported the suppression of more radical socialist and communist factions during the Spartacist Uprising. But never before has the party moved so far away from its traditional socialist stance as it did under the Schröder government. Its ever-increasing tendency towards liberal economic policies and cutbacks in government spending on social welfare programs led to a dramatic decline in voter support. The Schroeder Administration presided over a significant rise in poverty and inequality, with the percentage of Germans living in poverty, according to <b>one</b> <b>measure,</b> rising from 12% in 2000 to 16.5% in 2006.|$|E
