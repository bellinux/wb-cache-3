5|$|The ACLU lost an {{important}} press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the <b>obscenity</b> conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, {{books such as}} Tropic of Cancer and From Here to Eternity were still banned. But public standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and <b>obscenity</b> was notoriously difficult to define, so by 1971 prosecutions for <b>obscenity</b> had halted.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} and the states have long been permitted to limit <b>obscenity</b> or pornography. While the Supreme Court has generally refused to give <b>obscenity</b> any protection under the First Amendment, pornography is subject to little regulation. However, the definitions of <b>obscenity</b> and pornography have changed over time.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada made {{a ruling}} in R.v. Butler which {{incorporated}} {{some elements of}} Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian <b>obscenity</b> law. In Butler, the Court held that Canadian <b>obscenity</b> law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that <b>obscenity</b> law could be enforced constitutionally against some pornography {{on the basis of}} the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon.|$|E

5|$|As {{the content}} of comics matured {{throughout}} the 1980s, they {{became the subject of}} increasing scrutiny. In 1986, Calgary comic shop Comic Legends was raided and charged with <b>obscenity.</b> In response, Derek McCulloch and Paul Stockton of Strawberry Jam Comics established the Comic Legends Legal Defense Fund to help retailers, distributors, publishers, and creators fight against <b>obscenity</b> charges. To raise funds, they published two True North anthologies of Canadian talent.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal {{district}} court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album {{could result in}} a prosecution for <b>obscenity</b> violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the <b>obscenity</b> ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E

5|$|In 1921 Walter Long of Gillingham, Dorset {{objected to}} the giant's nudity and {{conducted}} a campaign to either convert it to a simple nude, or to cover its supposed <b>obscenity</b> with a leaf. Long's protest gained some support, including that of two bishops, and eventually reached the Home Office. The Home Office considered the protest to be in humour, though the chief constable responded to say the office could not act against a protected scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong <b>obscenity</b> test should be outlawed, but that the law in question was overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{as in the}} UK, the Hicklin test of <b>obscenity</b> applied, but New York {{case law}} had {{established}} that books should be judged by their effects on adults rather than on children and that literary merit was relevant. Ernst obtained statements from authors including Dreiser, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, H. L. Mencken, Upton Sinclair, Ellen Glasgow and John Dos Passos. Besides, freedom of expression was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. To make sure these supporters did not go unheard, he incorporated their opinions into his brief. His argument relied on a comparison with Mademoiselle de Maupin by Théophile Gautier, which had been cleared of <b>obscenity</b> in the 1922 case Halsey v. New York. Mademoiselle de Maupin described a lesbian relationship in more explicit terms than The Well did. According to Ernst, The Well had greater social value because it was more serious in tone and made a case against misunderstanding and intolerance.|$|E

To cover this, he would bring materials to within an inch of his eyes, and have clerks and his wife read to him (once when the Court took an <b>obscenity</b> case, a chagrined Harlan had his wife read him Lady Chatterley's Lover). Gravely ill, he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{continues}} {{to have a significant}} impact in English law, as its precedents serve to provide a definition of <b>obscenity</b> that is used in other legal contexts. For instance, anything deemed likely to contravene the Act is prohibited from videos awarded an R18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification. A list of the categories of material most commonly prosecuted under the Act is published by the Crown Prosecution Service.|$|E
5|$|Although the snuff film {{allegations}} were disproven, the Italian courts decided to ban Cannibal Holocaust {{due to the}} genuine animal slayings, citing animal cruelty laws. Deodato, Franco Palaggi, Franco Di Nunzio, Gianfranco Clerici, producer Alda Pia and United Artists Europa representative Sandro Perotti each received a four-month suspended sentence after they were all convicted of <b>obscenity</b> and violence. Deodato fought in the courts for three additional years to get his film unbanned. In 1984, the courts {{ruled in favor of}} Deodato, and Cannibal Holocaust was granted a rating certificate of VM18 for a cut print. It would later be re-released uncut.|$|E

5|$|Andrea Dworkin opposed LEAF's position, {{arguing that}} feminists should not support or attempt to reform {{criminal}} <b>obscenity</b> law. In 1993, copies of Dworkin's book Pornography were held for inspection by Canada Customs agents, fostering an urban legend that Dworkin's own books had been banned from Canada under {{a law that}} she herself had promoted. However, the Butler decision did not adopt Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance, Dworkin {{did not support the}} decision, and her books (which were released shortly after they were inspected) were held temporarily as part of a standard procedural measure, unrelated to the Butler decision.|$|E
5|$|Cannibal Holocaust {{achieved}} notoriety as its graphic violence aroused a {{great deal}} of controversy. After its premiere in Italy, it was ordered to be seized by a local magistrate, and Deodato was arrested on <b>obscenity</b> charges. He was later charged with making a snuff film due to rumors that claimed some actors were killed on camera. Although Deodato was later cleared, the film was banned in Italy, Australia, and several other countries due to its portrayal of graphic brutality, sexual assault, and real depictions of violence toward animals. Some nations have since revoked the ban, though it is still upheld in several countries. Critics have suggested that the film is a commentary about civilized versus uncivilized society.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{continued}} to produce paintings ranging from still lifes to formal portraits, and to attract both admiration for his technique and criticism for supposed <b>obscenity,</b> {{until his death}} in 1849. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, and his works fetched huge sums on resale. Changing tastes from the 1870s onwards meant history paintings in Etty's style fell rapidly out of fashion, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century, the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices.|$|E
