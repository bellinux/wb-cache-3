5|$|Of the six common strong {{mineral acids}} in chemistry, {{hydrochloric}} acid is the monoprotic acid {{least likely to}} undergo an interfering <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>reaction.</b> It {{is one of the}} least hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it consists of the non-reactive and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus {{the fact that it is}} available as a pure reagent, make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent.|$|E
25|$|Photovoltaic assay : The {{photovoltaic}} assay, {{used only}} in the dated Photo Electric Intoximeter (PEI), {{is a form of}} breath testing rarely encountered today. The process works by using photocells to analyze the color change of a redox (<b>oxidation-reduction)</b> <b>reaction.</b> A breath sample is bubbled through an aqueous solution of sulfuric acid, potassium dichromate, and silver nitrate. The silver nitrate acts as a catalyst, allowing the alcohol to be oxidized at an appreciable rate. The requisite acidic condition needed for the reaction might also be provided by the sulfuric acid. In solution, ethanol reacts with the potassium dichromate, reducing the dichromate ion to the chromium (III) ion. This reduction results in a change of the solution's color from red-orange to green. The reacted solution is compared to a vial of non-reacted solution by a photocell, which creates an electric current proportional to the degree of the color change; this current moves the needle that indicates BAC. Like other methods, breath testing devices using chemical analysis are somewhat prone to false readings. Compounds that have compositions similar to ethanol, for example, could also act as reducing agents, creating the necessary color change to indicate increased BAC.|$|E

2500|$|The {{synthesis}} of adrenocortical steroid hormones involves {{a chain of}} <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>reactions</b> catalyzed {{by a series of}} enzymes. Synthesis begins with a molecule of cholesterol. Through shared intermediates and pathways branching off those shared intermediates, the different classes of steroids are synthesized. Steroids are synthesized from cholesterol in their respective regions of the adrenal cortex. The process is controlled by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) which sits in the mitochondrial membrane and regulates the passage of cholesterol. [...] This is the rate-limiting step of steroid biosynthesis. Once StAR has transported cholesterol into the mitochondria, the cholesterol molecule undergoes a string of <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>reactions</b> catalyzed by a series of enzymes from the family of cytochrome P450 enzymes. A coenzyme system called adrenodoxin reductase transfers electrons to the P450 enzyme which initiates the <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>reactions</b> that transform cholesterol into the steroid hormones. Though synthesis is initiated inside mitochondria, precursors are shuttled to the endoplasmic reticulum for processing by enzymes present in the endoplasmic reticulum. The precursors are shuttled back to the mitochondria in the region of the adrenal cortex within which synthesis initially began and it is there that synthesis is completed.|$|R

50|$|Uncouplers of {{oxidative}} phosphorylation are specifically acting toxicants. Oxidative phosphorylation is a coupling reaction in which ATP is synthesized from phosphate groups using energy {{obtained from the}} <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>reactions</b> in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. ATP production is very important because it is essentially the energy currency in biological systems. Under normal circumstances, <b>oxidation-reduction</b> <b>reactions</b> in the mitochondrial electron transport chain produce energy. This energy is used to shuttle protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane, from the mitochondrial matrix into the inner membrane space. This creates a pH gradient where conditions are acidic (i.e. higher concentrations of protons) in the inner membrane space, and more basic (i.e. low concentrations of protons) in the mitochondrial matrix. Due to this gradient, protons pass through ATPase, a protein embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane, down their concentration gradient, into the mitochondrial matrix driving the production of ATP.|$|R
