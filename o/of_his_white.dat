5|$|Odell Waller (1917 – July 2, 1942) was an African American {{sharecropper}} from Gretna, Virginia {{executed for}} the fatal shooting <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> landlord, Oscar Wheldon Davis, on July 15, 1940. Waller unsuccessfully maintained {{at his trial}} that the killing had been in self-defense, but was convicted of a jury of white citizens who had paid the poll tax, a measure that effectively barred blacks and poor whites from jury service.|$|E
5|$|The Greek meander pattern at {{the foot}} of the wall is unusually close to the picture plane, {{confining}} the sitter. The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical. His eyes are heavily lidded, circled by oppositely positioned twists <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> collar, the winds of his hair, eyebrows and eyelids. His mouth turns downwards at the left and upwards to the right. This dual expression is intended to show his duality and complex personality: he is a hard-nosed businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth. The Portrait of Pope Leo X (c. 1519) by Raphael, a source for the Bertin portrait, also features a window reflection of the pommel on the pope's chair.|$|E
25|$|During {{the decline}} of the Apartheid era, race {{relations}} were particularly problematic as many White South Africans felt threatened by the eventuality of a regime change. This was the main cause of the events that transpired on the 13 May 1989, when the mayor, a Mr Gus Gouws, was tarred and feathered after officiating at a multiracial wheelchair marathon event. The National Party mayor ran foul <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>White</b> constituency when he proposed the opening of a taxi rank in the business district of Welkom.|$|E

25|$|The black soldier became another stock type {{during the}} Civil War and merged {{qualities of the}} slave and the dandy. He was {{acknowledged}} for playing some role in the war, but he was more frequently lampooned for bumbling through his drills or for thinking his uniform made him the equal <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> counterparts. He was usually better at retreating than fighting, and, like the dandy, he preferred partying to serious pursuits. Still, his introduction allowed for some return to themes of {{the breakup of the}} plantation family.|$|E
25|$|In this game, Tim Tebow {{also created}} an iconic image {{of himself and}} the Gators for 2008. Because of the rainy {{conditions}} in Tallahassee that day, the field was extremely wet and slippery, affecting play on both sides. On a 4-yard TD run into the endzone, Tebow slid in on the wet turf, causing the front <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> Away jersey to get wet red paint on it. The paint also got {{on his face and}} helmet and stayed on {{for the majority of the}} game. The red paint resembled blood to many people which provided Tebow with a bravado of bravery and passion, which also highlighted his intense sideline celebrations and enthusiasm. The image of Tebow's paint-stained Jersey became one of the lasting and memorable images in sports for 2008 and for the decade at large.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{law school}} and the {{following}} years, he often worked pro bono, representing housing project residents at Boston Housing Authority (BHA) hearings. In one high-profile 1994 case, Lynch provided free legal services to 14 teenagers, all white, who were accused of physically attacking a Hispanic teenager and harassing the family <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> girlfriend {{over a period of}} six months. Lynch, who claimed the youths had been [...] "overcharged," [...] helped some of the teenagers to avoid criminal charges and eviction by the BHA.|$|E

500|$|During Reconstruction, Davis {{publicly}} {{remained silent}} on his opinions, but privately he expressed opinions that federal military rule and Republican authority over former Confederate states was unjustified. He considered [...] "Yankee and Negroe" [...] {{rule in the}} South oppressive. Like most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> contemporaries, Davis held the belief that blacks were inferior to whites. The historian William J. Cooper has stated that Davis believed in a Southern social order that included [...] "a democratic white polity based firmly on dominance of a controlled and excluded black caste." ...|$|E
500|$|Jesse Washington {{was a black}} teenage farmhand who was lynched in Waco, Texas, on May 15, 1916, in {{what became}} a {{well-known}} example of racially motivated lynching. Washington was convicted of raping and murdering Lucy Fryer, the wife <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> employer in rural Robinson, Texas. He was dragged out of the court by observers and lynched in front of Waco's city hall. Over 10,000 spectators, including city officials and police, gathered to watch the attack. There was a celebratory atmosphere at the event, and many children attended during their lunch hour. Members of the mob castrated Washington, cut off his fingers, and hung him over a bonfire. He was repeatedly lowered and raised over the fire for about two hours. After the fire was extinguished, his charred torso was dragged through the town and parts of his body were sold as souvenirs. A professional photographer took pictures as the event unfolded, providing rare imagery of a lynching in progress. The pictures were printed and sold as postcards in Waco.|$|E

[...] Meanwhile, Homer discovers that all <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> shirts have turned pink because Bart put his red hat in with the laundry. [...] Homer {{has no choice but}} to wear a pink shirt to work and as a result, his co-workers poke fun at him. [...] Mr. Burns suspects him of being a [...] "free-thinking anarchist". [...] Homer is sent home with a 20-question psychiatric quiz that he has to fill in so that Dr. Marvin Monroe can assess his sanity. [...] Homer is too lazy to finish the quiz on his own and lets Bart fill it in. [...] When Dr. Monroe sees the results, he determines that Homer is insane. [...] Homer is sent to a mental institution, and is put in a cell with a large white man who seems to believe he is Michael Jackson (referred to as [...] "the big white guy who thinks he's the little black guy"), and who introduces himself as such. [...] Being unfamiliar with the real Michael Jackson, Homer believes and quickly befriends him.|$|E

60|$|Captain Burke {{really did}} {{look as if}} he needed a good many things,--among others, a comb and a brush. His gold-trimmed cap was pushed on the back <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head; <b>his</b> <b>white</b> coat was unbuttoned, and the collar turned in; and his countenance was troubled by the belief that <b>his</b> want <b>of</b> {{prudence}} had brought Mrs. Cliff and her property into a very serious predicament.|$|R
500|$|The {{facts of}} {{what took place}} in the store are still disputed. [...] According to what Jones said at the time, the other boys {{reported}} that Till had a photograph of an integrated class at the school he attended in Chicago, and Till bragged to the boys that the white children in the picture were his friends. He pointed to a white girl in the picture, or referred to a picture of a white girl that had come with his new wallet, and said she was his girlfriend and {{one or more of the}} local boys dared Till to speak to Bryant. However, writing a personal account of the incident in a book released in 2009, Till's cousin Simeon Wright, who was also present, disputed Jones' version of what happened on that day. According to Wright, Till did not have a photo of a white girl in his wallet and no one dared him to flirt with Bryant. Speaking in 2015, Wright said, [...] "We didn't dare him to go to the store — the white folk said that. They said that he had pictures <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> girlfriend. There were no pictures. They never talked to me. They never interviewed me." [...] The FBI report completed in 2006 notes [...] "...Jones recanted his 1955 statements prior to his death and apologized to Mamie Till-Mobley".|$|E
500|$|After the {{assassination}} of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, Lindsay feared that rioting would occur in Harlem. He traveled to the neighborhood to express condolences; Clarence13X and his followers were among those who accompanied him as he walked the streets. Clarence13X also instructed his followers {{to try to prevent}} violence and looting. He was commended by the city's leadership for his efforts, and they subsequently agreed to help him publish a book of Five Percenter teachings and portions of the Quran. Willieen Jowers recalled that Clarence13X admitted that his previous teachings about racial hatred were wrong around this time. He later described himself as [...] "neither anti-white nor pro-black" [...] and saw some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> contacts with the city as allies in the advancement of his teachings. His white convert was released from state custody and joined his teacher in Harlem during the February 1969 nor'easter. He was accepted as a Five Percenter, as Clarence13X maintained that [...] "civilization"—rather than race—was valued by the group. Clarence13X made possibly contradictory statements about whether white individuals could be reformed. Contrary to his radical reputation, he endorsed some conservative positions in the late 1960s, including capital punishment, respect for the U.S. flag, and American involvement in Vietnam. He also allowed his supporters to attend Christmas celebrations. Knight notes that these shifts may have been intended to decrease suspicions of law enforcement. Clarence13X was then allowed to visit a juvenile detention center to speak to young Five Percenters and won some concessions from the institution's leadership. Some secular black leaders disliked him, owing to his supportive comments about the mayor and neglect of revolutionary rhetoric. On one occasion, he was invited to address an audience of black Marxists, then spoke to them about numerology.|$|E

2500|$|Part of Big Black's local unpopularity {{stemmed from}} Albini and the vitriol he {{regularly}} directed at Chicago's rock scene: by 1985, the Metro Chicago {{was the only}} club {{in the city that}} was booking punk rock shows and was also large enough to accommodate Big Black, but after performing there Albini badmouthed the club in an interview and found himself banned from it permanently. Compounding the problem were the band's aggressive, noise-driven sound and Albini's confrontational lyrics, which tested the tolerance <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>white</b> liberal audience by mercilessly satirizing racism, sexism, chauvinism, and stereotypes of homosexuality, sometimes using pejoratives like [...] "darkie" [...] and [...] "fag" [...] to drive home the point; this led some listeners to consider him a bigot.|$|E
