Twarock decided to consider adding an <b>outward</b> <b>translation</b> to this generating process, which created a quite complex patterns of points in 3D space. These patterns turned out to very accurately predict the shape {{and size of the}} proteins, as well as the structure of packaged genetic material, for many viruses including Nodaviridae.|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of translating into a non-mother tongue (<b>outward</b> <b>translation)</b> {{is as old}} as the art of translation itself, but today a strong bias exists against it in many countries. Outside of academia, however, the common assumption is that translators work in both directions, and my research shows that this is in fact the practical reality {{in many parts of the}} world. It is clear that the quality of any translation depends on the abilities and strategies of the individual translator, not on the mother tongue or the directionality of the translation. The translation of doctrinal or apologetic texts is a specialized undertaking where accuracy is more important than style, and the original message must be carefully preserved. For this type of translation, consideration should be given to experienced outward translators with comprehensive theological knowledge, as they are more likely to recognize biblical expressions in the source text and correctly interpret difficult passages. The reluctance of a religious organization to use outward translators, coupled with the necessity of using volunteers due to lack of funding, restricts the amount of apologetic materials it is able to produce in other languages. I chose to do an <b>outward</b> <b>translation</b> into French of In the Name of Jesus by David K. Bernard, a book that represents a core teaching of the United Pentecostal Church International. With this endeavour, I will make an additional doctrinal book available to French UPCI constituents, and hopefully play a role in counteracting the bias against <b>outward</b> <b>translation.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIon {{channels}} are the “building blocks” of the excitation process in excitable tissues. Despite advances in determining their molecular structure, understanding {{the relationship between}} channel protein structure and electrical excitation remains a challenge. The Kv 7. 1 potassium channel is an important determinant of the cardiac action potential and its adaptation to rate changes. It is subject to beta adrenergic regulation, and many mutations in the channel protein {{are associated with the}} arrhythmic long QT syndrome. In this theoretical study, we use a novel computational approach to simulate the conformational changes that Kv 7. 1 undergoes during activation gating and compute the resulting electrophysiologic function in terms of single-channel and macroscopic currents. We generated all possible conformations of the S 4 –S 5 linker that couples the S 3 –S 4 complex (voltage sensor domain, VSD) to the pore, and all associated conformations of VSD and the pore (S 6). Analysis of these conformations revealed that VSD-to-pore mechanical coupling during activation gating involves <b>outward</b> <b>translation</b> of the voltage sensor, accompanied by a translation away from the pore and clockwise twist. These motions cause pore opening by moving the S 4 –S 5 linker upward and away from the pore, providing space for the S 6 tails to move away from each other. Single channel records, computed from the simulated motion trajectories during gating, have stochastic properties similar to experimentally recorded traces. Macroscopic current through an ensemble of channels displays two key properties of Kv 7. 1 : an initial delay of activation and fast inactivation. The simulations suggest a molecular mechanism for fast inactivation; a large twist of the VSD following its <b>outward</b> <b>translation</b> results in movement of the base of the S 4 –S 5 linker toward the pore, eliminating open pore conformations to cause inactivation...|$|E
40|$|Voltage-gated K(+) {{channels}} {{comprise a}} central pore enclosed by four voltage-sensing domains (VSDs). While {{movement of the}} S 4 helix is known to couple to channel gate opening and closing, the nature of S 4 motion is unclear. Here, we substituted S 4 residues of Kv 7. 1 channels by cysteine and recorded whole-cell mutant channel currents in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. In the closed state, disulfide and metal bridges constrain residue S 225 (S 4) nearby C 136 (S 1) within the same VSD. In the open state, two neighboring I 227 (S 4) are constrained at proximity while residue R 228 (S 4) is confined close to C 136 (S 1) of an adjacent VSD. Structural modeling predicts that in the closed to open transition, an axial rotation (approximately 190 degrees) and <b>outward</b> <b>translation</b> of S 4 (approximately 12 A) is accompanied by VSD rocking. This large sensor motion changes the intra-VSD S 1 -S 4 interaction to an inter-VSD S 1 -S 4 interaction. These constraints provide a ground for cooperative subunit interactions and suggest a key role of the S 1 segment in steering S 4 motion during Kv 7. 1 gating...|$|E
40|$|Optoelectronic {{plethysmography}} (OEP) is a noninvasive {{method for}} assessing lung volume variations and {{the contributions of}} different anatomical compartments of the chest wall (CW) through measurements of the motion of markers attached to the CW surface. The present study proposes a new method for analyzing the local CW kinematics from OEP measurements based on the kinematics of triangular Cosserat point elements (TCPEs). 52 reflective markers {{were placed on the}} anterior CW to create a mesh of 78 triangles according to an anatomical model. Each triangle was characterized by a TCPE and its kinematics was described using four time-variant scalar TCPE parameters. The total CW volume (V[subscript TCW]) and the contributions of its six compartments were also estimated, using the same markers. The method was evaluated using measurements of ten healthy subjects, nine patients with Pompe disease, and ten patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), during spontaneous breathing (SB) and vital capacity maneuvers (VC) in the supine position. TCPE parameters and compartmental volumes were compared with (V[subscript TCW]) by computing the phase angles θ (for SB) and the correlation r (for VC) between them. Analysis of θ and r of the <b>outward</b> <b>translation</b> parameter P[subscript] of each TCPE revealed that for healthy subjects it provided similar results to those obtained by compartmental volumes, whereas for the neuromuscular patients the TCPE method was capable of detecting local asynchronous and paradoxical movements also in cases where they were undistinguished by volumes. Therefore, the TCPE approach provides additional information to OEP that may enhance its clinical evaluation capabilities...|$|E
