40|$|Background and objective: Little {{studies using}} {{a limited number}} of {{questionnaires}} cannot reflect the depth and complication of diabetic patients about self-care. However, using the qualitative research method, it is possible to find out the depth of patients’ experiences of this illness. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find individual and environmental <b>obstacles</b> which affect self-care on these patients and to investigate patients’ viewpoint of this disease. Materials and Methods: In this qualitative study, group interview and case interview have been used. This study was carried out in two phases and at the end of the interview patients were provided with necessary teaching about the principals of self-care. Results: In general, 5 categories of <b>obstacles</b> to self-care in type 2 diabetes were identified which include: physical <b>obstacles,</b> economical <b>obstacles,</b> social <b>obstacles,</b> educational <b>obstacles,</b> and psychic <b>obstacles.</b> Social, educational and psychic <b>obstacles</b> are in latter classes. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that a high percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes face serious <b>obstacles</b> in the way of self-care and the most numerous and important <b>obstacles</b> in their opinion are physical and economical <b>obstacles.</b> Considering that developing countries face a shortage of resources, dealing with physical <b>obstacles</b> can bring satisfaction to patients and on the other hand, dealing with these <b>obstacles</b> requires less cooperation from exterior organizations...|$|R

5|$|Crash Bandicoot is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control the titular protagonist, Crash, as he traverses several levels in sequence in order to progress. Crash is able to defeat enemies by either jumping on them or using a spinning attack that launches them.

Crash can protect himself by collecting Aku Aku masks, which protect Crash from a single hit from an enemy or <b>obstacle</b> (but not pits or other instant-death obstacles). Crash can hold onto two masks at a time and, upon collecting a third mask, will gain temporary invincibility.
