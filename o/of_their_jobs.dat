40|$|As {{part of a}} {{large-scale}} project, this study investigated the differences between satisfied and dissatisfied Iranian junior secondary school English teachers in terms <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> performance. To this end, 64 Iranian English teachers and 1774 <b>of</b> <b>their</b> students completed a validated questionnaire specifically developed to investigate EFL teachers’ job performance. The results indicated that satisfied teachers significantly differed from their dissatisfied counterparts in terms <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> performance suggesting that the observed differences in <b>their</b> <b>job</b> performance might have mainly been caused by {{the degree to which}} they were satisfied with their profession. The results also showed a significant difference between students’ evaluation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> teachers’ <b>job</b> performance and the teachers’ self-evaluation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> performance. Furthermore, through a semi-structured interview, the most crucial factors contributing to poor job performance of dissatisfied Iranian secondary school EFL teachers were identified to be an insufficient subject and pedagogic knowledge, unequal attention to individual students, lack of professional commitment, interpersonal relationship problems, and demotivation...|$|R
5|$|Brezhnev's family, Yuri, Galina and Yuri Churbanov, were {{investigated}} and all, {{with the exception}} of Galina, were arrested on charges of political corruption during Mikhail Gorbachev's administration. Churbanov, Brezhnev's son-in-law, was sentenced to twelve years in prison on charges of large-scale embezzlement and corruption. By December 1988 Churbanov had been stripped of all state honours, and sent to a labour camp. Galina, {{along with the rest of}} Brezhnev's family, lost all their state privileges. The city of Brezhnev reverted to its old name Naberezhnye Chelny, and a group within the Soviet leadership wanted to rename all towns, street, factories and institutions bearing Brezhnev's name. This was actually carried through by the authorities in December 1988 when the Soviet Government issued a decree which stated all town, streets, factories, institutions and the like bearing Brezhnev's and Konstantin Chernenko's were to revert to their former name. According to his grandson Andrei Brezhnev, the very name Brezhnev had become a curse for the family, and several family members had been forced out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> and their friends had deserted them. Brezhnev, who had inflated his role in World War II, was rescinded the Order of Victory on 21 September 1989 in a Supreme Soviet convocation.|$|E
5|$|In their off-duty hours, SPARS contributed {{time and}} effort to many {{community}} and wartime causes. Some became active nurse's aides, some rolled bandages for the Red Cross, others donated blood to blood banks, some visited service men in convalescent hospitals, and others collected gifts for the men overseas. Many of them were also involved in the March of Dimes campaigns, and war chest and war bond drives. Both officers and enlisted were awarded ribbons and medals based on their service, and some were acknowledged for their outstanding contributions to the SPARS and the country. In general, SPARS looked upon their service favorably, and many of them found a form of kinship in having {{been a part of the}} nation's military forces during wartime. With the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the USCG demobilization effort began, and the SPARS were gradually discharged. They were separated from the service on a point system, and on the basis <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> However, many SPARS were reassigned to the personnel separation centers to help with demobilization (women and men reservists) and they were not separated until it was completed. The Women's Reserve of the USCG (SPARS) was inactivated on 25 July 1947.|$|E
5|$|While {{both the}} Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons {{with three or}} more Jewish {{grandparents}} would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one (Mischlinge of the second degree) would not, a debate arose as {{to the status of}} persons with two Jewish grandparents (Mischlinge of the first degree). The NSDAP, especially its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to Mischlinge of both the first and second degree. For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse. The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did {{not have the right to}} vote. Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the Anschluss. Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> on this date. A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.|$|E

25|$|The time {{commitment}} of exclusive breastfeeding {{is also an}} economic constraint.

However, some {{evidence suggests that the}} long-term benefits of exclusive breastfeeding outweigh the short-term costs. In the United States, workplace policy surrounding breastfeeding and parental leave often does not reflect these benefits. In addition, women are often unable to risk the loss <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> or loss of income due to breastfeeding adherence, so bottle-feeding is the best solution for the short-term.|$|E

40|$|Background: In the {{physical}} education (PE) teachers’ profession, physical tasks comprise a large part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job.</b> They identify <b>their</b> health as good, and they are satisfied with <b>their</b> <b>job.</b> Nevertheless, the work ability of PE teachers may be decrease. Purpose: The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the work ability of Finnish PE teachers. What disorders or physical problems do PE teachers experience as a result <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> and how do they affect job satisfaction? Are there differences between men and women or older and younger teachers? Key findings: Of the Finnish PE teachers (N= 655), 31 % reported that they had at least one disease or disorder that hindered their work ability. The most common were musculoskeletal disorders. PE teachers identified knee and back problems in particular. Good ability to work was related to higher job satisfaction...|$|R

25|$|The {{level of}} {{education}} one has attained has played a large part in Mexican feminism. Schoolteachers, in most cultures, {{are some of the}} first women to enter the work force and the same was true in Mexico. Many of the early feminists who emerged from the Revolution were teachers either before or after the war, as were the participants of the Primer Congreso Feminista, the first feminist congress in Mexico. The participants in the Mexico 68 clashes who went on to form that generation's feminist movement were predominantly students and educators. The advisers who established themselves within the unions after the 1985 earthquakes were educated women who understood the legal and political aspects of organized labor. What they realized was that to form a sustained movement and attract working class women, they needed to utilize worker's expertise and knowledge <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> to meld a practical, working system.|$|E
25|$|The Germans {{invaded the}} Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, and France in May 1940. In the Netherlands, the Germans {{installed}} Arthur Seyss-Inquart as Reichskommissar, who quickly began to persecute the approximately 140,000 Dutch Jews. Jews were forced out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> {{and had to}} register with the government. Non-Jewish Dutch citizens protested these measures and in February 1941 staged a strike that was quickly crushed. After Belgium's surrender {{at the end of}} May 1940, it was ruled by a German military governor, Alexander von Falkenhausen, who enacted anti-Jewish measures against the approximately 90,000 Jews in Belgium, many of whom were refugees from Germany or Eastern Europe. France had approximately 300,000 Jews, divided between the German-occupied northern part of France, and the unoccupied collaborationist southern areas under the Vichy regime. The occupied regions were under the control of a military governor, and there, anti-Jewish measures were not enacted as quickly {{as they were in the}} Vichy-controlled areas. In July 1940, the Jews in the parts of Alsace-Lorraine that had been annexed to Germany were expelled into Vichy France.|$|E
25|$|From {{early in}} the 19th century, it was a custom to hold boat races on the Tyne. The Tyne had {{a large number of}} keelmen and wherrymen, who handled boats as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>jobs.</b> As on the River Thames, there were {{competitions}} to show who was the best oarsman. As a wherryman did not earn very much, professional rowing was seen as a quick way of earning extra money. Regattas were held, and provided modest prizes for professionals, but the big money was made in challenge races, in which scullers or boat crews would challenge each other to a race over a set distance for a side stake. The crews would usually have backers, who would put up the stake money, as they saw the chance of financial gain from the race. In the days before mass attendances at football matches, races on the river were enormously popular, with tens of thousands attending. Betting would go on both before and during a race, the odds changing as the fortunes of the contestants changed. Contestants who became champions of the Tyne would often challenge the corresponding champions of the River Thames, and the race would be arranged to take place on one of the two rivers.|$|E
