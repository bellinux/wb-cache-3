40|$|During pre {{and post}} calving periods, it was {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} the following forage systems on reproductive performance of primiparous cows: natural pasture during pre and post-calving periods; natural pastures during pre-calving period and improved pastures during post-calving period; improved pastures during pre-calving and natural pasture during post-calving; improved pasture during pre- and post-calving periods. The lowest body weights and body condition scores were observed on cows kept on natural pastures pre-calving (384. 3 kg and 3. 31; 391. 4 kg and 3. 60), followed by those <b>on</b> <b>improved</b> pastures during pre-calving and on natural pasture during post-calving period (424. 4 kg and 3. 60), finally, cows <b>on</b> <b>improved</b> pasture during pre- and post-calving period (421. 2 kg and 3. 59). Cows <b>on</b> <b>improved</b> pastures pre and post-calving showed higher body weight and body condition score {{in the beginning of the}} breeding season (442. 1 kg and 3. 76), higher pregnancy rate (82. 3 %) and they conceived earlier.

40|$|This work {{evaluated}} the reproductive performance of first-calf cows at {{three years of}} age, submitted or not to protein supplementation at yearling on natural pastures. After calving, cows were managed <b>on</b> natural or <b>improved</b> pastures. The feeding managements were the following: on natural pastures as yearlings and during pregnancy, post-calving period and breeding season; on natural pastures with protein supplement as yearlings and only natural pasture during pregnancy, post-calving and breeding season; on natural pastures as yearlings and during pregnancy and <b>on</b> <b>improved</b> natural pastures (Lolium multiflorum L., Trifolium repens cv.
