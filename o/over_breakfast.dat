5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 July, McCudden had handed his sister an {{envelope}} <b>over</b> <b>breakfast,</b> which was subsequently found to contain all of his medals. Today all of McCudden's medals including his Victoria Cross are displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum in Gillingham, Kent, alongside those of two of his brothers and his father. The original brass engraved grave plaque used, along with a wooden propeller, are also displayed.

The museum's collections also include McCudden's uniform 'maternity jacket' and a half-length portrait of McCudden by William Orpen. In March 2009, McCudden and his contemporary Edward Mannock, were the subjects of the BBC Timewatch episode, WWI Aces Falling.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of November 1, 1824, Desha {{attended}} a celebration at a neighbor's house. He later stayed the night at Doggate's Tavern in Fairview, just over the county line in Fleming County. The next morning, he ate breakfast at the tavern, joined by eight other men, including Francis Baker. Editor of the Mississippian newspaper in Natchez, Baker was returning to his hometown of Trenton, New Jersey to marry a young woman there. <b>Over</b> <b>breakfast,</b> Baker mentioned wanting to visit a friend, Captain John Bickley, {{who lived in the}} area. Desha remarked that he knew where Bickley lived and, intending to ride in that direction, asked if Baker wanted to join him. Baker accepted, and the two men left about 8 a.m. toward Maysville. Desha rode his bay mare and Baker his gray mare, a fine horse that had already attracted much attention during his travel through Kentucky.|$|E

25|$|Homer escapes on a Union Jack {{parachute}} landing {{next to his}} family. He then releases his mother's ashes {{once again}} (after misunderstanding that he only needed to apply water to Mona's ashes {{to bring her back}} to life). The scene then turns into clips of Homer enjoying time with his mother from earlier episodes, which ends with a happy Homer as a child hugging his mother <b>over</b> <b>breakfast.</b> The scene then cuts to a black background with white text, saying that the episode was dedicated to Dan Castellaneta's mother, Elsie Castellaneta, and Harry Shearer's mother, Dora K. Warren.|$|E
500|$|Thursday, 3 May, was the {{penultimate}} {{day of the}} family's holiday. <b>Over</b> <b>breakfast</b> Madeleine asked: [...] "Why didn't {{you come}} when [...] and I cried last night?" [...] After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children's bedroom. Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine's pyjama top.|$|E
500|$|Presley also {{disagreed}} with having {{children with the}} singer. Imagining the future and {{what would happen if}} the marriage ended, Presley saw a [...] "custody battle nightmare". In addition, she felt her husband was too emotionally immature to be a parent, having watched his daily interactions with other people; she believed he was the one in need of parenting. Jackson explained to his wife <b>over</b> <b>breakfast</b> one morning that she did not have to be the biological mother if she so desired. He explained, [...] "My friend Debbie [...] said she will get pregnant and have my baby. If you won't do it, then she will. How about that?" [...] Unmoved, Presley replied that it was fine by her.|$|E

500|$|Harrison's diary {{records that}} Lennon and Ono [...] "diverted" [...] {{him at home}} <b>over</b> <b>breakfast</b> the {{following}} morning, but even after a subsequent band meeting at Starr's house, author Barry Miles writes, their [...] "feud" [...] remained [...] "intractable". At the meeting, much to Harrison's annoyance, Lennon once more chose to have Ono speak on his behalf. Harrison then went to his parents' home in Warrington {{for a few days}} before imposing terms for his return to the band – namely, that McCartney's plans for a live concert be abandoned and the project be relocated to the Beatles' own Apple Studio, at London's Savile Row. Commentators have remarked on a change in Harrison's standing within the band {{as a result of his}} walkout, and later in 1969, Lennon and McCartney would be speaking admiringly of Harrison's growth as a songwriter. In an article for Mojo magazine's July 2001 [...] "Solo Beatles Special", John Harris wrote that although Harrison [...] "nominally" [...] remained a Beatle, he was [...] "serving out his notice" [...] after 10 January 1969.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{his growing}} {{feelings}} for Baby, Johnny refused payment for sex with another Kellerman's guest, [...] "bungalow bunny" [...] Vivian Pressman. Vivian takes Robbie for sex in his cabin, which is accidentally interrupted by Lisa, who told Baby {{that she was}} intending {{to have sex with}} Robbie. When Vivian leaves the cabin the next morning, she discovers Baby leaving Johnny's cabin after. Later in the morning <b>over</b> <b>breakfast,</b> Max and Neil Kellerman reveal to the Housemans that Moe Pressman's wallet was stolen while he was playing a card game with other guests. Vivian accuses Johnny of the theft in a fit of her jealousy over Johnny's rejection. Johnny is unable to provide a verifiable alibi, in order to protect his relationship with Baby. To save Johnny from being fired, Baby confesses that Johnny did not commit the theft because she was with him in his cabin that night. Johnny is cleared of the theft after it is revealed that two elderly guests, Mr. and Mrs. Schumacher, stole Moe's wallet along with wallets of other guests. Max fires Johnny anyway for having a fraternizing affair with Baby. Baby and Johnny embrace and bid farewell to each other, saying they'll never regret their affair, despite her father's objections. [...] Baby pointedly apologizes to Jake for lying about her relationship with Johnny, but not for the relationship itself.|$|E
500|$|Billy takes Penny to a {{traveling}} abortionist while Baby and Johnny {{perform at the}} Sheldrake Hotel. Their performance is mostly successful, although Baby is too nervous to accomplish the dance's climactic lift. Johnny and Baby return to Kellerman's and find Penny in agony. Billy explains that the [...] "doctor" [...] {{turned out to be}} a back-alley hack who caused severe damage to Penny. Baby brings her father to help Penny, but when Jake asks point blank, [...] "Who's responsible for this girl?", Johnny replies [...] "I am", claiming responsibility out of fear that Penny will be fired if it gets out that she slept with Robbie. Jake treats Penny, but is angry that Baby used his money to pay for the procedure, and forbids Baby to associate with Johnny or his friends. Baby goes to Johnny to apologize for her father's behavior. They dance, and afterwards have sex. Jake tells his family they'll be leaving early <b>over</b> <b>breakfast.</b> Marjorie says they are paid up til Sunday and Lisa protests, because she wants to sing at the end-of-season talent show. Jake gives in, and Baby continues to see Johnny despite her father's warning. She pulls Johnny off the footpath when her father is nearby, and Johnny is hurt that she won't stand up for him to her father. Robbie sees them during their argument and makes a derisive remark about [...] "going slumming" [...] with the staff. Johnny assaults him.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Over</b> <b>breakfast</b> at the Burnt Toast Diner, Bennet {{reveals that}} the only way to stop Thompson is to get to New York City to destroy the {{tracking}} device that tracks heroes tagged with the neck tattoo, and he produces bus tickets to take them there. [...] When Matt asks if Mr. Linderman is in New York, Bennet seems surprised by Matt's knowledge of the name. [...] Matt guesses correctly that Bennet was [...] "middle management" [...] and is somewhat incredulous that Bennet seems not to know who was signing his paychecks all those years. [...] Bennet tells Matt to forget about Linderman and that it is more important that they get to New York and destroy the tracker. [...] Sprague casts the deciding vote to go to New York City, and Matt reluctantly agrees to join them on their destination.|$|E
2500|$|The {{show was}} well {{received}} by listeners and critics, and Evans was announced as {{the successor to}} Radio 2's Drivetime show on 2 March 2006 forcing out long-time host Johnnie Walker, beginning on 18 April. RAJAR audience figures published in August 2006 showed Evans had 150,000 fewer listeners than his predecessor's last show but was on par with previous years. The second set of RAJAR's published in October 2006 showed his audience was up by 109,000-year-on-year, and up by 33,000 compared with the previous quarter. Figures showed he was drawing an average audience of 4.9million a day on his drivetime show. [...] By the end of 2007, the show was averaging over five million listeners. On 7 September 2009 {{it was announced that}} Evans would take <b>over</b> <b>breakfast</b> show from Sir Terry Wogan after Wogan announced his intention to leave the show {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E

2500|$|Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is a career-minded {{woman who}} has just been given an on-air role with E! and is living in the pool house with her sister Debbie's (Leslie Mann) family. Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) is laid-back and sardonic. He lives off funds {{received}} in compensation for an injury and sporadically works on a celebrity porn website with his roommates (Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel and Martin Starr), in between smoking marijuana or going off with them at theme parks such as Knott's Berry Farm. While celebrating her promotion, Alison meets Ben at a local nightclub. After a night of drinking, they end up having sex. Due to a misunderstanding, they don't use protection: Alison uses the phrase [...] "Just do it already" [...] to encourage Ben to put the condom on, but he misinterprets this to mean to dispense with using one. The following morning, they quickly learn <b>over</b> <b>breakfast</b> that they {{have little in common}} and go their separate ways, which leaves Ben visibly upset.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 August 1942, {{in light}} of the grim global situation, President Roosevelt called for a major {{reassessment}} of U.S. air power requirements, [...] "in order to have complete air ascendancy over the enemy." [...] The Japanese had expanded quickly in the Pacific Theater, North Africa was being rolled up by Rommel with Egypt threatened, Soviet forces were falling back against the German advances toward Stalingrad and the oilfields of the Caucasus, and German U-boats in the Atlantic sank 589 ships in early 1942. On 25 August, Arnold received word of the president's request from Army Chief of Staff George Marshall. The individual AWPD-1 team members had been reassigned {{to a wide variety of}} posts and duties, so to perform the reassessment Arnold recommended Hansell, recently made brigadier general. Marshall cabled Hansell in the UK where he had been working under General Dwight D. Eisenhower as Air Planner, and under General Carl Andrew Spaatz as Deputy Theater Air Officer. Marshall ordered Hansell to hurry back to AWPD and that [...] "the results of the work of this group are of such far-reaching importance that it will probably determine whether or not we control the air." [...] Hansell brought with him VIII Bomber Command Chief of Intelligence Colonel Harris Hull and RAF Group Captain Bobby Sharp, as well as the little data compiled from five UK-based raids which had been flown by U.S. bombers. Hansell was assisted on a consultative basis by George, Kuter and Walker, old AWPD-1 hands, and by Lieutenant Colonel Malcolm Moss who was a sharp businessman in civil life. The team had just 11 days to finish the work. Arnold was more closely involved than before in leading the group and formulating the new plan. Like AWPD-1, the new framework was based largely on untried bombing theory. The report, entitled Requirements for Air Ascendancy, 1942, or AWPD-42, was submitted to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) on 6 September 1942. Harry Hopkins had obtained his copy at 1am the day it was to be released, and Hopkins read it in time to tell Roosevelt <b>over</b> <b>breakfast</b> that the plan was sound. Roosevelt called Stimson to say he approved it, but Stimson hadn't seen it, nor had Marshall when Stimson called him. Hansell left hurriedly for England so that he would not have to face Marshall's anger at being caught unprepared.|$|E
