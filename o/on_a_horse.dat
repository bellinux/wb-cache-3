5|$|Khandoba is {{considered}} as the giver of fertility. Maharashtrian Hindu couples {{are expected to}} visit a Khandoba temple to obtain Khandoba's blessing on consummation of marriage. Traditional Maharashtrian families also organize a jagaran {{as part of the}} marriage ceremony, inviting the god to the marriage. Copper figurines of Khandoba riding <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> (sometimes with Mhalsa) are worshipped by devotees on a daily basis in the household shrine.|$|E
5|$|Elisabeth and her Spanish entourage {{had arrived}} at the Bidasoa river on the Spanish border with a huge escort of French Catholic nobles on 14 June 1565. She then rode into Saint-Jean de Luz, where Catherine greeted her tearfully with embraces and kisses. During the {{reception}} ceremonies, ten of Catherine’s soldiers dropped dead from standing too long in the heat in their armour. The next day, Elisabeth made a dazzling entry into Bayonne <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> whose harness was studded with gems worth 400,000 ducats.|$|E

Mhalsa is piercing a demon's chest with a spear, while a dog is biting his thigh and the horse is hitting his head. The other demon is grabbing the reins of the horse and attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting the horse and attacking the demon with his sword.

5|$|Later in 1941 Roekiah and Djoemala {{completed}} Poesaka Terpendam (Buried Treasure), an action-filled film {{which followed}} two groups– the rightful heirs (Roekiah {{being one of}} them) and a band of criminals– in a race to find treasure buried in Banten. Roekiah and Djoemala worked on their final film together, Koeda Sembrani (The Enchanted Horse), in early 1942. In the film, adapted from One Thousand and One Nights, Roekiah took the role of Princess Shams-al-Nahar and was shown flying <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse.</b> The film was still incomplete when the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies began in March 1942, though it was screened by October 1943.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{breeding}} may {{be encouraged}} {{by the fact that}} many horses are sent to the breeding shed following an injury. If the injury is linked to a conformational fault, the fault is likely to be passed to the next generation. Additionally, some breeders will have a veterinarian perform straightening procedures <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> with crooked legs. This can help increase the horse's price at a sale and perhaps help the horse have a sounder racing career, but the genes for poor legs will still be passed on.|$|E

5|$|Wristwatches {{were first}} worn by {{military}} men {{towards the end}} of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Plumb was the US Olympic athlete {{with the}} {{greatest}} number of appearances in any sport at the Games. He was named to the US team in every Olympic games between 1960 (his first) and 1984, as well as appearing for the last time at the 1992 Summer Olympics, and competed at all of the Games except for 1980, when the US did not compete. During his seven Olympic appearances, he gathered multiple medals. At the 1960 Summer Olympics, Plumb took an individual 15th, while the US team did not finish the competition. At the 1964 Games, he repeated his individual performance, while the US team improved to take the silver medal. At these Games, he became the first rider ever to win a medal <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> that he had never previously ridden in competition. Plumb had planned to ride his main event horse, Markham, but on the flight to the Games in Tokyo, the horse panicked, possibly due to a bad experience previously suffered in a horse trailer. In order to keep him from destroying his stall and potentially the aircraft, the horse was euthanized. Plumb instead rode Bold Minstrel, a horse loaned to him by another top-level eventer.|$|E
5|$|In sculpture, Revanta {{is often}} {{depicted}} with the Guhyakas, whose chief he is, in scenes of hunting. Apart from the attributes described in texts like the sword, bow; he sometimes also carries {{a cup of}} wine in his hand. Revanta is often depicted wearing long boots reaching up to the calves, unlike other Hindu divinities – except Surya – who are depicted barefoot.

Some of them are shown blowing a conch or beaming drums or holding an umbrella {{over the head of}} their lord, the umbrella being the symbol of royalty.

5|$|The {{earliest}} horse remains {{found in}} the area now covered by Britain and Ireland date to the Middle Pleistocene. Two species of horse have been identified from remains at Pakefield, East Anglia, dating back to 700,000BC. Spear damage <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> shoulder bone discovered at Eartham Pit, Boxgrove, dated 500,000BC, showed that early hominids were hunting horses in the area at that time. The land which now comprises the British Isles was periodically joined to continental Europe by a land bridge, extending from approximately the current coast of North Yorkshire to the English Channel, most recently until about 9,000years ago. Dependent on {{the rise and fall}} of sea levels associated with advancing and retreating Ice ages, this allowed humans and fauna to migrate between these areas; as the climate fluctuated, hunters could follow their prey, including equids.|$|E
5|$|Throughout her career, James {{won more}} World Barrel Racing Championships {{than any other}} {{competitor}} {{in the history of}} the sport. She is barrel racing’s all-time leading money earner, and the first person to surpass a million dollars in prize winnings. James earned national recognition after winning the WPRA World Barrel Racing Championship consecutively from 1984 to 1993 riding Gils Bay Boy, a 1977 American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) gelding known by his nickname, Scamper, and again in 2002 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>horse</b> named Cruiser. James and Scamper also won the NFR Barrel Racing Average Titles in 1984, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990, 1993, and 2002.

James has a hall of fame career but could not be inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame except into the Notables category until 2017. Starting with the 38th class of inductees in 2017, the ProRodeo Hall of Fame entered into a partnership with the WPRA to include barrel racers, and James was one of two barrel racers inducted.|$|E
