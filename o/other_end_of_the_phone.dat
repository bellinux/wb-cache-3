2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{thousands}} of teeth analyzed, published in the November 24, 1961, issue of the journal Science, revealed elevated levels of radioactive compounds in the first sets of teeth that had been collected. President John F. Kennedy was made aware of the research results while he was negotiating a treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union to place controls on nuclear testing. His call to the Reiss home was answered by her son; the person on the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> said, [...] "This is John Kennedy, can I talk to your mom?" [...] Further analysis by the team led to the conclusion that children born in 1963 had absorbed levels of strontium-90 that were 50 times higher than those found in children born a decade earlier. Her husband, Eric Reiss, testified before the United States Senate when it was considering ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Later research showed that levels of strontium-90 in the cohort born in 1968, after the treaty had gone into effect, had declined by 50 percent.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Frederick {{shut the}} {{restaurant}} and put it up for auction. Bernard and Lester Magrill, local auctioneers and frequent patrons, conducted the auction. Sol Forman, who owned a metal giftware factory across the street, bought it for [...] "a whimsically low bid". According to Lester Magrill, the purchase price was $35,000, which included the building {{as well as the}} restaurant. According to one history, [...] "the neighborhood was declining, filling up with Hasidic Jews, whose kosher rules forbade the eating of Luger's hindquarters. Forman had been eating at Luger for twenty-five years, and he needed a place to take his clients. He was the only bidder during the auction. The purchase cemented the friendship between the Magrills and Formans and Lester frequented the restaurant almost five days a week for sixty years. Legend has it that Lester visited the Great Neck restaurant one evening and when mistreated by the Maitre'd, he asked to use the house phone. He turned to the offending host and stated, 'It's for you'. On the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> an irate Sol Forman fired the offending host on the spot and Magrill was immediately seated. A rave from über-critic Craig Claiborne in The New York Times was proof that Forman had kept the Luger faith—and the four-star review generated a new legion of the faithful." ...|$|E

[...] Morris frequently talks over his guests and does not realise or will not admit when he has the wrong person on the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> He also [...] "interviews" [...] real-life politicians, whose responses are edited from pre-recorded material to render them nonsensical, {{as well as the}} public, getting baffled or earnest responses to absurd questions ("Which is worse, a horizontal disease or a vertical disease?", [...] "What should {{the letter of the law}} be?", etc.).

5000|$|In 2011, Hoshino won the Kenzaburō Ōe Prize for {{his novel}} Ore Ore (2010), which explores {{the meaning of}} {{identity}} in the postmodern world. The title {{takes its name from}} the first-person Japanese pronoun ore ('I' or 'me'). Early in the novel, the narrator engages in a kind of scam known in Japan as a ore-ore sagi ('me-me scam'), in which he calls up an older person, pretends to be a relative, and tries to get the person on the <b>other</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> line to send money. In the novel, the narrator finds himself unwittingly pulled into the life of the person whose identity he has fraudulently assumed, {{at the same time that}} someone else assumes his identity. This starts a chain-reaction of identity-stealing that extends to the edges of society, creating an increasingly surreal and dangerous world in which no one is exactly who they seem. The novel has been translated as ME by Charles De Wolf for Akashic Books.|$|E
