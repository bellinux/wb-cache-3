40|$|Light is {{considered}} the most potent synchronizer of the human circadian system and exerts many other non-image-forming effects, including those that affect brain function. These effects are mediated in part by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells that express the photopigment melanopsin. The spectral sensitivity of melanopsin is greatest for blue light at approximately 480 nm. At present, there is little information on how the spectral composition of light to which people are exposed varies over the 24 h period and across seasons. Twenty-two subjects, aged 22 ± 4 yrs (mean±SD) participated {{during the winter months}} (November–February), and 12 subjects aged 25 ± 3 yrs participated during the summer months (April–August). Subjects wore Actiwatch-RGB monitors, as well as Actiwatch-L monitors, for seven consecutive days while living in England. These monitors measured activity and light exposure in the red, green, and blue spectral regions, in addition to broad-spectrum white light, with a 2 min resolution. Light exposure during the day was analyzed for the interval between 09 : 00 and 21 : 00 h.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} whether individuals can subjectively estimate: (1) the loudness of events with respect to the objectively measured noise level; and (2) the overall loudness of their daily noise exposure level. Design: Participants wore personal noise exposure meters for up to five days. During this time, participants kept diaries of daily events and estimated the loudness of these events and their <b>overall</b> noise <b>exposure</b> using 1 -to- 10 rating scales. Study sample: A group of 45 volunteers aged between 18 and 35 years participated in the study. Results: 86 % of participants’ subjective estimates were significantly correlated with the objective noise measurements. Multiple regression showed that age, overall lifestyle noise, and diary quality were predictors of the strength of correlation observed. In addition participants’ subjective estimates of their <b>overall</b> noise <b>exposure</b> were significantly correlated with their actual average daily noise exposure. Conclusions: Results suggest that individuals can make a reasonable estimate of the loudness of events they experience and the overall level of noise they experience. These results may have significant influence for those interested in producing effective hearing health awareness programs in that individuals may be capable of assessing their own degree of hazard exposure. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{monitoring}} (BM) is {{a useful}} way of determining <b>overall</b> <b>exposures</b> to chemical substances; however, {{in the case of}} respirable crystalline silica (RCS), this has not been analytically feasible in conventional biological matrices. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the utility of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as a potential biological matrix in which to determine exposure to RCS. A small pilot study was undertaken collecting EBC from six quarry workers and six occupationally unexposed persons; the samples were analysed using both single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (spICP-MS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed that EBC obtained from the occupationally unexposed persons exhibited low background levels of dissolved silica whilst silica particles of various sizes were present in samples from quarry workers. This is the first study to report EBC as a potential biological matrix that allows differentiation of RCS concentrations between samples from workers and occupationally unexposed controls. The results shown here confirm the presence of RCS in EBC by both spICP-MS and TEM. However, there are difficult analytical challenges still to be overcome before this can be used as a BM method to determine workplace exposure, these are currently being investigated.

50|$|The {{use of a}} flash or strobe {{is often}} {{regarded}} as the most difficult aspect of underwater photography. Some misconceptions exist about {{the proper use of}} flash underwater, especially as it relates to wide-angle photography. Generally, the flash should be used to supplement the <b>overall</b> <b>exposure</b> and to restore lost color, not as the primary light source. In situations such as the interior of caves or shipwrecks, wide-angle images can be 100% strobe light, but such situations are fairly rare. Usually, the photographer tries to create an aesthetic balance between the available sunlight and the strobe. Deep, dark or low visibility environments can make this balance more difficult, but the concept remains the same. Many modern cameras have simplified this process through various automatic exposure modes and the use of through-the-lens (TTL) metering. The increasing use of digital cameras has reduced the learning curve of underwater flash significantly, since the user can instantly review photos and make adjustments.|$|E

5000|$|Instead of {{reducing}} the aperture to limit light, the photographer can add a ND filter to limit light, and can then set the shutter speed according to the particular motion desired (blur of water movement, for example) and the aperture set as needed (small aperture for maximal sharpness or large aperture for narrow depth of field (subject in focus and background out of focus)). Using a digital camera, the photographer can see the image right away and choose the best ND filter to use for the scene being captured by first knowing the best aperture to use for maximal sharpness desired.

Methods: This cross-sectional study included fifteen {{patients with a}} confirmed diagnosis of NHL or HL who had completed a clinical FDG-PET/CT and a same day research FDG-PET/MR. SUVmax for FDG-avid lesions were measured for each imaging modality, as well as ADC from FDG-PET/MR. Strength of correlation between variables was measured using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs). The <b>overall</b> radiation <b>exposure</b> dose was also calculated for a clinical FDG-PET/CT and compared to the radiation dose level remaining at time of FDG-PET/MR. Results: Thirty-seven concordant FDG-avid lesions were identified on both PET/CT and PET/MR imaging. SUVmax from FDG-PET/MR versus FDG-PET/CT demonstrated a strongly positive correlation (rs= 0. 84 (0. 71, 0. 92); p< 0. 0001).
