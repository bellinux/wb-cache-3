5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and <b>other</b> <b>disciplines</b> {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and <b>other</b> <b>disciplines</b> to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from <b>other</b> <b>disciplines.</b> On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

5|$|As in <b>other</b> <b>disciplines,</b> {{the initial}} {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional economic analysis. Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Mouton co-founded the {{international}} motorsport event Race of Champions with Fredrik Johnsson, {{in memory of}} Toivonen and to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the world championship for rally drivers.

5|$|In the 1960s, {{the journal}} shifted towards a {{preference}} for quantitative model building including econometric models and time series models, and accepted more articles by non-accountants who contributed ideas from <b>other</b> <b>disciplines</b> in solving accounting-related problems.

30|$|Interestingly, while {{economic}} and psychological approaches sometimes address similar topics {{and use the}} same indicators of career success, economists and psychologists rarely refer to the research undertaken by the <b>other</b> <b>discipline</b> (this is also the preliminary result of a comparative content analysis of economics and psychology journals by Cortini and Zuffo 2009). What is more, {{there is not much}} interdisciplinary research on career success. This is somewhat regrettable since both disciplines could benefit from the <b>other</b> <b>discipline's</b> know-how in constructing and interpreting measures of career success, from the different statistical and econometric approaches employed, and from the different interpretations of similar findings offered by each discipline.|$|R
5|$|Mahendra's {{passion for}} cinema {{prompted}} him to leave for India and join the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune in 1966. He had to take up cinematography as he could not gain admissions to <b>other</b> <b>disciplines.</b> At the institute he was exposed to world cinema as he got an opportunity to watch films made by François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, both associated with the French New Wave movement. In 1969, Mahendra graduated from the institute with a gold medal.|$|E

The history of childhood emerged as a sub-discipline of history during the 1960s, and <b>other</b> <b>disciplines</b> such as the study of ancient medicine have been influenced by feminist approaches to the classics.|$|E
5|$|According to Mifune, in 1904 Maeda lost to Yoshitake Yoshio by hane goshi, after {{defeating}} three adversaries in succession, but in {{a following}} tsukinami-shiai defeated eight adversaries {{in a row and}} was awarded the rank of 4th dan (yondan). Mifune also states that Maeda {{was one of the most}} vigorous promoters of judo, although not by teaching the art, instead generating recognition of judo through his many combats with contenders from <b>other</b> <b>disciplines.</b> Maeda treated experienced and inexperienced students alike, throwing them as if in real combat. He reasoned that this behavior was a measure of respect towards his students, but it was often misunderstood and frightened many youngsters, who would abandon him in favor of other professors.|$|E

5|$|The Pony of the Americas (POA) is a pony breed {{developed}} {{in the state of}} Iowa in the United States. The foundation stallion was an Arabian/Appaloosa/Shetland pony cross. A breed registry was founded in 1954, and within 15 years had registered 12,500 ponies. Today, the Pony of the Americas Club {{is one of the largest}} and most active youth-oriented horse breed registries in the US. Although called ponies, POAs have the phenotype of a small horse, combining mainly Arabian and American Quarter Horse attributes. The registry is open, allowing blood from many other breeds, but has strict criteria for entry, including Appaloosa coloration, specified height and other physical characteristics. Although mainly bred for Western riding, the breed has been used for many <b>other</b> <b>disciplines,</b> including driving, endurance riding and some English disciplines.|$|E

5|$|St Petersburg {{academic}} psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller {{notes that}} the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises and in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis has immediately acquired the status of dogma which was later overcome in <b>other</b> <b>disciplines</b> but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky's concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis. That carried a great danger: any deviation from a norm evaluated by a doctor could be regarded as an early phase of schizophrenia, with all ensuing consequences. It resulted in the broad opportunity for voluntary and involuntary abuses of psychiatry. But Snezhnevsky did not take civil and scientific courage to reconsider his concept which clearly reached a deadlock.|$|E
