This paper provides one such tool, {{for use by}} highway administrations, based on Bayesian belief network (BBN) and aimed at replacing so-called generic or typological seismic fragility functions for reinforced concrete girder bridges. Resources for detailed assessments should be allocated to bridges with highest consequence of damage, for which site hazard, bridge fragility, and traffic data are needed. The proposed BBN based model is used to quantify seismic fragility of bridges based on data that {{can be obtained by}} visual inspection and engineering drawings. Results show that the predicted fragilities are of sufficient accuracy for establishing relative ranking and prioritizing. While the actual data and seismic hazard employed to train the network (establishing conditional probability tables) refer to the Italian bridge stock, the network structure and engineering judgment can easily be adopted for bridges in different geographical locations...|$|R

30|$|To {{recognize}} complex human action, frameworks aligned on single feature {{are usually}} not good enough. Researchers have proposed several features to extract different information of videos, such as the dense trajectory feature, STIP, SIFT, and so on. Moreover, there are researchers trying to combine multiple features by well-designed models for feature fusion. Natarajan et al. [18] extracted dozens of features from videos, which is SIFT, SURF, D-SIFT, CHOG, and so on. And they took advantage of multiple kernel learning and late fusion technology to combine these features. Tang et al. [19] used two basic operators which is <b>and</b> <b>operator</b> <b>and</b> <b>or</b> <b>operator</b> to combine two feature vectors. And operator simply connects two vectors while <b>or</b> <b>operator</b> chooses one vector from two vectors as the combined vector. They tried to construct a and-or tree to compute the best combination for two features. However, as this method requires searching for the best structure of and-or tree, the time complexity of this method is too high.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} few years several {{practitioners}} have proposed dif-ferent strategies for implementing Attribute-based credentials (ABCs) on smart cards. ABCs allow citizens to prove certain properties about them-selves without necessarily revealing their full identity. The Idemix ABC is the most versatile ABC system proposed in the literature, supporting pseudonyms, equality proofs of representation, verifiable encryption of attributes and proving properties of attributes via <b>AND,</b> NOT <b>and</b> <b>OR</b> <b>operators.</b> Recently, Vullers et al. and De La Piedra et al. addressed the implementation of the selective disclosure operations, pseudonyms and multi-credential proofs such as equality proofs of representation. In this manuscript, we present implementation strategies for proving properties of user attributes via these operators and show how to combine them via external and internal commitment reordering...|$|R
40|$|Complex event {{processing}} (CEP) {{has become}} increasingly important for tracking and monitoring applications ranging from health care, supply chain management to surveillance. These monitoring applications submit complex event queries to track sequences of events that match a given pattern. As these systems mature the need for increasingly complex nested sequence queries arises, while the state-of-the-art CEP systems mostly focus on the execution of flat sequence queries only. In this paper, we now introduce an iterative execution strategy for nested CEP queries composed of sequence, negation, <b>AND</b> <b>and</b> <b>OR</b> <b>operators.</b> Lastly the promise of applying selective caching of intermediate results to optimize the execution. Our experimental study using real-world stock trades evaluates the performance of our proposed iterative execution strategy for different query types. 1...|$|R

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been used to add value to Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Zimbabwe. This study had four objectives, The first objective was to find out which ICTs Zimbabwean SMEs are currently using. The second objective was to investigate the benefits of using ICTs in enhancing their businesses. The third goal was to find out on the various barriers which these SMEs are facing in adopting and using ICT. Finally the study sought to recommend how ICT can be engaged by these SMEs so that their businesses will be enhanced. The methodology used was a mixed one, where both qualitative and quantitative methods were used. Data was collected using interviews and questionnaires. Interviews were conducted with the <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>or</b> managers of the SMEs. The questionnaires were also self -administered to the <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> <b>or</b> managers of the SMEs. The sample was drawn from the Harareâ€™s CBD. The sampling method used was the stratified random sampling. This involved dividing the SMEs into a number of groups (strata). The stratum were clothing, hardware, stationery and Fast foods. The SMEs in the same sector were grouped together and then randomly selected. This method provided greater accuracy than a simple random sampling of the same size and was less expensive because a smaller sample provided greater precision. Findings from the study showed that ICT has enhanced SME businesses in different ways although they faced challenges in adopting them. Evidence showed that there are many benefits SMEs can get from using ICTs. The researcher recommends that <b>owners</b> <b>and</b> managers of SMEs should adopt and use ICT so that their businesses will be enhanced...|$|R
