40|$|Novel {{functionalized}} organo-morganic chiral catalysts {{have been}} prepared in two steps from activated silica gel and chiral <b>organic</b> <b>auxiliaries,</b> such as (+) -cinchonine or (S) -(-) -nicotine. These new catalysts have been tested in a solid-liquid-liquid three-phase system for the asymmetric epoxidation of alpha,beta-enones and the asymmetric alkylation reactions of glycine derivatives. The obtained stereoselectivities are negligible for the first case (ee < 2 %) and appreciable (ee 25 - 55 %) for the second one. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{dealing with}} the {{principles}} of sustainable production, the use of <b>organic</b> <b>auxiliary</b> materials continues to demand consideration because the procurement, application and disposal of such organic substances cause a significant load on the environment. To improve research work dealing with clean production this paper presents two measuring systems for detecting organic substances directly on the workpiece during the production process. The measuring devices are characterised with respect to their metrological properties and informational value of the results. The capacity to implement the devices readily is pointed out on the basis of measuring tasks found in industrial projects...|$|R
40|$|A new {{practical}} ligand-free {{protocol for}} copper-catalyzed C-heteroatom cross-coupling reactions (Ullmann-type) is described. The use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as the solvent overcomes {{the need to}} use <b>organic</b> <b>auxiliary</b> ligands; thus, DMSO is revealed as a nontoxic and superior solvent for Ullmann-type coupling reactions. This method allows the arylation {{of a wide range}} of amides, alcohols, and amines under practical conditions with bromobenzene and iodobenzene derivatives and will likely find direct application in current organic synthesis. The competitive reactivity among different functional groups is reported and rationalized, and the possibility to achieve selective arylation reactions is demonstratedThe authors acknowledge financial support from the European Research Council for Starting Grant Project (ERC- 2011 -StG- 277801), from the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Consolider-Ingenio CSD 2010 - 00065, INNPLANTA project INP- 2011 - 0059 -PCT- 420000 -ACT 1) and from the Generalitat de Catalunya (2009 SGR 637).

40|$|The factors {{identified}} to {{be important}} for the aerobic biodegradation of alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane (alpha-HCH) in a soil slurry are temperature, auxiliary carbon source, substrate concentration, and soil inhomogeneities. Temperatures {{in the range of}} 20 to 30 degrees C were determined to be most favorable for biodegradation of alpha-HCH. No alpha-HCH biodegradation was detected at temperatures below 4 degrees C and above 40 degrees C. The addition of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>organic</b> carbon compounds showed repressive effects on alpha-HCH biomineralization. Increased oxygen partial pressures reduced the repressive effects of added <b>auxiliary</b> <b>organic</b> carbon compounds. A linear relationship between alpha-HCH concentration and its conversion rate was found in a Lineweaver-Burk plot. Inhomogeneities such as clumping of alpha-HCH significantly affected its biodegradation. Inhomogeneity as an influence on biodegradation has not drawn sufficient attention in the past, even though it certainly has affected both laboratory studies and the application of biotechnological methods to clean up contaminated sites. On the basis of metabolites detected during degradation experiments, the initial steps of aerobic alpha-HCH bioconversion in a soil slurry are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Decontamination {{treatments}} of surfaces are performed on albumin and brain homogenate used as models of biological contaminations in a low-pressure reactor, {{inductively coupled plasma}} operated with water vapor based gas mixture. It is shown that removal of contamination {{can be achieved by}} using pure H 2 O or Ar/H 2 O mixtures at low temperatures with removal rates comparable with oxygen gas based mixtures. Particle fluxes (Ar+ ions, O and H atomic radicals and OH molecular radicals) from water vapor discharge are measured by optical emission spectroscopy and Langmuir probe in several operating conditions. Analysis of particle fluxes and removal rates measurements illustrates the role of ion bombardment associated with O radicals, governing the removal rates of <b>organic</b> matter. <b>Auxiliary</b> role of hydroxyl radicals is discussed on the base of experimental data. The advantages of a water vapor plasma process are discussed for practical applications in medical devices decontamination. JRC. I. 4 -Nanobioscience...|$|R
40|$|Solvent {{extraction}} using salphen as a ligand {{has been}} investigated for the selective separation and determination of trace Fe(II) and Fe(III). A salphen ligand was synthesized, and solvent extraction variables, such as solution pH, the concentration of salphen, the type of <b>organic</b> solvent, <b>auxiliary</b> agents, oxidants {{and the effect of}} interference were optimized. Salphen is stable at pH 3 - 4, and Fe(III) -salphen complexes can be selectively extracted into an MIBK(4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone) phase from an aqueous solution within this pH range. For the determination of the total amount of iron in 100 mL of aqueous solution, Fe(II) ions were completely oxidized using 0. 05 mL of 3. 5 % H 2 O 2 without side reactions. To evaluate its applicability, the proposed method was applied to determine trace Fe(II) and Fe(III) in several kinds of water samples. Reproducible results were obtained with RSD of less than 3. 0 %, and the recoveries for this reliability were obtained with 91 - 112 %.

40|$|Due {{to their}} oxygen affinity, {{magnesium}} and aluminium alloys are difficult-to-sinter materials. Either mechanical destruction or {{the action of}} a liquid phase {{can be used to}} break up oxide layers and thus achieve the desired diffusion bonds between the individual particles. In the present work, a liquid phase sintering approach is used in conjunction with high-purity particulates and controlled processing conditions in order to achieve a porous sintered product. Appropriate sinter conditions were determined with the help of thermodynamic calculations using the PANDAT software package. As no <b>organic</b> or other <b>auxiliary</b> substances are required, it is possible to obtain high-purity, high-porosity (up to 90 %) parts with exclusively open porosity. Such parts may find application as degradable implants or, in the case of aluminium, as heat exchangers in phase change heat storage or adsorption cooling devices...|$|R
40|$|This guide {{describes}} the simulator`s governing equations, constitutive functions and numerical solution algorithms of the STOMP (Subsurface Transport Over Multiple Phases) simulator, a scientific tool for analyzing multiple phase subsurface flow and transport. The STOMP simulator`s fundamental {{purpose is to}} produce numerical predictions of thermal and hydrologic flow and transport phenomena in variably saturated subsurface environments, which are contaminated with volatile or nonvolatile <b>organic</b> compounds. <b>Auxiliary</b> applications include numerical predictions of solute transport processes including radioactive chain decay processes. In writing these guides for the STOMP simulator, the authors have assumed that the reader comprehends concepts and theories associated with multiple-phase hydrology, heat transfer, thermodynamics, radioactive chain decay, and nonhysteretic relative permeability, saturation-capillary pressure constitutive functions. The authors further assume that the reader {{is familiar with the}} computing environment on which they plan to compile and execute the STOMP simulator. The STOMP simulator requires an ANSI FORTRAN 77 compiler to generate an executable code. The memory requirements for executing the simulator are dependent on the complexity of physical system to be modeled and the size and dimensionality of the computational domain. Likewise execution speed depends on the problem complexity, size and dimensionality of the computational domain, and computer performance. One-dimensional problems of moderate complexity can be solved on conventional desktop computers, but multidimensional problems involving complex flow and transport phenomena typically require the power and memory capabilities of workstation or mainframe type computer systems...|$|R
40|$|Firstly it is {{observed}} that in a large number of existing steam power plants the energy potential of the cooling medium is not fully utilized owing to turbine limitation in exhaust volume flow-handling capability. A method is proposed by which a fraction of the low-pressure steam is extracted and fed to an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>organic</b> Rankine cycle (ORC) module of small capacity which, besides being perfectly suited to exploiting even the coldest cooling agent, improves the working conditions of the main turbine by reducing its exhaust volume flow. Through the implementation of an appropriate computer program the performance of a typical power station supplemented with an ORC system is analysed for different cooling situations. Alternatively, as an obvious reference option, the performance of the same plant is evaluated under the assumption that the turbine is provided with an additional exhaust section. The characteristics of the ORC module are then considered. Working fluid selection within the new classes of ambient friendly refrigerants is discussed. Particular attention is devoted to turbine optimization, leading to high-efficiency low-stress two- and three-stage turbine configurations. With reference to the extended geothermal experience in the use of low-temperature ORC conversion systems a preliminary economic analysis is performed, giving encouraging indications about the potential viability of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{pollutant}} degrading biofilms {{in natural}} ecosystems and water treatment systems are often exposed to other carbon sources {{in addition to}} the pollutant. The availability of auxilliary carbon sources can lead to surplus biomass growth, changes in biofilm structure and carbon catabolite repression (CCR) which together will affect pollutant degradation rate and efficiency of the system. To understand the interplay between these processes, continuous biofilms of the 3, 4 -dichloroaniline (3, 4 -DCA) degrading Comamonas testosteroni WDL 7 -RFP were grown in single- and dual-substrate conditions with 3, 4 -DCA and/or citrate and reciprocal effects on 3, 4 -DCA/citrate degradation, biofilm biomass and biofilm structure were examined. The main mechanism affecting 3, 4 -DCA degradation in biofilms in dual-substrate conditions was citrate-mediated CCR as reflected by a decrease in specific 3, 4 -DCA degrading activity. Growth on citrate partially compensated for the lowered specific 3, 4 -DCA degradation activity under dual substrate conditions but not to the extent expected from growth observed under single-substrate conditions with citrate. This was explained by higher residual 3, 4 -DCA concentrations in the presence of citrate that increased cell dispersal in the biofilms. Our results show hampered pollutant removal in biofilms due to a complex interplay of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>organic</b> C source utilization for growth affecting specific pollutant degradation rate and changes in cell physiology due to incomplete pollutant removal. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy, {{through the}} Office of Technology Development, has {{requested}} {{the demonstration of}} remediation technologies for the cleanup of volatile organic compounds and associated radionuclides within the soil and groundwater at arid sites. This demonstration program, called the VOC-Arid Soils Integrated Demonstration Program (Arid-ID), has been initially directed at a volume of unsaturated and saturated soil contaminated with carbon tetrachloride, on the Hanford Site near Richland, Washington. A principal subtask of the Arid-ID program involves {{the development of an}} integrated engineering simulator for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of various remediation technologies. The engineering simulator's intended users include scientists and engineers who are investigating subsurface phenomena associated with remediation technologies. Principal design goals for the engineer simulator include broad applicability, verified algorithms, quality assurance controls, and validated simulations against laboratory and field-scale experiments. An important goal for the simulator development subtask involves the ability to scale laboratory and field-scale experiments to full-scale remediation technologies, and to transfer acquired technology to other arid sites. The STOMP (Subsurface Transport Over Multiple Phases) simulator has been developed by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory(a) for modeling remediation technologies. Information on the use, application, and theoretical basis of the STOMP simulator are documented in three companion guide manuals. This manual, the Theory Guide (Version 2. 0), provides the most recent theory and discussions on the governing equations, constitutive relations, and numerical solution algorithms for the STOMP simulator. The STOMP simulator's fundamental purpose is to produce numerical predictions of thermal and hydrogeologic flow and transport phenomena in variably saturated subsurface environments, which are contaminated with volatile or nonvolatile <b>organic</b> compounds. <b>Auxiliary</b> applications include numerical predictions of solute transport processes including radioactive chain decay processes. Quantitative predictions from the STOMP simulator are generated from the numerical solution of partial differential equations that describe subsurface environment transport phenomena. Description of the contaminated subsurface environment is founded on governing conservation equations and constitutive functions. Governing coupled flow equations are partial differential equations for the conservation of water mass, air mass, (dissolved) organic compound mass and thermal energy. Equations for the conservation of salt or surfactant mass have also been included. Constitutive functions relate primary variables to secondary variables. Solution of the governing partial differential equations occurs by the integral volume finite difference method. The governing equations that describe thermal and hydrogeological flow processes are solved simultaneously using Newton-Raphson iteration to resolve the nonlinearities in the governing equations. Governing transport equations are partial differential equations for the conservation of solute mass. Solute mass conservation governing equations are solved sequentially, following the solution of the coupled flow equations, by a direct application of the integral volume finite difference method. The STOMP simulator is written in the FORTRAN 77 language, following American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards. The simulator utilizes a variable source code configuration, which allows the execution memory and speed be tailored to the problem specifics, and essentially requires that the source code be assembled and compiled through a software maintenance utility...|$|R
