They got better information on German aircraft spark plugs, from BMW, Daimler, and Bosch, but not from Beru or Siemens, finding, in general, improvements focused on better performance at altitude or hotter, usually with better insulators or cooling.|$|E

Results using afterburner casing static pressure taps are compared to those using liner static pressure taps. It is found that the technique is very accurate for both the standard and <b>open</b> <b>nozzle</b> engine modes.

Fuel oil and gasoline were injected into air at densities of atmospheric land 0. 325 pound per cubic foot. It was found that the penetration rate at these low pressures was about the same as the rate obtained with higher pressures. Spray cone-angles were small and individual oil drops were visible in all the sprays. Gasoline and fuel oil sprays had similar characteristics...|$|E

50|$|Shut-off nozzles {{are used}} in the {{manufacturing}} process of plastic injection molding. Machine shut-off nozzles serve as the connection between the plasticizing barrel (with reciprocating screw) and the mold. They are mounted on the machineside of the plastic injection molding process, unlike hot runner nozzles which are mounted on the moldside of the process.

50|$|Depending on the design, {{the feed}} enters {{through the top}} or bottom inlet. Once {{clarified}} on the conical plates, product is discharged under pressure through the outlet. Separated solids, or sludge, are accumulated in the conical space adjacent to the nozzle. Once full (without exceeding {{the area of the}} plates), a piston is set to hydraulically <b>open</b> each <b>nozzle</b> ports, ejecting the sludge. Generally, water is used as the service fluid, acting as a piston to control the nozzle. During sludging, the water is injected to <b>open</b> the <b>nozzle</b> and drained to close it.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} model turbofan (typical {{of current}} engine technology) was {{tested in the}} NASA Glenn 9 by 15 Foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel (9 -by 15 -Foot LSWT) to explore far field acoustic effects of increased bypass nozzle area. This fan stage test {{was part of the}} NASA Glenn Fan Broadband Source Diagnostic Test, second entry (SDT 2) which acquired aeroacoustic results over a range of test conditions. The baseline nozzle was sized to produce maximum stage performance for the engine at a high altitude, cruise point condition. However, the wind tunnel testing is conducted near sea level conditions. Therefore, in order to simulate and obtain performance at other aircraft operating conditions, two additional nozzles were designed and tested-one with a + 5 percent increase in weight flow (+ 5. 4 percent increase in nozzle area compared with the baseline nozzle), sized to simulate the performance at the stage design point conditions, and the other with a + 7. 5 percent increase in weight flow (+ 10. 9 percent increase in nozzle area), sized for maximum weight flow with a fixed nozzle at sea level conditions. Measured acoustic benefits with increased nozzle area were very encouraging, showing overall sound power level (OAPWL) reductions of 2 or more dB while the stage thrust actually increased by several percentage points except fro the most <b>open</b> <b>nozzle</b> at takeoff rotor speed where stage performance decreased. These noise reduction benefits were seen to primarily affect broadband noise, and were evident throughout the range of measured sideline angles...|$|E

Effective perceived noise levels for a 1500 ft engine flyover and 3. 35 scale factor showed a similar noise reduction of 2 or more EPNdB.

Laser Doppler Velocimetry measurements taken downstream of the rotor showed that the total turbulent velocity decreased with increasing nozzle flow, which may explain the reduced rotor broadband noise levels...|$|E
5000|$|The needle {{keeps the}} nozzle [...] closed by spring pressure. When the {{injection}} pressure increases, the melt will push {{back on the}} needle head and try to <b>open</b> the <b>nozzle.</b> Once the melt inside the nozzle reaches {{a certain amount of}} pressure, it will succeed in pushing the needle back against the spring. There must, therefore, be a minimum pressure for the opening process to overcome the force of the spring. Once the <b>nozzle</b> <b>opens,</b> the pressure will drop again and the spring-operated needle will close the nozzle tip orifice.|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of outlet nozzles to upstream flow perturbations of varying magnitudes is investigated by numerically solving the quasi-one-dimensional Euler equations. Results are {{compared to the}} analytic linear solutions of Marble & Candel for compact and finite length choked nozzles, and those of Rienstra for <b>open</b> <b>nozzles.</b> It is demonstrated that the nonlinear {{response of}} the choked exit nozzle {{is very close to}} the linear analytic response at forcing amplitudes that are representative of those observed in combustors experiencing limit cycle, thermoacoustic instability. Although jet formation at an open end cannot be represented by quasi-one-dimensional flow, the numerical simulations suggest that the behaviour is slightly more nonlinear than for a choked outlet at the same forcing magnitudes, but still closely in agree-ment with the analytic linear solutions...|$|R
50|$|Afterburner-equipped engines {{may also}} <b>open</b> the <b>nozzle</b> for {{starting}} and at idle. The idle thrust is reduced which lowers taxi speeds and brake wear. This feature on the J75 engine in the F-106 was called 'Idle Thrust Control' and reduced idle thrust by 40%. On aircraft carriers, lower idle thrust reduces the hazards from jet blast.|$|R
40|$|Rate-of-{{discharge}} curves {{that show}} the discharge characteristics of an injection system having a very short fuel passage are presented. The rate of discharge closely follows the rate of displacement of the injection-pump plunger for <b>open</b> <b>nozzles</b> in which the maximum calculated pressures at the orifice do not exceed a certain value, which {{is dependent on the}} particular injection pump. With small orifices and high pump speeds, the rate of discharge does not follow the rate of plunger displacement because the higher discharge pressure results in increased leakage with corresponding decrease in discharge rate. The rate of discharge is not directly related to the rate of plunger displacement with automatic injection valves having closed nozzles. The types of pump check valve tested did not control the rate of cut-off or the discharge rate but they did affect the injection lag. Use of the short fuel passage eliminated the formation of secondary discharges...|$|R

Once at the 75 ft line and through the swinging doors, the competitor must then <b>open</b> the hose <b>nozzle,</b> releasing water onto a small target. After hitting the target, they must close the nozzle and drop the hose, which completes the event. The hose nozzle may only be <b>opened</b> once the <b>nozzle</b> <b>opens</b> the swinging doors, if the <b>nozzle</b> is <b>opened</b> earlier a 2 second penalty is added to the final time.

40|$|Until the 1960 s {{pesticides}} {{were applied}} with a spray gun {{connected to a}} long hose or directly to the tank and operated by a worker standing on a platform. This technique was gradually replaced by airassisted sprayers. The purchase of three sprayer test facilities in 1991 signified {{the start of a}} new era in pesticide application:• The ejection rate of the individual nozzles as well as the distribution pattern of the liquid could be measured and optimized on a vertical test stand by adjusting the nozzles or adding additional ones. • The ceramic nozzles were replaced by hollow-cone nozzles, which allowed for the first time to calculate the exact amount of liquid per hectare and tree height based on various parameters such as driving speed, spray pressure, number of <b>open</b> <b>nozzles</b> and nozzle output volume. The amount of water was reduced from 500 l/m tree height and hectare to 166 – 100 l. • The efficacy of the pesticides was increased and spray drift reduced, which brings about economic and ecological benefits. • Up to the year 1997 sprayer calibration was optional. Since then, a sprayer calibration in 5 -year intervals has become a condition for participation in the South Tyrolean IP-programme. This also facilitates the observance of the GobalGAP control points and Compliance Criteria regarding application equipment. Since 2011 the South Tyrolean sprayer manufacturers and fruit- and winegrowers have been able to measure and optimize the air blast and emission pattern. Thereby we hope to further reduce spray drift and increase the efficacy of the pesticides. A properly calibrated sprayer enables the fruit- and winegrowers to observe more easily the regulations for the distances to residential and public buildings as well as pastures enacted by the South Tyrolean Provincial Government and AGRIOS in 2011. We trust that the South Tyrolean fruit- and winegrowers will have no difficulties in complying with the Directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the sustainable use of pesticides with regard to application techniques and sprayer calibration...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{a product}} {{development}} of a product which facilitates enduro drivers swallowing fluid while driving. My own experience {{of the problem and}} a custom survey gave me some frames and requirements of how such a product would look. To obtain the different concepts the method of brainstorming was used where I outlined the various proposals. The basic concept was that some kind of pump would build pressure in the liquid and when the user <b>opens</b> the <b>nozzle</b> the liquid will come out without the need to use the mouth to suck. The screening phase consisted of two steps. The first step, a Pugh matrix where I varied reference concepts and four of the six proposals were eliminated. During the second screening phase, two test models were built and I tried out which one I would eliminate. The concept that was left was a simple pump, powered by a battery of 9 -volt. The pump starts when the user <b>opens</b> the <b>nozzle</b> and stops automatically when the nozzle is closed.   This is controlled by a hose which swells when the pump is running and the nozzle is closed. Then the hose begins to swell and affects a small micro switch that breaks the voltage supply to the pump. A check valve makes sure that the liquid remains in the hose and the pump will remain neutral until the re-opening of the nozzle and the hose shrinks. ...|$|R

At trimming (24 hours post mortem), two hundred left-thighs from pigs reared in two different farms, balanced for stunning and scalding methods, were evaluated subjectively {{on the basis of}} the intensity of red skin colour, using a 3 point scale system where 1 =defect absent, 2 =slight defect and 3 =serious defect, and colour of skin was measured.

40|$|Traditional {{sprayers}} adopt large-area uniform pesticide application, {{resulting in}} a low effective utilisation of pesticide and a harmful effect to the natural environment. Variable-rate spray is the key point to precision chemical application. However, {{it is inevitable that}} the spray pressure sharply fluctuates during variable-rate spray, which will definitely influence the spray characteristics, such as spray droplet sizes, spray angles, spray droplet velocities, etc., and reduce the efficiency of pesticide applications. Therefore, the research on how to keep the spray pressure constant during the process of variable- rate spray has practical significance to precision pesticide applications. In order to achieve the stability of spray pressure for variable- rate spray, a sprayer with constant-pressure control was set up using a closed-loop proportion integration differentiation (PID) controller of constant-pressure water-supply, which employed the techniques of single-phase alternating current (AC) chopper variablevoltage control and PID feedback regulation. Using hollow-cone nozzles, the spray volume was changed by adjusting spray pressure, frequency, and duty cycle of electromagnetic valve switching. The spray features concerning the spray angle and the spray volume distribution were studied in laboratory. The conclusions are as follows: i) for a given input spray pressure, the closed-loop controller with AC chopper and PID feedback regulation can effectively control the pressure fluctuations during the variable-rate spray through varying the frequency and the duty cycle; ii) the spray angle was slightly affected by the flow-rate change through adjusting the frequency and the duty cycle of electromagnetic valves or changing the number of <b>open</b> <b>nozzles.</b> The spray angle changes were controlled within the range of the maximum deviation 0. 87 ° from mean value and the minimum deviation 0. 03 ° from mean value; iii) when the spray pressure was set as 0. 3 Mpa, the peak radial position of the spray volume distribution basically unchanged and the spray volume and the peak values of the spray distribution gradually increased with the increasing duty cycle. When the setting pressure was increased, the spray volume increased and the peak radial position of the spray distribution gradually expanded toward outside, however the peak value of the spray distribution decreased a little...|$|R

For hover, a series of [...] "transition doors" [...] were <b>opened</b> into the <b>nozzles,</b> blocking them off and re-directing the flow downward under the aircraft. Control during this regime was provided by moving the outer portion of the flap to [...] "focus" [...] the flow. At higher speeds, the doors were closed, allowing the air to flow out {{from the edge of the}} aircraft, where a series of simple flap-like controls were located. The new control system covered the rear 3/4's of the aircraft's outer circumference; the front section featured the hovering controls only.|$|R
40|$|Long glass fiber-reinforced {{polypropylene}} composites {{are widely}} used in industry because of their low cost and high performance. However {{the strength of the}} parts depends on the average fiber length, and the fibers are subjected to breakage during the whole process, in the plasticating phase as well as during the flow through the nozzle and in the cavity of the mold. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine how hot runner systems (HRS) influence the fiber breakage. The type of HRS (<b>open</b> or tip <b>nozzle)</b> and its main geometrical characteristics (e. g. the manifold length and the diameter of the nozzle) could strongly induce a breakage of the fibers during the injection molding process. Experimental tests were conducted with a modular HRS. A polypropylene reinforced with long glass fibers was injected through different configuration of the HRS, maintaining the same process parameters. The flow in the modular HRS channels was also numerically simulated and the fiber breakage was predicted by a coupled fracture model. Eventually, the numerical simulation, calibrated by the experimental results, was used to optimize the geometry of the HRS, thus determining the configuration that retains the optimal fiber length throughout the injection molding process...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of a jet engine exhaust nozzle for {{civilian}} supersonic cruise vehicles, it is necessary to consider both the supersonic cruise efficiency and the noise generated during terminal area operations. The convergent-divergent geometry necessary for cruise efficiency, will separate when operated at the lower nozzle pressure ratios associated with take-off and initial climb, causing unacceptable noise levels. One proposed solution is to comprise the divergent geometry of two rotatable clamshell bodies. These clamshell components would be rotated <b>open</b> during low <b>nozzle</b> pressure ratio operation, to effectively eliminate the divergent geometry and effect a subsonic ejector nozzle. These clamshells have the added benefit of functioning as thrust reversers and eliminating the need for a separate such system. This work, in general, investigates the effectiveness of a preliminary clamshell ejector design. Specifically, a seven-hole probe mounted on an automated, 2 -axis traverse is used to collect wake survey data in the exhaust plume of the test nozzle in several configurations. This survey data is used to create velocity profiles of the jet plume and calculate thrust coefficients. In addition, several flow visualization techniques are utilized to further explore the flow structure near the geometry surface. Results indicate that the mixing layer between the primary and secondary streams is failing to attach to the ejector shroud, leading to separation and recirculation near the internal ejector shroud surfaces. Separation in these areas is causing streamwise vortices to be shed from the ejector surfaces. Thrust calculations indicate that the ejector configuration provides significant performance benefits reletive to the convergent-divergent cruise geometry, but is causing negative thrust augmentation. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{extremely}} powerful laser {{is being}} developed at Goddard Space Flight Center for use on a satellite. This laser has several potential applications. One application is {{to use it for}} upper atmosphere weather research. In this case, the laser would reflect off aerosols in the upper atmosphere and bounce back to the satellite, where the aerosol velocities could be calculated and thus the upper atmosphere weather patterns could be monitored. A second application would be for the US. Air Force, which wants to use the laser strategically as a weapon for satellite defense. The Air Force fears that in the coming years as more and more nations gain limited space capabilities that American satellites may become targets, and the laser could protect the satellites. Regardless of the ultimate application, however, a critical step along the way to putting the laser in space is finding a way to efficiently cool it. While operating the laser becomes very hot and must be cooled to prevent overheating. On earth, this is accomplished by simply running cool tap water over the laser to keep it cool. But on a satellite, this is too inefficient. This would require too much water mass to be practical. Instead, we are investigating spray cooling as a means to cool the laser in microgravity. Spray cooling requires much less volume of fluid, and thus could be suitable for use on a satellite. We have inherited a 2. 2 second Drop Tower rig to conduct our research with. In our experiments, water is pressurized with a compressed air tank and sprayed through a nozzle onto our test plate. We can vary the pressure applied to the water and the temperature of the plate before an experiment trial. The whole process takes place in simulated microgravity in the 2. 2 second Drop Tower, and a high speed video camera records the spray as it hits the plate. We have made much progress {{in the past few weeks}} on these experiments. The rig originally did not have the capability to heat the test plate, but I did some heat transfer calculations and picked out a heater to order for the rig. I learned QBasic programming language to change the operating code for our drops, allowing us to rapidly cycle the spray <b>nozzle</b> <b>open</b> and closed to study the effects. We have derived an equation for flow rate vs. pressure for our experiment. We have recorded several videos of drops at different pressures, some with heated test plate and some without, and have noticed substantial differences in the liquid behavior. I have also changed the computer program to write a file with temperature vs. time profiles for the test plate, and once the necessary thermocouple comes in (it was ordered last week), we will have temperature profiles to accompany the videos. Once we have these temperature profiles to go with the videos, we will be able to see how the temperature is affected by the spray at different pressures, and how the spray changes its behavior once as the plate changes from hot to cool. With quantitative temperature data, we can then mathematically model the heat transfer from the plate to the cooling spray. Finally, we can look at the differences between trials in microgravity and those in normal earth gravity...|$|R
