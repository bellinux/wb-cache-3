25|$|<b>Oxy-propane</b> torches {{are usually}} used for cutting up scrap to save money, as LPG is far cheaper joule for joule than acetylene, {{although}} propane {{does not produce}} acetylene's very neat cut profile. Propane also finds a place in production, for cutting very large sections.|$|E
5000|$|The alarm {{was raised}} at around 10:30, {{with the first}} crews {{arriving}} within five minutes. A serious fire was seen to be in progress, and a [...] "Make Pumps 10" [...] message was sent to control almost immediately (additional appliances required, which {{in addition to those}} already there would total 10). As part of this request for reinforcements, a [...] "Persons Reported" [...] message was sent, indicating persons were requiring urgent assistance and rescue. 70 firemen attended to fight the fire, with water poured onto the building from turntable ladders. It was found that efforts at rescue were futile due to the intense heat, and the difficulties in entering the building.Escape from the building had been prevented due to fire on the stairs, caused by polyurethane foam, and the escape doors from the first and second floors to the fire escape were found to have been locked from the inside. Eventually, no persons were seen at the windows, and any hopes of rescue for those inside ended when the roof of the building collapsed. Many attempts were made to enter the building where the employees were believed to be, but intense heat drove back the firemen. The Glasgow Fire Service personnel eventually gained access to the building, by cutting through the steel doors using <b>oxy-propane</b> cutting gear. The dead were found inside the factory to have died due to the inhalation of smoke, the burning of polyurethane foam resulting in poisonous fumes, fatal when inhaled.|$|E
40|$|Nanocrystalline {{alpha-alumina}} was synthesized in an indigenously built ultrasonic flame pyrolysis (UFP) setup. This paper {{describes the}} technical aspects of the apparatus and particle formation in the flame. Ultrasonically atomized aluminium nitrate dissolved in methanol-water mixture was pyrolyzed in an <b>oxy-propane</b> flame for yielding nanocrystalline alpha-alumina. The formation of nanophase alumina was confirmed by powder XRD analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was carried out to study particulate morphology. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.
