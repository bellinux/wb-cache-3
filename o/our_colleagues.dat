500|$|The Senate {{vetoed the}} text {{submitted}} by the Congress. The veto was proposed by the People's Party, which held {{the majority of the}} seats, and by the Democratic Union of Catalonia, and was approved by 131 [...] "yes" [...] and 119 [...] "no" [...] votes and 2 abstentions. As a result, the text was sent back to the Congress. On 30 June 2005, it was approved by Congress, which, in accordance with the constitutional provisions, overrode the Senate veto. This was achieved with 187 [...] "yes" [...] votes (including a member of the People's Party, Celia Villalobos), 147 [...] "no" [...] votes, and four abstentions. The veto override implied its approval as law. The vote was held after Zapatero unexpectedly took the floor of Parliament to speak in its support, saying We are expanding the opportunities for happiness of our neighbors, <b>our</b> <b>colleagues,</b> our friends and our relatives. At the same time, we are building a more decent society. Mariano Rajoy, the leader of the opposition People's Party, was denied the opportunity to address Parliament after Zapatero's appearance, and accused Zapatero of dividing Spanish society.|$|E
500|$|Newly elected President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych {{wanted to}} oust the current Cabinet and form a new Cabinet with his Party of Regions after his {{election}} on February 7, 2010. On February 20, 2010 Parliament Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn stated he would announce {{the dissolution of the}} coalition the next plenary week if its activity by then was not confirmed in documents. On February 17 Lytvyn had asked the coalition to provide within ten days documents that confirmed its existence, in particular, a list of at least 226 Members of Parliament who are members. Lytvyn stated {{that it was possible to}} ensure [...] "the effectiveness of the current coalition" [...] or create a new coalition in parliament. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko stated on February 22 she was holding negotiation [...] "to unite in the Verkhovna Rada the democratic and pro-Ukrainian forces, all rational deputies of Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc, the Lytvyn Bloc and Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc". If the current Cabinet could not be preserved Tymoshenko has stated she would go into Parliamentary opposition. During a Cabinet of Ministers meeting on February 24, 2010 Tymoshenko stated “I am certain that Our Ukraine group leaders … will stand firmly in the defense of Ukraine and everything Ukrainian. I am certain that these leaders will not change their ideology or beliefs and join a majority coalition led by Party of Regions” (the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc or Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc faction where needed to form a new coalition). On February 24 Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine’s parliament) Volodymyr Lytvyn received a document that had been drafted by the Party of Regions faction that had been submitted for examination by all factions, except the Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc, according to the Party of Regions the document was not the draft of a new coalition agreement but [...] "a document submitted to the head of the Lytvyn Bloc faction in the process of talks so that he can consider this draft and we proposed that <b>our</b> <b>colleagues</b> consider this coalition agreement and make their amendments and remarks, if they deem it necessary".|$|E

2500|$|The MNFIR {{became the}} object of {{government}} repression, soon after the antisemitic student Corneliu Zelea Codreanu was arrested on charges of terrorism. Codreanu had attempted to assassinate the staff of Adevărul, including the Jewish manager Iacob Rosenthal, and, during the interrogations, implicated other fascist alliances. His testimony was disputed by Vestul României, the pro-fascist newspaper of Timișoara, which claimed: [...] "The attempt [...] is not the work of terrorists, as was quickly proclaimed by some of <b>our</b> <b>colleagues,</b> but the mere revenge of one Sandi Bacaloglu who wished to defend the honor of his sister, that had been compromised by one Adevărul article, wherein it had been claimed that Elena Bacaloglu had been convicted for immodesty by the appellate court of Genoa." [...] Several other theories circulate regarding Codreanu's motivation, but {{it is known that}} his group of assassins included an FNR man, Teodosie Popescu, and also that the act was celebrated in the FNR media.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2006, {{a number}} of {{universities}} in Canada jointly refused {{to participate in the}} Maclean’s University Rankings survey. The president of the University of Alberta, Indira Samarasekera, commented that, [...] "Canadian universities are listening with great interest as the call to boycott U.S. News & World Report rankings continues to increase in volume among <b>our</b> <b>colleagues</b> to the south. Many of our American colleagues say {{that they would like to}} resist the rankings, but fear it can’t be done, especially if only a few institutions act. I write to let you know that institutions can take on the rankings. About a year ago, a growing number of Canadian institutions began to raise the same alarm, ultimately resulting in 25 of our 90+ institutions — including many of our leading universities — banding together to take just such a stand against the fall rankings issue of Maclean's, our Canadian equivalent [...] It’s time to question these third-party rankings that are actually marketing driven, designed to sell particular issues of a publication with repurposing of their content into even higher sales volume special editions with year-long shelf life." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1: The Sumo Association [...] "advises" [...] {{nineteen}} wrestlers {{to retire}} because of match-fixing: makuuchi-ranked Tokusegawa, Kasugao, Koryu, Hakuba, Shimotori, Kotokasuga and Mokonami, jūryō Masatsukasa, Asofuji, Sakaizawa, Wakatenro, Kiyoseumi, Toyozakura and Kyokunankai, former makuuchi Yamamotoyama and Jumonji, and former jūryō [...] Hoshihikari, Kirinowaka and Shirononami. Tanigawa Oyakata, (the former Kaiho), is {{also asked to}} resign but is quoted as saying, [...] "This is absolutely ridiculous. I told the Japan Sumo Association board that the panel’s investigation was full of holes. I will take legal action." [...] Many of the other wrestlers also declare their anger at being forced to retire, with Yamamotoyama saying,"They decided without listening to my excuse," [...] and Wakatenro protesting, [...] "There's no way I can accept this because I'm being forced out simply because my name came up in some testimonies and text messages." [...] They had until April 5 of that year to hand in their retirement papers, or face the even more harsh punishment of outright dismissal. Two year bans are given to those who admitted wrongdoing: Chiyohakuho, Takenawa Oyakata (ex Kasuganishiki) and sandanme ranked Enatsukasa (who acted as the go-between). However, all three have indicated they are leaving sumo completely. [...] Enatsukasa issued an apology to sumo fans, saying [...] "I've {{caused a lot of}} problems for the wrestlers who genuinely put in the work, and it hurts." [...] Seventeen sumo elders are demoted, with executive members Kitanoumi, Kokonoe and Michinoku resigning from their posts and chairman Hanaregoma taking a 30 per cent pay cut for two months. Hanaregoma told a press conference, [...] "We had to punish many people, all of whom are <b>our</b> <b>colleagues.</b> It was a very tough decision to make." [...] About ten other wrestlers are still under investigation, meaning {{it is unlikely that the}} Natsu tournament in May will go ahead.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 February 2017, {{more than}} 30,000 persons, {{including}} off-duty and former police officers, {{their family members}} as well as prominent Hong Kong society members such as former Secretary for Security and former Hong Kong Chief Executive candidate Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee, National People’s Congress deputy Maria Tam and legislators Priscilla Leung Mei-fun, Elizabeth Quat and Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, gathered at the Police Sports and Recreation Club in Mong Kok to express their sympathy for seven police officers who had been {{convicted and sentenced to}} two years' imprisonment for assaulting pro-democracy activist Ken Tsang, whom they had earlier arrested (and who was subsequently convicted) for assaulting police. Many observers condemned this as an illegal gathering as the organisers allegedly did not submit formal notice for this public gathering, as requited under Hong Kong's Public Order Ordinance. Some observers claim the gathering and its purpose was unethical as it implied endorsing the use of unlawful or excessive force against arrested persons; and that it improperly supported the actions of the convicted officers while suggesting contempt for the judicial decisions prompting their conviction and sentencing. Rather than disrespecting the judicial decision, other observers assert that the gathering's purpose was to show support for the convicted officers' families while expressing police frustration for being the focus of excessive verbal assaults and abusive insults when maintaining public order during the Umbrella Movement protests of 2014. One officer at the gathering was quoted as saying, “It is a deep and heartfelt expression of genuine support for <b>our</b> <b>colleagues</b> and their families, who we feel have been unfairly treated and whose actions came out of a time of highly charged political emotion and stress.” No matter the divergent points of view, the gathering albeit controversial, was conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{presidents have}} also {{commented on the}} {{reputational}} survey. [...] Former president of Scripps College, Nancy Y. Bekavac also stated in a press release on the college website that Scripps will also no longer submit the Reputational Survey to U.S. News as [...] "for years we have known of flaws in the methodology; {{many of us have}} spoken with editors at U.S. News in an attempt to improve its approach [...] but nothing can really improve a system that seeks to reduce 3,300 educational programs in American higher education to one set of numbers, and then rank them. College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not know enough about other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one of <b>our</b> <b>colleagues</b> likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. How can you say that Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position to make judgments on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with. The fact that one quarter of a college's ranking is based upon what is, in essence, its popularity, is very disturbing and we choose not to be a part of the process." ...|$|E
