Conducting polymers are of interest for solution-processing for film-forming conductive polymers. Therefore, attention has shifted to other conductive polymers for application purposes including polythiophene and polyaniline.|$|E
25|$|For {{mechanical}} stability, the LED and photoresistor are glued with {{a transparent}} epoxy, glue or an <b>organic</b> <b>polymer.</b> The glue also {{functions as a}} diffuser spreading the light beam – if it would fall near {{the border of the}} semiconductor and electrical contacts then a slight shift of the LED position might significantly alter the RO response.|$|E
25|$|Vegetable (paper) {{parchment}} is made {{by passing}} a waterleaf (an unsized paper like blotters) made of pulp fibers into sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural <b>organic</b> <b>polymer,</b> cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then washed in water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable parchment paper its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.|$|E

25|$|Red {{phosphorus}} {{can be used}} as a {{very effective}} flame retardant, especially in thermoplastics (e.g. polyamide) and thermosets (e.g. epoxy resins or polyurethanes). The flame retarding effect is based on the formation of polyphosphoric acid. Together with the <b>organic</b> <b>polymer</b> material, this acid creates a char which prevents the propagation of the flames. The safety risks associated with phosphine generation and friction sensitivity of red phosphorus can be effectively reduced by stabilization and micro-encapsulation. For easier handling, red phosphorus is often used in form of dispersions or masterbatches in various carrier systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of a hybrid photovoltaic cell that contains piezoelectric materials {{can be increased}} simply by placing it near a source of ambient noise or vibration. The effect was demonstrated with organic cells using zinc oxide nanotubes. The electricity generated by the piezoelectric effect itself is a negligible percentage of the overall output. Sound levels as low as 75 decibels improved efficiency by up to 50%. Efficiency peaked at 10kHz, the resonant frequency of the nanotubes. The electrical field {{set up by the}} vibrating nanotubes interacts with electrons migrating from the <b>organic</b> <b>polymer</b> layer. This process decreases the likelihood of recombination, in which electrons are energized but settle back into a hole instead of migrating to the electron-accepting ZnO layer.|$|E
25|$|Many {{applications}} of silicate glasses derive from their optical transparency, {{giving rise to}} their primary use as window panes. Glass will transmit, reflect and refract light; these qualities can be enhanced by cutting and polishing to make optical lenses, prisms, fine glassware, and optical fibers for high speed data transmission by light. Glass can be coloured by adding metallic salts, and can also be painted and printed with vitreous enamels. These qualities {{have led to the}} extensive use of glass in the manufacture of art objects and in particular, stained glass windows. Although brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Because glass can be formed or moulded into any shape, it has been traditionally used for vessels: bowls, vases, bottles, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms it has also been used for paperweights, marbles, and beads. When extruded as glass fiber and matted as glass wool in a way to trap air, it becomes a thermal insulating material, and when these glass fibers are embedded into an <b>organic</b> <b>polymer</b> plastic, they are a key structural reinforcement part of the composite material fiberglass. Some objects historically were so commonly made of silicate glass that they are simply called by the name of the material, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses.|$|E

Products made from cellulose include rayon and cellophane, wallpaper paste, biobutanol and gun cotton. Sugarcane, rapeseed and soy are some of the plants with a highly fermentable sugar or oil content that are used as sources of biofuels, important alternatives to fossil fuels, such as biodiesel.

These bug repelling properties of sweetgrass were later found by the American Chemical Society in the molecules phytol and coumarin.|$|E
500|$|Although {{primarily}} a saprotrophic fungus {{involved in the}} post-fire breakdown of duff and coniferous roots, Geopyxis carbonaria {{has been shown to}} be capable of forming ectomycorrhizae with Norway spruce (Picea abies). It had been demonstrated earlier in laboratory experiments that the fungus [...] has a biotrophic interaction with lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta). The hyphae of G.carbonaria were able to infect the cortex of the tree seedling, but did not penetrate the endodermis. These traits suggest that the fungus is a moderate pathogen, with limited ability to cause reductions in seed germination. Additionally, the fungus produces the enzyme polyphenol oxidase, and can break down the complex <b>organic</b> <b>polymer</b> lignin—features characteristic of saprotrophic fungi. The formation of a rudimentary Hartig net, a characteristic of mycorrhizal fungi, indicated that G.carbonaria might be capable of forming mutualistic relationships under the right conditions. Vrålstad and colleagues suggest that its below-ground association with spruce roots protects it from physical damage in the event of a fire, and the extensive fruitbody production after a fire may reflect [...] "a successful fungal escape from a dying host where the fungus no longer can maintain its biotrophic association".|$|E

Comm.|issue=16|date=1977|pages=578–580|doi=10.1039/C39770000578 }} Further studies led to improved control of the cis/trans isomer ratio and demonstrated that cis-polyacetylene doping led to higher conductivity than doping of trans-polyacetylene.

2500|$|Polyacetylene (IUPAC name: polyethyne) usually {{refers to}} an <b>organic</b> <b>polymer</b> with the repeating unit (C2H2)n. The name refers to its {{conceptual}} construction from polymerization of acetylene to give a chain with repeating olefin groups. [...] This compound is conceptually important as the discovery of polyacetylene and its high conductivity upon doping helped to launch the field of organic conductive polymers. The [...] high electrical conductivity discovered by Hideki Shirakawa, Alan Heeger, and Alan MacDiarmid for this polymer led to intense interest {{in the use of}} organic compounds in microelectronics (organic semiconductors). This discovery was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000. Early work in the field of polyacetylene research was aimed at using doped polymers as easily processable and lightweight [...] "plastic metals". Despite the promise of this polymer in the field of conductive polymers, many of its properties such as instability to air and difficulty with processing have led to avoidance in commercial applications.|$|E
2500|$|Ferrocene, a {{precursor}} to iron nanoparticles, {{can be used as}} a catalyst for the production of carbon nanotubes. The vinylferrocene from ferrocene can be made by a Wittig reaction of the aldehyde, a phosphonium salt and sodium hydroxide. The vinyl ferrocene can be converted into a polymer (polyvinylferrocene, PVFc), a ferrocenyl version of polystyrene (the phenyl groups are replaced with ferrocenyl groups). Another polyferrocene which can be formed is poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl ferrocenecarboxylate), PFcMA. [...] In addition to using <b>organic</b> <b>polymer</b> backbones, these pendant ferrocene units have been attached to inorganic backbones such as polysiloxanes, polyphosphazenes, and polyphosphinoboranes, (PH(R)BH2)n, and the resulting materials exhibit unusual physical and electronic properties relating to the ferrocene / ferrocinium redox couple. [...] Both PVFc and PFcMA have been tethered onto silica wafers and the wettability measured when the polymer chains are uncharged and when the ferrocene moieties are oxidised to produce positively charged groups. [...] The contact angle with water on the PFcMA-coated wafers was 70° smaller following oxidation, while in the case of PVFc the decrease was 30°, and the switching of wettability is reversible. [...] In the PFcMA case, the effect of lengthening the chains and hence introducing more ferrocene groups is significantly larger reductions in the contact angle upon oxidation.|$|E
