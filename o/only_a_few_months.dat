5|$|Construction was {{not without}} incident. In May 1860, a GNR train {{overshot}} the platform at King's Cross and fell into the workings.

5|$|Following {{historical}} sources, Shepseskare was traditionally {{believed to}} have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>months</b> at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion {{is based upon the}} state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung.|$|E
