40|$|Wind Energy {{available}} in 24 Nigeria cities is estimated using monthly wind speed data. The country is grouped into zones, namely: Coastal, Inland, Middle Belt and far Northern regions for effective characterization into areas of similar climatic conditions. To analyze the wind data, {{a check on}} the reliability is made to ensure adequacy for the estimation of spatial and temporal characteristics of the nation’s wind resources. The long-term average wind speed, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, shape and scale factors and wind power densities are estimated for each city and averaged for zones. From the results generated, the classification of the 24 stations into class 1 - 7 is made. Classification indicates class 1 for the weakest location for siting of wind power generators to class 7 the strongest possible site for electric energy generator site.

40|$|Ocean waves, in {{addition}} to generating direct forces on fixed and floating <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>generator</b> structures, also have significant indirect effects via their influence on the atmospheric and oceanic boundary layers {{above and below the}} water surface. In the atmospheric boundary layer the waves act as roughness elements, influencing the turbulent flow and the vertical wind speed profile, and induce oscillatory motions in the airflow. Spray droplets from breaking wave crests enhance structure corrosion, and may lead to icing under low-temperature conditions. Below the water surface, the air-sea momentum flux and mechanical energy flux, mediated by the waves and wave-generated turbulence, affect the vertical profiles of ocean current, temperature, and salinity. Effects include modifying the structural forces and dynamics, and the movement and dispersion of marine organisms, pollutants, and air bubbles generated by breaking waves, with consequences for fouling, corrosion, and environmental impact. Measurement of relevant airflow and ocean dynamical variables is also challenging, as near the water surface it is often necessary to use instruments mounted on moving measurement platforms. Modelling such boundary-layer effects is a complex task, as a result of feedbacks between the airflow, wave field, current field, and turbulence in the atmosphere and the ocean. We present results from a coupled model study of the North Sea and Norwegian Sea area. We employ a mesoscale atmosphere model (WRF) and a spectral wave model (WAM), running simultaneously and coupled using the open-source coupler MCEL which can interpolate between different model grids and time steps. To investigate the ocean boundary layer, one-dimensional model experiments were performed for an idealized Ekman layer and for locations in the North Sea, Atlantic Ocean, and the northern Pacific, using a version of the GOTM turbulence model, modified to take wave dynamics into account. Results show how the wave field alters the ocean’s aerodynamic roughness and the air–sea momentum flux, depending on the relation between the surface wind speed and the propagation speed of the wave crests (the wave age). These effects will feed back into the airflow, wind speed and turbulence profile in the boundary layer. The ocean dynamics experiments showed results which compare favourably with field observations from the LOTUS 3 and PROVESS experiments in the north Atlantic and North Sea, and Ocean Weather Station Papa in the Pacific Ocean. </p...|$|E

40|$|Choosing {{appropriate}} {{foundations for}} supporting <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> turbines {{is one of}} the uncertainties in the future rounds of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power development. <b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> turbines are dynamically sensitive structures as the global natural frequency of the whole system is very close to the forcing frequencies (due to the environmental loads and the associated frequencies due to the rotor). This particular aspect is important for designing foundations for Round 2 and Round 3 <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms in the UK.

Therefore <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm projects are increasingly turning to alternative multipod foundations (for example tetrapod, jacket, tripods) or on shallow foundations to reduce the environmental effects of piling noise.

40|$|The size of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> is increasing, and {{the trend}} is moving towards full {{converter}} gear-less solutions with permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSG). The nacelle weight reduction is a key design criterion for <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> turbines. To overcome the weight challenge, a transformer-less concept is under development. This concept employs a special PMSG with an innovative high insulation level between the groups of windings. The generator supplies nine series connected converter modules, which results in a high voltage DC output of 100 kV, reducing the total weight of the system. Conventional three phase 2 -level voltage source converters, each with 11. 1 kV output, are utilized in concept studies and simulations. However, other voltage source converter topologies {{are assumed to be}} more beneficial in terms of efficiency, voltage quality and reliability issues. This work compares multilevel converter topologies with regards to their suitability for the proposed concept. The result of an initial study is that the modular multilevel converter (MMC) is the most promising candidate. The MMC adds more components and complexity to an already intricate system, but gives benefits that are in line with many of the ideas behind the proposed concept. A modular structure grants the easiest expansion to a high number of levels, providing a high-quality voltage with less demand for filters to save both volume and weight. The MMC also offers redundancy possibilities for higher reliability, which is important in <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power installations. PSCAD/EMTDC simulation models have been built, implementing voltage balancing and redundancy control. The simulations have also investigated the functionality of the converter in the proposed system. The results show that the MMC performs well in the full system, and is therefore considered as a viable candidate. The number of levels needed is at least five to avoid series connection of IGBTs. Further studies should find an optimal number of levels, depending on the generator specifications, the desired level of losses, voltage quality and a weighting of reliability versus complexity. </p...|$|R

Currently, no codes or standards for <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power <b>generators</b> have been adopted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) for use on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). Current design methods based on allowable stress design (ASD) incorporate the uncertainty in the variation of loads transferred to the foundation and geotechnical capacity of the soil and rock to support the loads is incorporated into a factor of safety. Sources of uncertainty include spatial and temporal variation of engineering properties, reliability of property measurements applicability and sufficiency of sampling and testing methods, modeling errors, and variability of estimated load predictions.

Impedance functions (static and dynamic) have been proposed for piles exhibiting rigid and flexible behaviour in all the 3 ground profiles.

The results also show that, for the same dimensionless frequency, damping ratio of large diameter rigid piles is higher than long flexible piles and is approximately 1. 2 – 1. 5 times the material damping.

However the characteristics of these foundations under dynamic loading or long term cyclic wind turbine loading are not fully understood. This paper summarises the results {{from a series of}} small scaled tests (1 : 100, 1 : 150 and 1 : 200) of a complete National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) wind turbine model on three types of foundations: monopiles, symmetric tetrapod and asymmetric tripod. The test bed used consists of either kaolin clay or sand and up to 1. 4 million loading cycles were applied. The results showed that the multipod foundations (symmetric or asymmetric) exhibit two closely spaced natural frequencies corresponding to the rocking modes of vibration in two principle axes. Furthermore, the corresponding two spectral peaks change with repeated cycles of loading and they converge for symmetric tetrapods but not for asymmetric tripods. From the fatigue design point of view, the two spectral peaks for multipod foundations broaden the range of frequencies that can be excited by the broadband nature of the environmental loading (wind and wave) thereby impacting the extent of motions. Thus the system lifespan (number of cycles to failure) may effectively increase for symmetric foundations as the two peaks will tend to converge. However, for asymmetric foundations the system life may continue to be affected adversely as the two peaks will not converge. In this sense, designers should prefer symmetric foundations to asymmetric foundations...|$|R

The policy framework at present is uncertain, but there exists a number of schemes that could be applicable to <b>offshore</b> <b>wind,</b> making it feasible to incorporate <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> into the renewable energy supply using the usual funding and finance models. This dissertation finds that while there are many uncertainties, <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> development is feasible in Australia given the existing conditions...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{planners}} have shifted their attention towards <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power generation {{and the decision}} {{is supported by the}} public in general, which in the literature has a positive attitude towards <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> generation. However, globally only a few <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms are operating. As more wind farms start operating and more people become experienced with especially the visual impacts from <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms, the public positive attitude could change if the experienced impacts are different from the initially perceived visual interference. Using a binary logit model, the present paper investigates the relation between different levels of prior experience with visual disamenities from <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms and perception of visual impacts from <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. The differences in prior experience are systematically controlled for sampling respondents living in the areas close to the large scale <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms Nysted and Horns Rev and by sampling the a group of respondents representing the Danish population, which has little experience with <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. Compared to previous results in the literature, the present paper finds that perception of wind power generation is influenced by prior experience. More specifically, the results show that people with experience from <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms located far from the coast have a significant more positive perception of the visual impacts from <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms than people with experience from wind farms located closer to the coast. These results are noteworthy on two levels. First of all, the results show that perceptions of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> generation are systematically significantly influenced by prior experience with <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. Secondly, and in a policy context, the results indicate that the future acceptance of future <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms is not independent of the location of existing and new <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms. This poses for caution in relation to locating <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms too close to the coast. <b>Offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farms Visual impacts Perceptions Prior experience...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{outlines}} {{the design of}} an <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> farm using a dc offshore grid based on resonant dc-dc converters. Multiphase resonant dc-dc converters are studied to step up the dc voltage from individual <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> to a Medium Voltage (MV) dc bus, and from the MV bus to an HVDC line that will connect the wind farm to shore. Compared to an equivalent ac grid based wind farm, a dc grid based wind farm has slightly higher losses, but {{the weight of the}} magnetic components and cables is substantially lower. The analysis of operating permanent magnet synchronous generators at variable and constant dc voltages shows that a fixed dc voltage has marginally higher efficiency than a variable dc voltage. However, using a variable dc voltage gives lower harmonics at both the generator facing Voltage Source Converter (VSC) and the dc-dc step-up converter. An aggregated model of multiple parallel connected <b>wind</b> <b>generators</b> is developed and shown to accurately approximate a detailed PSCAD model during varying wind conditions and transients. Index Terms—dc-dc power conversion, HVDC transmission, wind energy, permanent magnet generator. I...|$|R
40|$|Year 2010 is the {{significant}} year of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power development in China. The first national <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power project {{is connected to}} the grid, and the first round of concession projects marks the strong support from central government. It is foreseeable that <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power capacity in China will expand rapidly in the future, and the understanding pattern of it is crucial for analyzing the overall wind market in China and global <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power development. This paper firstly provides an overview of global <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power development, then in China, including historical installation, potential of resources, demonstration and concession projects, and target of development. Based on this, analysis on current policies related to <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power and their implementation, current wind farm developers and turbine manufacturers of China's <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> industry is done. All the previous analysis generates complete evaluation of current status and some issues and trends of China <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power development, based on which some policy recommendations for sustainable development of <b>offshore</b> <b>wind</b> power are made...|$|R
