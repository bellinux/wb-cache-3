40|$|A {{world wide}} {{interest}} in protecting ozone layer against manmade effects is now increasing. Assessment {{of the ozone}} depletion due to these activities depends on how successfully we can separate the natural variabilities from the data. The monthly mean values of total ozone over Cairo (30 05 N) for the period 1968 - 1988, have been analyzed using the power spectral analysis technique. The technique {{used in this analysis}} does not depend on a pre-understanding of the natural fluctuations in the ozone data. The method depends on increasing the resolution of the spectral peaks in order to obtain the more accurate sinusoidal fluctuations with wavelength equal to or less than record length. Also it handles the possible sinusoidal fluctuations with wavelength equal to or less than record length. The results show {{that it is possible to}} detect some of the well known national fluctuations in the <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> such as annual, semiannual, quasi-biennial and quasi-quadrennial oscillations.

40|$|International audienceSurface ozone is {{measured}} since 2004 at the coastal East Antarctic station of Dumont d'Urville (DDU) and since 2007 at the Concordia station {{located on the}} high East Antarctic plateau. Ozone levels at Concordia reach a maximum of 35 ppbv in July and a minimum of 21 ppbv in February. From November to January, sudden increases of the ozone level, up to 15 - 20 ppbv above average, often take place. They are attributed to local photochemical ozone production as previously seen at the South Pole. The detailed examination of the diurnal <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> in summer at Concordia suggests a local photochemical ozone production of around 0. 2 ppbv h− 1 during the morning. The <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> at DDU exhibits a maximum of 35 ppbv in July and a minimum of 18 ppbv in January. Mixing ratios at DDU are always higher than those at Neumayer (NM), another coastal Antarctic station. A noticeable difference in the ozone records at the two coastal sites lies in the larger ozone depletion events occurring from July to September at NM compared to DDU, likely due to stronger BrO episodes in relation with a larger sea ice coverage offshore that site. A second difference is the large day-to-day fluctuations which are observed from November to January at DDU but not at NM. That is attributed to a stronger impact at DDU than at NM of air masses coming from the Antarctic plateau. The consequences of such a high oxidizing property of the atmosphere over East Antarctica are discussed {{with regard to the}} dimethylsulfide (DMS) chemistry...|$|E

The long-term <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> (1988 - 1996) was examined with regard to potential inhomogeneities using Zugspitze (2960 m asl), a neighbouring alpine site in Germany, as a reference site. The Alexandersson test (for shift) and the Easterling-Peterson test (for trend and shift) were applied to a difference times series, calculated from monthly ozone means at Jungfraujoch and Zugspitze. The Alexandersson test revealed a significant shift discontinuity in November 1989 and the Easterling-Peterson test a trend discontinuity in September 1991. It is assumed that the shift discontinuity may be related to an instrument change, but there is not firm evidence due to lack of detailed information from the instrumental history in the earlier years of the <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> at Jungfraujoch. Monthly ozone means at Davos (1640 m asl) in eastern Switzerland indicate that part of the trend discontinuity in September 1991 may be of natural origin. Adjustment of the monthly ozone means at Jungfraujoch for the observed shift discontinuity removed the inhomogeneity in November 1989, and reduced the trend discontinuity by a factor of 4. 8. A trend analysis on both adjusted (homogenised) and unadjusted monthly ozone means (1988 - 1996) at Jungfraujoch showed no statistically significant linear trend. The boundaries encompassing the true linear trend are indicated by two linear regression calculations on both adjusted and unadjusted data.

40|$|Although {{stratosphere}} penetrating {{volcanic eruptions}} have been infrequent {{during the last}} half century, periods have existed {{in the last several}} hundred years when such eruptions were significantly more frequent. Several mechanisms exist for these injections to affect stratospheric minor constituent chemistry, both on the long-term average and for short-term perturbations. These mechanisms are reviewed and, because of the sensitivity of current models of stratospheric ozone to chlorine perturbations, quantitative estimates are made of chlorine injection rates. It is found that, if chlorine makes up as much as 0. 5 to 1 % of the gases released and if the total gases released are about the same magnitude as the fine ash, then a major stratosphere penetrating eruption could deplete the ozone column by several percent.

The changes at any individual measuring station could be local in nature, and herein, particular attention was paid to the seasonal and latitudinal variations of total ozone, because two dimensional photochemical models indicate that any changes in total ozone would be most pronounced at high latitudes during the winter months.

Also included are some new, unpublished reanalyses of these records including a complete reevaluation of 29 stations located in the former Soviet Union. The major new advance in knowledge of the measured ozone trend is the existence of independently calibrated satellite data records from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAG) instruments. These confirm many of the findings, originally derived from the Dobson record, concerning northern mid-latitude changes in ozone. We now have results from several instruments, whereas the previously reported changes were dependent on the calibration of a single instrument. This update will compare the <b>ozone</b> <b>records</b> from many different instruments {{to determine whether or not}} they provide a consistent picture of the ozone change that has occurred in the atmosphere.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a sensitivity analysis of multi-variate regressions of recent springtime Antarctic vortex ozone trends using a "big data" ensemble approach. Multi-variate regression methods {{are widely used}} for studying the variability and detection of ozone trends. Based on multi-variate regression analysis of total Antarctic springtime vortex ozone {{it has been suggested}} that the observed increase of ozone since the late 1990 s is statistically significant and can be attributed to decreasing stratospheric halogens (Salby et al., 2011, 2012; Kuttippurath et al., 2013). We find that, when considering uncertainties that have not been addressed in these studies, this conclusion on ozone recovery is not warranted. An ensemble of regressions is constructed based on the analysis of uncertainties in the applied <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> as well as of uncertainties in the various applied regressors. The presented combination of ensemble members spans up the uncertainty range with about 35 million different regressions. The poleward heat flux (Eliassen–Palm Flux) and the effective chlorine loading explain, respectively, most of the short-term and long-term variability in different Antarctic springtime total ozone records. The inclusion in the regression of stratospheric volcanic aerosols, solar variability, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and the Southern Annular Mode is shown to increase rather than to decrease the overall uncertainty in the attribution of Antarctic springtime ozone because of large uncertainties in their respective records. Calculating the trend significance for the <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> from the late 1990 s onwards solely based on the fit of the effective chlorine loading should be avoided, as this does not take fit residuals into account and thereby results in too narrow uncertainty intervals. When taking fit residuals into account, we find that less than 30 % of the regressions in the full ensemble result in a statistically significant positive springtime ozone trend over Antarctica from the late 1990 s to either 2010 or 2012. Analysis of choices and uncertainties in time series show that, depending on choices in time series and parameters, the fraction of statistically significant trends in parts of the ensemble can range from negligible to more than 90 %. However, we were unable to detect a robust statistically significant positive trend in Antarctic springtime vortex ozone in the ensemble...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} stratospheric ozone on the interannual variability and trends in tropospheric ozone from 30 - 90 ° N between 1990 and 2009 using ozone measurements and a global chemical transport model (the Community Atmospheric Model with chemistry) with input meteorology from the National Center for Environmental Prediction. The model simulation uses constant interannual emissions. Both the model and measurements indicate that on large spatial scales stratospheric interannual ozone variability drives significant tropospheric variability and contributes to long-term tropospheric ozone trends. To diagnose the measured variability we utilized measurements from ozonesondes and the Measurements of OZone and water vapour by in-service Airbus airCraft programme (MOZAIC) north of 30 ° N. We identify a regionally robust 150 hPa ozone signal from measurements over Canadian, Northern European and Central European regions and at 500 hPa over Canadian, Northern European and Eastern US regions. Averaged over these regions, the 150 hPa interannual ozone variability explains 69 % of the interannual variability at 500 hPa. The simulated stratospheric signal explains 81 % of the simulated variability over these same regions. Simulated and measured ozone are significantly correlated over these regions and the simulation suggests that the <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> over these regions {{is representative of the}} overall hemispheric 500 hPa <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> from 30 - 90 ° N. The measured 500 hPa trends averaged over these three regions between 1990 and 2000 and 1990 and 2009 are 0. 73 (± 0. 51) ppbv yr− 1 and 0. 27 (± 0. 19) ppbv yr− 1, respectively. The simulated trends in 1990 - 2000 and 1990 - 2009 are 0. 29 ± 0. 10 ppbv yr− 1 and 0. 13 ± 0. 05 ppbv yr− 1, respectively; however, these trends are substantially larger when the model is sampled for missing data exactly as the measurements are. Simulated stratospheric ozone accounts for 79 % of the simulated 500 hPa trend between 1990 and 2000 and 100 % of the simulated trend between 1990 and 2009. Due to the importance of local meteorology and emissions at the surface it is difficult to isolate the stratospheric component of measured surface ozone variability. Overall when averaged between 30 - 90 ° N simulated surface interannual ozone trends are 0. 18 ppbv yr− 1 and 0. 07 ppbv yr− 1 between 1990 and 1999, and between 1990 and 2009, respectively. We have identified a number of surface sites where the measured interannual ozone variability is correlated with the 150 hPa ozone signal. Most notably these sites include the high mountain sites over Europe and Macehead, Ireland. Over Macehead the measured 150 hPa ozone signal explains 40 % of the interannual variability of the unfiltered measured <b>ozone</b> <b>record.</b> The simulated and measured ozone are highly correlated over Macehead. The Macehead measured and simulated unfiltered ozone trends between 1990 and 2000 are 0. 28 (± 0. 33) and 0. 17 (± 0. 13) ppbv yr− 1 respectively; between 1990 and 2009 the measured and simulated trends are 0. 18 (± 0. 11) and 0. 08 (± 0. 06) ppbv yr− 1, respectively. Increases in the simulated stratospheric ozone component accounts for 53 % and 75 % of the overall modeled trend for the two periods at Macehead...|$|E

The amount of ozone-depleting compounds in the stratosphere (as measured by Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine – EESC) maximised {{in the second half of}} the 1990 s. We therefore examine the trends in the periods before and after that peak to see if any change in trend is discernible in the <b>ozone</b> <b>record.</b> Prior to 1998, trends in the upper stratosphere (~ 45 km, 4 hPa) are found to be − 5 to − 10 % per decade at mid-latitudes and closer to − 5 % per decade in the tropics. No trends are found in the mid-stratosphere (28 km, 30 hPa). Negative trends are seen in the lower stratosphere at mid-latitudes in both hemispheres and in the deep tropics. However it is hard to be categorical about the trends in the lower stratosphere for three reasons: (i) there are fewer measurements, (ii) the data quality is poorer, and (iii) the measurements in the 1990 s are perturbed by aerosols from the Mt. Pinatubo eruption in 1991. These findings are similar to those reported previously even though the measurements for the two main satellite instruments (SBUV and SAGE II) and the ground-based Umkehr and ozonesonde stations have been revised. There is no sign of a continued negative trend in the upper stratosphere since 1998 : instead there is a hint of an average positive trend of ~ 2 % per decade in mid-latitudes and ~ 3 % per decade in the tropics. The significance of these upward trends is investigated using different assumptions of the independence of the trend estimates found from different datasets. The averaged upward trends are significant if the trends derived from various datasets are assumed to be independent, but are generally not significant if the trends are not independent. This arises because many of the underlying measurement records are used in more than one merged dataset. At this point it is not possible to say which assumption is best. Including an estimate of the drift of the overall ozone observing system decreases the significance of the trends. The significance will become clearer as (i) more years are added to the observational record, (ii) further improvements are made to the historic <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> (e. g. through algorithm development), and (iii) the data merging techniques are refined, particularly through a more rigorous treatment of uncertainties...|$|E

In this study we evaluate more than 5. 5 years of ozone profile measurements from the OMPS LP processed with the new NASA GSFC version 2. 5 retrieval algorithm. We provide a brief description of the key changes that had been implemented in this new algorithm, including a pointing correction, new cloud height detection, explicit aerosol correction, and a reduction of the number of wavelengths used in the retrievals. The OMPS LP ozone retrievals have been compared with independent satellite profile measurements obtained from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and Odin Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS). We document observed biases, seasonal differences and evaluate the stability of the version 2. 5 <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> over 5. 5 years. Our analysis indicates that the mean differences between LP and correlative measurements are well within required ± 10  % between 18 and 42  km. In the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere (>  43  km) LP tends to have a negative bias. We find larger biases in the lower stratosphere and upper troposphere, but LP ozone retrievals has significantly improved in version 2. 5 compared to version 2 due to the implemented aerosol correction. In the northern high latitudes we observe larger biases between 20 and 32  km due to the remaining thermal sensitivity issue. Our analysis shows that LP ozone retrievals agree well with the correlative satellite observations in characterizing vertical, spatial and temporal ozone distribution associated with natural processes, like the seasonal cycle and Quasi Biennial Oscillations. We found a small positive drift ~  0. 5  %/yr in the LP <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> against MLS and OSIRIS that is more pronounced at altitudes above 35  km.

40|$|Long-term climate {{records from}} {{satellites}} are often constructed from the measurements of {{a sequence of}} instruments launched at different times.

We illustrate these issues {{in the construction of}} a merged total <b>ozone</b> <b>record</b> from two TOMS and three SBUV instruments. This record extends from late 1978 through the present. The question is "How good are these records?". We have examined the uncertainty in determining the relative calibration of two instruments during an overlap period in their measurements. When comparing a TOMS instrument, such as that on Nimbus 7, with an SBUV instrument, also on Nimbus 7, we find systematic differences and random differences. We have combined these findings with estimates of individual instrument drift into a monte- carlo uncertainty propagation model. We estimate an instrument drift uncertainty of a little larger than 1 percent per decade over the 25 -year history of the TOMS/SBUV measurements. We make an independent estimate of the drift uncertainty in the ground-based network of total ozone measurements and find it to be of similar, but slightly smaller magnitude. The implications of these uncertainties for trend and recovery determination will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Most recent {{assessments}} of long-term {{changes in the}} vertical distribution of ozone (by e. g. WMO and SI 2 N) rely on data sets that integrate observations by multiple instruments. Several merged satellite <b>ozone</b> profile <b>records</b> have been developed {{over the past few}} years; each considers a particular set of instruments and adopts a particular merging strategy. Their intercomparison by Tummon et al. revealed that the current merging schemes are not sufficiently refined to correct for all major differences between the limb/occultation records. This shortcoming introduces uncertainties that need to be known to obtain a sound interpretation of the different satellite-based trend studies. In practice however, producing realistic uncertainty estimates is an intricate task which depends on a sufficiently detailed understanding of the characteristics of each contributing data record and on the subsequent interplay and propagation of these through the merging scheme. Our presentation discusses these challenges in the context of limb/occultation <b>ozone</b> profile <b>records,</b> but they are equally relevant for other instruments and atmospheric measurements. We start by showing how the NDACC and GAW-affiliated ground-based networks of ozonesonde and lidar instruments allowed us to characterize fourteen limb/occultation <b>ozone</b> profile <b>records,</b> together providing a global view over the last three decades. Our prime focus will be on techniques to estimate long-term drift since our results suggest this is the main driver of the major trend differences between the merged data sets. The single-instrument drift estimates are then used for a tentative estimate of the systematic uncertainty in the profile trends from merged data records. We conclude by reflecting on possible further steps needed to improve the merging algorithms and to obtain a better characterization of the uncertainties involved...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} analysis of total column <b>ozone</b> <b>records</b> obtained from satellite measurements and from two global climate chemistry models on global scale. Firstly, a spectral weight analysis is performed where the relative strength of semiannual, annual and quasi-biennial oscillations are determined {{with respect to the}} integrated power spectra. The comparison reveals some anomalies in the model representations at each spectral component. The tails of the spectra demonstrate that both models underestimate high frequency (daily) ozone variability, which might have a complex origin, since several dynamical processes affect short time changes of the ozone level at a given location. Secondly, detrended fluctuation analysis is exploited to analyze two-point correlations of anomaly time series. Both models reproduce the characteristic geographic dependence of correlation strength over the overlapping area with empirical observations (latitude band between 60 °S and 60 °N). The values of precise correlation exponents are hard to obtain over regions where quasi-biennial oscillations or other strong nonstationarities (ozone hole) are present. In spite of all the numerical difficulties, significant long range correlations are detected for total ozone over all geographic locations...|$|R
40|$|The annual {{variations}} of ozone near the tropopause {{are derived from}} aircraft exhibit year-to-year differences which are not explicitly {{accounted for by the}} simple, classical ozone transport theory. Phenomena such as tropopause lifting, interannual variations in the rates of stratospheric-tropospheric exchange and meridional mixing, contribute differently to the distribution of ozone in this altitude region. Ozone encounter climatologies have been represented by global maps which show the probabilities of exceeding ambient ozone levels of 200, 300, and 400 ppbV along flight routes during the year. Continuous <b>ozone</b> <b>records</b> obtained from the GASP system revealed the presence of gravity waves whose wavelength is of the order 20 km. The GASP data cannot, however, be utilized for the evaluation of horizontal fluxes of such quantities as ozone, sensible heat, and zonal momentum; the data are too sparsely and irregularly distributed for the computation of stable correlations. Multiple species data from the unique circumglobal flight of a Pan American airliner on 28 - 30 October 1977 are discussed with particular regard to the apparent interhemispheric differences in tropospheric species concentrations, variation between the Arctic and Antarctic stratospheres, to possible covariations between species, and to potential source regions for various constituents...|$|R
