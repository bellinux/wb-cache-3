Annual Net Profit is suggested as an objective function and the optimization procedure is developed. The effects of local wind speed and wind turbine power characteristics on the <b>optimum</b> hub <b>height</b> are investigated. The <b>optimum</b> hub <b>height</b> decreased as the mean wind speed and wind shear exponent increased.

40|$|Abstract — Existing {{practice}} of solar water pumping in multi-floored buildings employs Top Floor Storage Method. In this method, {{considerable amount of}} water is pumped to unnecessary heights, resulting in energy wastage. Present paper discusses a novel scheme “Individual Floor Storage Method ” for solar pumping. Here water is pumped to the required <b>optimum</b> <b>heights</b> thus avoiding wastage of energy. This results in reduction in panel size and hence in the net initial cost which is a significant advantage as the main demerit of solar pumping system is its high initial cost. In this paper, a comparison is made between both the methods for solar pumping system with battery backup for a 2 -floored house. It’s found from the tests that the solar panel size is reduced by 12. 5 % and the net cost is reduced by 11 % with the proposed new method.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of musculoskeletal disorders {{of the lower}} back is high in female assembly line workers. This has posed serious problems in health management at workplaces. We have already pointed out that such health related problems {{are closely related to}} working conditions and have advocated the need for ergonomy-based improvement of working conditions for the prevention of occupational diseases. This study was designed to ergonomically determine the <b>optimum</b> working <b>height</b> and the <b>optimum</b> period of work for the relief of muscle stress associated with working postures. A field experiment was undertaken. In the experiment, the body length distribution of workers was taken into consideration. 1. Many of the workers felt that the low working height, high speed of the conveyor-belts and long period of work were the sources of stress. The complaint that the working height was too low was more frequent in tall workers. 2. To determine the <b>optimum</b> working <b>height,</b> conveyor-belts of four different heights, 73, 78, 83 and 88 cm, were prepared and tested. The conveyor-belt of 78 cm in height was best suited por 90 % of the workers, regardless of their statures. When the angle of stooping action and the smooth movement of arms are taken into consideration, a 5 - 10 cm increase from the current height (73 cm) seemed to be the <b>optimum</b> working <b>height.</b> 3. Shortening the current period of 60 minutes to 20 minutes was found to be desirable. The above results suggest that introduction of working time management and ergonomically-derived measures in addition to the already advocated health-management plans would be effective for the relief of musculoskeletal disorders...|$|R

The columns and beam of frames consist of an un-stiffened rectangular-shaped steel section. Pushover analyses of single columns and rigid-frames were carried out using beam-column elements associated with nonlinear stress-strain relations for both concrete and steel. The effect of filled-in height of single columns was first examined by comparing the ultimate displacement and the ultimate strength determined using an available failure criterion established for cantilever type concrete-filled steel columns. The <b>optimum</b> concrete-filled <b>height</b> of the single columns was found to be around 0. 30 times the column height. The pushover analyses were carried out for three rigid-frames having different filled-in heights.

In addition, three cross wind speeds 1, 2 and 3 m/swere produced to determine the effect of wind speed on total spray drift.

The nozzle angle 65 ° gave the highest drift reduction compared to the other nozzle angles. The maximum driftfor all nozzles was found at nozzle height of 60 cm. The minimum mean value of the drift was found at wind speed of 1 m/s.
