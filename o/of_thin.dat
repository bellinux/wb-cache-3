30|$|It is {{well known}} that wood density and tree RW are {{affected}} by different types <b>of</b> <b>thinning</b> treatments; however, information on the effects <b>of</b> <b>thinning</b> on individual RD and RW is meager and fragmentary. Koga et al.

40|$|Effective time <b>of</b> <b>thinning</b> is {{essential}} for determining a silvicultural operation schedule. One {{of the most commonly}} used methods is the percentage of radial increase to assess the effect <b>of</b> <b>thinning.</b> However, {{it is difficult to determine}} the ideal time point due to variation in tree growth rates. Event history analysis was used to quantify the optimal timings for different row thinning types for a 45 -year-old Cryptomeria japonica plantation in the mountainous region of Taiwan. The increase in tree-ring size was measured and converted to the basal area increment (BAI) to estimate annual tree growth; derived time-series data were entered into event history analysis to calculate the time to 50 % probability of survival. Additionally, an accelerated failure time regression was applied to test the effects <b>of</b> <b>thinning</b> and its timing; model validation was carried out to examine the influence <b>of</b> <b>thinning</b> time variation on plant growth through time. Results showed that thinning modified the temporal dynamics of the BAI, and, in general, a positive trend was observed between strip-width and time <b>of</b> <b>thinning.</b> Simulated tree growth in the model validation corroborated that accurate timing may optimize thinning effects. Combining tree-ring measurement and event history analysis may facilitate determining the timing <b>of</b> row <b>thinning,</b> which can improve carbon sequestration of forest stands...|$|R

5|$|Familial dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM) {{is a rare}} {{cause of}} systolic heart failure (prevalence 1:5000). A wider range of mutations (including some non-sarcomeric proteins as well) is associated with DCM.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of a comparison <b>of</b> <b>thinning</b> in spruce forest stands and beech forest stands. The data were collected {{in the area of}} forest districts Oravská Polhora and Nadleśnictwa Jeleśnia. The aim was to find out the intensity and the type <b>of</b> <b>thinning.</b> There were particular selected stands with similar natural and characteristic conditions where a future intervention was planned. There were established 8 research plots in the stands with the area of 0, 16 ha. Basic stand characteristics were measured and evaluated on the plots before and also after the interventions. The data analyzing shows a big difference among the intensities <b>of</b> interventions. The <b>thinning</b> in Poland was much more intense. The intensity <b>of</b> <b>thinning</b> on the plots of Slovak territory was just one half of the intensity prescribed in the forest economical plans. There was a big difference between the measured stand reserves and the reserves listed in the plans. On the plots where beech was the dominant tree species a thinning from above with negative selection was done. On the plots where spruce was the dominant tree species a negative thinning from below with minimal intervention into the level was done. This corresponds with the indexes <b>of</b> <b>thinning.</b> The carried out ways <b>of</b> <b>thinning</b> for beech and spruce were often used especially in the past. Current effort is to grow stands with the highest stability and quality. According to these requirements newer and more modern ways <b>of</b> <b>thinning</b> were developed. These ways help us effective to achieve the aims. Based on the results a rationalization thinning from above according to Korpeľ (1988), possibly free thinning from above according to Štefančík (1984) was suggested in the stands with beech as a dominant tree species. In the spruce stands a thinning from above according to Konšel D degree (1931) was suggested...|$|R
