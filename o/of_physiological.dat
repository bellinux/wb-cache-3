5|$|Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} metabolites (or natural products), {{and research}} has established {{the existence of}} biochemical pathways solely {{for the purpose of}} producing mycotoxins and other natural products in fungi. Mycotoxins may provide fitness benefits in terms <b>of</b> <b>physiological</b> adaptation, competition with other microbes and fungi, and protection from consumption (fungivory). Many fungal secondary metabolites (or derivatives) are used medically, as described under Human Use below.|$|E

5|$|Serpins are {{involved}} in a wide array <b>of</b> <b>physiological</b> functions, and so mutations in genes encoding them can cause a range of diseases. Mutations that change the activity, specificity or aggregation properties of serpins all affect how they function. The majority of serpin-related diseases are the result of serpin polymerisation into aggregates, though several other types of disease-linked mutations also occur. The disorder α-Antitrypsin deficiency {{is one of the most}} common hereditary diseases.|$|E

5|$|The flesh has a mild taste, and a strong, pungent, fruity smell. The {{mushroom}} is poisonous, containing muscarine compounds. Consumption of {{the mushroom}} {{could lead to}} a number <b>of</b> <b>physiological</b> effects, including: salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal problems and emesis (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym SLUDGE. Other potential effects include a drop in blood pressure, sweating and death due to respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals have {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>physiological</b> and {{anatomical}} features to overcome the unique challenges associated with aquatic living. Some of these features are very species specific. Marine mammals have developed a number of features for efficient locomotion such as torpedo shaped bodies to reduce drag; modified limbs for propulsion and steering; tail flukes and dorsal fins for propulsion and balance. Marine mammals are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber, circulatory adjustments (counter-current heat exchangers); torpedo shaped bodies, reduced appendages, and large size to prevent heat loss.|$|E
5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples <b>of</b> <b>physiological</b> enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E

25|$|As are all metazoans, {{humans are}} capable <b>of</b> <b>physiological</b> {{regeneration}} (i.e. {{the replacement of}} cells during homeostatic maintenance that does not necessitate injury). For example, the regeneration of red blood cells via erythropoiesis occurs through the maturation of erythrocytes from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow, their subsequent circulation for around 90 days in the blood stream, and their eventual cell-death in the spleen. Another example <b>of</b> <b>physiological</b> regeneration is the sloughing and rebuilding of a functional endometrium during each menstrual cycle in females in response to varying levels of circulating estrogen and progesterone.|$|E

25|$|Physiological {{noise is}} from head and brain {{movement}} in the scanner from breathing, heart beats, or the subject fidgeting, tensing, or making physical responses such as button presses. Head movements cause the voxel-to-neurons mapping to change while scanning is in progress. Since fMRI is acquired in slices, after movement, a voxel continues {{to refer to the}} same absolute location in space while the neurons underneath it would have changed. Another source <b>of</b> <b>physiological</b> noise is the change in the rate of blood flow, blood volume, and use of oxygen over time. This last component contributes to two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>physiological</b> noise, which, in turn, is the main contributor to total noise.|$|E
