In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today.

25|$|As {{parts of}} Jazz Track and Jazz at the Plaza, respectively, the 58 Sessions chronicled the {{transition}} from the brawny agitation of Milestones, to the cerebral tranquility <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue. The recording sessions also became known as a stepping stone in Davis' move from bebop to modal jazz. The live side in particular was seen by critics as a glimpse at the sextet that would record Kind of Blue. The complimentary and seemingly spontaneous style of performance ethic and the relationship between Davis and his musicians was fundamental for his work during these sessions and improved onto the Kind of Blue sessions.|$|E
25|$|The {{sessions}} for the album in mid-1958, {{along with the}} Milestones sessions from earlier that year, were seen by many music writers as elemental in Miles Davis' transition from bebop to the modal style of jazz and were viewed as precursors to his best-known work, Kind of Blue. Following audio engineering and digital restoration by engineer Larry Keyes at Sony Music New York Studio, the album was reissued on compact disc in 1991 as part of Columbia's Jazz Masterpieces Series. For later reissues, the album was retitled as 58 Sessions Featuring Stella by Starlight or 58 Miles Featuring Stella by Starlight. The complete 1958 {{sessions for}} Columbia were issued on the box set The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane, and Jazz at the Plaza was reissued in 2001. The first four tracks were also released as Bonus disc of the 50 Anniversary Collector's Edition <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue.|$|E

500|$|Kind of Blue was {{originally}} released as a 12-inch vinyl record, in both stereo and mono. There {{have been several}} reissues <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue, including additional printings throughout the vinyl era. On some editions, the label switched the order for the two tracks on side two, [...] "All Blues" [...] and [...] "Flamenco Sketches". The record has been remastered many times during the compact disc era, including the 1986 Columbia Jazz Masterpieces reissue and, most notably, the 1992 remastering that corrected the speed for side one, which had been issued slightly off-pitch originally, and the 1997 issue that added the alternative take of [...] "Flamenco Sketches". In 2005, a DualDisc release included the original album, a digital remastering in 5.1 Surround Sound and LPCM Stereo, and a 25-minute documentary Made in Heaven about the making and influence <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue. Kind of Blue has also been re-released on a rare 24-carat gold CD collectors version.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, {{however, the}} arrival of Ornette Coleman on the jazz scene via his fall {{residency}} at the Five Spot club, consolidated by the release of his The Shape of Jazz to Come LP in 1959, muted the initial impact <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue, a happenstance that irritated Davis greatly. Though Davis and Coleman both offered alternatives to the rigid rules of bebop, Davis would never reconcile himself to Coleman's free jazz innovations, although he would incorporate musicians amenable to Coleman's ideas with his great quintet of the mid-1960s, and offer {{his own version of}} [...] "free" [...] playing with his jazz fusion outfits in the 1970s. The influence <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue did build, and all of the sidemen from the album went on to achieve success on their own. Evans formed his influential jazz trio with bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian; [...] "Cannonball" [...] Adderley fronted popular bands with his brother Nat; Kelly, Chambers and Cobb continued as a touring unit, recording under Kelly's name as well as in support of Coltrane and Wes Montgomery, among others; and Coltrane went on {{to become one of the}} most revered and innovative of all jazz musicians. Even more than Davis, Coltrane took the modal approach and ran with it during his career as a leader in the 1960s, leavening his music with Coleman's ideas as the decade progressed.|$|E
500|$|As was Davis's penchant, {{he called}} for almost no {{rehearsal}} and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only [...] "Flamenco Sketches" [...] yielded a complete take on the first try. That take, not the master, was issued in 1997 as a bonus alternate take. The five master takes issued, however, were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to [...] "Freddie Freeloader" [...] was recorded, but was not used for release or on the issues <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue prior to the 1997 reissue. Pianist Wynton Kelly {{may not have been}} happy to see the man he replaced, Bill Evans, back in his old seat. Perhaps to assuage the pianist's feelings, Davis had Kelly play instead of Evans on the album's most blues-oriented number, [...] "Freddie Freeloader". The live album Miles Davis at Newport 1958 documents this band. However, the Newport Jazz Festival recording on July 3, 1958, reflects the band in its hard bop conception, the presence of Bill Evans only six weeks into his brief tenure in the Davis band notwithstanding, rather than the modal approach <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue.|$|E

500|$|Gary Burton, of Berklee College of Music, {{noted the}} {{consistent}} innovation present throughout the album, stating: [...] "It wasn’t just one tune {{that was a}} breakthrough, it was the whole record. When new jazz styles come along, the first few attempts to do it are usually kind of shaky. Early Charlie Parker records were like this. But with Kind of Blue [...] all sound like they’re fully into it." [...] Along with the Dave Brubeck Quartet's Time Out (1959) and Coltrane's Giant Steps (1960), Kind of Blue has often been recommended by music writers as an introductory jazz album, for similar reasons: the music on both records is very melodic, and the relaxed quality of the songs makes the improvisation easy for listeners to follow, without sacrificing artistry or experimentation. Upon {{the release of the}} 50th anniversary collector's edition of the album, a columnist for All About Jazz stated [...] "Kind of Blue heralded the arrival of a revolutionary new American music, a post-bebop modal jazz structured around simple scales and melodic improvisation. Trumpeter/band leader/composer Miles Davis assembled a sextet of legendary players to create a sublime atmospheric masterpiece. Fifty years after its release, Kind of Blue continues to transport listeners to a realm all its own while inspiring musicians to create to new sounds—from acoustic jazz to post-modern ambient—in every genre imaginable." [...] Later in an interview, renowned hip-hop artist and rapper Q-Tip reaffirmed the album's reputation and influence when discussing the significance <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue, stating [...] "It's like the Bible—you just have one in your house." [...] The 2014 album Blue by Mostly Other People Do the Killing is a note-for-note reproduction <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue.|$|E
500|$|According to Acclaimed Music, Kind of Blue is the 49th most ranked {{record on}} critics' all-time lists. In 1994, {{the album was}} ranked number one in Colin Larkin's Top 100 Jazz Albums.

In 2002, Kind of Blue was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress {{to be added to the}} National Recording Registry. In selecting the album as number 12 on its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, Rolling Stone magazine stated: [...] "This painterly masterpiece is one of the most important, influential and popular albums in jazz".

The script is Carter and company's usual hodepodge of crackpot theory and weird extemporization, but it's a huge relief to shift away, even for a week, from the grind of heavy-handed murder parties that define so much of the series". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "very atmospheric". Gibron praised Dourif's guest role, and noted that the episode helped to lay the groundwork for the direction the series would take in its second season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Force Majeure" [...] five stars out of five, describing it as [...] "rich and dark". Shearman felt that the episode's plot was [...] "borrowed from The X-Files", and came across as [...] "just a collection of ideas". However, he praised Dourif's [...] "barnstorming performance", comparing it to his role in The X-Files episode [...] "Beyond the Sea", and noted that [...] "Force Majeure" [...] was [...] "an episode which bravely redefines what [...] is capable of".|$|E

500|$|Originally {{there was}} a scene after the four had been reunited in the museum where Amy had a [...] "meltdown" [...] and Rory assured her it was okay; this was cut due to pacing issues, which pleased Darvill as he disliked his {{performance}} in the scene. Gillan stated that the episode was the [...] "most difficult" [...] for her, as it was [...] "a big climax for Amy and her story that's been building through the series...it just required a lot <b>of</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> concentration and emotion." [...] In August 2011 she stated that the Doctor and Amy's farewell was the most emotional scene for her to film. The scene in which the Doctor gives a final speech to young Amelia was not filmed with Smith and Blackwood on the same set. Smith's dialogue was shot first in the bedroom set, while the corner with the bed was recreated and filmed with Blackwood as a pick-up. Blackwood fell asleep during filming. Amy and Rory's wedding reception was filmed at Miskin Manor. Gillan found wearing the dress strange, while Darvill {{felt as if he}} was gate-crashing someone else's wedding, as he did not know any of the extras there. Haynes wanted to first show the revelation that the TARDIS would appear at the reception in a small way with minor changes such as the glasses tinkling and chandelier shaking, and build it up from there. Moffat thought that Amy would want a big wedding with a lot of dancing. In the script it was written that the Doctor was a [...] "terrible dancer" [...] and danced like a [...] "drunk giraffe", and Smith additionally came up with his own routine.|$|E

2500|$|During the {{creative}} process <b>of</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Blue, Davis handed Evans {{a piece of paper}} with two chords– G minor and A augmented– and asked [...] "What would you do with that?"

When Evans suggested he might deserve a share of the royalties, Davis offered him a check for $25. Evans also penned the liner notes for Kind of Blue, comparing jazz improvisation to Japanese visual art. By the fall of 1959, Evans had started his own trio with Jimmy Garrison and Kenny Dennis, but it was short-lived.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 2008 it was {{announced}} that Jay-Z become the first major hip hop artist to headline Britain's 2008 Glastonbury Festival. Tickets sold out quickly. Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. [...] "I'm sorry, but Jay-Z?" [...] Gallagher asked, swearing. [...] "No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition <b>of,</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of,</b> guitar music, do you know what I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday night—you go, 'Kylie Minogue? I don't know about that', do you know what I mean?—but I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury, no way, no, no. It's wrong." [...] As controversy mounted, Jay-Z replied, [...] "We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other's genre of music and move forward." [...] Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis's iconic song [...] "Wonderwall", and went on to deliver a performance heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.|$|E

And the word sort of stuck with me, and I think the whole idea of performance, and kind of putting on this outfit and going out almost to find some sort of exorcism or absolution, to kind of get outside yourself, there's a sense of ceremony to it." [...] Welch also revealed that she wanted to call the album Violence, stating, [...] "I wanted to make an album that sounded like the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, the violence mixed with the classical Shakespearean drama mixed with the pop and the pulp, extreme neon stuff." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she described the album as [...] "much bigger" [...] and categorised its genre as [...] "chamber soul", a mixture of chamber pop and soul.

There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the other thing, {{that was the first time}} we ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo <b>of</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway.
