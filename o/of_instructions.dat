40|$|Supervision {{in school}} often {{discussed}} about the negative opinion of teachers because misunderstanding {{about the process}} and the concept of supervision. Thus, this descriptive study was conducted through a questionnaire survey on three schools in the Zone City Muar Johor. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the teachers’ opinions towards supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> that has been implemented at schools, identify the practice <b>of</b> supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> carried out at school, identify whether there is a difference teachers’ opinion towards supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> based on demographic factors (gender, race and experience teaching), identify whether there is a difference practice <b>of</b> supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> based on demographic factors (gender, race and experience teaching) and determine whether there is a significant relationship between opinion for the supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> with practice <b>of</b> supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction.</b> The study sample involved 120 teachers from schools in SJK (C) Zone City Muar Johor. Questionnaires modified from previous studies were used as an instrument. The data were analyzed using SPSS and the results of the analysis were reported in the form of descriptive statistics. The reliability of the instrument using Cronbach Alpha was 0. 644 for part B and 0. 797 for part C. The results showed that teachers had a positive opinion for the supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> and practice <b>of</b> supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> was at a high level, the study showed no difference of opinion about the supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> based on gender and race, and found a difference of opinion about the supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> based on experience teaching. The findings showed there was no significant difference in teachers' opinions about practice <b>of</b> supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> based on gender, race and experience teaching. Finally, this study proves that there was a positive and strong relationship between the opinion for the supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> with practice <b>of</b> supervision <b>of</b> <b>instruction...</b>|$|R
5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime {{of a program}} {{is equal to the}} number <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all compute-bound programs.|$|E
5|$|Michael J. Flynn created {{one of the}} {{earliest}} classification systems for parallel (and sequential) computers and programs, now known as Flynn's taxonomy. Flynn classified programs and computers by whether they were operating using a single set or multiple sets <b>of</b> <b>instructions,</b> and whether or not those instructions were using a single set or multiple sets of data.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{computer}} software {{has been written}} for serial computation. To solve a problem, an algorithm is constructed and implemented as a serial stream <b>of</b> <b>instructions.</b> These instructions are executed on a central processing unit on one computer.

5|$|Upon {{completion}} of each puzzle, the player's performance is compared on a leaderboard {{based on the}} number <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> placed in their reactors, the number of cycles it took to meet the quota, and the number of reactors required to meet the solution. The player also has an option to upload videos of their solution to YouTube. The player, once having cleared a puzzle, can return to previous puzzles to try to improve their solution by reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>instructions,</b> cycles taken, or reactors used. SpaceChem supports downloadable content created by the developers themselves, and user-submitted puzzles through its ResearchNet service. A later addition included an open-ended sandbox mode where players could simply explore the game's capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Three {{programs}} were {{written for the}} computer. The first, consisting of 17instructions, was written by Kilburn, and so far as can be ascertained first ran on 21 June 1948. It was designed to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218−1 downwards. The divisions were implemented by repeated subtractions of the divisor. The SSEM took 3.5million operations and 52minutes to produce the answer (131,072). The program used eight words of working storage {{in addition to its}} 17words <b>of</b> <b>instructions,</b> giving a program size of 25words.|$|E
5|$|To fit {{the program}} into the 320 words {{available}} on the chip, some significant modification was used. By not using regular floating point numbers, which require lots <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> to keep the decimal point in the right place, some space was freed up. Trigonometric functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log about 20 on top of that. The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs.|$|E

5|$|Acton was {{supplanted by}} the most famous English cookery book of the Victorian era, Isabella Beeton's Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, 1861, which sold nearly two million copies up to 1868. Where Acton's was a book to be read and enjoyed, Beeton's, {{substantially}} written in later editions by other hands, was a manual <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> and recipes, to be looked up as needed. Mrs Beeton was substantially plagiarized from authors including Elizabeth Raffald and Acton. The Anglo-Italian cook Charles Elmé Francatelli became a celebrity, cooking {{for a series of}} aristocrats, London clubs, and royalty including Queen Victoria. His 1846 book The Modern Cook ran through 29 editions by 1896, popularising an elaborate cuisine described throughout with French terminology, and offering bills of fare for up to 300 people.|$|E
5|$|From {{the advent}} of very-large-scale {{integration}} (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling computer word size—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle. Increasing the word size reduces the number <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than {{the length of the}} word. For example, where an 8-bit processor must add two 16-bit integers, the processor must first add the 8 lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8 higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the carry bit from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.|$|E

Belgrano rejected taking the prize money for himself, considering that a patriot should not seek money or wealth. He gave {{it back to the}} XIII year Assembly, with instructions to build primary schools at Tarija, Jujuy, San Miguel de Tucumán, and Santiago del Estero. He laid out a series <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> about the methods and requirements for the selection of the teachers.

5|$|The {{distinction}} between the king's personal household department of the Wardrobe and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. The Wardrobe had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the Great Seal, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy Seal, used to authenticate the king's less formal letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> for the chancellor to issue {{a letter from the}} Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.|$|E
