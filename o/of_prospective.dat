5|$|Dialogi and Summa Technologiae (1964) are Lem's {{two most}} famous {{philosophical}} texts. The Summa is notable {{for being a}} unique analysis <b>of</b> <b>prospective</b> social, cybernetic, and biological advances; in this work, Lem discusses philosophical implications of technologies that were completely {{in the realm of}} science fiction at the time, but are gaining importance today—for instance, virtual reality and nanotechnology.|$|E
5|$|The results <b>of</b> <b>prospective</b> {{cohort studies}} on the {{relationship}} between abortion and breast cancer have been consistently negative. Such studies are considered more reliable than retrospective studies and case-control studies. The positive association between abortion and breast cancer risk observed in case-control studies is accounted for by recall bias.|$|E

5|$|At one point, Monica was {{forecast}} to pass {{directly over}} Goulburn Island. In response, officials evacuated the island's 337 residents to shelters {{set up in}} Pine Creek. Numerous schools in the threatened region, especially in Darwin, were closed ahead of Monica's arrival. Several shelters were opened in Darwin early on 24 April in anticipation of an influx of evacuees. Stores throughout the area reported increased sales for storm supplies, with some reducing prices on specific items. The same day, the Darwin Returned and Services League of Australia cancelled all ANZAC Day services and marches in Darwin that were to be held the next day, {{to ensure the safety}} <b>of</b> <b>prospective</b> participants.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Republican Senator Scott Brown ran for {{re-election}} to a first full term. He {{had been elected}} in a special election in 2010 {{following the death of}} incumbent Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy. Brown faced no challengers from his own party. For the Democrats, an initial wide field <b>of</b> <b>prospective</b> candidates narrowed after the entry of Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, the architect of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren clinched near-unanimous party support, with {{all but one of the}} other Democratic candidates withdrawing following her entrance. After winning her party's nomination, eliminating any need for a primary, she faced Brown in the general election.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic <b>of</b> <b>prospective</b> mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E

5|$|The black {{nationalist}} movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites {{during the late}} 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential black voters that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo trade unionist Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and {{by the start of}} 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU <b>of</b> <b>prospective</b> black voters impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{and comment on}} the published peer-reviewed literature for evidence of effectiveness of treatments for metastatic uveal melanoma. Methods: Literature search and analysis of satisfactory articles on treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma published between 1980 and 2007. Results: Of 71 identified articles, 10 (14. 1 %) were review articles without original case information, 2 (2. 8 %) were review articles combined with case reports, 17 (24. 0 %) were case reports, 15 (21. 1 %) were retrospective descriptive case series reports, 3 (4. 2 %) were pilot studies of a novel intervention, 2 (2. 8 %) were reports <b>of</b> a <b>prospective</b> nonrandomized phase I clinical trial, 7 (9. 9 %) were reports <b>of</b> a <b>prospective</b> nonrandomized phase I/II clinical trial, 14 (19. 7 %) were reports <b>of</b> a <b>prospective</b> nonrandomized phase II clinical trial, and 1 (1. 4 %) was a report <b>of</b> a <b>prospective</b> randomized phase II clinical trial. None of the articles was a report <b>of</b> a <b>prospective</b> randomized phase III clinical trial. None of the reports <b>of</b> a <b>prospective</b> study included a comparison group of similar but untreated patients. The largest reported unselected patient groups had a median survival time after detection of metastasis {{in the range of}} 3 to 4 months. In contrast, the largest selected patient groups tended to have substantially longer median survival times. Conclusions: Although median survival time following diagnosis of metastatic uveal melanoma tends to be substantially longer in selected subgroups of patients subjected to aggressive invasive interventions than it is in unselected groups, and although thi...|$|R
