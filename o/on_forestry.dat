He served as a surgeon and botanist for the geographical and geological exploration and survey west of the 100th meridian under Lieut. George M. Wheeler, the Wheeler Survey, 1873-1875. In 1876, he established the North Mountain School of Physical Culture in Luzerne County, also during the same year he was appointed by the American Philosophical Society lecturer <b>on</b> <b>forestry</b> in execution of the Michaux legacy. He studied botany in Alsace at the University of Strassburg in 1880. It was while Rothrock was in Europe that he began to study forest management, which led him to be a pioneer in forest management in Pennsylvania and the United States.|$|E
25|$|From {{the summit}} of Carl Side a system of ridges descends southward towards Millbeck. The main spur runs {{straight}} for a mile, the first half being of gentler gradient and culminating in a large patch of white stones at about 1,600ft. There is a very short rocky arête here, before the spur falls abruptly to the valley floor. On {{the eastern side of}} this section are the crags of Doups. The southern ridge sends out shorter branches on either side, just above the patch of white stones. On the western side across the rocky col of Long Doors is Dodd, a fell <b>on</b> <b>Forestry</b> Commission land that is largely wooded. To the east is Carlsleddam, a steep sided spur that appears sharply peaked from below: though less inspiring close up it does have a narrow and airy summit ridge.|$|E
500|$|The tax-driven {{nature of}} {{investment}} in the sector made it vulnerable to policy changes and court rulings interpreting tax law. Tax law reforms in the late 1990s resulting from a major review of tax policy (called the Ralph review) altered {{the way in which}} deductions could be claimed. These changes, together with company profit warnings, caused a decline in Great Southern's share price and its business prospects in 2000 and 2001. Although Great Southern survived the reforms, another company, Australian Plantation Timber, was driven into administration. In June 2001 a Senate committee report was critical of Australian Taxation Office (ATO) advice <b>on</b> <b>forestry</b> investments, and the ATO released a statement reassuring forest product investors that they had investment certainty. MIS schemes recovered in 2002, despite a further Senate Committee report critical of mass-marketed investment schemes, that recommended [...] "that the government seek advice from both ASIC and the ACCC {{on the question of the}} adequacy of the current measures for monitoring the schemes market, with particular reference to agribusiness and franchise schemes".|$|E

500|$|In {{between his}} Parliamentary work, Coke {{and his wife}} had been {{maintaining}} and improving his estates since they took possession of it in April 1776. The cornerstone was Holkham House, a [...] "temple to the arts" [...] built by Coke's great uncle. Knowing {{that he did not have}} the same understanding of classical architecture and art, Coke mainly left it alone, instead focusing on the park and gardens. The grounds had been laid out during the 1720s and 1730s, in a design which quickly became seen as old-fashioned. Coke had the lake massively expanded, shifting a total of 36,000 cubic yards of earth, and employed the gardener John Sandys from 1781. Sandys created several large pieces of woodland, planting over 7,000 trees in 22 acres near the Eastern Lodge, another ten acres near the lake, and four acres on marshland. In 1784 a further woodland expansion was undertaken, with 40 acres and 11,000 trees, and between 1785 and 1789 396,750 trees were planted on a further 179 acres. He retired in 1805 and was replaced a year later by James Loose, but continued to advise Coke <b>on</b> <b>forestry</b> matters. The library was also expanded, through the work of William Roscoe, who bought books including the Mainz Psalter for Coke between 1814 and 1842.|$|E
500|$|Sheet Harbour is a rural {{community}} on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, Canada. It {{is part of the}} Halifax Regional Municipality and lies along the Marine Drive on Trunk 7 approximately [...] northeast of Halifax. The catchment area around the community contains approximately 5,000 people. The community is located along the shores of Sheet Harbour, which has two arms: the Northwest Arm and the Northeast Arm. Two rivers flow into the harbour: West River into the Northwest Arm, and East River into the Northeast Arm. Little West River, a minor river, also flows into the Northwest Arm. Grand Lake, a large lake west of Sheet Harbour, empties into the Atlantic Ocean, via the Little West River. Adjacent to the community is the Sheet Harbour Industrial Port, an important regional deep-water port. The majority of the land was granted in 1773 and the colony was established in 1784. Forestry was prominent in Sheet Harbour during its early years. The first sulphide pulp mill in the Dominion of Canada was constructed along the East River in 1885. However, it was closed in 1891, due to the high prices of importing sulphide. Another pulp mill was constructed beside the West River Falls in 1925, but it was destroyed by Hurricane Beth in August 1971. The community today relies <b>on</b> <b>forestry,</b> fishing and tourism.|$|E
500|$|In June 1964 the Natural Resources Council asked Stephen H. Spurr, {{dean of the}} Graduate School of the University of Michigan and an {{authority}} <b>on</b> <b>forestry</b> and forest ecology, to form a group to evaluate the proposed Rampart Dam. The Spurr report determined that the scenarios offered as justification for the project were overly optimistic with respect to Alaska’s projected long-term population growth, its per capita use of electricity, and the predicted rate of entry of electroprocess industries like the aluminum industry (which had substantial power requirements) into Alaska. Moreover, the proposed dam would have greatly reduced the catch of five species of Pacific salmon, especially the chinook (king), chum (dog) and coho (silver) salmon. It would also eliminate vast numbers of migratory waterfowl, including an estimated 1.5 million ducks and 12,500 geese that migrated annually from the Yukon flats. [...] There would also have been {{a sharp decline in}} both large mammals - the moose, black and grizzly bear, and caribou - and smaller mammals: [...] muskrats, mink, beavers, and river otters in aquatic habitats, and marten, wolverines, weasels, lynx, snowshoe hares, red fox and red squirrels in terrestrial or upland habitats. Spurr’s report noted: [...] "is a truism of wildlife ecology that displacement of a population from the area where it normally lives is tantamount to eliminating it completely. Adjoining habitats ordinarily are carrying all the wildlife that the local resources will support. In short, loss of habitat is synonymous with loss of the animal population supported by the inundated habitat." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{downside}} of demobilization was that around 70,000 military personnel were left unemployed. That meant {{little to the}} conscripts, and most returned home, but the career military personnel saw their livelihoods taken away, and houses, land, and money which was promised to them was either not delivered due to inadequate resources or seemed to be paid arbitrarily. Since only 5.8% of the former officers had received benefits by early 1992, {{there was a feeling}} that those who had political favor had either kept their jobs in the 14% of the military which was retained or received their promised compensation. Between April and December 1992, a series of strikes were held in protest of the situation. Pockets of army veterans ("recompas") and resistance veterans ("recontras") threatened to re-arm, but realizing they had the same issues, the two sides joined forces. To pacify the groups, Chamorro integrated some of the former Contra fighters into the rural police services and established a Civil Inspectorate to investigate claims of police abuses and human rights violations. [...] She also allowed the Sandinistas' agrarian reform movement's redistribution of land to be maintained and expanded it on the Caribbean coast to meet veterans' demands. That move created conflict with the Caribbean indigenous people and infringed <b>on</b> <b>forestry</b> reserves leading to criticism. Others who had received land from the Sandinistas began to return their co-operative land titles to the large landholders who had owned them before the reforms, or simply to sell their portions to opportunists. Unable to solve the problem, Chamorro dealt with the most egregious claims and then turned the issue over to the courts to resolve individual disputes.|$|E
500|$|The La Pérouse's {{expedition}} {{was last}} seen on 10 March 1788 as it left Botany Bay in New Holland, Australia. It had been observed by ships of the First Fleet of convicts from England {{under the command of}} Arthur Phillip who was just leaving for Port Jackson after deciding that Botany Bay was unsuitable for settlement. In 1791 France’s National Assembly decided to send out a search mission led by Bruni d’Entrecasteaux. With Thouin’s recommendation Delahaye, who was at this time principal assistant gardener at the botany school of the Jardin du Roi, was invited to join the expedition's team of [...] "savants" [...] (more than ten scientists, engineers and artists) as the expedition's gardener. Thouin described Delahaye as “ ... strong, vigorous and well-suited for voyages. Gentle, honest and of an exact probity. Active, hard-working and passionately loving his calling. Knowing by theory and by practice the processes of gardening and knowing very well the plants cultivated in the Jardin du Roi.” Delahaye's annual salary on the expedition, paid by the navy, was 1000 livres (24 livres were equivalent to the gold coin, the Louis d'or), and he was reimbursed 1,236 livres for equipment. As a lowly gardener he was not permitted accommodation with the savants or to dine with the officers. Throughout the expedition he worked with diligence and honesty, keeping meticulous horticultural notes in his journal. Thouin wanted Delahaye to improve his schooling on the expedition and recommended that Delahaye study Latin, try to translate the works of Linnaeus and to read and write in French. His reading included Pierre Bulliard’s Dictionairre Elementaire de Botanique (1783) and the works of Henri-Louis Duhamel du Monceau (1700–1782) who published works <b>on</b> <b>forestry,</b> naval architecture (especially relating to timber), agriculture, fruit tree cultivation, seed conservation and insect pests affecting seeds. Delahaye arrived in Brest, ready for the ship's departure, with four cases of garden seeds, one of fruit tree nuts, one containing gardening tools and another gardener’s clothing.|$|E
