When in New Zealand, they simply wear morning dress as official uniform, together with their chains and baton.|$|E
5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> much, particularly during the fast-moving launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
5|$|Prerogative {{powers were}} {{formerly}} exercised by the monarch acting {{on his or}} her own initiative. Since the 19th century, by convention, the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet—who are then accountable to Parliament for the decision—has been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised. The monarch remains constitutionally empowered to exercise the royal prerogative against the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet, but in practice would <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in emergencies or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question.|$|E

5|$|The game ends {{in defeat}} if the player crashes, {{runs out of}} fuel, or is shot down by taking too much damage. The player can also eject, but can <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> safely over Allied territory. The player is victorious if they defeat all enemy forces. During the game, points are awarded and {{displayed}} in the control panel for destroyed enemies and on game end tallied up in a high score table.|$|E
5|$|While Nike-X {{could be}} {{expected}} to attack these with a reasonable 1 to 1 exchange ratio, compared to Zeus' 20 to 1, it could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> over a limited area. Most nationwide deployment scenarios contained thousands of Sprint missiles protecting only the largest US cities. Such a system would cost an estimated $40 billion to build ($ billion in , about half the annual military budget).|$|E
5|$|Great mullein is a {{biennial}} {{and generally}} requires winter dormancy {{before it can}} flower. This dormancy is linked to starch degradation activated by low temperatures in the root, and gibberellin application bypasses this requirement. Seeds germinate almost solely in bare soil, at temperatures between 10°C and 40°C. While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present (tests give a 35% germination rate under ideal conditions), in the wild, they in practice <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> when exposed to light, or {{very close to the}} soil surface, which explains the plant's habitat preferences. While it can also grow in areas where some vegetation already exists, growth of the rosettes on bare soil is four to seven times more rapid.|$|E

Romanian, most of whose {{speakers}} are Eastern Orthodox, {{was the first major}} language to switch from Cyrillic to Latin script, <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> in the 19th century, although Moldova <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> after the Soviet collapse.|$|R
5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in a finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used {{to explain why the}} electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E
5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2012, {{legal issues}} arose when {{attempts}} were made to digitally re-release the film. G. Vijaya of Vijaya Pictures had filed a lawsuit against Gemini Colour Laboratory and Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures for attempting to re-release the film without her production company's permission. The reason for the suit was that in December 1975, Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures had transferred the entire rights of the film to Movie Film Circuit, which in turn had transferred them to Vijaya Pictures on 18 May 1976. Vijaya Pictures approached the Gemini Colour Laboratory to digitise the film for re-release, however Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures asked laboratory officials not to release the film without their prior consent. Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures also disputed Vijaya's claim by running an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper on 18 May 2012, stating that it was the owner of the film's rights and anybody who wished to exhibit it in digital format should <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> with their permission. R. Subbiah, the judge who presided over the case, ordered the status quo to be maintained by both parties.|$|E

5|$|Thus far, the German fighters had {{performed}} well, {{but now it}} came to {{the most difficult part of}} the operation: withdrawing under attack. The German fighters were low on fuel and could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> much to protect the bombers. Damaged stragglers lagged behind the main bomber streams and were easy prey for RAF fighters if they could be found. The four German raiding formations were all heading in different directions by 13:30: 9 Staffel were well clear to the south, heading back over Beachy Head; KG 1 were completing their bomb run while the Spitfires of 610 were being held at arm's length by JG 54 Bf 109s; the Ju 88s of KG 76 had attacked West Malling and their escorts were battling Nos. 32, 64, 501 and 615 Squadrons. The Dorniers were heading home under attack by elements of 32, 64 and 615 Squadrons. However, further to the east, Nos. 1, 17, 54, 56 and 266 Squadrons totalling 23 Spitfires and 36 Hurricanes were moving in to meet the main formations during their withdrawal.|$|E

5000|$|Its {{capacity}} of 1,790 {{made it the}} country's biggest cabaret venue in the 1970s. Its location in one of England's smaller cities meant that some acts were initially reluctant to appear and <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> after their peers had performed there.|$|R
25|$|Multiple {{surveys and}} polls taken from 2011 {{reveal that the}} {{majority}} of United States cat owners are against declawing, believing the practice to be cruel. These surveys also suggest that the U.S. public believes {{that the majority of}} veterinarians who perform declawings <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> because of the lucrative amounts of money that can be made for performing them.|$|E
25|$|Some illusory visual proofs, such as {{the missing}} square puzzle, can be {{constructed}} {{in a way which}} appear to prove a supposed mathematical fact but <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> under the presence of tiny errors (for example, supposedly straight lines which actually bend slightly) which are unnoticeable until the entire picture is closely examined, with lengths and angles precisely measured or calculated.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} primary flight controls: control stick, rudder pedals, and throttle. Typically, the control stick is termed the cyclic and tilts the rotor in the desired {{direction}} to provide {{pitch and roll}} control (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor relative to the airframe, or <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The rudder pedals provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.|$|E
50|$|In later films, Harpo was {{put into}} {{situations}} where he would repeatedly attempt to convey a vital message to another person, but <b>only</b> <b>did</b> <b>so</b> through nonverbal means, usually by whistling or pantomime.

25|$|Biofilms in aquatic environments {{are often}} founded by diatoms. The exact {{purpose of these}} biofilms is unknown, however there is {{evidence}} that the EPS produced by diatoms facilitates both cold and salinity stress. These Eukaryotes interact with a diverse range of other organisms within a region known as the phycosphere, but importantly are the bacteria associated with diatoms, as {{it has been shown that}} although diatoms excrete EPS, they <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> when interacting with certain bacteria species.|$|E
25|$|Both President Makarios and Dr. Küçük issued {{calls for}} peace, {{but these were}} ignored. Meanwhile, {{within a week of}} the {{violence}} flaring up, the Turkish army contingent had moved out of its barracks and seized the most strategic position on the island across the Nicosia to Kyrenia road, the historic jugular vein of the island. They retained control of that road until 1974, at which time it acted as a crucial link in Turkey's military invasion. From 1963 up to the point of the Turkish invasion of 20 July 1974, Greek Cypriots who wanted to use the road could <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> if accompanied by a UN convoy.|$|E
25|$|Alpha and beta {{radiation}} have low penetrating power and {{are unlikely to}} affect vital internal organs from outside the body. Any type of ionizing radiation can cause burns, but alpha and {{beta radiation}} can <b>only</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> if radioactive contamination or nuclear fallout is deposited on the individual's skin or clothing. Gamma and neutron radiation can travel much further distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before skin effects are evident. Local gamma irradiation can cause skin effects without any sickness. In the early twentieth century, radiographers would commonly calibrate their machines by irradiating their own hand and measuring the time to onset of erythema.|$|E
