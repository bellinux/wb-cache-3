Introduction The efficient elimination <b>of</b> <b>multiples</b> from marine seismic data is one of the outstanding problems in geophysics. The marine seismic industry is a multi-million dollar market, and improvement of the accuracy and efficiency of the removal <b>of</b> <b>multiples</b> will lead to cost reduction and shorter turnaround times in this industry. The efficient elimination <b>of</b> <b>multiples</b> requires large amounts of computer time. This prompted us to investigate the applicability of using HPCN technology to increase the efficiency of this type <b>of</b> application. <b>Multiple</b> data...|$|R

5|$|Data {{is written}} to the flash memory in units called pages (made up <b>of</b> <b>multiple</b> cells).

Then the free pages left by not moving the stale data are available for new data. This is a process called garbage collection (GC). All SSDs include some level of garbage collection, but they may differ in when and how fast they perform the process. Garbage collection {{is a big part of}} write amplification on the SSD.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The problem <b>of</b> {{attenuation}} <b>of</b> <b>multiples</b> is <b>of</b> permanent {{interest for}} theoreticians {{as well as}} for practical geophysicists (e. g. [1]). Classical approaches to suppression <b>of</b> <b>multiples</b> exploit a well-seen self-repetition of wave-forms, resulting in a rather high correlation of primaries and respective multiples (coherent-, or waveform preserved-, reverberations). In a routine processing of marine data it gives a good result, when the multiples are associated mainly with the water-layer reverberations in a locally 1 D-environment, with a fairly simple layering <b>of</b> a sea-bed. <b>Multiple</b> Suppression via Envelopes (let us call it MSvE), exposed here, aims to deal with elimination <b>of</b> <b>multiples</b> which are incoherent, albeit well-seen, with primaries. Losses of coherency can be of different physical grounds, while the relevant statistical aspects are general for the transition: wave/transfer phenomena. The coherency losses can b...|$|R
