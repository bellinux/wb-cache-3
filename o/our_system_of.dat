25|$|At {{the same}} time, the second {{principle}} is equally true. Secrecy in government is antithetical to democratic governance.

25|$|Third, Searle {{argues that}} much of {{rational}} deliberation involves adjusting our (often inconsistent) patterns of desires to decide between outcomes, {{not the other way}} around. While in the Classical Model, one would start from a desire to go to Paris greater than that of saving money and calculate the cheapest way to get there, in reality people balance the niceness of Paris against the costs of travel to decide which desire (visiting Paris or saving money) they value more. Hence, he believes rationality is not a system of rules, but more of an adverb. We see certain behavior as rational, no matter what its source, and <b>our</b> <b>system</b> <b>of</b> rules derives from finding patterns in what we see as rational.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we study {{sequences}} of vector orthogonal polynomials. The vector orthogonality presented here provides a reinterpretation {{of what is}} known in the literature as matrix orthogonality. These <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> orthogonal polynomials satisfy three-term recurrence relations with matrix coefficients that do not obey to any type of symmetry. In this sense the vectorial reinterpretation allows us to study a non-symmetric case of the matrix orthogonality. We also prove that <b>our</b> <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> polynomials are indeed orthonormal with respect to a complex measure of orthogonality. Approximation problems of Hermite-Pade ́ type are also discussed. Finally, a Markov’s type theorem is presented...|$|R
