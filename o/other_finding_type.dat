However, when Fullkawa Honpo was in mis mid 20s, the band split before they managed to debut, and he remained in Tokyo to work as a designer. Frustrated with the band, he began working as a Vocaloid producer, and started uploading songs to Nico Nico Douga in June 2009. He took his Vocaloid moniker Fullkawa-P from a local carpark business called Furukawa Parking (古川パーキング), thinking that something ending in [...] "P" [...] would be suitable, in the style of many other Vocaloid producers.|$|R
40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is {{a significant}} problem in society today. Many approaches {{have been taken to}} address the issue and treat the individual or couple. Gottman et al. published groundbreaking research aimed at classifying batterers based on heart rate reactivity. Their finding, that batterers may differ in type, is part of a wealth of recent research leading toward more effective treatment of IPV. Researchers have recently brought about many considerations to the way IPV can be classified and effectively treated by mental health professionals. The {{purpose of this article is}} to follow the developments of Gottman and others, as IPV research and treatment has grown over the past 17 years. Keywords intimate partner violence, Gottman, characterological violence, situational violence Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a widespread problem in the United States. An estimated 1. 3 million females are victims of physical assault each year by an intimate partner (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003). Gottman et al. (1995) published groundbreaking research regarding IPV as differentiated by batterer physiology. These authors found that two subtypes of batterers could be distinguished by heart rate and that interventions for one type may not be effective for the <b>other.</b> <b>Findings</b> included <b>Type</b> 1 batterers whose heart rates lower during altercations and who act from a preemptive desire to control their spouse, and Type 2 batterers whose heart rate rises during altercations and who act from a stance of losing control of themselves emotionally and physically. Gottman’s research was conducted parallel to other studies that suggested a separation of IPV typology based more on partner relations rather than batterer type alon...|$|R
40|$|Reactions of neural, psychological, {{and social}} systems are rarely, if ever, {{independent}} of previous inputs and states. The potential for serial order carryover effects from one condition {{to the next}} in a sequence of experimental trials makes counterbalancing of condition order {{an essential part of}} experimental design. Here, a method is proposed for generating counterbalanced sequences for repeated-measures designs including those with multiple observations of each condition on one participant and self-adjacencies of conditions. Condition ordering is reframed as a graph theory problem. Experimental conditions are represented as vertices in a graph and directed edges between them represent temporal relationships between conditions. A counterbalanced trial order results from traversing an Euler circuit through such a graph in which each edge is traversed exactly once. This method can be generalized to counterbalance for higher order serial order carryover effects as well as to create intentional serial order biases. Modern graph theory provides tools for <b>finding</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> of paths through such graph representations, providing a tool for generating experimental condition sequences with useful properties...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{methods to}} {{visualize}} {{large amounts of}} object movements described with so called multivariate trajectories, which are lists of records with multiple attribute values {{about the state of}} the object. In this chapter we focus on vessel traffic as one of the examples of this kind of data. The purpose of our visualizations is to reveal what has happened over a period of time. For vessel traffic, this is beneficial for surveillance operators and analysts, since current visualizations do not give an overview of normal behavior, which is needed to find abnormally behaving ships that can be a potential threat. Our approach is inspired by the technique of kernel density estimation and smooths trajectories to obtain an overview picture with a distribution of trajectories: a density map. Using knowledge about the attributes in the data, the user can adapt these pictures by setting parameters, filters, and expressions as means for rapid prototyping, required for quickly <b>finding</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> of behavior with our visualization approach. Furthermore, density maps are computationally expensive, which we address by implementing our tools on graphics hardware. We describe different variations of our techniques and illustrate them with real-world vessel traffic data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Most {{interest}} in violence and gender {{has focused on}} certain types of victimization such as sex offenses and relational aggression. This study examined gender patterns across numerous forms of youth victimization. The data are from the National Survey of Children 2 ̆ 7 s Exposure to Violence (NatSCEV), a nationally representative U. S. sample of 4, 549 children ages 1 month to 17 years obtained through a telephone survey of caregivers and youth. For 18 of 21 victimization types, male perpetration was significantly more common than female perpetration. Perpetrator-victim patterns revealed that most forms of physical assault and bullying showed a predominantly male-on-male pattern. All forms of sexual assault, plus kidnapping, showed a predominantly male-on-female pattern. Nonphysical maltreatment showed a mixed pattern, with fairly similar rates across all four gender configurations. Many violence types were more severe when perpetrated by males versus females as indicated by higher injury rates and greater victim fear. Higher order analyses by victimization <b>type</b> indicated, among <b>other</b> <b>findings,</b> that victimization <b>types</b> with more stranger perpetrators had more male perpetrators, victimizations with higher percentages of male-on-female and female-on-male incidents {{were more likely to}} be sexual offenses, and higher percentages of female-on-female incidents were associated with verbal victimizations. Results also suggest that males are more likely to aggress in more impersonal contexts compared to females. Gender socialization, physical power, and social power appear to intersect in ways that create gendered patterns of violence. These factors, versus a focus on skills deficits, need more attention in prevention and intervention...|$|R

40|$|Background: There was {{a recent}} {{epidemic}} of chikungunya (CKG) in Calicut and other northern districts of Kerala, South India, affecting thousands of people. Aims: To study the cutaneous manifestations of CKG {{and to have a}} serological and histopathological correlation. Methods: A total of 162 patients (63 males and 99 females) with cutaneous manifestations of CKG were enrolled in the study and serological confirmation was done with capture IgM ELISA for CKG. Skin biopsy was done in all representative cases. Results: Cutaneous manifestations were found more in females. There were 23 children, the youngest being 39 days old. Generalized erythematous macular rash was the most common finding. Vesicles and bullae were also common especially in infants. Localized erythema of the nose and pinnae, erythema and swelling of the pre existing scars and striae and toxic epidermal necrolysis-like lesions sparing mucosae were the <b>other</b> interesting <b>findings.</b> Different <b>types</b> of pigmentation were observed with a striking nose pigmentation in a large number of patients, by looking at which even a retrospective diagnosis of CKG could be made. Hence we suggest this peculiar pigmentation may be called "chik sign". There was flare up of existing dermatoses like psoriasis, lichen planus and unmasking of Hansen&#x 2032;s disease with type 1 reaction. Serological tests were positive in 97 &#x 0025;. Some hitherto unreported histopathologic findings like melanophages in the erythematous rashes were observed. Conclusion: A spectrum of cutaneous manifestations of CKG {{with a wide variety of}} unusual presentations with confirmed serological and histopathological evidence was encountered...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} typing {{polymorphic}} recursion (i. e., recursive function definitions rec {x = e} where different occurrences of x in e are used with different types) {{has been investigated}} both by people working on type systems and by people working on abstract interpretation. Recently, Gori and Levi have developed a family of abstract interpreters {{that are able to}} type all the ML typable recursive definitions and in-teresting examples of polymorphic recursion. The problem of <b>finding</b> <b>type</b> systems corresponding to their abstract interpreters was open (such systems would lie between the let-free fragments of the ML and of the Milner-Mycroft systems). In this paper we exploit the notion of principal typing to: (i) provide a complete stratification of (let-free) Milner-Mycroft typability, and (ii) solve the problem of <b>finding</b> <b>type</b> systems corresponding to the type abstract interpreters proposed by Gori and Levi...|$|R
