500|$|International {{trade and}} the {{negotiation}} of free-trade agreements were a priority in Key's third term. He has been a leading advocate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), having also supported the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (TPSEP). Both agreements provide for a multilateral free-trade area in the Asia–Pacific region. In a September 2016 speech to the Council of Foreign Relations, Key said [...] " [...] will boost <b>our</b> <b>economy</b> by at least $2.7 billion a year by 2030. It will help diversify <b>our</b> <b>economy</b> and create more jobs and higher incomes for New Zealanders". Key was particularly intent on securing {{the participation of the}} United States in the agreement; to this end, he discussed TPP with President Barack Obama in April 2016, and hosted Secretary of State John Kerry in Wellington, 9–13 November 2016. The finalised TPP proposal was signed on 4 February 2016 in Auckland, concluding seven years of negotiations. The provisional proposal is currently awaiting ratification to enter into force. Ratification of the TPP agreement by the government will require approval from Parliament.|$|E

He also opposes it on the grounds that the tax would likely be passed onto consumers in the form of higher service and ATM fees. In September 2010, Brown opposed a Senate bill creating a $30 billion government fund aimed at encouraging lending to small businesses. The bill combines the fund with $12 billion in new tax breaks. Brown criticized the bill for including a provision much like the Troubled Asset Relief Program, stating: [...] "Banks making lending decisions with government funds is not the way to get <b>our</b> <b>economy</b> moving again." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 1981, a bomb struck ZANU-PF headquarters, killing {{seven and}} {{injuring}} 124. Mugabe blamed South African-backed white militants. He criticised [...] "reactionary and counter-revolutionary elements" [...] {{in the white}} community, stating that {{despite the fact that}} they had faced no punishment for their past actions, they rejected racial reconciliation and [...] "are acting in collusion with South Africa to harm our racial relations, to destroy our unity, to sabotage <b>our</b> <b>economy,</b> and to overthrow the popularly elected government I lead". Increasingly he criticised not only the militants but the entire white community for holding a monopoly on [...] "Zimbabwe's economic power". This was a view echoed by many government ministers and the government-controlled media. One of these ministers, Tekere, was involved in an incident in which he and seven armed men stormed a white-owned farmhouse, killing an elderly farmer; they alleged that in doing so they were foiling a coup attempt. Tekere was acquitted of murder although Mugabe dropped him from the cabinet.|$|E
