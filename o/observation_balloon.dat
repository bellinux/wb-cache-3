5|$|Swiss {{military}} aviation {{began in}} 1900with {{the creation of}} an <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> force. Swiss balloonists were first engaged in combat on 7October 1918, near the end of World War I, when a German airplane accidentally attacked a Swiss <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> stationed close to the German border and killed the observer, Lieutenant Werner Flury. The balloon force was eventually disestablished in 1938when developments in aviation made it obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Elba {{operated}} the <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> through 1913. The following year, she was modified {{to serve as}} a depot ship for three seaplanes, and she entered service in this new role on 4 June 1914. During this period she operated Nieuport IV seaplanes. She was the first dedicated seaplane tender of the Italian navy, though seaplanes had already been operated aboard several battleships and cruisers. Elba was nevertheless too small and too old for her intended role, and she was retired in 1916. She remained in the Italian inventory until 4 January 1920, when she was sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Elba {{was present}} in Korea during the Russo-Japanese War, which took place {{primarily}} in neighboring Manchuria. She witnessed the Battle of Chemulpo Bay in February 1904 and rescued Russian survivors along with British and French cruisers. In 1905, Umbria represented Italy at the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. Lombardia was converted into a depot ship for submarines in 190608. Etruria visited the United States twice for major events, the Jamestown Exposition in 1907 and the Hudson-Fulton Celebration in 1909. Elba and Liguria were modified to operate an <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> to assist in spotting naval mines, which could be more easily seen from the air. In December 1910, Umbria was sold to the Haitian Navy and renamed Consul Gostrück, though she sank shortly after the transfer due to her new crew's inexperience.|$|E
50|$|Historically, <b>observation</b> <b>{{balloons}}</b> {{were filled}} with hydrogen. The balloons were fabric envelopes filled with hydrogen gas, whose flammable nature led {{to the destruction of}} hundreds of balloons on both sides. Observers manning these <b>observation</b> <b>balloons</b> frequently had to use a parachute to evacuate their balloon when it came under attack. To avoid the potentially flammable consequences of hydrogen, <b>observation</b> <b>balloons</b> after World War I were often filled with non-flammable helium.|$|R

5|$|Liguria {{served in}} a variety of roles {{throughout}} her career. She frequently was assigned to the main fleet, but in 1904 she was deployed to the American Station. In 1906, she conducted tests with coaling while at sea, and from 1908 to 1911, she was fitted with an experimental <b>observation</b> <b>balloon.</b> She saw extensive action during the Italo-Turkish War in 191112. She took part in the seizure of Benghazi, provided gunfire support to the defenders of Tripoli, and conducted bombardments of Ottoman ports in western Libya and the Red Sea coast of Arabia. She was still in service during World War I as a training ship, but she did not see action during the conflict. Liguria was eventually sold for scrap in May 1921.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August 1919, one of {{the largest}} engagements of the {{intervention}} occurred, taking place at Seltso and the surrounding villages along the Dvina. In a confused battle through the marshy swamps Sadlier-Jackson's brigade battled a large Bolshevik force, with the Fusiliers—including the two Australian companies of the 45th Battalion—fighting their way through with their bayonets and re-occupying Seltso. Perhaps as many as 1,000 prisoners were taken and 19 field guns captured. Due to the terrain the Fusiliers had been unable to manoeuvre their mountain guns through the swamp, whilst Sadlier-Jackson had to use an <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> for situational awareness. During this battle an Australian, Corporal Arthur Sullivan, won the Victoria Cross (VC) for saving a group of drowning men while under fire.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in the Field, {{commanded}} by Sir David Henderson consisted of five squadrons—one <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> squadron (RFC No 1 Squadron) and four aeroplane squadrons (Nos 2, 3, 4 and 5). These units were first used for aerial spotting on 13 September 1914, but only became efficient when they perfected the use of wireless communication at Aubers Ridge on 9 May 1915. Aerial photography was attempted during 1914, but again, it only became effective the following year. In August 1915, General Hugh Trenchard replaced Henderson. The British use of air power evolved during the war, from a reconnaissance force to a fighting force that attempted to gain command of the air above the trenches and carry out bombing raids on targets behind the line. The early aircraft of the RFC were inferior to their German rivals; in April 1917, (known as Bloody April), the RFC lost over 300 aircrew and 245 aircraft. Not until late 1917, with the introduction of the Sopwith Camel and the S.E.5, were they able to compete successfully for control of the air.|$|E

5|$|In April 1917, {{with the}} support of Muirhead Bone and his own father, Nevinson was {{appointed}} an official war artist by the Department of Information. Wearing the uniform of a war correspondent, he visited the Western Front from 5 July to 4 August 1917, a period which included the start of the Battle of Passchendaele on 31 July. Nevinson was billeted with other visitors in the Château d'Harcourt, south of Caen. Although life at the Chateau allowed Nevinson to demonstrate his cocktail making skills to the other visitors, he soon transferred to the 4th Infantry Division near Arras. From there he moved widely along the Front, visiting forward observation posts and artillery batteries. He flew with the Royal Flying Corps and came under anti-aircraft fire. He spent a night in an <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> above the Somme. Making his way to a forward post one day he was pinned down by enemy fire for an hour. An unauthorised visit to the Ypres Salient earned Nevinson a reprimand and added to his reputation for recklessness.|$|E
5|$|The 47th Division {{planned to}} attack with two brigades, each {{reinforced}} by a battalion from the reserve brigade, along {{either side of}} the Ypres–Comines Canal. Large numbers of machine-guns were organised to fire offensive and defensive barrages and signal detachments were organised to advance with the infantry. An <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> was reserved for messages by signal lamp from the front line, as insurance against the failure of telephone lines and message-runners. The divisional trench mortar batteries were to bombard the German front line opposite the 142nd Brigade, where it was too close for the artillery to shell without endangering British troops. Wire-cutting began in mid-May, against considerable local retaliation by German artillery. At the end of May the two attacking brigades began training at Steenvoorde, on practice courses built to resemble the German positions to be attacked, using air reconnaissance photographs to mark the positions of machine-gun posts and hidden barbed wire. Divisional intelligence summaries were used to plan the capture of German company and battalion headquarters. The 140th Brigade with four tanks attached, was to occupy White Château and the adjacent part of , while the 142nd Brigade attacked the spoil heaps and the canal bank to the left. On 1 June, the British artillery began the intense stage of preparatory bombardment for trench-destruction and wire cutting and the two attacking brigades assembled for the attack from 4 to 6 June.|$|E
25|$|McGregor would next turn balloon buster, {{destroying}} {{an enemy}} <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> east of Maretz, France on 8 October. He ended his string of triumphs by destroying another recon plane on 23 October 1918. His final tally was an <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> and five enemy airplanes destroyed, plus four planes driven {{down out of}} control.|$|E
50|$|Kite {{balloons}} {{began to}} be used at sea for anti-submarine purposes {{towards the end of}} World War I. <b>Observation</b> <b>balloons</b> also played a role during the Cold War; for example, Project Mogul used high-altitude <b>observation</b> <b>balloons</b> to monitor Soviet nuclear tests. However, heavier-than-air craft now performed the vast majority of operations. Aerostats have been used by US and coalition military forces in Iraq and in Afghanistan.|$|R
5000|$|The {{history of}} American {{military}} aviation began during the Civil War, when the Union Army operated <b>observation</b> <b>balloons.</b> [...] Later, a balloon {{was used by}} the US Army in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. These were ad-hoc and not part of an established branch of the Army. The use of <b>observation</b> <b>balloons</b> continued after the end of World War I. The last use of <b>observation</b> <b>balloons</b> by the Army was during maneuvers conducted in Louisiana during September 1941. Balloons must either be tethered, or go where they are blown by the wind, but {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century powered airships, capable of being directed at the will of the pilot, were developed.|$|R

25|$|Duncan scored {{his first}} aerial victory on November 6, 1917, when he {{destroyed}} a German DFW reconnaissance plane northeast of Polygon Wood. He began to accumulate wins. On {{the day the}} RFC was consolidated into the Royal Air Force, April 1, 1918, he shared his seventh victory with American ace John Griffith. On May 17, 1918, he raised his tally to nine. The next day, {{he was promoted to}} temporary captain. He would score twice more after that, destroying an LVG on June 3 and busting a German <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> on June 5, 1918. He was returned to Home Establishment on June 30, 1918. A summary of his victories included an enemy <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> destroyed, an enemy fighter plane captured, seven enemy planes destroyed (including four shared wins), and two enemy airplanes driven down out of control.|$|E

Mecozzi served with 78a Squadriglia past war's end, until February 1919.|$|E
25|$|In mid-October 1916, {{another attempt}} was made to arm a Halberstadt D.II with rockets, this time for <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> attacks with a more formal method, using eight Le Prieur-like rockets mounted on the outer wing struts, the way that the French Nieuport 11 had been armed nearly a year earlier. Problems with the {{ignition}} system on the rockets prevented the system from being experimented with any further.|$|E
25|$|On 9 October 1917 he {{shot down}} and burned an <b>observation</b> <b>balloon</b> for his 22nd victory; {{it was the}} first of five {{balloons}} he would down. His Albatros that day was painted all red, in emulation of von Richthofen, with the addition of mustard colored skulls on either side of the fuselage. This paint scheme would become characteristic of his aircraft until war’s end.|$|E
