40|$|Abstract- Virtualization enables {{installation}} and running of multiple virtual machines {{on the same}} computer system. <b>Operating</b> system that communicates directly with hardware {{is known as the}} host <b>operating</b> system whereas virtual <b>operating</b> systems have all the features of a real <b>operating</b> system, but they run inside the host <b>operating</b> system. A virtual machine is separated from the computer hardware resources and it runs on the emulated hardware. Performance of the virtual <b>operating</b> system running on the same computer system hardware depends on the performance of the host <b>operating</b> system. In this paper we study how different host <b>operating</b> systems influence virtual machine performance. Windows XP®, Windows Vista ™ and Windows 7 ™ are used as host <b>operating</b> systems using Windows Vista as a virtual <b>operating</b> system. Performance measurement of the virtual <b>operating</b> system is done in the same controlled conditions for all three host <b>operating</b> systems using benchmark applications. Performance measurement results show that the virtual <b>operating</b> system has the best performance when Windows 7 is used as the host <b>operating</b> system...|$|R
