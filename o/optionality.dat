The price will substantially reflect (1) {{the value of}} the underlying shares, (2) the discounted gross income advantage of the convertible over the underlying shares, plus (3) some figure for the embedded <b>optionality</b> of the bond. The tax advantage is greatest with mandatory convertibles. Effectively a high tax-paying shareholder can benefit from the company securitising gross future income on the convertible, income which it can offset against taxable profits.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1991-92, most market-makers in Europe have {{employed}} binomial models to evaluate convertibles. Models were available from INSEAD, Trend Data of Canada, Bloomberg LP and from home-developed models, amongst others. [...] These models needed an input of credit spread, volatility for pricing (historic volatility often used), and the risk-free rate of return. The binomial calculation assumes {{there is a}} bell-shaped probability distribution to future share prices, and the higher the volatility, the flatter is the bell-shape. Where there are issuer calls and investor puts, these will affect the expected residual period of <b>optionality,</b> at different share price levels. The binomial value is a weighted expected value, (1) taking readings from all the different nodes of a lattice expanding out from current prices and (2) taking account of varying periods of expected residual <b>optionality</b> at different share price levels. See Lattice model (finance)#Hybrid Securities. The three biggest areas of subjectivity are (1) the rate of volatility used, for volatility is not constant, and (2) {{whether or not to}} incorporate into the model a cost of stock borrow, for hedge funds and market-makers. The third important factor is (3) the dividend status of the equity delivered, if the bond is called, as the issuer may time the calling of the bond to minimise the dividend cost to the issuer.|$|E

We show {{that this is not}} quite correct. The value of the option to underperform on debt-service obligations depends on two other <b>optionalities</b> available to equity holders, namely, the option to carry cash reserves within the firm and the option to raise new external financing. We disentangle the effects of the three factors, and characterize the impact of each in isolation as well as their interaction. We find, among other things, that while strategic behavior can increase spreads significantly under some conditions, its impact is negligible in others, and in some cases it even leads to a decline in equilibrium spreads. We show that this last apparently paradoxical result is a consequence of an interaction of <b>optionalities</b> that results in a trade-off between strategic and liquidity-driven defaults. ...|$|R

40|$|Healthcare {{applications}} are {{complex in the}} way data and schemas are organised in their internal systems. Healthcare standards have been proposed to reduce heterogeneities between healthcare applications. Widely deployed healthcare standards such as the Health Level Seven (HL 7) Version 2 specifications are designed as flexible schemas which allow several <b>optionalities</b> while constructing clinical messages. Such flexibility and <b>optionalities</b> offer choices to meet clinician messaging requirements. However, these <b>optionalities</b> result in a quadratic number of interfaces and alignments between Version 2 applications. To overcome the alignment problem HL 7 has proposed Version 3, where a centrally consistent information model controls terminologies and concepts shared by Version 3 applications. However, {{it is impossible to}} predefine all clinical possibilities in a central information model. Consequently, Version 3 allows the creation of local vocabularies and constraints, thus further impeding interoperability of HL 7 applications. The goal of this thesis is to reduce the integration burden between HL 7 applications. Our hypothesis which we aim to prove with the contributions summarised in this thesis is that "An ontology-based integration framework can improve healthcare data interoperability by reducing: (i) the integration burden (per message) between heterogeneous healthcare applications; and (ii) the number of alignments between heterogeneous healthcare applications". We address three main research challenges in the development of an ontology-based integration framework (i) how to build HL 7 ontologies by reusing domain artefacts reside in separate global and local spaces; (ii) how to automate alignment of HL 7 ontologies with greater accuracy of correspondences retrieved; and finally (iii) how to resolve inconsistencies caused by context-sensitive (or local) healthcare policies while mediating heterogeneous HL 7 messages. We provide (i) a semi-automatic ontology building methodology for the HL 7 standard; (ii) a semi-automatic ontology alignment methodology for HL 7 ontologies; and (iii) a detailed investigation and a solution path towards realising context-awareness and modularity for local healthcare policies. This thesis offers an ontology-based integration framework called Plug and Play Electronic Patient Records (PPEPR) that reduces the number of alignments and the integration burden between HL 7 applications. Further, the PPEPR framework enables interoperation of HL 7 Version 2 and Version 3 applications. HL 7 ontologies and their alignments are successfully deployed and evaluated under the PPEPR framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Recent work in {{corporate}} finance {{has suggested that}} strategic debt-service by equityholders works to lower debt values and raise yield spreads substantially. We show {{that this is not}} quite correct. With optimal cash management, defaults occassioned by deliberate underperformance (“strategic defaults”) and those forced by inadequate cash (“liquidity defaults”) work as substitutes: allowing for strategic debt-service leads to a decline in the equilibrium likelihood of liquidity defaults. In some cases, this decline is sufficiently sharp that equilibrium debt values actually increase and yield spreads decline. We provide an intuitive explanation for these results in terms of an interaction of <b>optionalities...</b>|$|R

In particular {{it has been argued}} that mandatory unbundling of the local loop creates <b>optionalities</b> (real options), leading to a transfer of wealth from incumbents to entrants unaccounted for by a static investment perspective. We extend this line of research by explicitly considering the significance of margin squeezes, predatory pricing, and related pricing rules in a duopoly model tailored to the German context. Analytical and numerical methods are employed to characterize pricing behavior and market dynamics under demand uncertainty. We draw conclusions with respect to the incumbent’s cost of capital under regulatory intervention...|$|R

To ensure {{the continuity of}} a collective scheme, {{it has to be}} monitored whether the contracts offered to participants are financially fair in terms of their market value. When risk sharing is implemented by means of <b>optionalities</b> such as conditional indexation, the analysis of financial fairness is not straightforward. In this paper, we use a stylised overlapping generations model to study financial fairness for a conditional indexation scheme. We find that financial fairness for all participants at all times is not feasible within a scheme of this type, unless the nature of indexation is such that the scheme is reduced to DC. However, financial fairness for incoming generations at the moment of entry can be realised. We show how to compute the fair contribution rate {{as a function of the}} current nominal asset/liability ratio for a given level of nominal entitlements. At low levels of the ratio, the fair contribution for incoming generations is also relatively low; nevertheless, the joining of a new generation still has a positive effect on the asset/liability ratio...|$|R

Although there are interesting approaches from the academic side, the economic potential of nuclear is still assessed by classical discounted cash-flow (DCF) calculation, often based on crude heuristics, negative experience from past like projects and unconscious bias of the assessing team. Due to high front-up costs, hurdle rates far above average and uncertainty about future revenues, undervaluation of nuclear projects is the consequence {{of not being able}} to quantify the strategic potential of this technology. Although generating technologies using fossil fuels come along with high sensitivity towards fuel prices and carbon taxes, there are only some 30 new nuclear power plants under construction, only two of these in Western Europe and US. A worldwide increasing number of license applications suggest that utilities are being aware of the strategic benefits of nuclear, yet in the western hemisphere they intuitively exercise the option to wait until some of the institutional uncertainty has cleared off. Against common understanding, the nuclear fuel cycle is full of <b>optionalities.</b> If spent nuclear fuel is a liability or a valuable source of energy depends mainly on how the nuclear industry is able to add a positive economic value on an infrastructure of advanced nuclear systems.

Principal Components Analysis and Canonical Correlation analysis were used to demonstrate how the task of explaining the various shipping forward curves can be simplified substantially and how very high correlations can be achieved between shipping forward curves. The conditions under which correlations are higher are discussed {{as well as the}} various applications of these results using case studies. Applications include trading from a hedge fund perspective, cross hedging any physical exposure in illiquid markets and portfolio optimization. Conditioning as a tool is also examined to demonstrate how more reliable correlation results can be obtained for cross hedging or other purposes, and how the best trading opportunities can be unveiled conditional on recently observed data. Tanker valuations are carried out using the adjusted forward curves with the RAFL ship valuation model. The results are very close to transaction prices for relatively modem vessels while deviations in older ships are explained with regards to phase out regulations and other factors. The ship value volatility and consequently the valuations of typical options are substantial and increase {{as a percentage of the}} ship value with age.

40|$|Structural {{failures}} of bulk carriers continue {{to account for}} the loss of many lives every year. Capes are particularly vulnerable to cracking because of their large length, their trade in high density cargos, and the high rates of cargo operations. Rapid loss often occurs allowing little reaction time which has alarmed the industry. The Cape market is extremely volatile with ship values appreciating in some cases by over 500 % and then returning to original levels, all within a few years. Recent market changes have rendered conventional pricing methods inaccurate and often inapplicable, resulting in a pressing need for alternate valuation models. Very little research combines the closely interlinked technical and financial elements which are crucial for valuation and decision making by various parties in the shipping industry. The present research involves the collection and analysis of one of the largest ship cracking surveys. It is focused specifically on capes which lie {{at the core of the}} problem and is based on the records of ship owners, classification societies and shipyards. A location coding system was specifically designed to analyze the data and present the frequency, size and estimated crack growth rates with respect to location and ship age. The results were compared with existing knowledge based on surveys conducted over the past 50 years, the stress distribution based on an investigation of loading patterns, and theoretical fracture mechanics predictions. They were then combined with the frequency of crack failures, derived from an investigation of an extensive fleet sample, to develop a reliability model which yields the hazard function throughout the ship's life. Repair procedures and design modifications were also examined and a model was designed to assess their cost effectiveness based on the present value of projected crack costs. The crack repair costs were calculated as a function of ship age to be used in conjunction with the safety assessment for decision making by ship owners, insurance companies, classification societies and others. A new state of the art valuation model was developed combining both technical and financial aspects in a fundamental valuation based on risk-adjusted discounting of expected cash flows. A forward view of the main parameters was obtained from derivatives and financial securities that include shipping futures, FFAs, options, interest rate swaps and inflation protected bonds. The inherent risk of cracks is treated as a fictitious credit risk, derived from the reliability model, and is incorporated into the discount rate along with other risk premiums. Other inputs include repair costs and off-hire time, which were calculated with respect to ship age using a database of repairs, while the records of public and private companies were used along with surveys to estimate operating expenses. The resulting valuations were found to be in very close alignment with recent transaction prices across all ship ages. The model also estimates the volatility of the ship value and uses it to price <b>optionalities</b> that are often included in ship transactions. The combination of technical and financial analysis of this thesis is valuable to many involved in the shipping industry including brokers, accountants, analysts, shipping banks and investors interested in valuation; ship owners when making managerial or investment decisions; shipyards when designing ships, setting prices and deciding payment structures and options; insurance companies when covering total loss or emergency repairs; the IMO when setting regulations; and classification societies when scheduling inspections and deciding which areas to focus on. by Nicholas Andrew Hadjiyiannis.

40|$|AIFIRM {{believes}} that the a Pillar 2 approach, where banks are allowed, subject to supervisory approval, to use internal measurement systems (IMS) for assessing their ability to cover potential losses from IRRBB, is the best suited option. In fact, the standardization associated with a Pillar 1 approach {{would lead to a}} lower precision of the risk exposure estimate and a poorer comprehension of the factors that determine it. By adopting a Pillar 1 approach, there is a higher probability that banks set aside an amount of internal capital that either underestimates or overestimates its appropriate amount, entailing a potential threat to the overall banking stability and an unnecessary reduction in lending capacity, respectively. AIFIRM welcomes the consideration of multiple scenarios because it is a step forward in the comprehension of risk determinants. The new mathematical framework allows to obtain a measure of risk exposure that is more consistent with the level of interest rates observed on the evaluation date and, therefore, represents an important improvement, if compared with the current one, which is based on unrealistic duration coefficients. The new framework can also be easily integrated within banks’ IMS for the implementation of more sophisticated methodologies. The Association {{believes that}} option n. 4 is the best-suited among those proposed by the Committee to calculate minimum capital requirements because it allows the net interest profit (NIP) to reduce minimum capital requirements associated with the change to economic value of equity (EVE) and earnings. This approach is based on the presence of many positions characterized by locked-in margins, which will generate a positive interest income even when EVE is at its highest. Following this method, minimum capital requirements are more consistent with banks’ actual riskiness and banks’ credit supply is calibrated in a more appropriate way. Within a Pillar 2 approach, minimum capital requirements may be based on both: i) stressed scenarios of changes in the key-rates that are consistent with the six proposed scenarios, in terms of both shock magnitude and structure, and ii) scenarios obtained through banks’ internal measurement systems. However, AIFIRM believes that further discussions and analyses on the NIP calibration are necessary. As concerns the treatment of the items characterized by behavioral options, AIFIRM recognizes the utility of introducing some constraints in modelling non-maturity deposits (NMDs), even in cases of banks’ own internal representations, since they could contribute to the reduction of the model risk. However, they seem to be too conservative giving rise, even in the discretionary approach, to a unique representation of NMDs. According to AIFIRM, based on the analysis of historical data of the Italian banking market: i) the allocation of the repricing component of NMDs may be led by the interest rate pass-through that follows a change in the reference market rate; ii) the core component of NMDs should include not only the fraction of non-maturity deposits that are stable, but also the portion that reprice, with a certain sluggishness, when the reference market rate changes. Finally, as regards positions other than NMDs, the Association agrees with the choice to model their <b>optionalities</b> using a two step approach. Within the supported solution of an enhanced Pillar 2 capital framework, AIFIRM believes that public disclosure on a regular basis of a bank’s IRRBB risk profile, key measurement assumptions, qualitative and quantitative assessment of IRRBB levels and quantitative disclosure of IRRBB metrics, is crucial. Banks should describe in detail the qualitative information required in BCBS (2015) for disclosure purposes since these are issues of particular relevance in estimating banks' risk exposure. As for the quantitative information, if appropriate public disclosure is important, disclosure of standardized calculation could be misleading. By using the standardized calculation, the proposed Pillar 2 approach is no different from the proposed Pillar 1. Supporting a “true” Pillar II approach, AIFIRM believes that banks' internal measurement and management of IRRBB are those which ought to be disclosed. This document is organized as follows: paragraph 1 comments on the choice between a Pillar 1 and a Pillar 2 solutions; in section 2, we discuss some of the main issues associated with the interest rate scenario design; section 3 deals with the specification of minimum capital requirements; in section 4 we analyze the treatment of the positions with behavioral options; section 5 provides some comments on the disclosure requirements...|$|R
