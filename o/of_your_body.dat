500|$|Vivekananda linked {{morality}} {{with control}} of the mind, seeing truth, purity and unselfishness as traits which strengthened it. He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddhā (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya (celibacy), believing it {{the source of his}} physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, [...] "Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life– think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>body,</b> be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced".|$|E

Then, she appeared dressed in a feathered headdress. During the performance of the song, Beyoncé performed it as a tribute to Donna Summer, singing her song [...] "Love to Love You Baby". Maura Johnston of The Village Voice wrote that [...] "the sinuous 'Naughty Girl' had its source material laid bare at the outset when a sample of the groans and coos from 'Love To Love You Baby' was laid over it".

500|$|Their debut album, Your Body Above Me, co-produced by David Bianco and the band, was {{released}} on October 21, 1997 in the United States. Two singles from the album charted in the U.S., the power ballad [...] "Time Ago" [...] and the alternative rock hit [...] "Wash It Away"; the album also featured the PJ Harvey-penned [...] "All the Money in the World". The LP peaked on Billboard's Heatseekers charts at No.19 in 1998, and sales of the album eventually topped 120,000. Reviews <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Body</b> Above Me noted the album's dark, melodic modern rock sound, and were mixed but generally positive. The Washington Post called Your Body Above Me [...] "moodily sumptuous", Guitar Player described the music as having [...] "drama and rhythmic urgency", and Allmusic noted the album's [...] "brooding yet propulsive sound that's actually quite intriguing". The band subsequently toured with Days of the New, Cracker, and Our Lady Peace, and were called [...] "The American U2" [...] by the San Francisco Chronicle. Black Lab songs were featured on soundtracks to Can't Hardly Wait, Varsity Blues, Permanent Midnight, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and the song [...] "Wash It Away" [...] was also included on a charity album, Live in the X Lounge. Just as momentum was building on their debut, however, Geffen {{went out of business}} after being subsumed by Universal; dissatisfied with the new label arrangement, Durham moved to Los Angeles, and the band broke up in 1999.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{opened the}} shows with a {{performance}} of [...] "End of Time" [...] as her silhouette appeared {{in front of a}} large screen.

As she was performing a New Edition-inspired choreography and sang the song's modulations in an extended vocal showcase the crowd sang along with her. Afterwards, [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] was performed with Bob Fosse-style swing and formations. Beyoncé performed the reggae dancehall song [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and during a [...] "giddy" [...] version of [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] she wore a cropped, spangled top and a mini skirt. During the performance of the song, pre-recorded vocals by Jay-Z who is featured on it were played. [...] "Diva" [...] was performed as the sixth song of the set. Prior to the performance of [...] "Naughty Girl", a spoken-word segment about female sexuality was shown with Beyoncé saying [...] "Harnessing the power <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>body</b> requires responsibility". During the performance of the song she also included a sample of the groans and coos from Donna Summer's [...] "Love to Love You Baby" [...] and sang a snippet of it as a tribute to the singer following her death. During the performance of the eighth song, [...] "Party", confetti were dropped on stage from the roof and dice-shaped beach balls were being tossed through the crowd as dancers in large feathered headdresses performed a choreography in the aisles. During [...] "Dance for You", Beyoncé did not sing live but was accompanied vocally by her three backup vocalists and performed a choreographed bump and grind dance. She was wearing a black leotard during the performance of [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] which featured a strut-heavy footwork. During the performance of [...] "I Care", Beyoncé matched the notes of her guitarist's solo and [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] followed. [...] "1+1" [...] saw her singing the song seated on top of a piano and the performance focused on the singer and individual members of her band.|$|E

5000|$|With this method, you are {{to start}} off by {{assuming}} a posture in which you are not to use your hands.

2500|$|Length – Boards for {{children}} are {{as short as}} boards for racers, or [...] "alpine" [...] riders, are as long as [...] Most people ride boards in the [...] range. Board length used to {{be judged by the}} height of your chin. If a board held next to the frontside <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>body</b> came to your chin then it was an acceptable length. Due to the development of new technologies and board shapes, people can now ride a wider range of board sizes. Rather, the length of a snowboard corresponds mainly to the style, weight, and preference of the rider. A good rule of thumb is to stay within the recommended manufacturer weight range. The longer the board, the more stable it is at high speed, {{but it is also a}} bit tougher to maneuver. Another factor riders consider when selecting a snowboard is the type of riding it will be used for, freestyle boards being shorter than all-mountain boards.|$|E
