25|$|Rural {{and some}} {{suburban}} areas of North America may utilize curbside mailboxes, {{also known as}} rural mailboxes. These receptacles generally consist of a large metal box mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>support</b> designed primarily to receive large quantities of incoming mail, often with an attached flag to signal the presence of outgoing mail to the mail carrier.

25|$|Guerrilla warfare {{is often}} {{associated}} with a rural setting, and this is indeed the case with the definitive operations of Mao and Giap, the mujahadeen of Afghanistan, the Ejército Guerrillero de los Pobres (EGP) of Guatemala, the Contras of Nicaragua, and the FMLN of El Salvador. Guerrillas however have successfully operated in urban settings as demonstrated in places like Argentina and Northern Ireland. In those cases, guerrillas rely on a friendly population to provide supplies and intelligence. Rural guerrillas prefer to operate in regions providing plenty of cover and concealment, especially heavily forested and mountainous areas. Urban guerrillas, rather than melting into the mountains and forests, blend into the population and are also dependent <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>support</b> base among the people. Removing and destroying guerrillas out of both types of areas can be difficult.|$|E

2500|$|One of Verneuil's {{sources of}} {{inspiration}} for developing his own method was {{the appearance of}} synthetic rubies sold by an unknown Genevan merchant in 1880.
