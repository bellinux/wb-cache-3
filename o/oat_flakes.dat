40|$|Product {{quality is}} an {{important}} determinant of consumer acceptance. Consistent <b>oat</b> <b>flake</b> properties are thus necessary in the mill {{as well as in}} the marketplace. The effects of kilning and tempering conditions (30, 60 or 90 min at 80, 95 or 110 degrees C) on flake peroxidase activity, size, thickness, strength and water absorption were therefore determined. After kilning, some peroxidase activity remained but steaming and tempering effectively destroyed the activity of these enzymes. Thus the supposed protective effect of kilning or groat durability was not confirmed. Kilning resulted in an increase in flake specific weight, but no other significant effect on flake quality was observed. Tempering time and temperature interacted significantly to produce complex effects on flake specific weight, thickness and water absorption. Flake thickness and specific weight were significantly correlated (r = 0. 808, n = 54). Longer tempering times resulted in an increased fines' fraction, from 1. 45 % at 30 min to 1. 75 % at 90 min. It is concluded that whilst kilning has little effect on flake quality, the heat treatment immediately prior to flaking, can be used to adjust flake quality independently of flake thickness...|$|R

40|$|The {{release of}} soluble dietary fiber is a {{prerequisite}} for viscous effects and hence beneficial health properties. A simple in vitro method was adapted to follow the release during gastrointestinal digestion, and the percentage of solubilized fiber was measured over time. beta-Glucan from oat bran was mainly released during gastric digestion while the release of pectin from sugar beet fiber continued in the small intestine. Unmilled fractions of sugar beet fiber released more soluble fiber than <b>oat</b> bran <b>flakes,</b> probably due to the porous structure of sugar beet fiber as a result of manufacturing processes, but also clue to differences in source. Milling to smaller fiber particles significantly improved releasability (from 20 to 55 % released beta-glucan and from 50 to 70 % released pectin, respectively, after digestion). When milled fibers were included in individual food matrices, the release was reduced by protein and starch matrices (5 % beta-glucan and 35 % pectin released, respectively) and slowed by fat (45 % beta-glucan and 60 % pectin released). This may result in a too low or too late release in the upper small intestine to be able to interfere with macronutrient uptake. The method may be suitable for predicting the gastrointestinal release of soluble dietary fibers from food matrices in the development of healthy food products...|$|R

Moisture content was determined by air-drying. Water absorption was determined by weighing 50 g of flakes into a beaker and adding 200 ml of water at 24 °C. After 5 min the mixture was spread over a pre-weighed 0. 85 mm screen, tilted at 28 ° from the horizontal and allowed to drain. Flake colour was measured with a tri-stimulus instrument. Flake size distribution was measured using 5 and 2. 5 mm round-holed sieves, from a representative sample obtained with a sample divider. Pasting properties were measured using a Rapid Viscoanalyzer. There was a positive correlation between specific weight and flake thickness. Specific weight showed strong negative correlations with water absorption and the peak viscosity of flakes ground in a pin mill, however there were no significant difference between finely ground flakes, which suggests differences in the particle size distribution or extractability of starch. Thin flakes were whiter. The relationship between specific weight and breakage was less clear, although thin flakes were more susceptible to breakage.

In this study, the importance of the degree of gelatinization and the product thickness for postprandial glycemic and insulinemic {{responses to}} rolled oats and barley were studied in healthy subjects (5 men and 5 women). Thick (1. 0 mm) rolled oats were made from raw or preheated (roasted or steamed) kernels. In addition, thin (0. 5 mm) rolled oats were made from roasted or roasted and steamed (processed under conditions simulating commercial production) oat kernels. Finally, steamed rolled barley kernels (0. 5 or 1. 0 mm) were prepared. All thin flakes elicited high glucose and insulin responses [glycemic index (GI), 88 – 118; insulinemic index (II), 84 – 102], not significantly different from white wheat bread (P. 0. 05). In contrast, all varieties of thick <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> gave significantly lower metabolic responses (GI, 70 – 78; II, 58 – 77) than the reference bread (P, 0. 05).

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of commercial fibre cereals on the rate of gastric emptying, postprandial glucose response and satiety in healthy subjects. Methods Gastric emptying rate (GER) was measured by standardized real time ultrasonography. Twelve healthy subjects were assessed using a randomized crossover blinded trial. The subjects were examined after an 8 hour fast and after assessment of normal fasting blood glucose level. Satiety scores were estimated and blood glucose measurements were taken before and at 0, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min after the end of the meal. GER was calculated as the percentage change in the antral cross-sectional area 15 and 90 min after ingestion of sour milk with corn flakes (GER 1), cereal bran flakes (GER 2) or wholemeal <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> (GER 3). Results The median value was, respectively, 42 % for GER 1, 33 % for GER 2 and 51 % for GER 3. The difference between the GER after ingestion of bran flakes compared to wholemeal <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> was statistically significant (p = 0. 023). The postprandial delta blood glucose level was statistically significantly lower at 40 min (p = 0. 045) and 120 min (p = 0. 023) after the cereal bran flakes meal. There was no statistical significance between the areas under the curve (AUCs) of the cereals as far as blood glucose and satiety were concerned. Conclusion The result of this study demonstrates that the intake of either bran flakes or wholemeal <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> has no effect on the total postprandial blood glucose response or satiety when compared to corn flakes. However, the study does show that the intake of cereal bran flakes slows the GER when compared to <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> and corn flakes, probably due to a higher fibre content. Since these products do not differ in terms of glucose response and satiety on healthy subjects, they should be considered equivalent in this respect. Trial registration ISRCTN 90535566 </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dietary fibre {{food intake}} {{is related to}} a reduced risk of {{developing}} diabetes mellitus. However, the mechanism of this effect is still not clear. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of commercial fibre cereals on the rate of gastric emptying, postprandial glucose response and satiety in healthy subjects. METHODS: Gastric emptying rate (GER) was measured by standardized real time ultrasonography. Twelve healthy subjects were assessed using a randomized crossover blinded trial. The subjects were examined after an 8 hour fast and after assessment of normal fasting blood glucose level. Satiety scores were estimated and blood glucose measurements were taken before and at 0, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min after the end of the meal. GER was calculated as the percentage change in the antral cross-sectional area 15 and 90 min after ingestion of sour milk with corn flakes (GER 1), cereal bran flakes (GER 2) or wholemeal <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> (GER 3). RESULTS: The median value was, respectively, 42 % for GER 1, 33 % for GER 2 and 51 % for GER 3. The difference between the GER after ingestion of bran flakes compared to wholemeal <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> was statistically significant (p = 0. 023). The postprandial delta blood glucose level was statistically significantly lower at 40 min (p = 0. 045) and 120 min (p = 0. 023) after the cereal bran flakes meal. There was no statistical significance between the areas under the curve (AUCs) of the cereals as far as blood glucose and satiety were concerned. CONCLUSION: The result of this study demonstrates that the intake of either bran flakes or wholemeal <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> has no effect on the total postprandial blood glucose response or satiety when compared to corn flakes. However, the study does show that the intake of cereal bran flakes slows the GER when compared to <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> and corn flakes, probably due to a higher fibre content.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the extent to which oat particle size in a porridge could alter glucose absorption, gastric emptying, gastrointestinal hormone response, and subjective feelings of appetite and satiety. Porridge was prepared from either <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> or oat flour with the same protein, fat, carbohydrate, and mass. These were fed to eight volunteers on separate days in a crossover study, and subjective appetite ratings, gastric contents, and plasma glucose, insulin, and gastrointestinal hormones were determined over a period of 3 h. The flake porridge gave a lower glucose response than the flour porridge, and there were apparent differences in gastric emptying in both the early and late postprandial phases. The appetite ratings showed similar differences between early- and late-phase behavior. The structure of the <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> remained sufficiently intact to delay their gastric emptying, leading to a lower glycemic response, even though initial gastric emptying rates were similar for the flake and flour porridge. This highlights the need to take food structure into account when considering relatively simple physiological measures and offering nutritional guidance...|$|E
40|$|Plasmodium of a {{cellular}} slime mould Physarum polycephalum {{is a very}} large eukaryotic microbe visible to the unaided eye. During its foraging behavior the plasmodium spans sources of nutrients with a network of protoplasmic tubes. In this paper we attempt to address the following question: Is slime mould capable of computing transport networks? By assuming the sources of nutrients are cities and protoplasmic tubes connecting the sources are motorways, how well does the plasmodium approximate existing motorway networks? We take the Netherlands as a case study for bio-development of motorways, while it has the most dense motorway network in Europe, current demand is rapidly approaching the upper limits of existing capacity. We represent twenty major cities with <b>oat</b> <b>flakes,</b> place plasmodium in Amsterdam and record how the plasmodium spreads between <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> via the protoplasmic tubes. First we analyze slime-mould-built and man-built transport networks in a framework of proximity graphs to investigate if the slime mould is capable of computing existing networks. We then go on to investigate if the slime mould is able calculate or adapt the network through imitating restructuring of the transport network as a response to potential localized flooding of the Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{sensitive}} LC-MS/MS {{method for}} the simultaneous determination of type A, B, and D trichothecenes in cereals is presented. The limits of detection ranged between 0. 1 µg kg- 1 and 0. 7 µg kg- 1 for all analytes. The method {{was applied to}} 289 representatively drawn samples of wheat, rye, and oat products. Ninety-four percent of the wheat samples (n= 130), 95 % of the rye samples (n= 61), and 100 % of the oat samples (n= 98) were contaminated with the type A trichothecenes T- 2 and HT- 2 toxin. Median levels of T- 2 /HT- 2 (sum of the toxins) were 0. 91 µg kg- 1, 0. 53 µg kg- 1, and 8. 2 µg kg- 1, respectively. Highest levels were found in wheat bran (24 µg kg- 1), rye kernels (3. 1 µg kg- 1), and <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> (85 µg kg- 1). All wheat and rye samples and 75 % of the oat samples were contaminated with the type B trichothecene deoxynivalenol. Median levels of this toxin were 23 µg kg- 1, 15 µg kg- 1, and 0. 53 µg kg- 1, respectively. Highest levels were found in wheat bran (1160 µg kg- 1), rye kernels (288 µg kg- 1), and <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> (55 µg kg- 1). The type B trichothecene nivalenol was detected in 67 % of the wheat samples, in 3 % of the rye samples, and in 24 % of the oat samples with highest levels in wheat bran (96 µg kg- 1), rye kernels (1. 8 µg kg- 1), and in <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> (17 µg kg- 1), respectively. Levels of other type A and B trichothecenes played a minor role, although the rates of contamination were often high. Neither macrocyclic type D trichothecenes (satratoxin G and H, verrucarin A, roridin A) nor the type A trichothecenes diacetylverrucarol and verrucarol were detected {{in any of the}} samples...|$|E

40|$|The {{study focused}} on {{differences}} between four types of <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> in the fundamental assessments, chemical analyses, sensory evaluations and mineral composition. Statistically signi­ficant differences between the four types of <b>oat</b> <b>flakes</b> were found for ash, water-holding capacity by centrifugal method, soluble fiber, total fiber, β-glucans, starch, proteins, Mg, Fe, Zn, Ni, Pb, Cd, total sensory evaluation and color purity C*. The best overall score was given to ecological flakes, due to a large content of fiber (8. 6 %), β-glucans (3. 6 %), starch (64 %), ash (1. 8 %), {{and low levels of}} manganese (33 mg/kg), cadmium (0. 021 mg/kg) and nickel (0. 7 mg/kg). The worst score was given to regular flakes and comparable to instant. Regular flakes contained minimum of ash (1. 6 %), fiber (5. 3 %), β-glucans (1. 8 %), starch (59 %), and the highest content of manganese (46 mg/kg) and cadmium (0. 052 mg/kg). In the instant flakes the highest content of lead (0. 13 mg/kg), and the largest centrifugal water absorption (118 %), together with the minimum starch content (59 %) could be observed. On the basis of the very significant difference in quality, it was concluded that it could be possible to improve product quality, and reduce the content of heavy metals, especially through a careful selection of quality oats...|$|E
