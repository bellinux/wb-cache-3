5|$|Many people prepare {{packages}} <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> {{they give}} to neighbors, friends, family, and colleagues on Purim. These are called mishloach manot ("sending of portions"), and often include wine and baked goods, fruit and nuts, and sweets.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{population}} size would not dramatically increase until the Song dynasty period, when the population doubled to 100 million {{people because of}} extensive rice cultivation in central and southern China, coupled with rural farmers holding more abundant yields <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> they could easily provide to the growing market.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{and other}} members of the genus Equus are adapted by {{evolutionary}} biology to eating small amounts of the same kind of food all day long. In the wild, horses ate prairie grasses in semi-arid regions and traveled significant distances each day in order to obtain adequate nutrition. Therefore, their digestive system was made to work best with a small but steady flow <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> does not change much from day to day.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, the Livestock Conservancy {{entered a}} {{partnership}} with Slow Food USA, Chefs Collaborative, and four other organizations to found the Renewing America's Food Traditions collaboration. The effort resulted in a book, Renewing America's Food Traditions, describing more than 1000varieties and species <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> are disappearing from the United States. The organization has written or published over a dozen books on heritage livestock breeds, including several on heritage poultry and waterfowl and more on general livestock conservation. Its conservation criteria and literature on livestock biodiversity are also widely used in independent publications on breeds. The Conservancy organizes an annual conference {{that focuses on the}} preservation and promotion of rare livestock breeds. For this conference, it partners with other organizations to teach members and other attendees about various aspects of rare breed livestock. For instance, in 2005, the organization partnered with the NAGP and the American Grassfed Association for a discussion on the cryogenic preservation of rare breed genetic material, which included a tour of the USDA Livestock and Poultry Gene Bank. In 2009, the Conservancy set up an online classified advertisement system to help users find and purchase rare breeds.|$|E

25|$|The {{classical}} rabbis prohibited any item <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> {{had been}} consecrated to an idol {{or had been}} used in the service of an idol. Since the Talmud views all non-Jews as potential idolaters, and viewed intermarriage with apprehension, it included within this prohibition any food which has been cooked or prepared completely by non-Jews. (Bread sold by a non-Jewish baker {{was not included in the}} prohibition.) Similarly, a number of Jewish writers believed food prepared for Jews by non-Jewish servants would not count as prepared by potential idolaters, although this view was opposed by Jacob ben Asher.|$|E

25|$|Research {{shows that}} Western diet habits are {{a factor in}} {{development}} of metabolic syndrome, with high consumption <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> is not biochemically suited to humans. Weight gain is associated with metabolic syndrome. Rather than total adiposity, the core clinical component of the syndrome is visceral and/or ectopic fat (i.e., fat in organs not designed for fat storage) whereas the principal metabolic abnormality is insulin resistance. The continuous provision of energy via dietary carbohydrate, lipid, and protein fuels, unmatched by physical activity/energy demand creates a backlog of the products of mitochondrial oxidation, a process associated with progressive mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance.|$|E
25|$|To {{fulfill the}} mitzvah of giving charity to two poor people, one can give either food or money {{equivalent}} to the amount <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> is eaten at a regular meal. It is better to spend more on charity than on the giving of mishloach manot. In the synagogue, regular collections of charity are made on the festival and the money is distributed among the needy. No distinction is made among the poor; anyone {{who is willing to}} accept charity is allowed to participate. It is obligatory upon the poorest Jew, even one who is himself dependent on charity, to give to other poor people.|$|E

25|$|Media {{portrayals of}} an 'ideal' body shape are widely {{considered}} to be a contributing factor to bulimia. In a 1991 study by Weltzin, Hsu, Pollicle, and Kaye, it was stated that 19% of bulimics undereat, 37% of bulimics eat an amount <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> is normal for an average human being, and 44% of bulimics overeat. A survey of 15- to 18-year-old high school girls in Nadroga, Fiji, found the self-reported incidence of purging rose from 0% in 1995 (a few weeks after the introduction of television in the province) to 11.3% in 1998. In addition, the suicide rate among people with bulimia nervosa is 7.5 times higher than in the general population.|$|E
25|$|At around 16:00 on 29 November 2011, three student union presidents (of Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, University College Cork and IT Carlow) {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Union of Students in Ireland (USI) President Gary Redmond occupied a room at Department of Social Protection on Dublin's Store Street as part of a continued effort to have the Labour Party clarify its position on tuition fees. Police broke down the door of the room in which they were stationed and led them away. The students came armed with a chemical toilet and supplies <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> could have lasted them weeks. Ten student union presidents also attempted to occupy a room at the Department of Enterprise on Kildare Street for the same reasons.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{metabolic}} {{rates is}} complicated by the distinction between the rates while resting and while active. In all modern reptiles and most mammals and birds the maximum rates during all-out activity are 10 to 20 times higher than minimum rates while at rest. However, in a few mammals these rates differ by a factor of 70. Theoretically it would be possible for a land vertebrate to have a reptilian metabolic rate at rest and a bird-like rate while working flat out. However, an animal with such a low resting rate would be unable to grow quickly. The huge herbivorous sauropods may have been on the move so constantly in search <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> their energy expenditure would have been much the same irrespective of whether their resting metabolic rates were high or low.|$|E

25|$|The {{cooking time}} depends {{primarily}} on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> needs to be cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours {{before and after the}} local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, {{it might be possible to}} melt butter in 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for four people in 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, you may be able to grill a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.|$|E
25|$|The -long {{complex of}} tunnels at Củ Chi has been {{preserved}} {{by the government}} of Vietnam, and turned into a war memorial park with two different tunnel display sites, Ben Dinh and Ben Duoc. The tunnels are a popular tourist attraction, and visitors are invited to crawl around in the safer parts of the tunnel system. The Ben Duoc site contains part of the original tunnel system, while the Ben Dinh site, closer to Saigon, has tunnel reconstructions and some tunnels have been made larger to accommodate tourists. In both sites low-power lights have been installed in the tunnels to make traveling through them easier, and both sites have displays of the different types of booby traps that were used. Underground conference rooms where campaigns such as the Tết Offensive were planned in 1968 have been restored, and visitors may enjoy a simple meal <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> Viet Cong fighters would have eaten.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, a year {{of strong}} {{economic}} activity and robust competition in the grocery market, prices in Houston's grocery stores were {{below the national average}} prices in grocery stores. Houston's grocery price index averaged at 85.6, below the national average of 88.4. This means that, for the 1982-1984 base period, Houstonians paid $88.40 for an amount <b>of</b> <b>food</b> <b>that</b> would cost $100 according to the national average. During the oil bust and the economic decline, Houston's prices stayed even with the national average. In 1983 Houston's grocery index increased from 96.8 to 99.4 and matched the national average of 99.1. As the city began to recover, the prices began to edge upward. When a recession in the U.S. began and while Houston's economic growth slowed and continued, the national price index fell below Houston's price index. As of 1992 prices in Houston's grocery stores were higher than the national average; Houston's index averaged to be 137.3, and the national average was 132.3.|$|E
