40|$|Allelic {{association}} has proven useful {{to refine the}} location of major genes prior to positional cloning, but it is of uncertain value for genome scans in complex inheritance. We have extended kinship theory to give information content for linkage and allelic association. Application to pairs of closely linked markers as a surrogate for marker × <b>oligogene</b> pairs indicates that association is largely determined by regional founders, with little effect of subsequent demography. Sub-Saharan Africa has the least allelic association, consistent with settlement of other regions by small numbers of founders. Recent speculation about substantial advantages of isolates over large populations, of constant size over expansion, and of F 1 hybrids over incrosses is not supported by theory or data. On the contrary, fewer affected cases, less opportunity for replication, and more stochastic variation tend to make isolates less informative for allelic association, as they are for linkage...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{methods are}} {{available}} for positional cloning of major genes by linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD). The application of these methods to complex diseases is more demanding, but advances in sequencing the human genome, SNP discovery, high-throughput genotyping techniques, LD maps, and haplotype annotation are revolutionizing positional cloning of <b>oligogenes</b> for common multifactorial disease...|$|R
40|$|Linkage {{tests to}} {{localize}} <b>oligogenes</b> have been extended {{during the past}} year. Using simulated data and multiplex selection we find that several tests on affected sib pairs have comparable power and type I error. Three variants of SIBPAL 2 are favoured when substantial numbers of normal sibs are included, but performance relative to the BETA benchmark degrades rapidly as normal sibs are depleted by selective sampling or typing. Neglect of this fact may explain recent failure of retrospective collaboration to confirm asthma candidates in the 5 q cytokine region that are supported by other studies. A fully quantitative trait favours variance components under complete ascertainment and two options in SIBPAL 2 under multiplex selection, with substantial gain in power from covariance analysis if the covariate is independent of the candidate locus. A dichotomy and liability threshold give virtually identical results in the SOLAR variance components program. Comparison with single-marker parametric analysis suggests that extension to multiple markers would be competitive with nonparametric methods in power, and superior in depth of genetic analysis. The simulated examples illustrate common problems encountered with linkage scans for <b>oligogenes.</b> They show that nonparametric methods provide no panacea for analytical problems posed by different phenotypes and methods of ascertainment...|$|R
50|$|Further studies, however, {{have shown}} that this {{simplification}} enough arguments to justify the prevailing view {{that the majority of}} monogenic features have oligogenic determination, or that such traits genetically certain small number of <b>oligogenes</b> with a very dominant phenotypic effect major gene; effect of other, so-called minor genes from the corresponding oligogenic series (as well as environmental factors) on the expression of the observed characteristics is, in fact, practically negligible. It should be noted, however, that the difference between major and minor genes, as well as criteria for separating the oligogenic and polygenetically feature is still arbitrary.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work: the {{description}} of the polygene system achaete-acute as the model system of determination of the quantitative sign. For the first time, the elements, invariant to the factors, modifying the phenotype, have been revealed in the structure of maps of the phenotypic appearances of the mutations. Its consequence has been interpretated as the genetic map of the <b>oligogene</b> scute. The correlation between the character of the total distribution of six mobile elements and the level of the penetrance in the isogenous lines of the mutants has been revealed. For the first time, the two groups of polygenes with the antagonistic character of influence on the sign have been mapped. The fact of activization of the mobile elements has been detected in the process of the isogenizing crossings. The representations about the architectonics of the polygenous system achaete-scute have been formulated.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} potential of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for mapping complex traits which are determined by genes of small individual effect (oligogenes). It is thought likely that many oligogenes are themselves common polymorphisms, perhaps biallelic, {{for which there is}} effectively neutral selection reflected in late age of onset. The extent of detectable linkage disequilibrium between SNP x SNP pairs and SNP x <b>oligogene</b> pairs is of considerable interest, particularly in the context of identifying ’favourable ’ populations. Unfortunately data are sparse and few populations have been extensively sampled. Polymorphisms with the appropriate characteristics that have been studied are blood groups in the Rhesus and MNS systems for which there are extensive data on four pairs of biallelics. These might be regarded as surrogates for SNP-SNP or SNP-oligogene pairs. By developing and applying an approach, previously used for major genes, to evaluate association (ρ) in SNP haplotypes, it is evident that, with some exceptions, there is little difference between isolates and large populations. Furthermore it is apparent that there is useful linkage disequilibrium even for the MN-Ss locus pair (0. 195 cM apart), in both large populations and isolates. This is somewhat more favourable to linkage disequilibrium mapping than a recent simulation suggests...|$|E
40|$|In plants, an <b>oligogene</b> family encodes NADP-malic enzymes (NADP-me), {{which are}} {{responsible}} for various functions and exhibit different kinetics and expression patterns. In particular, a chloroplast isoform of NADP-me {{plays a key role}} in one of the three biochemical subtypes of C 4 photosynthesis, an adaptation to warm environments that evolved several times independently during angiosperm diversification. By combining genomic and phylogenetic approaches, this study aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms linked to the recurrent evolutions of C 4 -specific NADP-me in grasses (Poaceae). Genes encoding NADP-me (nadpme) were retrieved from genomes of model grasses and isolated from a large sample of C 3 and C 4 grasses. Genomic and phylogenetic analyses showed that 1) the grass nadpme gene family is composed of four main lineages, one of which is expressed in plastids (nadpme-IV), 2) C 4 -specific NADP-me evolved at least five times independently from nadpme-IV, and 3) some codons driven by positive selection underwent parallel changes during the multiple C 4 origins. The C 4 NADP-me being expressed in chloroplasts probably constrained its recurrent evolutions from the only plastid nadpme lineage and this common starting point limited the number of evolutionary paths toward a C 4 optimized enzyme, resulting in genetic convergence. In light of the history of nadpme genes, an evolutionary scenario of the C 4 phenotype using NADP-me is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Recombination acts on {{the genetic}} map, {{not on the}} {{physical}} map. On the other hand, the physical map is usually more accurate. Choice of the genetic or physical map for positional cloning by allelic association depends on the goodness of fit of data to each map under an established model. Huntington disease illustrates the usual {{case in which the}} greater reliability of physical data outweighs recombinational heterogeneity. Hemochromatosis represents an exceptional case in which unrecognized recombinational heterogeneity retarded positional cloning for a decade. The Malecot model performs well for major genes, but no approach assuming either equilibrium or disequilibrium has been validated for <b>oligogenes</b> contributing to common disease. In this case of greatest interest, the power of allelic association relative to linkage is less clear than for major genes...|$|R
40|$|A LOD score >= 3 is {{necessary}} but {{not sufficient to}} make a linkage test reliable, and this applies to complex inheritance {{as well as to}} major loci. Factors that affect this threshold are considered here. A LOD score as small as 2 is suggestive but is unreliable except as confirmation of either a significant linkage or a strong candidate locus. A threshold as great as 4 is unnecessarily conservative if multipoint tests are used sensibly. Marker density is not a major factor, and biases in the evaluation of LOD scores-especially inadequate allowance for estimation of nuisance parameters in multiple models-are paramount. Allelic association increases resolution for <b>oligogenes</b> within a candidate region and remains the only practical method to locate polygenes.

40|$|The {{application}} of allelic association to map genes for complex traits, particularly using high-density maps of {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} in candidate regions, {{is an area of}} very active research. Here we present some aspects of the methodology and applications to both major gene mapping, which illustrates the effectiveness of the method, and <b>oligogenes,</b> where methods are still in flux and for which there have been relatively few successes to date. Several important considerations emerge, including the selection of the optimal metric for measuring association and the importance of modelling the decline in association with distance given the variability in association in a candidate region. The Malecot model of association with distance is shown to have a resolution of greater than 50 kilobases but the available evidence suggests that considerably higher resolution might be achieved with dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) maps...|$|R

40|$|The central {{problem of}} complex {{inheritance}} is to map <b>oligogenes</b> for disease susceptibility, integrating linkage and association over samples that differ in several ways. Combination of evidence over multiple samples with 1, 037 families supports loci contributing to asthma susceptibility in the cytokine region on 5 q [maximum logarithm of odds (lod) = 2. 61 near IL- 4], but {{no evidence for}} atopy. The principal problems with retrospective collaboration on linkage {{appear to have been}} solved, providing far more information than a single study. A multipoint lod table evaluated at commonly agreed reference loci is required for both collaboration and metaanalysis, but variations in ascertainment, pedigree structure, phenotype definition, and marker selection are tolerated. These methods are invariant with statistical methods that increase the power of lods and are applicable to all diseases, motivating collaboration rather than competition. In contrast to linkage, positional cloning by allelic association has yet to be extended to multiple samples, a prerequisite for efficient combination with linkage and the greatest current challenge to genetic epidemiology...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a simple, graphical method for determining plausible modes of inheritance for complex traits and apply this to bipolar disorder. The constraints that allele frequencies and penetrances {{lie in the}} interval 0 - 1 impose limits on recurrence risks, KR, in relatives of an affected proband for a given population prevalence, KP. We have investigated these limits for KR in three classes of relatives (MZ co-twin, sibling, and parent/offspring) for the general single-locus model and for two types of multilocus models: heterogeneity and multiplicative. In our models we have assumed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, an all-or-none trait, absence of nongenetic resemblance between relatives, and negligible mutation at the disease loci. Although the true values of KP and the KR's are only approximately known, observed population and family data for bipolar disorder are inconsistent with a single-locus model or with any heterogeneity model. In contrast, multiplicative models involving three or more loci are consistent with observed data and, thus, represent plausible models for the inheritance of bipolar disorders. Studies to determine the genetic basis of most bipolar disorder should use methods capable of detecting interacting <b>oligogenes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Meta-analysis is {{presented}} for published studies on linkage or allelic association that {{have in common}} only reported significance levels. Reporting is biassed, and nonsignificance is seldom quantified. Therefore meta-analysis cannot identify <b>oligogenes</b> within a candidate region nor establish their significance, but it defines candidate regions well. Applied to a database on atopy and asthma, candidate regions are identified on chromosomes 6, 5, 16, 11, 12, 13, 14, 7, 20, and 10, in rank order from strongest to weakest evidence. On the other hand, there is little support for chromosomes 9, 8, 18, 1, and 15 in the same rank order. The evidence from 156 publications is reviewed for each region. With reasonable type I and II errors several thousand affected sib pairs {{would be required to}} detect a locus accounting for 1 / 10 of the genetic effect on asthma. Identification of regions by a genome scan for linkage and allelic association requires international collaborative studies to reach the necessary sample size, using lod-based methods that specify a weakly parametric alternative hypothesis and can be combined over studies that differ in ascertainment, phenotypes, and markers. This has become the central problem in complex inheritance. <br/...|$|R
30|$|There is now {{enormous}} amount of genomic data available on various public domains. Information on the genetic basis of rare and common disease phenotypes can be found relatively freely on Medline and OMIM. The focus is now understandably on common medical diseases that are termed complex diseases as the underlying pathogenesis is not usually fully understood but generally perceived to involve multiple factors including the pathogenic effects of polygenes, <b>oligogenes,</b> genetic polymorphisms, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and the copy number variations (CNVs). Thus evidence that has now accumulated from the genomic research is plentiful and powerful in clarifying the biological understanding {{of a number of}} complex diseases. This information is now rapidly harvested in designing new diagnostic tools and as well as those in making pharmaco-therapeutic decisions and predicting the outcome. In this context, genome-wide measures of gene expression derived from DNA microarray studies has the potential of providing information to the analysis of biological phenotypes (Nevins et al. 2003). One of the most successful applications of this kind of data has been in the characterisation of human cancers, including the ability to predict clinical outcomes. Gene expression studies using the microarray genomic technology have been used in defining the broad group distinctions as another mean to define traditional risk factors. However, this approach is less successful in making accurate predictions in individual patients due to considerable heterogeneity within these broadly defined groups. This can be possibly resolved using multiple gene expression patterns and combining this with individual characteristics and predicting outcomes. Thus it is envisaged that combining both genomic and clinical data would most effectively characterise individual patients and provide strong evidence in predicting the clinical outcomes (West et al. 2006).|$|R
40|$|Till {{now there}} is no uniform opinion in the {{scientific}} literature about number and type of action of genes coding barley aluminum resistance. For example, Rigin, Yakovleva (2001) considers, that it is controlled by two <b>oligogenes,</b> as a minimum, with possible action of genes with weaker effect. Other authors assume the control of the parameter by one dominant gene Pht [Stolen, Andersen, 1978], or gene Alp [Reid, 1971], both located on chromosome 4 [Minella, Sorrells, 1997]. Gourley et al [1990] concluded, that type of action of genes coding aluminum resistance in sorghum (additive, partially or completely dominant), depends not only on a researched genotype, but also on used Al concentration. Aniol [1995, 1996] has established, that when the concentration of aluminum in test solution is low (30 - 40 µМ), cereal cultures (wheat, rye) use mechanisms that block accumulation of aluminum in roots (for example, chelation of aluminum at the expense of exudation of organic acids by root system), at higher concentration of aluminum in root growth environment (200 - 300 µМ) the basic role is played by other physiological mechanisms of Al-resistance. Thus the author remarks [Aniol, 1997] that the aluminum resistance of wheat plants at a concentration of 296 µМ is controlled by 2 genes and at a concentration of 592 µМ aluminum resistance is controlled by three genes. He wrote, that genes located in D-genome of wheat, are expressed only at high Al concentration, and genes located on chromosome 5 А are expressed at all studied concentrations. The aim of our research was to determine the influence of Al concentration on a direction and character of dominance of parameters of roots growth of barley F 2 hybrid seedlings...|$|R
