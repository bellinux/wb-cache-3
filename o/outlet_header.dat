The steam flow of 2,200 t/h produces a net output capacity of 676 MW. The steam for the testing purpose of the CTF (12 kg/s) is taken from the inlet header of the superheater (SH1) and is led to the evaporator panel, where it is heated to 600 C. Steam is further heated in the test superheater to 705 °C before entering either the high pressure bypass test valve, or being cooled and mixed with the main superheater steam (SH 4).

50|$|Within {{the boiler}} design activities, {{potential}} cost savings {{were identified by}} considering shortening the main and reheat steam lines using two novel arrangements. Firstly, a twin tower or inverse two-pass boiler design was considered, in which firing {{takes place in a}} first tower, with the hot combustion gases moving down and across to a second tower. The final super-heater and re-heater are arranged {{at the bottom of the}} second tower with <b>outlet</b> <b>headers</b> located close to the turbine. The arrangement minimizes the thermal movement between boiler and steam lines providing a significant reduction in the length of steam piping to 25 m and 30 m for each string of 400 MW reference plant. As an alternative arrangement, a horizontal boiler concept, designed with the <b>outlet</b> <b>headers</b> on top of the boiler was considered. The low height boiler design arrangement resulted in a similar shortening of the steam lines to around 35 m to 40 m for each string of a 400 MW reference plant.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>headers</b> used to {{distribute}} {{hot and cold}} fluids in the matrix is much simpler in counter flow regenerators than recuperators. The reason behind this is that both streams flow in different sections for a rotary regenerator and one fluid enters and leaves one matrix {{at a time in}} a fixed-matrix regenerator. Furthermore, flow sectors for hot and cold fluids in rotary regenerators can be designed to optimize pressure drop in the fluids. The matrix surfaces of regenerators also have self-cleaning characteristics, reducing fluid-side fouling and corrosion. Finally properties such as small surface density and counter-flow arrangement of regenerators make it ideal for gas-gas heat exchange applications requiring effectiveness exceeding 85%. The heat transfer coefficient is much lower for gases than for liquids, thus the enormous surface area in a regenerator greatly increases heat transfer.|$|R

The forced ventilation would sweep out the water vapor from the evaporation of the coolant rejecting heat from the coolant stream. The hollow fibers are obtained commercially (X 50 - 215 Celgard) which are arranged in a sheet containing 5 fibers per linear inch. Two engineering development units were produced that vary the fold direction of the fiber sheets relative to the ventilation.

Generic root causes of large differences in temperature of tubes intended to remain at closely similar temperatures at all times are discussed, with suggestions how the resultant cyclic thermally-induced stresses at tube attachment to header can be mitigated on existing HRSG installations by minor modifications to equipment and by better-informed operating procedures during startups and shutdowns, and eliminated on new installations by more enlightened design of HRSG and also of balance of plant systems that influence the transient conditions imposed on the HRSG during startup and shutdowns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The main {{parameters}} describing {{the efficiency and}} acceptance of a particular shell and tube heat exchanger in any application is its pressure drop. More the pressure drop across the tube side less is the heat transfer and hence more is the pumping power required and more is the cost. The pressure drop on the tube side can be split into three parts namely pressure drop due to Inlet nozzle, pressure drop in the tube bank, and pressure drop in the outlet nozzle. A large number of analytical expressions are available for finding the tube bank pressure drop of a Conventional SHTX i. e. as per TEMA Standards. This research provides a Numerical approach for finding the pressure drop across the tube bank for a SHTX with a nozzle position other than the TEMA Standards and also its comparison of the tube bank pressure drop with a conventional BEM types of TEMA SHTX. Firstly the Conventional Nozzle position is used for an Elliptical Inlet and Outlet headers i. e. the nozzle length being perpendicular to the direction of flow in the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>header</b> and secondly the nozzle length being parallel to the direction of flow in the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>header.</b> Since the approach is numerical the use of Ansys 14. 5 was used.

40|$|Abstract: The {{primary heat}} {{transport}} system {{of a typical}} CANDU®- 6 nuclear power reactor contains 760 feeder pipes. These feeders carry the coolant between the inlet or <b>outlet</b> <b>headers</b> and the individual fuel channels. Inspection requirements that developed in feeders in the 1990 ’s led to rapid development of NDE technology to evaluate feeder integrity. The NDE technology {{had to deal with}} the complex and variable geometry of feeders and access constraints inherent in feeder inspections. The first feeder inspection requirement was ability to detect Flow-Accelerated Corrosion (FAC). This led to an evolution in wall thickness measurement techniques for feeders that is continuing. The leading edge technique for wall thickness measurement is the METAR Crawler that scans feeder bends with 14 wall thickness probes. This system uses motors to push the bracelet along the feeder bend. Second, cracking was detected in a feeder in 1997. This led to development of a specialized, manual inspection technique to deal with access problems. This technique has been extended to use a Hydro Quebec developed drive system to move the probes over a raster scan. The presentation will explain feeder degradation modes and the NDE developed to evaluate feeder integrity.

40|$|Based on a {{theoretical}} analysis of convective heat transfer across large internal surface areas, this paper discusses the design implications for generating lightweight gas-gas heat exchanger designs by packaging such areas into compact three-dimensional shapes. Allowances {{are made for}} hot and cold inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>headers</b> for assembly of completed regenerator (or recuperator) heat exchanger units into closed cycle gas turbine flow ducting. Surface area and resulting volume and mass requirements are computed {{for a range of}} heat exchanger effectiveness values and internal heat transfer coefficients. Benefit cost curves show the effect of increasing heat exchanger effectiveness on Brayton cycle thermodynamic efficiency on the plus side, while also illustrating the cost in heat exchanger required surface area, volume, and mass requirements as effectiveness is increased. The equations derived for counterflow and crossflow configurations show that as effectiveness values approach unity, or 100 percent, the required surface area, and hence heat exchanger volume and mass tend toward infinity, since the implication is that heat is transferred at a zero temperature difference. To verify the dimensional accuracy of the regenerator mass computational procedure, calculation of a regenerator specific mass, that is, heat exchanger weight per unit working fluid mass flow, is performed in both English and SI units.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to model and {{experimentally}} validate refrigerant inventory of R 134 a in small-channel cross-flow condenserst. This heat exchanger is used in automotive applications and uses smaller internal volumes than conventional heat exchangers to perform the same task. Since the cost of refrigerants continues to rise due to the phase out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), internal volume becomes a key design parameter. The model is a one-dimensional, two-fluid model which divides the condenser into several segments and modules. This model accurately predicts the rate of heat transfer and refrigerant pressure drop: the heat transfer was predicted within ?? 10 % of the experiment and the pressure drop was predicted within ?? 30 % {{for the majority of the}} data. More importantly, the model predicts refrigerant inventory within ?? 10 % of the experiments for ninety five percent of the data. In the inlet header, the slip ratio was correlated to the Reynolds and Froude numbers, and the homogeneous liquid volume fraction. In the small channels, the Reynolds and Weber numbers, and the homogeneous liquid volume fraction were used to correlate the slip ratio. For the <b>outlet</b> <b>header,</b> the dispersed liquid in the core was modeled using an unsteady gravity model and the annulus was modeled using the liquid-film Reynolds number and inverse viscosity. Finally, the flow regimes were documented for the pipes, headers and small channel condenser tubes. Intermittent flow was the predominate flow regime in the small channels which is consistent with the Damianides flow map and Kelvin-Helmholtz stability criteria.

40|$|In this study, a {{numerical}} model is developed for determining coupled heat and moisture transfer in a run-around membrane energy exchanger (RAMEE) using two counter/cross flow exchangers {{and with a}} salt solution of MgCl 2 as the coupling fluid. The counter/cross flow exchanger is a counter-flow exchanger with cross-flow inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>headers.</b> The model is two-dimensional, steady-state {{and based on the}} physical principles of conservation of momentum, energy, and mass. The finite difference method is used in this model to discretize the governing equations. The heat transfer model is validated with effectiveness correlations in the literature. It is shown that the difference between the numerical model and correlations is less than ¡À 2 % and ¡À 2. 5 % for heat exchangers and run around heat exchangers (RAHE), respectively. The simultaneous heat and moisture transfer model is validated with data from another model and experiments. The inter-model comparison shows a difference of less than 1 %. The experimental validation shows an average discrepancy of 1 % to 17 % between the experimental and numerical data for overall total effectiveness. At lower NTUs the numerical and experimental results show better agreement (e. g. within 1 - 4 % at NTU= 4). The model for RAHE is used to develop new effectiveness correlations for the geometrically more complex counter/cross flow heat exchangers and RAHE systems. The correlations are developed to predict the response of the exchangers and overall system to the change of different design characteristics as it is determined by the model. Discrepancies between the simulated and correlated results are within ¡À 2 % for both the heat exchangers and the RAHE systems. It is revealed by the model that the overall effectiveness of the counter/cross flow RAMEE depends on the entrance ratio (the ratio of the length of the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>headers</b> to the length of the exchanger, xi/x 0), aspect ratio (the ratio of the height to the length of the exchanger, y 0 /x 0), number of heat transfer units (NTU), heat capacity rate ratio (Cr*), number of mass transfer units (NTUm), and the mass flow rate ratio of pure salt in desiccant solution to dry air (m*). Beside these dimensionless parameters, the performance of the RAMEE system is affected by the liquid-air flow configuration and the operating inlet temperature and humidity. This study concludes that the maximum effectiveness of the RAMEE system with two counter/cross flow exchangers occurs when NTU and NTUm are large (e. g. greater than 10). At any NTU, the overall effectiveness of the RAMEE system increases with Cr* until it reaches a maximum value when Cr*=. Increasing Cr* above causes the overall effectiveness to decrease slightly.

The methodology consists of (i) a transient heat transfer model, (ii) a sequential anisothermal cyclic viscoplastic model and (iii) a multiaxial, critical-plane implementation of the Ostergren fatigue indicator parameter. The methodology permits identification of the local thermo-mechanical stressâstrain response at critical locations and prediction of fatigue life and cracking orientation for complex transient, anisothermal, cyclic elasticâplastic-creep material behaviour. Measured plant data, {{in the form of}} steam and pipe temperature transients and steam pressure data, are employed to identify heat transfer constants and validate the predicted thermal response, with particular attention given to plant start-up and attemperation effects. The predictions indicate out-of-phase temperature-strain response at the header inside surface and in-phase response on the outside surface. Cooling transients are predicted to control damage and crack initiation at the inner bore, whereas heating transients are predicted to have a more damaging effect at weld locations. A representative test cycle is presented, which is shown to capture the salient thermo-mechanical cyclic damage of the realistic cycle.

A more uniform flow distribution leads to a homogenous temperature distribution which gives higher collector efficiency.

It is being designed to support the Orion Crew Module and to support future Constellation missions. The MFE would be used from Earth sea level conditions to the vacuum of space. The current Shuttle configuration utilizes an ammonia boiler and flash evaporator system to achieve cooling at all altitudes. The MFE system combines both functions into a single compact package with significant weight reduction and improved freeze-up protection. The heat exchanger core is designed so that radial flow of the evaporant provides increasing surface area to keep the back pressure low.

The structural integrity of such critical components is essential for operational safety, reliability and economic plant operation.

The component design is based on EN standards. Economic results of the retrofit of critical components were investigated with sensitivity studies. The results show, that material and manufacturing costs are less important compared to the loading characteristics (i. e. number of starts), the electricity price and the fuel costs. Even the change in the design specifications, with a resulting reduction in the wall thickness, leads to improved flexibility in the plant operation and an economic benefit, even without the use of different materials. Due to the modular design of the implemented methods, this optimization can be easily adapted to other components...|$|E
40|$|Multi-evaporator vapor {{compression}} systems (ME-VCS) simultaneously provide cooling {{to multiple}} zones. The thermodynamic conditions in these zones are independent: the heat loads often differ, and {{the occupants of}} these spaces often have different desired room temperatures. Therefore, in order to regulate each zone to its desired setpoint temperature, the amount of thermal energy removed by each evaporator must be modulated independently. However, the common evaporating pressure within all evaporators introduces coupling that makes this objective difficult [...] -the valve and piping arrangement imposes the constraint that all evaporators operate at the same temperature. (Systems considered here do not have valves at the outlet of each evaporator and therefore the individual evaporator pressures cannot be independently controlled.) In {{order to reduce the}} per-zone cooling, existing control strategies duty cycle the evaporator (alternate between a fully-open and fully-closed valve). However, duty cycling causes periodic disturbances to not only the local zone, but also to many machine temperatures and pressures, and these disturbances are often not transient but instead persist indefinitely. Fluctuations induced by the periodic disturbances can degrade the ability of the machine to regulate zone temperatures with zero steady state error, cause excessively high or low temperatures during peaks of the period, and couple into most machine signals of interest in ways that are difficult to describe with low order dynamical models. As an alternative to duty cycling, an observed behavior of refrigerant mass distribution in multi-path heat exchangers is exploited for control purposes. Multi-path heat exchangers are characterized by an inlet header pipe that splits refrigerant flow to two or more parallel paths through the heat exchanger and collects those paths into a common <b>outlet</b> <b>header</b> pipe. In the paper, we describe the following empirical phenomenon exploited for control: as the inlet valve is decreased, refrigerant mass flow rate entering the heat exchanger is reduced, and at some critical flow rate, refrigerant is shown to preferentially flow in some paths more than others, causing maldistribution. This uneven refrigerant distribution is repeatable and reduces the capacity in a continuous manner. The refrigerant distribution can be detected by temperature sensors along different paths of a multi-path heat exchanger. As some paths are starved for refrigerant they become superheated, and this uneven superheating process is unstable. A feedback controller is designed to provide stability and robustness to per-zone conditions. Finally, setpoints for this controller that relate per-path superheat temperature to overall evaporator capacity is created {{in such a way as}} to be robust to changes in local zone temperatures and the overall system evaporating temperature, which provides zone decoupling and ultimately creates a virtual control input for a supervisory controller such as a model predictive controller...|$|E
40|$|Repair {{rather than}} {{replacement}} of pressure vessel components operating at elevated temperatures {{is becoming a}} far more viable option, with welding being used increasingly for repair, replacement, retrofits and modifications. However, the considerable cost and time involved in performing conventional post weld heattreatment (PWHT) is increasingly forcing utility owners to turn toward other alternatives, such as cold weld repairs. These require no PWHT and rely on a controlled deposition process – precise weld bead placement and heat inputs to achieve tempering of the HAZ. One such cold weld repair was applied to a prematurely failed reheater <b>outlet</b> <b>header</b> (RHOH) in an emergency situation, enabling its return to service until a replacement component was available. Investigation of this particular repair constitutes a core component of this thesis. Much of the research that has been conducted to justify cold repair techniques has used accelerated high temperature creep testing to demonstrate their integrity. How well this testing reflects real-life performance of repaired components remains uncertain. However, the present study provided {{a rare opportunity to}} evaluate the effects of service exposure on the performance of an emergency cold weld repair, as well as to examine the effectiveness of accelerated laboratory creep testing on creep life predictions for the repair weld, the original fabrication welds and the service exposed parent metal. The metallurgical and mechanical properties of the service-exposed non-PWHT temper bead (TB) repair weld were analysed and characterised systematically relative to both the service-exposed original fabrication weld and parent metal. All test specimens were machined transverse to the welding direction, from 20 mm thick slices taken from both the TB repair and original fabrication weldments. The mechanical property characterisation involved hot tensile (miniature sample), Charpy V-notch impact, hardness and accelerated creep-rupture testing. The microstructural characterisation consisted of compositional analysis, surface replication and conventional metallography, post-test fractography, high-resolution microscopy (SEM, TEM and EBSD), EDS and dilatometry. The microstructural studies were successful in characterising the service-exposed TB repair weld metal both in the as-received and post-test conditions. The findings generally showed the TB repair weld metal microstructure was significantly {{different from those of the}} parent and fabrication weld metals. This was established by the TEM and EBSD studies which showed finer carbides, higher dislocation density and limited subgrain formation, features which are consistent with structure of high stored strain energy. The finer carbides, significant Fe content of some carbides and the presence of Mo-rich carbides are also consistent with a relatively early stage in the carbide evolution sequence for this steel. Additionally, the non-metallic inclusions, which are generally considered to be deleterious to properties, were fine scale and uniform in size distribution. These microstructural characteristics were reflected in superior mechanical properties for all tests, with the notable exception of creep performance. In terms of creep resistance, weld repairs of this kind install a high energy microstructure (finer carbides, higher dislocation density, fine grain structure and subgrain / cell structure) into significantly creep degraded material and generate sharp gradients in microstructure and properties. Overall, the microstructural observations in the service-aged condition and the mechanical properties determined by the experimental work were found to support the conclusion that the ex-service material had clearly not exhausted its creep service-life. This was proven by simulating further service life using accelerated creep testing. During these experiments, the creep failure mode was found to be ductile fracture induced by micro-void coalescence. The tests indicated that although the predicted creep life of the TB repair weldment was inferior to the aged parent metal, it was slightly higher than that of the service-exposed fabrication weldment. It is therefore concluded that the TB repair weld and its associated HAZ did not compromise the overall weldment integrity. This conclusion is drawn despite the finding that the accelerated creep test data for the repair weld showed sub-normal creep performance relative to NT samples and even the aged parent metal. This outcome is probably due to the “accelerated” test conditions which induced structural changes that are unlikely to occur under the actual service conditions. Therefore, accelerated creep test data should be treated with circumspection, particularly for structures such as cold repair weld metal which are characterised by high stored strain energy. The instability of this kind of structure in relation to restoration processes (at the “accelerated” temperatures used for testing) is likely to produce premature creep failure and result in a highly conservative creep life assessment. The perceived danger of cold repair welding is that the vessel integrity will be impaired by the absence of a PWHT to reduce internal stresses, liberate hydrogen and improve mechanical properties. However, the evidence obtained in this study indicates that this need not be the case. Therefore, it is concluded that the TB weld technique can be successfully applied to high energy piping (HEP) components without the need for PWHT. The results of the investigation provide new insights into the microstructure and properties, particularly the creep performance, of service-aged cold repair welds. The research has also revealed a serious limitation of accelerated creep testing of weld repair structures of this kind, in that dynamic restoration processes can be induced that are unlikely to occur at the lower service operating temperatures and stresses...|$|E
