5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, {{both male and}} female mallards can become aggressive, driving off competitors to themselves or their mate by charging at them.

For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E

When one achieves dominance, it sings loudly, while the loser remains silent.|$|E
