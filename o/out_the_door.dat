5|$|After {{destroying}} his workshop, Hoffman is {{attacked and}} subdued by three pig-masked figures, {{one of whom}} is Lawrence. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Lawrence has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, a videotape in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought to the disused bathroom and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used to sever his own foot <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> and then turns off the lights and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|E
5|$|Massino, Napolitano and Gerlando Sciascia, a Sicilian-born capo {{linked to}} the Montreal Rizzuto crime family, {{arranged}} a meeting at a Brooklyn social club with the three capos for May 5, 1981. They had four gunmen, including Vitale and Bonanno-affiliated Montreal boss Vito Rizzuto, hiding in a closet to ambush them. When Trinchera, Giaccone and Indelicato arrived with Frank Lino to meet Massino they were shot to death, with Massino himself stopping Indelicato from escaping. Lino escaped unscathed by running <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The hit further improved Massino's prestige, but was marred by both Lino's escape and the discovery of Indelicato's body on May 20.|$|E

5|$|After {{a tour of}} the home, {{the girls}} leave the {{watermelon}} in a well to keep it cold. Mac later goes to retrieve the watermelon and does not return.

The aunt disappears after entering the broken refrigerator, and the girls are attacked or possessed by a series of items in the house, such as Gorgeous becoming possessed after using her aunt's mirror and Sweet disappearing after being attacked by mattresses. These attacks cause the girls to try to escape the house. As soon as Gorgeous walks <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> the rest of the girls find themselves locked in.

Pascal and Maximus encounter several obstacles and hindrances in their attempt, eventually crashing into a tar factor upon retrieving the rings from a flock of flying doves.

5|$|The first {{match that}} aired {{was for the}} WWE Intercontinental Championship in a Steel cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring. Jeff Hardy was {{defending}} the title against Johnny Nitro. The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs {{off the top of the}} cage. Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled Nitro from the top of the cage and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but Nitro put his foot on the bottom rope. Nitro then made it over the cage, but just as Nitro was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked the door open, and Nitro fell onto the top of the door, paining him between his legs. As Nitro was on top of the door, Hardy kicked the cage door, and walked <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

25|$|Manager Billy Kirkwood {{continued}} {{to rebuild the}} team over the close season, bringing in Motherwell defender Rab Shannon, Rangers keeper Ally Maxwell and Neil Caldwell, also from Ibrox. Another two ex-Rangers players arrived {{before the start of}} the season, with Steven Pressley and Sandy Robertson both arriving from Coventry City.

25|$|One {{of those}} 'big names' {{listening}} was Bruce Flohr, a top-level A rep for RCA Records and newly established ATO Records (known for introducing David Gray to American audiences). Upon meeting Jem, {{and listening to}} more of her demos, Flohr recalled thinking 'How do I not let this girl <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> without signing her?'. ATO Records quickly made the unanimous decision to offer her a recording contract. At that time {{there was no other}} label interest in her because her status as a studio only artist meant that she flew under the radar of most A She was subsequently signed to the label and on 13 October 2003 in preparation for the release of the full-length album, ATO released an extended play entitled, It All Starts Here..., consisting of five adapted demos that Jem had initially recorded. In anticipation of the album release, Jem also relocated to Los Angeles, where she felt there was more opportunity for her to promote her work and explore her musical potential.|$|E
25|$|Lisa shows Homer {{her school}} science project, a robot named Linguo, who corrects grammar. Homer breaks it by pouring beer down its throat, and Lisa runs upstairs frustrated. Meanwhile, Marge accidentally severs Homer's thumb {{as she is}} cutting brownies. They drive to the hospital, but Dr. Hibbert claims that the {{insurance}} will not cover the cost, so they instead drive off for Dr. Nick's clinic. Since Homer's thumb is starting to shrivel up, he stops by at Moe's, where he gets a pickle brine solution. He gets distracted when Moe offers him a beer. Homer rushes <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and sees Marge is gone. He hitchhikes with Cletus who drives him to Dr. Nick's, but they discover the clinic is on fire. Homer asks Cletus to drive him to Shelbyville Hospital, but his truck gets stolen and Homer leaves for the hospital on foot. His thumb is almost completely shrivelled up now, and he is just about to throw it away when an explosion sends Linguo's severed head flying {{up into the air}} and it lands next to him.|$|E
25|$|The troop carrier {{pilots in}} their remembrances and {{histories}} admitted to many errors in {{execution of the}} drops but denied the aspersions on their character, citing the many factors since enumerated and faulty planning assumptions. Some, such as Martin Wolfe, an enlisted radio operator with the 436th TCG, pointed out that some late drops were caused by the paratroopers, who were struggling to get their equipment <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> until their aircraft had flown by the drop zone by several miles. Others mistook drops made ahead of theirs for their own drop zones and insisted on going early. The TCC personnel {{also pointed out that}} anxiety at being new to combat was not confined to USAAF crews. Warren reported that official histories showed 9 paratroopers had refused to jump and at least 35 other uninjured paratroopers were returned to England aboard C-47s. General Gavin reported that many paratroopers were in a daze after the drop, huddling in ditches and hedgerows until prodded into action by veterans. Wolfe noted that although his group had botched the delivery of some units in the night drop, it flew a second, daylight mission on D-Day and performed flawlessly although under heavy ground fire from alerted Germans.|$|E
