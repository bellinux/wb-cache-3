5|$|The 28th Massachusetts Infantry {{regiment}} was {{the second}} primarily Irish American volunteer infantry regiment recruited in Massachusetts for service in the American Civil War. The regiment's motto (<b>or</b> <b>cry)</b> was Faugh a Ballagh (Clear the Way!). 28th Massachusetts {{was assigned to the}} II Corps as the fourth regiment of the famed Irish Brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas Francis Meagher. The Irishmen of the 28th Massachusetts saw action in most of the Union Army's major eastern theatre engagements – Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Overland Campaign, and the siege of Petersburg – and were present for Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House.|$|E
5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur <b>or</b> <b>cry</b> amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – I never saw any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E

In late August Katipuneros gathered in Caloocan and declared the start of the revolution. The event is now known as the Cry of Balintawak <b>or</b> <b>Cry</b> of Pugad Lawin, due to conflicting historical traditions and official government positions.|$|E

25|$|However, in {{some other}} patients, the {{character}} of the emotional display can be incongruent with, and even contradictory to, the emotional valence of the provoking stimulus or may be incited by a stimulus with no clear valence. For example, a patient may laugh in response to sad news <b>or</b> <b>cry</b> in response to stimuli with no emotional undertone, or, once provoked, the episodes may switch from laughing to crying or vice versa.|$|E
25|$|During negotiations, anger {{disrupts}} {{the process by}} reducing the level of trust, clouding parties' judgment, narrowing parties' focus of attention and changing their central goal from reaching agreement to retaliating against the other side. Angry negotiators pay less attention to opponent's interests and are less accurate in judging their interests, thus achieve lower joint gains. Moreover, because anger makes negotiators more self-centered in their preferences, it {{increases the likelihood that}} they will reject profitable offers. Opponents who get really angry (<b>or</b> <b>cry,</b> or otherwise lose control) are more likely to make errors: make sure they are in your favor.|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} screenplay, Hirani and Joshi stayed {{together}} {{for more than}} four months. They developed scenes by going out for a walk and discussing the scene. They would not return home until they had created a scene that would make them laugh, <b>or</b> <b>cry,</b> or had some provocative thought. While there was a shortage of resources during the shooting of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S., the crew did not encounter a financial crisis during the filming of Lage Raho Munna Bhai, as the team managed to receive whatever was deemed necessary (including a Jimmy Jib, a specific kind of camera crane, just for a single crane shot). The film was shot on location in and around Mumbai, with Goa as a backdrop for the [...] "Aane Charaane" [...] song.|$|E

2500|$|The general {{theme that}} the band {{requested}} for the video {{was one of}} sociality and reflecting current society. As [...] "Endless" [...] was a non-single song, the band wanted a video that would express the entire Documentaly album. Shiga took inspiration directly from the song's lyrics, wanting to express the lyrical theme of one statement {{being able to make}} different people laugh <b>or</b> <b>cry.</b> He took inspiration from the [...] "sad people" [...] lyric to create the eyeball costumes worn by the band, and used the facial masks to make the members anonymous, so that the lyrics would be interpreted as applying to anyone.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the drive}} back to Portsea, Holt {{suggested}} that the group stop at Cheviot Beach for a swim – it was about 12:15 p.m., {{and he wanted to}} cool down and work up an appetite before lunch. He knew the area well and had swum there many times before, in 1960 even salvaging a porthole from the SS Cheviot, the shipwreck that had given the beach its name. Holt did not hesitate in entering the water, despite a large swell and visible currents and eddies. Alan Stewart was the only other swimmer, as the others considered it unsafe. Stewart stayed close to shore, and even in the shallows felt a strong undertow. However, Holt swam into deeper water and was dragged out to sea. The others called out to him, but he did not raise his arms <b>or</b> <b>cry</b> for help. He soon slipped under the waves and out of sight, in a manner which Marjorie Gillespie described as [...] "like a leaf being taken out [...] so quick and final".|$|E
2500|$|The {{seven other}} murder charges {{are all of}} first degree murder; they relate to babies, whom staff have testified they saw move <b>or</b> <b>cry</b> after {{complete}} birth, and whose deaths are alleged to have resulted from subsequent lethal action. They arise because of the [...] "born alive rule", a principle of common law which stipulates that by default, for legal purposes, personhood arises – and therefore unlawful killing constituting murder becomes possible – immediately upon the victim's being born alive (several US {{states as well as}} Federal legislation have more specific laws to protect fetuses and newborn babies; see fetal rights and born alive laws in the United States). Steven Massof, a clinic employee who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2011, testified that he (Massof) had snipped the spines of more than 100 infants after they had been born alive, and that this was considered [...] "standard procedure" [...] at the clinic; a number of other employees had also testified to the same point. No physical evidence exists for five of the seven cases — charges are based on staff testimony and denied by Gosnell. A photograph exists of the sixth, who allegedly had a gestational age of 30 weeks, and the physical remains were obtained of the seventh. The Grand Jury report states that [...] "A medical expert with 43 years of experience in performing abortions was appalled. This expert told us, 'I’ve never heard of it [...] being done during an abortion'." ...|$|E

2500|$|There were {{echoes of}} Jonathan Edwards in both McGready’s {{theology}} {{and in the}} language he used in his sermons. [...] Although he was ecumenical in his invitation to Methodists and others, with whom he disagreed on theological matters, to assist him in revivals. [...] McGready was an unapologetic Calvinist. [...] He believed that only the irresistible grace of God could enable the faith necessary for conversion, and that sinful man was devoid of the capacity to effect, or choose his own salvation. [...] McGready believed he was acting on a solemn charge to shine the light of truth on man’s desperate spiritual condition, that judgment awaited, and was possibly imminent: [...] “The ungodly and finally impenitent will now be ripe for destruction…they shall reap a harvest of immortal woe….This is, indeed, the solemn, dreadful harvest day; the tares are separated from the wheat, and… cast into everlasting fire." [...] Conversion, then, was not a mere moral readjustment, but a cataclysmic recreation of a spirit corrupted by sin. [...] In this context, McGready, like Edwards, saw dramatic conversion experiences that caused people to swoon <b>or</b> <b>cry</b> out as the physical manifestation of unseen spiritual activity. McGready’s focus on the need of the people for regeneration was not reserved for overt sinners, but also for church members who relied on exhibiting a moral life {{and knowledge of the}} Westminster catechism, but had not experienced a saving change. [...] To McGready, all such people were in need of conversion. [...] He regarded the participation in the sacrament without evidence of heart-felt regeneration as a serious hypocrisy, telling his congregation that “an unworthy communicant …is more offensive to Almighty God than a loathsome carcass crawling with vermin." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Skywhales design {{received}} a mixed reception after the balloon was unveiled on 9 May 2013. Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister Katy Gallagher {{said that her}} eyes [...] "nearly fell out of her head" [...] when she first saw a diagram of The Skywhales design, but {{she had come to}} like it and believed that it would challenge the perception of Canberra as a boring city. She also stated that [...] "There will be people in the community who think it's a great achievement to have won a commission like this in the ACT and have it as a symbol of our centenary and those who won't see it as value for money". The leader of the opposition in the ACT, Jeremy Hanson, was critical of The Skywhale stating that [...] "I really don't know whether to laugh <b>or</b> <b>cry</b> ... it's an embarrassing indulgence only a fourth term government would contemplate". Public views of the design, as expressed on social media and talkback radio, were also mixed. Much of the public criticism has been focused on the five breasts which hang from each side of the balloon, with a Twitter user calling it [...] "terrifyingly nipply". The director of the Canberra Museum and Gallery wrote an opinion article praising The Skywhale, arguing that the strength of the design [...] "arises from how it concentrates the wonder, awe and mystery we experience in nature, with an urgent insistence on social engagement". The Canberra Times' art critic Kerry-Anne Cousins complemented the boldness of the design, and stated that [...] "I think it's a mark of the sophistication of Canberra that we can have this kind of debate". In response to the criticism of the balloon's design, Piccinini has stated that it wasn't intended to be sexual and the breasts represent how female whales feed their calves. She also believes that The Skywhale is likely to win greater support once Canberrans see it in person.|$|E
