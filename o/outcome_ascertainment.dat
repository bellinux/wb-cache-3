40|$|Implementation {{of simple}} {{telehealth}} to manage hypertension in general practice: a service evaluation Elizabeth Cottrell 1 *, Tracey Cox 2, Phil O’Connell 2 and Ruth Chambers 3 Background: Hypertension is common and conveys significant risk of morbidity and mortality. However, inadequate control of hypertension is common. Following a successful local {{use of a}} simple telehealth intervention (‘Florence’) for the diagnosis and management of hypertension, the Advice & Interactive Messaging (AIM) for Health simple telehealth programme was launched across England in March 2013. Four protocols were developed to diagnose and monitor blood pressure (BP). The aim of this service evaluation was to identify {{the extent to which}} predefined service <b>outcomes,</b> regarding <b>ascertainment</b> of a diagnosis of hypertension, and achievement of hypertension control, were met for the hypertension protocols.

40|$|Adverse drug {{events are}} a {{leading cause of}} {{emergency}} department visits and unplanned admissions, and prolong hospital stays. Medication review interventions aim to identify adverse drug events and optimize medication use. Previous evaluations of in-hospital medication reviews have focused on interventions at discharge, with an unclear effect on health outcomes. We assessed the effect of early in-hospital pharmacist-led medication review on the health outcomes of high-risk patients. We used a quasi-randomized design to evaluate a quality improvement project in three hospitals in British Columbia, Canada. We incorporated a clinical decision rule into emergency department triage pathways, allowing nurses to identify patients at high-risk for adverse drug events. After randomly selecting the first eligible patient for participation, clinical pharmacists systematically allocated subsequent high-risk patients to medication review or usual care. Medication review included obtaining a best possible medication history and reviewing the patient's medications for appropriateness and adverse drug events. The primary outcome was the number of days spent in-hospital over 30 days, and was ascertained using administrative data. We used median and inverse propensity score weighted logistic regression modeling to determine the effect of pharmacist-led medication review on downstream health services use. Of 10, 807 high-risk patients, 6, 416 received early pharmacist-led medication review and 4, 391 usual care. Their baseline characteristics were balanced. The median number of hospital days was reduced by 0. 48 days (95 % confidence intervals [CI] = 0. 00 to 0. 96; p = 0. 058) in the medication review group compared to usual care, representing an 8 % reduction in the median length of stay. Among patients under 80 years of age, the median number of hospital days was reduced by 0. 60 days (95 % CI = 0. 06 to 1. 17; p = 0. 03), representing 11 % reduction in the median length of stay. There was no significant effect on emergency department revisits, admissions, readmissions, or mortality. We were limited by our inability to conduct a randomized controlled trial, but used quasi-random patient allocation methods and propensity score modeling to ensure balance between treatment groups, and administrative data to ensure blinded <b>outcomes</b> <b>ascertainment.</b> We were unable to account for alternate level of care days, and therefore, may have underestimated the treatment effect in frail elderly patients who are likely to remain in hospital while awaiting long-term care. Early pharmacist-led medication review was associated with reduced hospital-bed utilization compared to usual care among high-risk patients under 80 years of age, but not among those who were older. The results of our evaluation suggest that medication review by pharmacists in the emergency department may impact the length of hospital stay in select patient populations...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Large-scale {{disasters}} may disrupt {{health surveillance}} systems, depriving health officials and researchers of timely and accurate {{information needed to}} assess disaster-related health effects and leading to use of less reliable self-reports of health <b>outcomes.</b> In particular, <b>ascertainment</b> of cancer in a population is ordinarily obtained through linkage of self-reported data with regional cancer registries, but exclusive reliance on these sources following a disaster may result in lengthy delays or loss of critical data. To {{assess the impact of}} such reliance, we validated self-reported cancer in a cohort of 59, 340 responders and survivors of the World Trade Center disaster against data from 11 state cancer registries (SCRs). Methods. We focused on residents of the 11 states with SCRs and on cancers diagnosed from September 11, 2001, to the date of their last survey participation. Medical records were also sought in a subset of 595 self-reported cancer patients who were not recorded in an SCR. Results. Overall sensitivity and specificity of self-reported cancer were 83. 9 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 81. 9, 85. 9) and 98. 5 % (95 % CI 98. 4, 98. 6), respectively. Site-specific sensitivities were highest for pancreatic (90. 9 %) and testicular (82. 4 %) cancers and multiple myeloma (84. 6 %). Compared with enrollees with true-positive reports, enrollees with false-negative reports {{were more likely to be}} non-Hispanic black (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5 1. 8, 95 % CI 1. 2, 2. 9) or Asian (aOR 52. 2, 95 % CI 1. 2, 4. 1). Among the 595 cases not recorded in an SCR, 13 of 62 (21 %) cases confirmed through medical records were reportable to SCRs. Conclusion. Self-report of cancer had relatively high sensitivity among adults exposed to the World Trade Center disaster, suggesting that self-reports of other disaster-related conditions less amenable to external validation may also be reasonably valid...|$|R
40|$|Loss to {{follow-up}} (LTFU) is {{a common}} problem in many epidemiological studies. In antiretroviral treatment (ART) programs for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), mortality estimates can be biased if the LTFU mechanism is non-ignorable, that is, mortality differs between lost and retained patients. In this setting, routine procedures for handling missing data may lead to biased estimates. To appropriately deal with non-ignorable LTFU, explicit modeling of the missing data mechanism is needed. This can be based on additional <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> for a sample of patients LTFU, for example, through linkage to national registries or through survey-based methods. In this paper, we demonstrate how this additional information {{can be used to}} construct estimators based on inverse probability weights (IPW) or multiple imputation. We use simulations to contrast the performance of the proposed estimators with methods widely used in HIV cohort research for dealing with missing data. The practical implications of our approach are illustrated using South African ART data, which are partially linkable to South African national vital registration data. Our results demonstrate that while IPWs and proper imputation procedures can be easily constructed from additional <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> to obtain valid overall estimates, neglecting non-ignorable LTFU can result in substantial bias. We believe the proposed estimators are readily applicable to a growing number of studies where LTFU is appreciable, but additional outcome data are available through linkage or surveys of patients LTFU.

40|$|The {{human health}} risk {{associated}} with exposure to pesticide formulations applied to New Brunswick forests was examined for 31 sites of cancer, using measures of exposure based on the proximity of non-city population centers to spray areas. Two organochlorine and two organophosphate exposure indices were developed by using maps of areas sprayed each year during the period 1952 to 1976. These data were analyzed in relation to cancer incidence rates during the period 1977 -l 980 for 254 New Brunswick municipalities. Follow-up case-control studies of the cancer sites considered {{does not seem to}} be a matter of high priority at present.

40|$|With a birth {{prevalence}} of 1 in 1000, neural tube defects (NTD) s contribute considerably to morbidity and healthcare costs. Known genetic and environmental (non-inherited) {{risk factors for}} NTDs account for {{a small portion of}} risk, suggesting unidentified risk factors. In animal studies, maternal alcohol and pesticide exposures, independently, led to excess neural cell death, resulting in too few cells for neural tube closure. Human studies report no association between alcohol exposure and NTDs, but small to moderate positive associations for pesticide exposure. Such human etiologic studies of NTDs require a large base population, but frequently include only live births. Exclusion of cases by pregnancy <b>outcomes</b> may create <b>ascertainment</b> and response bias, complicating interpretation of findings. Using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) and the Iowa Registry for Congenital and Inherited Disorders (IRCID), the independent effects of maternal periconceptional (1 month prior through 2 months postconception) alcohol and occupational pesticide exposure on the development of NTDs were examined, and differences in Iowa NTD cases were characterized by pregnancy outcome. Maternal reports of alcohol exposure were obtained for 1223 NTD case infants and 6807 control infants. Adjusted odds ratios, estimated using multivariate logistic regression, were near unity for NTDs by any maternal alcohol exposure, binge episode(s), and type(s) of alcohol consumed. Occupational pesticide exposure was assigned by industrial hygienists for mothers of 502 case and 2950 control infants. Adjusted odds ratios for any exposure and cumulative exposure to any pesticide, insecticides only, and insecticides + herbicides + fungicides were near unity for NTDs. Insecticide + herbicide exposure was positively associated with spina bifida. Among the 279 Iowa NTD case infants ascertained by the IRCID, 167 live births and 112 were other pregnancy outcomes (fetal deaths and elective terminations), which increased in proportion over time. Selected infant and maternal characteristics of live births and other pregnancy outcomes were similar. NBDPS eligibility varied significantly by pregnancy outcome, but participation rates did not. NTD case mothers were similar to Iowa NBDPS control mothers. Efforts were made to improve upon prior etiologic studies of these exposures and NTDs, including increased sample size and improved exposure specificity. Some exposure strata (e. g., herbicides only) and outcome strata (e. g., other rare subtypes) were limited by small numbers. All results may have been affected by response and ascertainment bias. Future studies should aim to use similarly detailed exposure classification methods, increase sample size in less prevalent NTD subtypes, and improve ascertainment of fetal deaths...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundGastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) {{is said to}} be the {{causative factor}} in up to 41 % of adults with chronic cough. However cough and GORD are common ailments and their co-existence by chance is high. Also cough can induce reflux episodes. Treatment for GORD {{includes}} conservative measures (diet manipulation), pharmaceutical therapy (motility or prokinetic agents, H 2 -antagonist and proton pump inhibitors (PPI)) and fundoplication. ObjectivesTo evaluate the efficacy of GORD treatment on chronic cough in children and adults with GORD and prolonged cough that is not related to an underlying respiratory disease i. e. non-specific chronic cough. Search strategyWe searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The date of last search was 24 th April 2009. Selection criteriaAll randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on GORD treatment for cough in children and adults without primary lung disease. Data collection and analysisTwo review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted. Study authors were contacted for further information. Main resultsEighteen studies (5 paediatric, 13 adults) were included. None of the paediatric studies could be included in meta-analysis. In adults, analysis on use of H 2 antagonist, motility agents and conservative treatment for GORD were not possible (from lack of data) and there were no controlled studies on fundoplication as an intervention. Nine adult studies comparing PPI (two to three months) to placebo were analysed for various outcomes in themeta-analysis. Enrolment of participants subjects for two studies were primarily frommedical clinics and another eight studies were otolaryngology clinic patients or patients with laryngeal symptoms. Using “intention to treat”, pooled data from studies resulted in no significant difference between treatment and placebo in total resolution of cough, Odds Ratio 0. 46 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 19 to 1. 15). Pooled data revealed no overall significant improvement in cough outcomes (end of trial or change in cough scores). Significant differences were only found in sensitivity analyses. A significant improvement in change of cough scores was found in end of intervention (two to three months) in those receiving PPI with a standardised mean difference of - 0. 41 (95 % CI - 0. 75 to - 0. 07) using generic inverse variance analysis on cross over trials. Two studies reported improvement in cough after five days to two weeks of treatment. Authors’ conclusionsThere is insufficient evidence to definitely conclude that GORD treatment with PPI is universally beneficial for cough associated with GORDin adults. The beneficial effect was only seen in sub-analysis. The optimal duration of such a trial of therapy to evaluate response could not be ascertained although two RCTs reported significant change by 2 -weeks of therapy. Clinicians should be cognisant of a period (natural resolution with time) and placebo effect in studies that utilise cough as an outcome measure. Future paediatric and adult studies should be double blind, randomised controlled, parallel design, using treatments for at least two months, with validated subjective and objective cough <b>outcomes</b> and include <b>ascertainment</b> of time to respond as well as assessment of acid and/or non-acid reflux...|$|R

First, {{to the best}} of our knowledge, ours is the first study to have examined the longitudinal adherence-effects of an exercise-music strategy within a structured exercise program. Until now, the vast majority of studies exploring the effects of music in exercise have been cross-sectional in design and/or narrow in <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment,</b> with most studies limited to ergonomic and/or perceptual outcomes [8 - 16, 44 - 46]. Second, we employed a novel integrated audio-playlist strategy where patient preferences informed the choices of musical genres and artists but where exercise pace restricted the playlist selection to those songs whose music tempos approximated individuals’ program-prescribed steps per minute. Third, our study demonstrated that RAS-enhancements, which were designed to accentuate the auditory cues associated with tempo-pace synchrony [24, 27], were accomplished feasibly using commercially available customized playlists. Moreover, such RAS-enhanced playlists were incrementally efficacious in improving long-term physical activity behaviours. Finally, ours, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, is the first to compare the behavioural outcomes associated with a personalized music strategy against an evidence-based gold-standard usual-care control, which itself, has been associated with a 20 % improvement in long-term survival [4].|$|E
40|$|Although the {{effectiveness}} of tamoxifen in prevent-ing the recurrence of breast cancer is well estab-lished, associations between tamoxifen and the occurrence of atherosclerotic events are not as clear. Breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen have lower serum cholesterol and other lipid levels than those not taking tamoxifen, suggesting that tamoxifen might prevent atherosclerotic events, but the existing studies are conflicting. We examined the relation between tamoxifen and incident hospitalization of angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke. The study population of 16, 289 women was identified from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group nationwide clinical database and includes women diagnosed with stage I or II estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer between 1990 and 2004 at ages 45 to 69.

40|$|Abstract Background Hypertriglyceridemia may be {{associated}} with important complications. The aim {{of this study is to}} estimate the magnitude of association and quality of supporting evidence linking hypertriglyceridemia to cardiovascular events and pancreatitis. Methods We conducted a systematic review of multiple electronic bibliographic databases and subsequent meta-analysis using a random effects model. Studies eligible for this review followed patients longitudinally and evaluated quantitatively the association of fasting hypertriglyceridemia with the outcomes of interest. Reviewers working independently and in duplicate reviewed studies and extracted data. Results 35 studies provided data sufficient for meta-analysis. The quality of these observational studies was moderate to low with fair level of multivariable adjustments and adequate exposure and <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment.</b> Fasting hypertriglyceridemia was significantly associated with cardiovascular death (odds ratios (OR) 1. 80; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 31 - 2. 49), cardiovascular events (OR, 1. 37; 95 % CI, 1. 23 - 1. 53), myocardial infarction (OR, 1. 31; 95 % CI, 1. 15 - 1. 49), and pancreatitis (OR, 3. 96; 95 % CI, 1. 27 - 12. 34, in one study only). The association with all-cause mortality was not statistically significant.

40|$|Objective: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} literature regarding the prevalence, preventability, severity {{and types of}} adverse events (AE) in the Emergency Department (ED). Methods: We systematically searched major bibliographic databases, relevant journals and conference proceedings, and completed reference reviews of primary articles. Observational studies (cohort and case-control), quasi-experimental (e. g. before/after) studies and randomized controlled trials, were considered for inclusion if they examined a broad demographic group reflecting {{a significant proportion of}} ED patients and described the proportion of AE. Studies conducted outside of the ED setting, those examining only a subpopulation of patients (e. g. a specific entrance complaint or receiving a specific intervention), or examining only adverse drug events, were excluded.

HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy interact with NCD risk factors in complex ways, and research into this "web of causation" has so far been largely based on data from high-income countries. However, improving the understanding, treatment, and prevention of NCDs in LMICs requires region-specific evidence. Priority research areas include: (1) defining the burden of NCDs among people living with HIV, (2) understanding the impact of modifiable risk factors, (3) evaluating effective and efficient care strategies at individual and health systems levels, and (4) evaluating cost-effective prevention strategies. Meeting these needs will require observational data, both to inform the design of randomized trials and to replace trials that would be unethical or infeasible. Focusing on Sub-Saharan Africa, we discuss data resources currently available to inform this effort and consider key limitations and methodological challenges. Existing data resources often lack population-based samples; HIV-negative, HIV-positive, and antiretroviral therapy-naive comparison groups; and measurements of key NCD risk factors and outcomes.

Methods and Results—The investigation was a prospective cohort study of adult patients not in cardiac arrest for whom dispatchers provided CPR instructions in King County, Washington, between June 1, 2004, and January 31, 2007. The study focused on those who received chest compressions. Information was collected through review of the audio and written dispatch report, written emergency medical services report, hospital record, and telephone survey. Of the 1700 patients for whom dispatcher CPR instructions were initiated, 55 % (938 of 1700) were in arrest, 45 % (762 of 1700) were not in arrest, and 18 % (313 of 1700) were not in arrest and received bystander chest compressions. Of the 247 not in arrest who received chest compressions and had complete <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment,</b> 12 % (29 of 247) experienced discomfort, and 2 % (6 of 247) sustained injuries likely or possibly caused by bystander CPR. Only 2 % (5 of 247) suffered a fracture, and no patients suffered visceral organ injury. Conclusions—In this prospective study, the frequency of serious injury related to dispatcher-assisted bystander CPR among nonarrest patients was low. When coupled with the established benefits of bystander CPR among those wit...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} effect of peer support on {{duration}} of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials were searched from inception to April 2012. Two authors independently searched, reviewed, and assessed the quality of randomized controlled trials utilizing peer support in LMICs. Meta-analysis and metaregression techniques were used to produce pooled relative risks and investigate sources of heterogeneity in the estimates. Eleven randomized controlled trials conducted at 13 study sites met the inclusion criteria for systematic review. We noted significant differences in study populations, peer counselor training methods, peer visit schedule, and <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> methods. Peer support significantly decreased the risk of discontinuing EBF as compared to control (RR: 0. 71; 95 % CI: 0. 61 - 0. 82; I(2)  = 92 %). The effect of peer support was significantly reduced in settings with > 10 % community prevalence of formula feeding as compared to settings with < 10 % prevalence (p= 0. 048). There was no evidence of effect modification by inclusion of low birth weight infants (p= 0. 367) and no difference in {{the effect of}} peer support on EBF at 4 versus 6 months postpartum (p= 0. 398). Peer support increases the duration of EBF in LMICs; however, the effect appears to be reduced in formula feeding cultures. Future studies are needed to determine the optimal timing of peer visits, how to best integrate peer support into packaged intervention strategies, and the effectiveness of supplemental interventions to peer support in formula feeding cultures...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Soil-transmitted {{helminth}} {{infections are}} endemic in 114 countries worldwide, and cause the highest {{burden of disease}} among all neglected tropical diseases. The WHO includes women of reproductive age as a high-risk group for infection. The primary consequence of infection in this population is anaemia. During lactation, anaemia may contribute to reduced {{quality and quantity of}} milk, decreasing the duration of exclusive breastfeeding and lowering the age at weaning. To date, no study has investigated the effects of maternal postpartum deworming on infant or maternal health outcomes. Methods and analysis: A single-centre, parallel, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial will be carried out in Iquitos, Peru, to assess the effectiveness of integrating single-dose 400 mg albendazole into routine maternal postpartum care. A total of 1010 mother-infant pairs will be randomised to either the intervention or control arm, following inhospital delivery and prior to discharge. Participants will be visited in their homes at 1, 6, 12 and 24 months following delivery for <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment.</b> The primary outcome is infant mean weight gain between birth and 6 months of age. Secondary outcomes include other infant growth indicators and morbidity, maternal soil-transmitted helminth infection and intensity, anaemia, fatigue, and breastfeeding practices. All statistical analyses will be performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Ethics and dissemination: Research ethics board approval has been obtained from the McGill University Health Centre (Canada), the Asociacion Civil Impacta Salud y Educacion (Peru) and the Instituto Nacional de Salud (Peru). A data safety and monitoring committee is in place to oversee study progression and evaluate adverse events. The results of the analyses will be published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented at national and international conferences...|$|E
40|$|To {{systematically}} {{review the}} literature regarding the prevalence, preventability, severity {{and types of}} adverse events (AE) in the Emergency Department (ED). We systematically searched major bibliographic databases, relevant journals and conference proceedings, and completed reference reviews of primary articles. Observational studies (cohort and case-control), quasi-experimental (e. g. before/after) studies and randomized controlled trials, were considered for inclusion if they examined a broad demographic group reflecting {{a significant proportion of}} ED patients and described the proportion of AE. Studies conducted outside of the ED setting, those examining only a subpopulation of patients (e. g. a specific entrance complaint or receiving a specific intervention), or examining only adverse drug events, were excluded. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility, completed data extraction, and assessed study quality with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Our search identified 11, 624 citations. Ten articles, representing eight observational studies, were included. Methodological quality was low to moderate with weaknesses in study group comparability, follow-up, and <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> and reporting. There was substantial variation in the proportion of patients with AE related to ED care, ranging from 0. 16 % (n =  9308) to 6. 0 % (n =  399). Similarly, the reported preventability of AE ranged from 36 % (n =  250) to 71 % (n =  24). The most common types of events were related to management (3 studies), diagnosis (2 studies) and medication (2 studies). The variability in findings and lack of high quality studies on AE in the high risk ED setting highlights the need for research in this area. Further studies with rigorous, standardized outcome assessment and reporting are required...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} {{randomised}} controlled trial evaluation of an intensive one-to-one numeracy programme – Numbers Count – which formed part of the previous government's numeracy policy intervention – Every Child Counts. We rigorously designed and conducted the trial to CONSORT guidelines. We used a pragmatic waiting list design to evaluate the intervention in real life settings in diverse geographical areas across England, to increase the ecological validity of the results. Children were randomly allocated within schools to either the intervention (Numbers Count in addition to normal classroom practice) or the control group (normal classroom practice alone). The primary outcome assessment was the Progress in Maths (PIM) 6 test from GL Assessment. Independent administration ensured that <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> was undertaken blind to group allocation. The secondary outcome measure was the Sandwell test, which was not undertaken and marked blind to group allocation. At post-test the effect size (standardised mean difference between intervention and control group) on the PIM 6 was d = 0. 33 95 % confidence intervals [0. 12, 0. 53], indicating strong evidence of {{a difference between the}} two groups. The effect size for the secondary outcome (Sandwell test) was d = 1. 11 95 % CI [0. 91, 1. 31]. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant effect of Numbers Count on our primary, independently marked, mathematics test. Like many trials, our study had both strengths and limitations. We feel, however, due to our a priori decision to report these in an explicit manner, as advocated by the CONSORT guidelines, that we could maximise rigour (e. g., by using blinded independent testing) and report potential problems (e. g., attrition rates). We have demonstrated that it is feasible to conduct an educational trial using the rigorous methodological techniques required by the CONSORT statement...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Reports from Africa have {{suggested}} that pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is a less important cause of morbidity than in the developed world. However, more {{recent studies have shown}} high seroprevalence rates of P. jirovecii in healthy individuals with HIV as well as high rates of clinical disease in African children. This suggests that PCP may be more common in Africa than was previously recognised. Understanding the contribution of PCP to disease in HIV-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has important implications for diagnosis, management and resource allocation. We therefore propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to investigate the burden of PCP in this population. METHODS AND DESIGN:We plan to search electronic databases and reference lists of relevant articles published from 1995 to May 2013 using broad terms for pneumocystis, HIV/AIDS and sub-Saharan Africa. Studies will be included if they provide clear diagnostic criteria for PCP and well-defined study populations or mortality data (denominator). A novel quality score assessment tool has been developed to ensure fidelity to inclusion criteria, minimise risk of selection bias between reviewers and to assess quality of <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment.</b> This will be applied to eligible full-text articles. We will extract data using a standardised form and perform descriptive and quantitative analysis to assess PCP prevalence, mortality and case fatality, as well as the quality of included studies. This review protocol has been published in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of systematic reviews, registration number CRD 42013005530. DISCUSSION:Our planned review will contribute to the diagnosis and management of community-acquired pneumonia in HIV-infected individuals in SSA by systematically assessing the burden of PCP in this population. We also describe a novel quality assessment tool that may be applied to other prevalence reviews...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPost-licensure {{real world}} {{evaluation}} of vaccine implementation {{is important for}} establishing evidence of vaccine effectiveness (VE) and programme impact, including indirect effects. Large cohort studies offer an important epidemiological approach for evaluating VE, but have inherent methodological challenges. Since March 2012, we have conducted an open prospective cohort study in two sites in rural Malawi to evaluate the post-introduction effectiveness of 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 13) against all-cause post-neonatal infant mortality and monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV 1) against diarrhoea-related post-neonatal infant mortality. Our study sites cover a population of 500, 000, with a baseline post-neonatal infant mortality of 25 per 1000 live births. We conducted a methodological review of cohort studies for vaccine effectiveness in a developing country setting, applied to our study context. Based on published literature, we outline key considerations when defining the denominator (study population), exposure (vaccination status) and <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> (mortality and cause of death) of such studies. We assess various definitions in these three domains, {{in terms of their}} impact on power, effect size and potential biases and their direction, using our cohort study for illustration. Based on this iterative process, we discuss {{the pros and cons of}} our final per-protocol analysis plan. Since no single set of definitions or analytical approach accounts for all possible biases, we propose sensitivity analyses to interrogate our assumptions and methodological decisions. In the poorest regions of the world where routine vital birth and death surveillance are frequently unavailable and the burden of disease and death is greatest We conclude that provided the balance between definitions and their overall assumed impact on estimated VE are acknowledged, such large scale real-world cohort studies can provide crucial information to policymakers by providing robust and compelling evidence of total benefits of newly introduced vaccines on reducing child mortality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Linking {{population}} health data to pathology data is a {{new approach}} {{for the evaluation of}} predictive tests that is potentially more efficient, feasible and efficacious than current methods. Studies evaluating the use of first trimester maternal serum levels as predictors of complications in pregnancy have mostly relied on resource intensive methods such as prospective data collection or retrospective chart review. The aim of this pilot study is to demonstrate that record-linkage between a pathology database and routinely collected population health data sets provides follow-up on patient outcomes that is as effective as more traditional and resource-intensive methods. As a specific example, we evaluate maternal serum levels of PAPP-A and free β -hCG as predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and compare our results with those of prospective studies. Methods Maternal serum levels of PAPP-A and free β -hCG for 1882 women randomly selected from a pathology database in New South Wales (NSW) were linked to routinely collected birth and hospital databases. Crude relative risks were calculated to investigate the association between low levels (multiples of the median ≤ 5 th percentile) of PAPP-A or free β -hCG and the outcomes of preterm delivery (th percentile), fetal loss and stillbirth. Results Using only full name, sex and date of birth for record linkage, pregnancy outcomes were available for 1681 (89. 3 %) of women included in the study. Low levels of PAPP-A had a stronger association with adverse pregnancy outcomes than a low level of free β -hCG which is consistent with results in published studies. The relative risk of having a preterm birth with a low maternal serum PAPP-A level was 3. 44 (95 % CI 1. 96 – 6. 10) and a low free β -hCG level was 1. 31 (95 % CI 0. 55 – 6. 16). Conclusion This study provides data to support the use of record linkage for <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> in studies evaluating predictive tests. Linkage proportions are likely to increase if more personal identifiers are available. This method of follow-up is a cost-efficient technique and can now be applied to a larger cohort of women. </p...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{quantify}} the mortality rates associated with absent and low positive (CAC 1 to 10) coronary artery calcium (CAC). BackgroundThere is increasing interest {{in the absence of}} CAC as a “negative” cardiovascular risk factor. However, published event rates for individuals with no CAC vary, likely owing to differences in baseline risk, follow-up period, and <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment.</b> The prognostic significance of low CAC (CAC 1 to 10) is not well described. MethodsAnnualized all-cause mortality rates were assessed in 44, 052 consecutive asymptomatic patients referred for CAC testing. Mean follow-up of the cohort was 5. 6 ± 2. 6 years (range 1 to 13 years). ResultsA total of 19, 898 patients (45 %) had no CAC on screening electron beam tomography, whereas 5, 388 (12 %) had low levels of CAC (CAC 1 to 10), and 18, 766 (43 %) had CAC > 10. There were 104 deaths in those with no CAC (0. 52 %), 58 deaths in those with CAC 1 to 10 (1. 06 %), and 739 deaths in those with CAC > 10 (3. 96 %). Annualized all-cause mortality rates for CAC = 0, CAC 1 to 10, and CAC > 10 were 0. 87, 1. 92, and 7. 48 deaths/ 1, 000 person-years, respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality among CAC 1 to 10 versus CAC = 0 after adjustment for traditional risk factors was 1. 99 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 44 to 2. 75). Smoking (HR: 3. 97, 95 % CI: 2. 75 to 5. 41) and diabetes mellitus (HR: 3. 36, 95 % CI: 2. 09 to 5. 41) were associated with few events observed in CAC = 0 group. ConclusionsIn appropriately selected asymptomatic patients, the absence of CAC predicts excellent survival with 10 -year event rates of approximately 1 %. A finding of 0 CAC might be used as a rationale to emphasize lifestyle therapies rather than pharmacotherapy and to forgo repeated imaging studies. Individuals with low CAC score (CAC 1 to 10) are at increased risk above individuals with a 0 score and could be considered a distinct risk group by physicians and investigators...|$|E
40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) {{and reproductive}} coercion (RC) are key public health concerns {{for young women}} and are associated with poor sexual health outcomes. We studied 1) the pathways between IPV/RC and unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STI), 2) partner influence on use of female-controlled contraception (FCC), and 3) discordance between self-report and medical record data for pregnancy/STI and predictors of discordance. A cluster-randomized controlled trial of female family planning clinic patients (ARCHES; 16 - 24 years) and a nationally representative survey {{of women in the}} U. S. (NSFG survey; 15 - 24 years) were used. Women in the ARCHES study (n= 2, 363) self-reported IPV, RC, sexual self-efficacy, recent STI, past-year pregnancy, and past-year unintended pregnancy, at enrollment, four months, and twelve months; pregnancy and STI diagnoses were abstracted from medical records. Women in the NSFG survey (n= 2, 541) self-reported contraceptive use in the past year, whether they had stopped using a contraceptive method because a partner did not like it, and whether their partner wanted a baby but they themselves did not. In the ARCHES sample, sexual self-efficacy did not mediate the relationship between IPV and RC with unintended pregnancy and STI. In the NSFG sample, current use of FCC was low, with the majority of those on FCC using oral contraceptives. Partner influence was associated with greater current FCC use among young adults, but adolescents both with and without partner influence had poorer contraceptive use. Self-report on confidential surveys and medical record data showed poor agreement, with self-report providing higher prevalence estimates compared to medical records. Women who reported recent IPV or RC, were older, or African-American were more likely to self-report STI and pregnancies that were not in their medical records. These findings have identified multiple pathways by which partner influence, including IPV and RC, impact young women’s reproductive and sexual health, thus enabling future interventions to target these specific points. Further, best methodologies for this research field were identified. Thus, this dissertation has significant public health relevance as it informs programs to reduce disease burden due to sexual health sequelae associated with IPV/RC, and improve exposure and <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> in future research...|$|E
40|$|Background Recent {{observational}} {{studies suggest}} that the risk for stroke may be high in the first 90 days after transient ischemic attack (TIA). This finding may, however, not be consistent across existing studies assessing stroke risk after TIA. The objectives of our study were to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies estimating the risk of stroke at 2, 30, and 90 days after TIA and to explore clinical and methodological factors that may explain variability in findings across studies. Methods Articles were obtained by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1996 to present), MEDLINE (1966 to present), EMBASE (1980 to present), CINAHL (1982 to present), and BIOSIS previews (1980 to present). Searches were supplemented by scanning bibliographies of included articles, review articles, and conference proceedings and by contacting an expert in the field. Abstracts were retained if they reported original data and addressed early risk of stroke in patients with TIA. We identified 51 candidate studies reporting early risk of stroke after TIA. Two reviewers independently extracted information from 11 selected studies. Indicators of study quality were collected and included consecutive enrollment, losses to follow-up, explicit criteria used to define TIA and stroke, and method of ascertainment. Pooled early risk of stroke was estimated using fixed and random effects models, and meta-regression was used to assess the association between clinical and methodological factors and the reported early risk of stroke. Results Based on a random effects model, the pooled early risk of stroke was 3. 5 %, 8. 0 %, and 9. 2 % at 2, 30, and 90 days after TIA, respectively. Studies reported higher risks when the methodology involved active ascertainment of stroke outcome compared with passive ascertainment. Early risk of stroke was 9. 9 %, 13. 4 %, and 17. 3 % at 2, 30, and 90 days, respectively, when only studies with active <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> were considered. Conclusions Transient ischemic attack is associated with high early risk of stroke. The methodological design of studies accounts for some of the variability seen in previous reports of early stroke risk after TIA...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although {{overweight}} and obesity {{have been studied}} in relation to individual cardiometabolic diseases, their association with risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity is poorly understood. Here we aimed to establish the risk of incident cardiometabolic multimorbidity (ie, at least two from: type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke) in adults who are {{overweight and}} obese compared {{with those who are}} a healthy weight. Methods: We pooled individual-participant data for BMI and incident cardiometabolic multimorbidity from 16 prospective cohort studies from the USA and Europe. Participants included in the analyses were 35 years or older and had data available for BMI at baseline and for type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke at baseline and follow-up. We excluded participants with a diagnosis of diabetes, coronary heart disease, or stroke at or before study baseline. According to WHO recommendations, we classified BMI into categories of healthy (20 · 0 – 24 · 9 kg/m 2), overweight (25 · 0 – 29 · 9 kg/m 2), class I (mild) obesity (30 · 0 – 34 · 9 kg/m 2), and class II and III (severe) obesity (≥ 35 · 0 kg/m 2). We used an inclusive definition of underweight (< 20 kg/m 2) to achieve sufficient case numbers for analysis. The main outcome was cardiometabolic multimorbidity (ie, developing at least two from: type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke). Incident cardiometabolic multimorbidity was ascertained via resurvey or linkage to electronic medical records (including hospital admissions and death). We analysed data from each cohort separately using logistic regression and then pooled cohort-specific estimates using random-effects meta-analysis. Findings: Participants were 120    813 adults (mean age 51 · 4 years, range 35 – 103; 71   445 women) who did not have diabetes, coronary heart disease, or stroke at study baseline (1973 – 2012). During a mean follow-up of 10 · 7 years (1995 – 2014), we identified 1627 cases of multimorbidity. After adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, compared with individuals with a healthy weight, the risk of developing cardiometabolic multimorbidity in overweight individuals was twice as high (odds ratio [OR] 2 · 0, 95 % CI 1 · 7 – 2 · 4; p< 0 · 0001), almost five times higher for individuals with class I obesity (4 · 5, 3 · 5 – 5 · 8; p< 0 · 0001), and almost 15 times higher for individuals with classes II and III obesity combined (14 · 5, 10 · 1 – 21 · 0; p< 0 · 0001). This association was noted in men and women, young and old, and white and non-white participants, and was not dependent on the method of exposure assessment or <b>outcome</b> <b>ascertainment.</b> In analyses of different combinations of cardiometabolic conditions, odds ratios associated with classes II and III obesity were 2 · 2 (95 % CI 1 · 9 – 2 · 6) for vascular disease only (coronary heart disease or stroke), 12 · 0 (8 · 1 – 17 · 9) for vascular disease followed by diabetes, 18 · 6 (16 · 6 – 20 · 9) for diabetes only, and 29 · 8 (21 · 7 – 40 · 8) for diabetes followed by vascular disease. Interpretation: The risk of cardiometabolic multimorbidity increases as BMI increases; from double in overweight people to more than ten times in severely obese people compared with individuals with a healthy BMI. Our findings highlight the need for clinicians to actively screen for diabetes in overweight and obese patients with vascular disease, and pay increased attention to prevention of vascular disease in obese individuals with diabetes.

40|$|Importance: Delirium is {{associated}} with accelerated cognitive decline. The pathologic substrates of this association are not yet known, that is, whether {{they are the same}} as those associated with dementia, are independent, or are interrelated. Objective: To examine whether the accelerated cognitive decline observed after delirium is independent of the pathologic processes of classic dementia. Design, Setting, and Participants: Harmonized data from 987 individual brain donors from 3 observational cohort studies with population-based sampling (Vantaa 85 +, Cambridge City Over- 75 s Cohort, Cognitive Function and Ageing Study) performed from January 1, 1985, through December 31, 2011, with a median follow-up of 5. 2 years until death, were used in this study. Neuropathologic assessments were performed with investigators masked to clinical data. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2013. Clinical characteristics of brain donors were not {{different from the rest of}} the cohort. <b>Outcome</b> <b>ascertainment</b> was complete given that the participants were brain donors. Exposures: Delirium (never vs ever) and pathologic burden of neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, vascular lesions, and Lewy bodies. Effects modeled using random-effects linear regression and interactions between delirium and pathologic burden were assessed. Outcomes: Change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores during the 6 years before death. Results: There were 987 participants (290 from Vantaa 85 +, 241 from the Cambridge City Over- 75 s Cohort, and 456 from the Cognitive Function and Ageing Study) with neuropathologic data; mean (SD) age at death was 90 (6. 4) years, including 682 women (69 %). The mean MMSE score 6 years before death was 24. 7 points. The 279 individuals with delirium (75 % women) had worse initial scores (- 2. 8 points; 95 % CI, - 4. 5 to - 1. 0; P[*]<[*]. 001). Cognitive decline attributable to delirium was - 0. 37 MMSE points per year (95 % CI, - 0. 60 to - 0. 13; P[*]<[*]. 001). Decline attributable to the pathologic processes of dementia was - 0. 39 MMSE points per year (95 % CI, - 0. 57 to - 0. 22; P[*]<[*]. 001). However, the combination of delirium and the pathologic processes of dementia resulted in the greatest decline, in which the interaction contributed an additional - 0. 16 MMSE points per year (95 % CI, - 0. 29 to - 0. 03; P[*]=[*]. 01). The multiplicative nature of these variables resulted in individuals with delirium and the pathologic processes of dementia declining 0. 72 MMSE points per year faster than age-, sex-, and educational level-matched controls. Conclusions and Relevance: Delirium in the presence of the pathologic processes of dementia {{is associated}} with accelerated cognitive decline beyond that expected for delirium or the pathologic process itself. These findings suggest that additional unmeasured pathologic processes specifically relate to delirium. Age-related cognitive decline has many contributors, and these findings at the population level support a role for delirium acting independently and multiplicatively to the pathologic processes of classic dementia.
