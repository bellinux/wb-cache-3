5|$|Accompanying {{his family}} on the variety show circuit, Sellers learned stagecraft, but {{received}} conflicting encouragement from his parents and developed mixed feelings about show business. His father doubted Sellers's abilities in the entertainment field, even suggesting that his son's talents were <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> to become a road sweeper, while Sellers's mother encouraged him continuously.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air {{supremacy}} in North Africa. The Ju 87s ventured out in Rotte strength only, often jettisoning their bombs {{at the first}} sight of enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> fuel to cover the Ju 87s on take off, their most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas were on their own.|$|E
5|$|By 22:15 {{the brigade}} had secured {{all of its}} day one {{objectives}} {{and some of the}} missing men had arrived in the brigade area. However, there were many still unaccounted for. The 4th Parachute Battalion numbered around 200 men with almost no heavy weapons. The 6th (Royal Welch) Parachute Battalion had 317 men. There were <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> men of the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion to guard the approach roads leading to the drop zone from the north.|$|E

5|$|Littorio was {{inactive}} for {{the first}} six months of 1943 due to severe fuel shortages in the Italian Navy. <b>Only</b> <b>enough</b> fuel was available for Littorio, Vittorio Veneto and their recently commissioned sister , but even then the fuel was <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> for emergencies. On 19 June 1943, an American bombing raid targeted the harbor at La Spezia and hit Littorio with three bombs. She was renamed Italia on 30 July after the government of Benito Mussolini fell from power. On 3 September, Italy signed an armistice with the Allies, ending her active participation in World War II. Six days later, Italia and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta, where they would be interned for the remainder of the war. While en route, the German Luftwaffe (Air Force) attacked the Italian fleet using Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X radio-controlled bombs. One Fritz X hit Italia just forward of turret no. 1; it passed through the ship and exited the hull, exploding in the water beneath and causing serious damage. Roma was meanwhile sunk in the attack.|$|E
5|$|Other {{details about}} the {{poisoning}} have always been in dispute. While some argue that Claudius was in Rome, others claim he was in Sinuessa on the night he was poisoned. Whether one ingestion of poison was <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> to cause Claudius to fall ill and whether a second dose was given to kill him is also debated.|$|E
5|$|As the Browns recaptured {{a hint of}} past {{success in}} 1994, all was not well behind the scenes. Modell was in {{financial}} trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes. Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the Cleveland Indians, and rented it out for concerts and other events. While the deal worked fine {{for the city and}} Modell early on, the owner was later dogged by excessive borrowing and lawsuits.|$|E

5|$|At {{the inauguration}} of its new {{assembly}} line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its KC-X fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and Airbus parent EADS, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{failed to}} {{progress}} {{past the first}} round of their earliest five World Cup participations. After two scoreless defeats at the inaugural World Cup in 1930, the team scored in their first-round knockout games in the 1934 and 1938 editions—but <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> to save their honour. In 1954, they tied with England (4–4 after extra time), and in 1970, they won their first World Cup match, against El Salvador (3–0). From 1982 until 2002, Belgium reached six successive World Cups by playing qualification rounds, advancing to the second phase five times. In the 1982 FIFA World Cup opener, Belgium beat defending champions Argentina 1–0. Their tournament ended in the second group stage, after a Polish hat-trick by Zbigniew Boniek and a 0–1 loss against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. He was a friend and informal leader there for many of his classmates, and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying. He also became a lightweight boxer. McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> to pass subjects that gave him difficulty, such as mathematics. He came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules, which contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899), despite a high IQ. McCain graduated in 1958.|$|E

5|$|On May 23, 1913, a {{grand jury}} convened to hear {{evidence}} for an indictment against Leo Frank {{for the murder of}} Mary Phagan. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, presented <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> information to obtain the indictment, assuring the jury that additional information would be provided during the trial. The next day, May 24, the jury voted for an indictment. Meanwhile, Frank's legal team suggested to the media that Jim Conley was the actual killer, and put pressure on another grand jury to indict him. The jury foreman, on his own authority, convened the jury on July 21; on Dorsey's advice, they decided not to indict Conley.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity was {{therefore}} planned with these three airborne divisions in mind, {{with all three}} to be dropped behind German lines {{in support of the}} 21st Army Group as it conducted its amphibious assaults to breach the Rhine. However, during the earliest planning stages, it became apparent that the 13th Airborne Division would be unable to participate in the operation, as there were <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> combat transport aircraft in the area to transport two divisions effectively. The plan for the operation {{was therefore}} altered to accommodate the two remaining airborne divisions, the British 6th and U.S. 17th Airborne Divisions. The two airborne divisions would be dropped behind German lines, with their objective to land around Wesel and disrupt enemy defences in order to aid the advance of the British Second Army towards Wesel.|$|E
5|$|The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built 25 Little Boy {{assemblies}} in 1947 {{for use by}} the nuclear-capable Lockheed P2V Neptune {{aircraft carrier}} aircraft (which could be launched from but not land on the Midway-class aircraft carriers). Components were produced by the Naval Ordnance Plants in Pocatello, Idaho, and Louisville, Kentucky. Enough fissionable material was available by 1948 to build ten projectiles and targets, although there were <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> initiators for six. All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.|$|E

5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
5|$|After the {{briefing}} Phu immediately {{returned to his}} headquarters in Pleiku, where he began planning for the withdrawal with Brigadier Generals Tran Van Cam, Pham Ngoc Sang, Pham Duy Tat, and Colonel Le Khac Ly. To maintain secrecy, Phu ordered his officers to issue orders using only word of mouth instead of written documents, and not to reveal the withdrawal plan to local regional forces. Furthermore, he stated that the abandonment of II Corps Tactical Zone had to be quick, with the army taking <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> military equipment and ammunition to fight one last battle. Generals Tat and Cam were assigned the task of supervising the movements of soldiers and their dependents on the ground. Sang {{was responsible for the}} movement of vital military equipment and supplies via air transport and to sweep Route 7 using air force fighter-bombers. Ly was ordered to lead a group of combat engineers to repair the road and bridges on Route 7, as well as maintain contact with the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters in Nha Trang. The plan was destined to fail, as Phu was unaware that General Ngo Quang Truong, commander of I Corps Tactical Zone, had also received similar orders to evacuate.|$|E
5|$|Fighting raged {{throughout}} {{the early morning}} as 'B' Company vainly attempted to assist the cut-off 'D' Company. Varley decided to launch a counterattack with 'A' Company, but at 8:00am the order to withdraw came from brigade headquarters, cancelling the attack. Covered by the reserve company, 'A' and some of 'B' Company were able to break contact and fall back. 'D' Company, {{along with those of}} 'B' Company that were still isolated and in contact, had to be left to fight their way back to the battalion's lines. By the time they arrived, there were <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> men left to form one platoon. The 2/18th's losses in this action amounted to about 90 men killed, wounded or missing. Japanese losses are unknown, but are thought to be significant and they were unable to take Jemaluang for two more days.|$|E

5|$|He opened 2005 with {{a second}} win in the European Clubs' Cross Country Cup. He won his first World Cross Country Championship medal soon after, {{finishing}} second to Bekele to take silver at the 2005 edition. On the track, he recorded a 5000m personal best of at the Qatar Grand Prix in Doha, and qualified to compete at the World Championships in both the 5000 and 10,000m. At the 2005 World Championships, he broke the national record in the 10,000 m final, but his time of 27:12.82 was <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> for sixth. The 5000 m final held little reprieve for the Eritrean as he finished in second last position. He ended the season on a positive note, however, improving his 10,000m best to 27:04.70 at the Memorial Van Damme, and winning the Great North Run with a world best time of 59:05 – which was only his second outing over the half marathon distance.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, the Atlantic, Milos, and Pacific, {{picked up}} 3,600 Jews from Vienna, Gdańsk and Prague in Tulcea, Romania, {{to be sent}} to Palestine. The Jews that arrived in Palestine came without entry permits and were {{subsequently}} denied entry by the British government, specifically Sir Harold MacMichael, who was the High Commissioner. The British decided to deport the immigrants to either Trinidad and Tobago or Mauritius, both British colonies. On 25 November 1940, the first ship carrying the 1,800 Jews to Mauritius, the Patria, was accidentally bombed by the Haganah, who wanted the Jews to stay in Palestine. Their intentions were to cripple the ship. There were 260 fatalities and 172 injuries. There were <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> lifeboats for 805, since the capacity was 805 when the Patria was a French ship. When the British repossessed the boat, they increased the capacity to 1,800 but still had the same number of lifeboats.|$|E
5|$|In most of {{the class}} Enopla ("armed"), the {{proboscis}} exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a stylet, a calcareous barb, with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth. The stylet is attached about one-third of distance {{from the end of}} the ed proboscis, which extends <b>only</b> <b>enough</b> to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost. Instead of one stylet, the Polystilifera have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla. The Enopla can only attack after contacting the prey.|$|E
