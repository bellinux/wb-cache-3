Despite attempts to save them, all seven of its Torah scrolls were destroyed, as were over 3,000 prayer books.

5|$|After {{failing to}} qualify {{on the final}} day of the 2009 campaign, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said {{anything}} short of a playoff spot in 2010 would be unacceptable. With that directive, former director of soccer Mo Johnston hired Preki and made wholesale changes to the roster to reflect the U.S. Hall of Famer's plan to play a tough, defensive style. Despite scoring troubles, TFC played well at the start, going undefeated in seven games at <b>one</b> <b>time.</b> <b>The</b> team struggled following the World Cup break. Sensing problems in the locker room and to try to salvage the season, MLSE dismissed both Johnston and Preki on September 14, naming Earl Cochrane interim director of soccer and Nick Dasovic interim coach. The players responded to Dasovic's more open flexible style, but it wasn't enough as the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three games left in the season. Off-field issues with season-seat holders over the 2011 season ticket package added to the fans' frustrations, forcing MLSE to hold a series of town hall meetings.|$|E

5|$|At <b>one</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> {{island was}} {{considered}} an arid location, where coconuts were the only useful plants likely to flourish and vegetables were difficult to produce.

Anxious {{to attract the attention of}} the French colonial administration which he judged insufficiently involved in the development of Casamance, administrator Emmanuel Bertrand-Bocandé submitted a report which documented in great detail the plant species then present on the island. Although this report was written in 1849, the information it contains has remained valuable even into the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years Clark's {{mounting}} debts {{made it impossible for}} him to retain ownership of his land, since it became subject to seizure due to his debts.

Clark, who was at <b>one</b> <b>time</b> <b>the</b> largest landholder in the Northwest Territory, was left with only a small plot of land in Clarksville.
