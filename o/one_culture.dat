5|$|Sometimes food {{not found}} in its {{original}} culture is assimilated into another; for example, Chinese restaurants in Malaysia often serve Malay dishes. Food from <b>one</b> <b>culture</b> is sometimes also cooked using styles taken from another culture, For example, sambal belacan (shrimp paste) are commonly used as ingredients by Chinese restaurants to create the stir fried water spinach (kangkung belacan). This means that although much of Malaysian food {{can be traced back}} to a certain culture, they have their own identity. Rice is popular in many dishes. Chili is commonly found in local cuisine, although this does not necessarily make them spicy.|$|E

25|$|Taylor {{presents}} a more pancultural {{view of the}} cauldron's images; he concludes that the deities and scenes portrayed on the cauldron are not specific to <b>one</b> <b>culture,</b> but many. He compares Rhiannon, whom he thinks is the figure of plate f, with Hariti, an ogress of Bactrian mythology. In addition, {{he points to the}} similarity between the female figure of plate B and the Hindu goddess Lakshmi, whose depictions are often accompanied by elephants. Wheel gods are also cross-cultural with deities like Taranis and Vishnu, a god from Hinduism.|$|E
25|$|Many Mississippian {{ceramics}} {{are decorated}} by incising or engraving. Implements such as sticks, reeds, or bone fragments, were dragged through wet clay to incise it, {{or they were}} scratched into {{the surface of the}} dried but as yet unfired pieces to engrave. Sharpened reeds or fingernails were also used to punch small marks. Ornate designs and motifs are common decorative elements, which archaeologists use to track the spread of influences from <b>one</b> <b>culture</b> onto another culture. Many of the designs have symbolic meanings, usually associated with aspects of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex.|$|E

50|$|Language is an {{essential}} aspect of any culture. Individuals are able to maintain key aspects of their culture by maintaining their culture’s language. Language {{is important because it}} is an oral form of how people interact with other people within a society. Language reinforces the ties among the people who speak the same language, and thus encourages cultural bonding. Thus, by preserving the language within both of <b>one’s</b> <b>cultures,</b> <b>one</b> can maintain one’s integration within each culture. However, this can result in a difficulty in integrating <b>one’s</b> <b>cultures</b> if each has a distinct, different language as it can prevent outsiders from understanding that particular culture.|$|R
25|$|The {{prehistory}} of Greenland is a {{story of}} repeated waves of Paleo-Eskimo immigration from the islands north of the North American mainland. (The peoples of those islands are thought to have descended, in turn, from inhabitants of Siberia who migrated into Canada thousands of years ago.) Because of Greenland's remoteness and climate, survival there was difficult. Over the course of centuries, <b>one</b> <b>culture</b> succeeded another as groups died out and were replaced by new immigrants. Archaeology can give only approximate dates for the cultures that flourished before the Norse exploration of Greenland in the 10th century.|$|E
25|$|One {{study done}} in Shanghai had {{two types of}} hippocampal {{neuronal}} cultures: In <b>one</b> <b>culture,</b> the neuron was grown from a layer of astrocytes and the other culture was not in contact with any astrocytes, but they were instead fed a glial conditioned medium (GCM), which inhibits {{the rapid growth of}} cultured astrocytes in the brains of rats in most cases. In their results they were able to see that astrocytes had a direct role in Long-term potentiation with the mixed culture (which is the culture that was grown from a layer of astrocytes) but not in GCM cultures.|$|E
25|$|Only some 3% of {{the land}} of Papua New Guinea is in private hands; it is privately held under 99-year state lease, or it is held by the State. There is {{virtually}} no freehold title; the few existing freeholds are automatically converted to state lease when they are transferred between vendor and purchaser. Unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional landowners. The precise nature of the seisin varies from <b>one</b> <b>culture</b> to another. Many writers portray land as in the communal ownership of traditional clans; however, closer studies usually show that the smallest portions of land whose ownership cannot be further divided are held by the individual heads of extended families and their descendants or their descendants alone if they have recently died.|$|E

25|$|Some {{critical}} psychiatrists {{criticize the}} practice of defining {{one and the same}} belief as normal in <b>one</b> <b>culture</b> and pathological in another culture for cultural essentialism. They argue that since cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, books and the internet, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences, the assumption that culture can be boiled down to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically quantifiable factors and that everything that does not fall in those factors must be biological, is not a justified assumption. Other critical psychiatrists argue that just because a person's belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing empirical evidence, only that psychiatry rarely if ever present patients with such situations.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{the agents}} {{that killed the}} test fungi also {{turned out to be}} highly toxic to animals, {{signifying}} that they could not be safely used for human treatment. Interestingly enough, of the hundreds of soil samples sent to Hazen and Brown from around the world, the <b>one</b> <b>culture</b> that was effective against fungi and not fatal to animals was originally found in the soil near a barn of two of Hazen’s friends, the Walter B. Nourses. The microorganism discovered in the soil was later named Streptomyces norsei in their honor. Brown’s chemical testing showed that the microorganism in this particular soil sample produced two antifungal substances called Fractions N and AN. Fraction N was fatal on tests with animals, just like the other substances that Hazen tested. However, Fraction AN proved safe in tests on live animals and was effective not only against the initial two fungi, but fourteen others as well. Brown then purified this second antibiotic into small white crystals. The two scientists first named the drug fungicidin, but upon discovery that the name was already in use, changed it to “Nystatin” in honor of the New York State Division of Laboratories and Research.|$|E

50|$|Especially in {{the capital}} of Luanda, which was {{historically}} associated with white colonial settlers, black Angolans were encouraged to wear traditional dress as a form of cultural distinction and to build a sense of nationalism among the people.

500|$|There is also {{a strong}} anti-imperialist vein in the film's satire. The film scholar Matthew Solomon notes that {{the last part of}} the film (the parade and {{commemoration}} sequence missing in some prints) is especially forceful in this regard. He argues that Méliès, who had previously worked as an anti-Boulangist political cartoonist, mocks imperialistic domination in the film by presenting his colonial conquerors as bumbling pedants who mercilessly attack the alien lifeforms they meet and return with a mistreated captive amid fanfares of self-congratulation. The statue of Barbenfouillis shown in the film's final shot even resembles the pompous, bullying colonialists in Méliès's political cartoons. The film scholar Elizabeth Ezra agrees that [...] "Méliès mocks the pretensions of colonialist accounts of the conquest of <b>one</b> <b>culture</b> by another," [...] and adds that [...] "his film also thematizes social differentiation on the home front, as the hierarchical patterns on the moon are shown to bear a curious resemblance to those on earth." ...|$|E
