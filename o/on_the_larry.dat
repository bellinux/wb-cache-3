500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{gave the}} episode an 8.9 rating out of 10 and wrote [...] "...the real reason to watch, as always, was Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin and their fantastic comedic performances." [...] Canning responded favorably to the episode {{with the exception}} of the Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth storyline, calling it [...] "silly". Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger wrote that Jack taking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Larry</b> Braverman persona [...] "gave Baldwin a chance to play a delightfully goofy strain of those occasional glimpses we get of a happy Jack." [...] Like Sepinwall, Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was favorable to Jack going to the reunion, but most enjoyed the character impersonating Larry Braverman, observing it was a [...] "well-used plot device" [...] as Baldwin [...] "made it believable". TV Guides Matt Mitovich was positive about [...] "Reunion", calling it a [...] "nice" [...] episode. Jeff Labrecque for Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the episode, and said that [...] "Reunion" [...] was the first episode of the season that [...] "I think the show benefited from the refocused attention on its core characters. The reunion plot was so strong, and the Carrie finale so inspired, that I hope the viewership ratings reflect positively and encourage a continuance of this creative trend." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that he was [...] "much more amused" [...] by Rob Sussman's [...] "still-simmering rage" [...] against Liz, because he [...] "scored many of the show's biggest laughs." [...] He said that he found the second plot [...] "a little underwhelming though I thought there was a neat meta-textual element to it", but wrote that it [...] "scored some nice shots at the vapid narcissism of actors but it promised more than it could deliver." [...] Rick Porter of Zap2it said that despite the [...] "super-capital-A-list guest stars" [...] that guest starred at the beginning of the season, [...] "Reunion" [...] got back [...] "to the show's core cast... the show gave us probably the best episode of the season." [...] Time contributor James Poniewozik opined that this episode was [...] "pretty good" [...] and [...] "funny in most of the usual 30 Rock ways." ...|$|E

Zevon's cover of cult artist Judee Sill's [...] "Jesus Was a Crossmaker" [...] predated the wider rediscovery {{of her work}} a decade later. The album, however, suffered the worst sales of Zevon's career, in part because his label, superagent Irving Azoff's short-lived Giant Records, {{was in the process}} of going out of business. Rhino Records released a Zevon [...] "best-of" [...] compilation in 1996, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead.

2500|$|After {{beginning}} her {{stand-up comedy}} in 1992, Silverman {{was part of}} the 1993–94 season of Saturday Night Live (SNL) for 18 weeks as a writer and featured player. She was fired after one season where only one of the sketches she wrote survived to dress rehearsal and none aired, although she did appear on the show as a cast member in skits, usually in smaller supporting roles. Bob Odenkirk, a former SNL writer, explained, [...] "I could see how it wouldn't work at SNL because she's got her own voice, she's very much Sarah Silverman all the time. She can play a character but she doesn't disappear into the character—she makes the character her." [...] She has stated that she was not ready for SNL when she got the job. She said that when she was fired it hurt her confidence for a year, but after that nothing could hurt her and that she attributes her time to SNL as being a key reason why she has been so tough in her career. Later, she was grateful that her SNL time was short because it didn't end up defining her. She parodied the situation when she appeared <b>on</b> <b>The</b> <b>Larry</b> Sanders Show episode [...] "The New Writer" [...] (1996), playing Sanders' new staff writer, whose jokes are not used because of the chauvinism and bias of the male chief comedy writer, who favors the jokes of his male co-writers. She appeared in three episodes of Larry Sanders during its final two seasons.|$|E

As of 1993 the organization was utilizing its own public relations office called the Age of Enlightenment News Service. In a scene in the 1999 film, Man on the Moon, TM meditator Andy Kaufman was asked to leave a TM teacher training course because his performances were incompatible with the behavior expected of a TM teacher. The Maharishi gave his first interview in 25 years <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Larry</b> King Show in May 2002.
