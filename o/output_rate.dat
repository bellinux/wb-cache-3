500|$|In Asia, Japan termed nations {{under its}} {{occupation}} as {{being part of}} the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, essentially a Japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples. Although Japanese forces were originally welcomed as liberators from European domination in some territories, their excessive brutality turned local public opinion against them within weeks. During Japan's initial conquest it captured [...] of oil (~5.5×105 tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces, and by 1943 was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to , 76 per cent of its 1940 <b>output</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{automatic}} {{hot forging}} process involves feeding mill-length steel bars (typically [...] long) into {{one end of}} the machine at room temperature and hot forged products emerge from the other end. This all occurs rapidly; small parts can be made at a rate of 180 parts per minute (ppm) and larger can be made at a rate of 90 ppm. The parts can be solid or hollow, round or symmetrical, up to , and up to [...] in diameter.

2500|$|Volumetric {{modulated}} arc therapy (VMAT) {{is a new}} radiation technique, {{which can}} achieve highly conformal dose distributions on target volume coverage and sparing of normal tissues. The specificity of this technique is to modify the three parameters during the treatment. VMAT delivers radiation by rotating gantry (usually 360° rotating fields {{with one or more}} arcs), changing speed and shape of the beam with a multileaf collimator (MLC) ("sliding window" [...] system of moving) and fluence <b>output</b> <b>rate</b> (dose rate) of the medical linear accelerator. VMAT also has the potential to give additional advantages in patient treatment, such as reduced delivery time of radiation, compared with conventional static field intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} perform this analysis, the BLS {{performed}} {{two types of}} productivity calculations.

40|$|This article {{extends the}} option {{approach}} to valuing real assets by modeling the firm as a two-stage process with bounded <b>output</b> <b>rates,</b> {{in which the}} output of the first stage may be held as work-in-process. In this setting, the real asset becomes a compound option, which, if exercised, gives the option to finish the work-in-process and sell the output as its final payoff. The existence of intermediate inventories may arise as an optimal investment strategy for exploiting possible future price increases.
