The overall goal {{of this research was}} to correlate the synthon strength and nature found in the crystal structures of the α- and β-forms of 4 -aminobenzoic acid to experimentally observed data, assessing their applicability for predicting crystallisation conditions that would produce crystals of desirable physical properties. The strength and nature of the synthons found in the α-structure were found to significantly vary, while the strength and nature of the synthons in the β-structure were found to be much more similar. These synthons were also found to influence the conformation of the COOH and NH 2 groups in both structures. Water was calculated to favourably bind to the COOH group than ethanol, along with the <b>OH</b> [...] . <b>O</b> <b>H-bonding</b> dimers being calculated to be less stable in aqueous than ethanolic solutions. This suggests that water may hinder the formation of the α form more so than other solvents. The attachment energy morphological prediction of α-pABA was less needle-like than often observed, probably due to the growth rate of the capping faces growing by a rough interfacial growth mechanism along the long axis of the needle dominated by π-π stacking interactions, being underestimated. Nitromethane (NMe) was calculated to interact more strongly with the phenyl ring than other solvents and hence addition of NMe to ethanolic solutions shortens the long axis of the needle. The experimentally measured local surface molecular chemisty was found to vary between measurements of the bulk and surface at the (1 0 - 1) surface, which is predicted to have unsaturated H-bonds at the surface. Complementing this, spatially resolved measurements across the (1 0 1) surface also showed changes in structure of a supposedly periodic surface. This study revealed how predicting the strength and nature of the synthons in the bulk structure and at the surface, along with their interaction with solvent molecules and stability in solution, can influence the morphology and polymorphism of the crystals produced from solution. ...|$|R

40|$|KefC is a prokaryotic {{potassium}} efflux system, {{which is}} vital {{for the maintenance of}} cell homeostasis and the protection of cells against toxic electrophiles. As such, this system presents a novel target for antimicrobial agents. The channel is maintained shut by the tripeptide glutathione (Ɣglutamylcysteinyl glycine, GSH) and is activated by glutathione Sconjugates formed by the reaction of GSH with electrophiles such as Nethylmaleimide and methylglyoxal. It provides protection via modulation of the intracellular pH, thus making the nucleophilic groups on DNA and proteins less reactive towards the toxic compound. X-ray crystal structures of KefC have been obtained in both the open and closed conformations, which has allowed a model for channel regulation at the molecular level to be proposed. This structure has been used to rationally design activators/inhibitors of the channel and explore the SAR of the system. Systematic modification of the GSH core structure has been undertaken in an effort to develop molecules with both increased affinity and selectivity and to identify the core components necessary for binding. A novel GSHbased fluorescent probe has also been developed to allow development of a rapid and robust assay to test potential inhibitors/activators of this system. The greater aim associated with this work is to develop drug-like molecules, which through binding to KefC disrupt cell homeostasis and as such display bactericidal properties.

H 2 O−Na−H 2 OH 2 O−Na−H 2 O ? ?? ??? ?? ??? ????. We applied gemological {{analytical}} approaches on Aquamarine {{from the}} Gilgit-Baltistan of Northern Areas, Pakistan. The standard gemological testing indicates {{that they are}} consistent with general characteristics of natural aquamarines. We have identified the inclusions of Tantalite-Mn by Raman analysis. It indicates that they occurs {{in association with the}} veins of Be-rich coarse pegmatite. And the results of chemical analyses, infrared absorption spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy indicate that H 2 <b>OH</b> 2 <b>O</b> molecules in channel mostly exist in Type-I and a little Type-II with low alkali ion. The comparison of relative peak intensity of FT-IR analysis can be used for prediction of Na 2 ONa 2 O content within not only emerald but also aquamarine...|$|R
30|$|The Moon {{has been}} {{orbiting}} through the Earth’s magneto tail, immersed {{in it for}} about 4  days every month. During these periods, its surface is exposed to electrons and the low energy ions trapped there, specifically to H, <b>OH,</b> <b>O</b> and N, {{some of which may}} be of terrestrial origin (see e.g. [5]). Since the Moon has been very close to the Earth in the past, it has been exposed to terrestrial environment to some extent. All these considerations make the Moon an interesting object for scientific study [6] and therefore a scientific mission to the Moon with limited but well defined objectives was undertaken by ISRO.|$|R

In {{order to}} enhance our {{understanding}} of the possible influence of meteor ablation on the enrichment in <b>OH</b> and <b>O</b> 2 of the lower thermosphere we studied intense Leonid meteor activity by using the SATI (Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager) interferometer of the Instituto de Astrofı́sica de Andalucı́a. We measured the emission rate and rotational temper-ature of <b>OH</b> and <b>O</b> 2 airglow emission layers during two observation periods of high meteoric activity: the 1998 Leonid outburst and the 2002 Leonid storm. The results show {{that there is not a}} clear relation of <b>O</b> 2 and <b>OH</b> airglow emission and rotational temperature with meteoric activity...|$|R
40|$|Strategies {{utilizing}} {{continuous wave}} (CW) lasers are considered which {{are capable of}} simultaneously measuring the flow parameters of velocity, temperature, and pressure at sampling rates exceeding 3 kHz. Velocity is determined from the Doppler shift of the spectral profile, temperature is extracted from intensity ratios of multiple lines, and pressure is measured from either the collision of broadening or the magnitude of absorption. Distinctions between strategies concern the specifics of probe spacies (NO, <b>OH,</b> <b>O</b> 2, and H 2 O) in terms of nominal probe wavelength, equipment, and detection scheme. CW lasers were applied to path-integrated absorption measurements of transient shock-tube flows and spatially resolved laser-induced fluorescence measurements of underexpanded jets...|$|R
