Formerly flying 380 passengers, it has {{been converted into a}} 118-seat restaurant with large numbers of the seats removed in order to provide adequate space for patrons and for the installation <b>of</b> <b>dining</b> tables. An annex was attached to {{the right side of the}} fuselage to accommodate the kitchen.|$|E

5|$|From the 1854 {{establishment}} of railways in Norway to 1909, no dining service was offered aboard trains; passengers {{were allowed to}} bring food with them. Train stations also lacked dining facilities. The first dining service was started by restaurateur Carl Christiansen. He established the restaurant at Drammen Station, and in 1907 was asked by NSB to establish a dining service aboard the express trains on the Bergen Line, which would open in 1909. After investigating similar operations in England and Germany, he ordered two carriages from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk. These were {{to be paid for}} by the state, but the Parliament of Norway delayed the grants after a long debate regarding the suitability of restaurant carriages on trains. The plans were opposed by the teetotaler faction of Parliament, but there was a majority in favor <b>of</b> <b>dining</b> service. To get the carriages in time, Christiansen personally guaranteed the production cost in case a state grant was not allocated. After the parliamentary decision, the cost of the carriages was refunded by NSB. In 1910, when President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt visited Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, several restaurant carriages were ordered solely for the occasion. Two years later, restaurant carriages were put in regular service on the Østfold Line.|$|E

40|$|We {{isolated}} a membrane-bound metallopeptidase, DINE (damage-induced neuronal endopeptidase), by {{differential display}} PCR using rat normal and axotomized hypoglossal nuclei. The most marked properties <b>of</b> <b>DINE</b> were neuron-specific expression and a striking response to axonal injury {{in both the}} central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. For instance, cranial and spinal nerve transection, ischemia, corpus callosum transection, and colchicine treatment increased DINE mRNA expression in the injured neurons, whereas kainate-induced hyperexcitation, immobilization, and osmotic stress failed to up-regulate <b>DINE</b> mRNA. Expression <b>of</b> <b>DINE</b> in COS cells partially inhibited C 2 -ceramide-induced apoptosis, probably because of the activation of antioxidant enzymes such as Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, Mn-superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase through the proteolytic activity <b>of</b> <b>DINE.</b> These data provide insight into the mechanism of how injured neurons protect themselves against neuronal death...|$|R

25|$|Since {{a buffet}} {{involves}} diners serving themselves, {{it has in}} the past been considered an informal form <b>of</b> <b>dining,</b> less formal than table service.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study seeks {{to determine the}} critical elements and activities that comprise the cultural history <b>of</b> <b>Dine</b> College as the first tribally controlled college in the United States. An oral history methodology utilizing a narrative Dine "story-telling" inquiry approach allowed this study to blend stories, songs, prayers, and ceremonies from the Dine creation stories to challenge a host of social, educational, and cultural issues which the Dine people confronted in establishing the first post-secondary educational institution on tribal land, {{owned and operated by}} tribal people. Goals of this institution were to prepare students for further academic studies, employment, and culturally astuteness. Cultural history reflects the traditional stories, songs, prayers, and ceremonies of a people, and is used here to reconstruct {{the events of the past}} to gain a fair, accurate, and objective understanding <b>of</b> <b>Dine</b> College's unique philosophy of Sa'ah Naaghai Bik'eh Hozhoon and its related components: Nitsahakees-Thinking, Nahata-Planning, Iina-Living and Siih Hasin-Achievement. Through oral history narratives of four key Navajo individuals who were directly and indirectly involved in the College's founding, five key themes are revealed: land, leadership, mission, philosophy, and curriculum. They converge together to weave the cultural history <b>of</b> <b>Dine</b> College...|$|R

25|$|Before the {{inclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>dining</b> cars in passenger trains became common practice, a rail passenger's only option for meal service in transit was to patronize {{one of the}} roadhouses often located near the railroad's water stops.

25|$|For a {{different}} type <b>of</b> <b>dining</b> experience, the Pink Door (founded 1981), entered by a nearly unmarked door on upper Post Alley, is a favorite first-date restaurant, with solid Italian food, a fantasia of a dining room, a bar that sometimes features live jazz, and an outdoor deck overlooking Elliott Bay. Another restaurant combining Italian food and romantic ambience is the Il Bistro, located below grade in the Economy Market, off the winding cobblestones of Lower Post Alley.

25|$|While {{borrowing}} {{much from}} the preceding Etruscan architecture, {{such as the use}} of hydraulics and the construction of arches, Roman prestige architecture remained firmly under the spell of Ancient Greek architecture and the classical orders. This came initially from Magna Graecia, the Greek colonies in southern Italy, and indirectly from Greek influence on the Etruscans, but after the Roman conquest of Greece directly from the best classical and Hellenistic examples in the Greek world. The influence is evident in many ways; for example, in the introduction and use of the Triclinium in Roman villas as a place and manner <b>of</b> <b>dining.</b> Roman builders employed Greeks in many capacities, especially in the great boom in construction in the early Empire.|$|E
25|$|Georgian cuisine {{and wine}} have evolved through the centuries, {{adapting}} traditions in each era. One {{of the most}} unusual traditions <b>of</b> <b>dining</b> is supra, or Georgian table, which is also a way of socialising with friends and family. The head of supra is known as tamada. He also conducts the highly philosophical toasts, and makes sure that everyone is enjoying themselves. Various historical regions of Georgia are known for their particular dishes: for example, khinkali (meat dumplings), from eastern mountainous Georgia, and khachapuri, mainly from Imereti, Samegrelo and Adjara. In addition to traditional Georgian dishes, the foods of other countries have been brought to Georgia by immigrants from Russia, Greece, and recently China.|$|E
