His reviews were known for their flair, and he often used them as a soapbox for issues of concern to him, whether petty (people who cough during plays) or more important (such as racial intolerance).|$|E

5|$|Coffin's {{attempts}} to find business in the Midwest were thwarted by the well-established presence there of several notable landscape architects in Chicago {{but she was not}} short of commissions despite this failure. Her success was recognized by her being elected a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects in 1918, and by the 1920s {{she was one of the}} most sought-after East Coast landscape architects. Her work was widely featured in popular magazines and professional journals, at Coffin's own instigation as part of an overt marketing strategy. She sought to reach the wealthy and powerful women who made up an important part of the readership <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> such as the Garden Club of America's Bulletin. Coffin commissioned some of America's leading landscape photographers to take photographs of her creations and promoted her work through slide lectures. Her marketing was highly successful and led to a steady stream of commissions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and applies several meta-analytic {{techniques to}} investigate the presence <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> bias in industrial relations research, specifically in the union-productivity effects literature. Publication bias arises when statistically insignificant results are suppressed or when results satisfying prior expectations are given preference. Like most fields, research in industrial relations is vulnerable to publication bias. Unlike other fields such as economics, {{there is no evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> bias in the union-productivity literature, as a whole. However, there are pockets <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> selection, as well as negative autoregression, confirming the controversial nature of this area of research. Meta-regression analysis reveals evidence <b>of</b> <b>publication</b> bias (or selection) among US studies...|$|R
5|$|Days {{after the}} storm, fears of food {{shortages}} began to arise as railways, in which food {{would normally be}} able to be delivered, were washed out. To deal with the large number of bodies {{in the wake of the}} disaster, Mexican officials decided to cremate and mass bury victims. By mid-September, between 1,600 and 1,800 people were hired to repair and rebuild the devastated railways in Nuevo León. In 2009, the third edition of the book El Río Fiera Bramaba: 1909 by Oswaldo Sánchez, re-accounting reports form people who experienced the flood, was planned. According to the director <b>of</b> <b>publications</b> at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, the book was considered one of historical quality. In memory of those who perished during the flood, the book was released to the public on August27, 2009, the 100year anniversary of the disaster.|$|E
5|$|Scotland in the High Middle Ages is a {{relatively}} well-studied topic and Scottish medievalists have produced a wide variety <b>of</b> <b>publications.</b> Some, such as David Dumville, Thomas Owen Clancy and Dauvit Broun, are primarily interested in the native cultures of the country, and often have linguistic training in the Celtic languages. Normanists, such as G.W.S. Barrow, {{are concerned with the}} Norman and Scoto-Norman cultures introduced to Scotland after the eleventh century. For much of the twentieth century, historians tended to stress the cultural change that took place in Scotland during this time. However, scholars such as Cynthia Neville and Richard Oram, while not ignoring cultural changes, argue that continuity with the Gaelic past was just as, if not more, important.|$|E
5|$|The 1870s {{were the}} golden years of Cope's career, marked by his most {{prominent}} discoveries and rapid flow <b>of</b> <b>publications.</b> Among his descriptions were the therapsid Lystrosaurus (1870), the archosauromorph Champsosaurus (1876), and the sauropod Amphicoelias (1878), possibly the largest dinosaur ever discovered. In {{the period of}} one year, from 1879 to 1880, Cope published 76papers based on his travels through New Mexico and Colorado, and {{on the findings of}} his collectors in Texas, Kansas, Oregon, Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah. During the peak years, Cope published around 25reports and preliminary observations each year. The hurried publications led to errors in interpretation and naming—many of his scientific names were later canceled or withdrawn. In comparison, Marsh wrote and published less frequently and more succinctly—his works appearance in the widespread American Journal of Science led to faster reception abroad, and subsequently Marsh's reputation grew more rapidly than Cope's.|$|E
