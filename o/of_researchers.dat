5|$|A protein as a {{stand-alone}} infectious agent stands {{in contrast to}} all other known infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites, all of which contain nucleic acids (DNA, RNA, or both).

5|$|Whether prions cause {{disease or}} are merely a symptom {{caused by a}} {{different}} agent is still debated by a minority <b>of</b> <b>researchers.</b> The following sections describe several hypotheses: Some pertain to {{the composition of the}} infectious agent (protein-only, protein with other components, virus, or other), while others pertain to its mechanism of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|A team <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> {{discover}} {{remains of}} a crashed spaceship in the Arctic Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen in the wreckage. Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E

5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, Said {{is known for}} the book Orientalism (1978), {{a critique of the}} cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient. Said’s model of textual analysis transformed the academic discourse <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> in literary theory, literary criticism, and Middle-Eastern studies—how academics examine, describe, and define the cultures being studied. As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the program, after the Korean War, the CHA had little means to operate. Go Sangnyeol (고상렬), the administrator of CHA between 1961 and 1968 set out to search for intangible cultural properties {{on the basis of a}} series of articles written by Yae Yonghae (예용해) for Hankook Ilbo, as the reporter spent years in exploring the country and interviewing old masters of handicraft. The first items to be inscribed on the intangible heritage list were thus taken from Yae's articles. Others were added based on the opinions <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> and also included winners of the annual folk tradition competitions. The recommendation of local administrations was also sought.|$|E

5|$|Banton {{was already}} {{inhabited}} during pre-colonial times as proven by ancient artefacts such as wooden coffins and skeletal remains {{found in the}} island's caves in 1936 by a team <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> from the National Museum of the Philippines. Among the artefacts was the Banton Cloth, {{a piece of a}} traditional burial cloth found in one of the wooden coffins. It is estimated to be 400 years old, making it the earliest known warp ikat (tie-resist dyeing) textile in the Philippines and Southeast Asia. These artifacts are now preserved at the National Museum of Anthropology in Manila.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E
5|$|In June 1981, Owen Beattie, a {{professor}} of anthropology at the University of Alberta, began the 1845–48 Franklin Expedition Forensic Anthropology Project (FEFAP) when he and his team <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> and field assistants travelled from Edmonton to King William Island, traversing the island's western coast as Franklin's men did 132years before. FEFAP hoped to find artifacts and skeletal remains in order to use modern forensics to establish identities and causes of death among the lost 129.|$|E

40|$|An {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>researcher</b> requirements {{is vital}} for any institution that conducts and supports research. As part of Curtin University’s ongoing efforts to improve our understanding <b>of</b> how <b>researchers</b> use Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in research, the CITS eResearch Support team recently surveyed Curtin’s research community. The survey was run in conjunction with Curtin University’s Office of Research and Development to maximise its reach. Over a quarter <b>of</b> active <b>researchers</b> completed the survey...|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to quantize the branes. Starting in 1991, a team <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes {{was reduced to a}} relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E
5|$|Leo Max Frank (April 17, 1884August 17, 1915) was an American factory {{superintendent}} who {{was convicted}} in 1913 {{of the murder of}} a 13-year-old employee, Mary Phagan, in Atlanta, Georgia. His trial, and lynching two years later, attracted national attention and became the focus of social, regional, political, and racial concerns, particularly regarding antisemitism. Today, the consensus <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> on the subject holds that Frank was wrongly convicted.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} by Gary Nunn of the American Museum of Natural History (1996) {{and other researchers}} around the world studied the mitochondrial DNA of all 14 accepted species, finding four, not two, monophyletic groups within the albatrosses. They proposed the resurrection {{of two of the}} old genus names, Phoebastria for the North Pacific albatrosses and Thalassarche for the mollymawks, with the great albatrosses retaining Diomedea and the sooty albatrosses staying in Phoebetria. Both the British Ornithologists' Union and the South African authorities split the albatrosses into four genera as Nunn suggested, and the change has been accepted by the majority <b>of</b> <b>researchers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Other {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses {{agree the}} redefined Platyhelminthes are most {{closely related to}} Gastrotricha, and both {{are part of a}} grouping known as Platyzoa. Platyzoa are generally agreed to be at least closely related to the Lophotrochozoa, a superphylum that includes molluscs and annelid worms. The majority view is that Platyzoa are part of Lophotrochozoa, but a significant minority <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> regard Platyzoa as a sister group of Lophotrochozoa.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard Airport, Longyear, {{opened in}} 1975, {{allowing}} better facilities and connection with scheduled flights to the mainland. At the same time, Lufttransport established itself at Svalbard Airport. During {{the summer of}} 1975, the Norwegian Polar Institute stationed two helicopters at Ny-Ålesund Airport to support their expeditions. During the late 1970s there was little winter activity in Ny-Ålesund, but the air strip was kept operational for the few groups <b>of</b> <b>researchers</b> who did visit. A radio line repeater was installed at Kongsvegpasset in 1980, resulting in Ny-Ålesund receiving a telephone connection. A radio beacon was subsequently installed at the airport.|$|E
