When the students {{take a trip}} to the nearby Château de Rochambeau, for example, Lambert, who has never visited the château, nevertheless recalls vivid memories of the place from a dream. Believing his spirit visited the place while his body slept, he ascribes the experience to [...] "a complete severance <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> and my inner being" [...] and [...] "some inscrutable locomotive faculty in the spirit with effects resembling those of locomotion in the body".|$|E

500|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the tour's title, Beyoncé was criticized by several critics and feminists alike for entitling it after her husband's name as she has been regarded as a feminist. Questions were raised about how Beyoncé agreed to be known as a bride of another celebrity person. During an interview with Vogue, Beyoncé described herself as a [...] "modern-day feminist" [...] and further spoke about her decision to reference her husband's name: [...] "I feel like Mrs. Carter is who I am, but more bold and more fearless than I've ever been..... It comes from knowing my purpose and really meeting myself once I saw my child. I was like, 'OK, this is what you were born to do'. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> became completely different." [...] After the second European leg was announced on December 11, 2013, a new poster was revealed and used for the promotion of all the newly added shows.|$|E
500|$|Air safety {{investigators}} attributed Vulović's survival to {{her being}} trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's fuselage as it {{broke away from}} the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin depressurized, the passengers and other flight crew were sucked out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact. Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered in the aircraft's fuselage on the basis of her conversations with Honke. [...] "The man who found me... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," [...] she said. [...] "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane." [...] Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of low blood pressure caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact. Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.|$|E
500|$|Promoted acting wing {{commander}} in June 1943, Arthur became wing leader of No.71 Wing, which controlled No.75 Squadron {{and three other}} combat units. On 5November, {{he was involved in}} a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No.79 Squadron. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns. He later recalled, [...] "...I felt my hands disappear, felt my face go but the rest <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> was...was just flames...And {{then all of a sudden}} the flames dropped down a bit and I got out and went like mad and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to guess how far I could go before I'd try to put the flames out..." [...] Although his family was informed that his injuries were [...] "of a very slight nature" [...] and that he had been [...] "burnt but not badly", Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina. [...] He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at Yaralla Military Hospital (now Concord Hospital). After his recovery in April 1944, he attended a staff course before taking over command of No.2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura, Victoria. In August, at the age of 24, he was promoted to temporary group captain, the youngest in the RAAF. That December he took command of No.81 Wing of the Australian First Tactical Air Force (No.1 TAF), based at Noemfoor and Labuan in the Dutch East Indies.|$|E

2500|$|In about 200 AD, Tertullian wrote: [...] "Having {{taken the}} bread and given it to His disciples, He made it His own body, by saying, This is my body, that is, the figure <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body.</b> A figure, however, there could not have been, unless there were first a veritable body. An empty thing, or phantom, is {{incapable}} of a figure. If, however, (as Marcion might say) He pretended the bread was His body, because He lacked the truth of bodily substance, it follows that He must have given bread for us." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Duchess's {{household}} at Horsham, {{in around}} 1536, Catherine (then aged 13) was repeatedly molested by her music teacher, Henry Mannox (aged 36). [...] He later gave {{evidence in the}} inquiry against her. Mannox and Catherine both confessed during her adultery inquisitions that they had engaged in sexual contact, but not actual coitus. When questioned Catherine was quoted as saying, [...] "At the flattering and fair persuasions of Mannox, being but a young girl, I suffered him at sundry times to handle and touch the secret parts <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> which neither became me with honesty to permit nor him to require." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{event of}} Ahl al-Kisa signifies a happy married life.

[...] The three most popular versions of this tradition are related by al-Miswar b. Makhrama, a Companion who was about nine years old when Muhammad died. Ali, anyhow, did not marry another woman during Fatima's lifetime despite the difference in opinion among some Muslims about his proposal for Abu Jahl's daughter. One of Ali's letter provides comparison of alleged proposal ...|$|E
2500|$|Harrison was indisputably {{known for}} his sense of humor. Even detractor John Adams conceded in his diary that [...] "Harrison's {{contributions}} and many pleasantries steadied rough sessions." [...] Indeed, while preparing to sign the Declaration, the rather rotund Harrison famously quipped to Elbridge Gerry, who had taken his {{place at the table}} to sign: [...] "I shall have a great advantage over you, Mr. Gerry, when we are all hung for what we are now doing. From the size and weight <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> I shall die in a few minutes and be with the angels, but from the lightness of your body you will dance in the air an hour or two before you are dead." ...|$|E
40|$|The complex {{functioning}} {{of the human body}} produces the biological, historical and environmental contingencies of lived existence. These experiences of embodiment are chiasmic, dialectical and dialogical, and underpin the narrative dilemmas we create through the storied nature of our attempts to make sense of them. In testifying my own embodiment this autobiographical form of sensual scholarship emphasizes the subjective basis for <b>my</b> <b>body’s</b> psychology. By developing the complicating action segments <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life story told through interview data into a chronologically-ordered and textually- layered account of personally significant memories, I craft a story <b>of</b> <b>my</b> panicking <b>body.</b> <b>My</b> upbringing was influenced by discourses that reinforced parental and family affiliation at the expense <b>of</b> <b>my</b> feeling <b>body.</b> Unravelling <b>my</b> need to exercise as a contingency of this affiliation provides retrospective meaning to the distress my panicking caused. Situating my feelings, thoughts, emotions and actions within the broader constraints <b>of</b> <b>my</b> family’s history, community, religion and culture reveals the contingent nature <b>of</b> <b>my</b> embodiment. Describing the shifting contingencies of a life lived since my upbringing in the small, rural town of Inglewood, New Zealand, provides the opportunity to recognize and to re-align the dialectics of identity that help to make up <b>my</b> <b>body’s</b> psychology. Juxtaposing this narrative meaning-making are <b>my</b> revelations <b>of</b> experiential integration achieved through the flow of exercise. Understood as an extension <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body’s</b> fundamental sensuality, this evolutionally-refined capacity for engagement underpins my lived experiencing. Together these sentient and reflexive forms of testimony confirm the inherence <b>of</b> <b>my</b> sensuality and the circumstance of self-hood, and invite you, the reader, to explore the workings of your own body. By revealing the sensual and symbolic strands <b>of</b> <b>my</b> embodiment this story of human contingency reveals something of the fleshy consciousness that we all share, not by speaking for anyone else, but by calling attention to the taken-for-granted nature of its unfolding. By arguing for a psychology more relevant to lived experiencing, my thesis questions the body of Western science and, in particular, psychology’s version of it. Articulating the felt nature <b>of</b> <b>my</b> experiencing situates my mind back in <b>my</b> <b>body</b> and, in doing so, fleshes out its psychology. While the insights shared here are personal, the relevance of the felt-body is found in the ways it becomes discoursed and narrated...|$|R

Shue explained her reason for doing so in a 2007 interview. [...] "There was no other choice back then," [...] she pointed out to the interviewer. [...] "There was no girls team to play on." [...] Shue continued to play on the team till 1976, when she turned 13. Of her decision to leave the team, Shue stated, [...] "the movie is really {{what would have happened if}} I hadn’t quit [...] I quit because of what people would think of me. The pressure from the boys. The awkward development <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body.</b> I really, really regret it. I wish I’d been brave enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{were several}} {{incidents}} {{during the trial}} where Saddam showed defiance against the court's authority. At one point, Saddam's legal defense team {{stormed out of the}} court after questioning the tribunal's legitimacy, and asking about return of defence papers seized by US Army troops and security issues regarding the protection of the defense. Saddam, along with his co-defendants, railed against Chief Judge Amin and the tribunal. The next day, after listening to hours of testimony against him, he lashed out at the judge. He said that he was exhausted, he did not intend on returning to the trial, and to [...] "go to hell". Later, on 7 December 2005, Saddam refused to enter court, complaining of the conditions in which he was being held and the conduct of the trial. Saddam's complaints included, among other things, that he {{had not been able to}} change his clothes for four days. On 12 December 2005, instead of cross-examining witnesses, Saddam accused his American captors of torturing him, saying, [...] "I have been beaten on every place <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> and the signs are all over my body." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike much other feminist art, Schneemann's {{revolves}} around sexual expression and liberation, rather than referring to victimization or repression of women. [...] According to artist and lecturer Johannes Birringer, Schneemann's work resists the political correctness enforced by some branches of feminism {{as well as}} ideologies that some feminists claim are misogynist, such as psychoanalysis. [...] He also asserts that Schneemann's work is difficult to classify and analyze as it combines constructivist and painterly concepts with her physical body and energy. [...] In her 1976 book Cézanne, She Was A Great Painter, Schneemann wrote that she used nudity in her artwork to break taboos associated with the kinetic human body and to show that [...] "the life {{of the body is}} more variously expressive than a sex-negative society can admit." [...] She also stated, [...] "In some sense I made a gift <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> to other women; giving our bodies back to ourselves." [...] According to Kristine Stiles, Scheeman read several written works exploring the body’s relationship with “sexuality, culture, and freedom,” such as The Theater and Its Double by Antonin Araud, The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir, and The Sexual Revolution by Wilhelm Reich. These written works may have influenced her belief that women must represent themselves through writing about their experiences if they wished to gain equality. She preferred her term [...] "art istorical" [...] (without the h), so as to reject the [...] "his" [...] in history.|$|E
