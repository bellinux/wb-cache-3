5|$|Spectre {{was filmed}} from December 2014 to July 2015, with {{locations}} in Austria, the United Kingdom, Italy, Morocco and Mexico. The action scenes prioritised practical effects and stunts, while still employing computer-generated imagery made by five different companies.

5|$|Preliminary work on L.A. Noire {{began after}} the {{founding}} of developer Team Bondi in 2003. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, work was shared between the core team and multiple other studios owned by publisher Rockstar Games. Unlike other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses a custom engine, which includes a combination of facial motion capture and animation software. The game also uses MotionScan to capture actor's facial expressions. BBC News reporter Kev Geoghegan estimated that the development budget for the game exceeded US$50 million, making L.A. Noire <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> video games ever made.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary work on Red Dead Redemption {{began in}} 2005; full {{development}} commenced in 2006, following {{the formation of}} a core development team. Rockstar San Diego co-opted a number of other studios owned by parent company Rockstar Games to facilitate development between a full team of over 800. Media analysts estimated the development budget for the game was between US$80 million and US$100 million, making Red Dead Redemption <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> video games ever made.|$|E
5|$|The Leopard2E {{replaced}} the Leopard2A4 in Spanish mechanized units, {{which in turn}} replaced M60s in cavalry units. Both versions of the Leopard 2 are expected to remain in service with the Spanish army until 2025. In terms of industrial scale, the production {{and development of the}} Leopard2E represents a total of 2.6million man-hours of work, including 9,600 in Germany. It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> Leopard 2s built; the original contract was worth €1,910m but the final cost was €2,399m.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{planning}} for T2 3-D: Battle Across Time {{began in the}} early 1990s. It was originally developed for Universal Studios Florida, with producers pushing for a second installation in Universal Studios Hollywood during development. The original attraction cost a total of $60 million. With a total run time of 12 minutes, the film alone cost $24 million, making it <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> films per minute in the world. The attraction opened in the Hollywood area of Universal Studios Florida on April 27, 1996, to very positive reviews. Additional venues were later announced for Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Japan.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pilot}} was set in and around Boston, {{production}} was set in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The episode cost $10 million to produce, making it <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> pilots in television history. Following the pilot's filming, production for the series moved to New York. The producers were forced to hire a new cow {{for the remainder of}} the season because they were not allowed to travel the original cow from Canada to New York. Production team members noted that they were prepared to paint new cows if viewers noted the differences in spots.|$|E
5|$|Apollo was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> American {{scientific}} programs ever. It {{cost more}} than $20 billion in 1960s dollars or an estimated $ in present-day US dollars. (In comparison, the Manhattan Project cost roughly $, accounting for inflation.) It used the Saturn rockets as launch vehicles, which were far bigger than the rockets built for previous projects. The spacecraft was also bigger; it had two main parts, the combined command and service module (CSM) and the lunar landing module (LM). The LM was to be left on the Moon and only the command module (CM) containing the three astronauts would eventually return to Earth.|$|E

5|$|Rockstar San Diego {{began to}} develop Red Dead Redemption in 2005. Development was {{conducted}} {{by a team of}} more than 800 people, including Rockstar San Diego's core team and staff from parent company Rockstar Games's studios around the world. The game runs on the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), which was improved for the game to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities. The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and rendering tasks. Having exhausted the use of previous hardware on previous projects, Rockstar felt inspired after realising the potential power of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget between US$80 million and US$100 million, which would make it <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> video games ever made.|$|E
5|$|The Calgary {{games were}} at the time <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> Olympics ever held, but the {{organizing}} committee turned record television and sponsorship revenue into a net surplus {{that was used to}} maintain the facilities built for the Olympics and develop the Calgary region into the heart of Canada's elite winter sports program. The five purpose-built venues continue to be used in their original functions, and have helped the country develop into one of the top nations in Winter Olympic competition; Canada more than quintupled the five medals it won in Calgary at the 2010 games, the next Winter Olympics hosted on Canadian soil in Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|The California condor {{conservation}} project may be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> {{species conservation}} projects in United States history, costing over $35million, including $20million in {{federal and state}} funding, since World War II. As of 2007 the annual cost for the condor conservation program was around $2.0 million per year. However, nesting milestones have been recently reached by the reintroduced condors. In 2003, the first nestling fledged in the wild since 1981. In March 2006, a pair of California condors, released by Ventana Wildlife Society, attempted to nest in a hollow tree near Big Sur, California. This {{was the first time}} in more than 100 years that a pair of California condors had been seen nesting in Northern California.|$|E

5|$|The Leopard2E {{is a major}} {{improvement}} over the M60 Patton tank, which it replaced in Spain's mechanized and armored units. Its development represented a total of 2.6million man-hours worth of work, 9,600 of them in Germany, at a total cost of 2.4billion euros. This makes it <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> Leopard 2s built. Indigenous production amounted to 60% and the vehicles were assembled locally at Sevilla by Santa Bárbara Sistemas. It has thicker armor on the turret and glacis plate than the German Leopard 2A6, and uses a Spanish-designed tank command and control system, {{similar to the one}} fitted in German Leopard 2s. The Leopard2E is expected to remain in service until 2025.|$|E
5|$|The film's set {{designers}} Eugène Lourié and Max Douy built <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> sets in French film {{history at}} the Joinville Studio. According to Douy they {{were based on the}} script and were not reproductions of the interior of Chateau de la Ferté-Saint-Aubin, where exterior scenes were shot. The music boxes used in the film were borrowed from several sources and some are now in a museum in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Renoir thought the musical organ scene and Dalio's performance in it was the best scene he had ever filmed. He shot the scene several times before he was satisfied with it. The costumes for the film were designed by Coco Chanel.|$|E
5|$|The {{street was}} built on fields {{surrounding}} Clarendon House on Piccadilly, which were developed by Sir Thomas Bond. It was built up in the 1720s, {{and by the end}} of the 18th century was a popular place for the upper-class residents of Mayfair to socialise. Prestigious and expensive shops were established along the street, but it declined as a centre of social activity in the 19th century, although it held its reputation as a fashionable place for retail, and is home to the auction houses Sotheby's and Bonhams (formerly Phillips) and the department stores Fenwick and Tiffany's. It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> and sought after strips of real estate in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Universal Studios, {{which had}} won the bidding war for the film, was hoping to take {{advantage}} of Belushi's popularity in the wake of Saturday Night Live, Animal House, and the Blues Brothers' musical success; it soon found itself unable to control production costs. The start of filming was delayed when Aykroyd, new to film screenwriting, took six months to deliver a long and unconventional script that Landis had to rewrite before production, which began without a final budget. On location in Chicago, Belushi's partying and drug use caused lengthy and costly delays that, along with the destructive car chases depicted onscreen, made the final film <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> comedies ever produced.|$|E
5|$|As {{with every}} game prior to Final Fantasy VII, Square had {{continued}} to use the passion-based game development approach present with their early projects, but now had the resources and ambition to create the game they wanted. This was because they had extensive capital from their earlier commercial successes, which meant they could focus on quality and scale rather than obsessing over their budget. Final Fantasy VII eventually became ranked as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> video game projects at the time, coming in at an estimated $40 million USD, which adjusted for inflation came to $61 million in 2017. Development of the final version lasted just over a year, and included a staff of between 100 and 150 people. As video game development teams were usually only 20 people, the game had what was described as the largest development team of any game up to that point. The development team was split between both Square's Japanese offices and its new American office in Los Angeles, with the American team primarily responsible for city backgrounds.|$|E
5|$|Costume {{designer}} Christine Peters crafted the episode's baseball uniforms {{after visiting}} Sports Robe, a Hollywood costume house. Dena Green from the hair department gave extras haircuts {{so that they}} would be {{in the style of the}} 1940s. Car coordinator Kelly Padovich rented two 1947 model Flxible buses for the Roswell Greys on-bus scenes, as well as various other 1930s- and 1940s-era cars. Researcher Lee Smith worked with the Baseball Hall of Fame to ensure the accuracy of the statistics used in the episode. The props department developed from scratch the Peter Rosebud Bank that Dales shows Mulder; it was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>expensive</b> props of the season. The score by Mark Snow, the show's composer, was recorded with musicians rather than synthesizers for the first time in the series' history; slide guitar player Nick Kirgo and harmonica performer Tommy Morgan assisted Snow with the music.|$|E
