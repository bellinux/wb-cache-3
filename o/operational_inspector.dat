40|$|School {{inspection}} {{has formed}} {{part of both}} English and Swedish approaches to governing education for some time now. But latterly due to the neo liberal drive for educational excellence, both countries have remodelled their inspector work-force. Using Jacobsson's theory of governance as a regulative, meditative and inquisitive activity, this chapter investigates the effects that these shifts have had on the <b>operational</b> work of <b>inspectors.</b> Drawing upon interview data with inspectors and head teachers from both systems combined with documentary analysis we examine how the remodelling of the workforce in both countries has impacted on {{the ways in which}} inspectors carry out their work. The chapter concludes that inspection operating within a neo liberal framework of regulation must constantly shift and evolve in order to remain credible. It also points out that these shifts in themselves create tensions around the role and <b>operational</b> work of <b>inspectors</b> in both countries...|$|R
50|$|Within the British police, {{inspector}} is {{the second}} supervisory rank. It is senior to that of sergeant, but junior to that of chief inspector. The rank is mostly <b>operational,</b> meaning that <b>inspectors</b> are directly concerned with day-to-day policing. Uniformed inspectors are often responsible for supervising a duty shift made up of constables and sergeants, or act in specialist roles such as supervising road traffic policing.|$|R

Officers of Police act primarily as managers and generally do not partake in <b>operational</b> policing. An <b>Inspector</b> {{is in charge of}} a section. A Detective Inspector is normally in charge of the whole station CIB. A uniform Inspector is normally in charge of the stations operations.|$|R

A few months later he was named {{chief of staff of the}} Prussian forces that were being assembled to observe, and if necessary to suppress, revolutionary agitation in Poland. It was in the course of the latter assignment that Clausewitz contracted the cholera from which he died the following year, leaving On War in the unfinished state in which it has come down to us. The undated manuscript of the Campaign of 1815 was found among his surviving papers and included among the collected works published under his wifeâ€™s supervision a few years later...|$|R
