500|$|Rix {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth between her two ailing family members until, on 2 September 1914, Elsie died. For three months Rix withheld the news from her mother, fearing it would harm her already fragile condition. Elizabeth survived the news, but as the war continued, Rix's artistic output dwindled almost to nothing. Then in March 1916, Elizabeth died. Rix was just over thirty years old, and all her immediate relatives were now dead. Recalling the experience, she later wrote: [...] "I could scarcely put <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the other and walked like an old thing".|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E

2500|$|The best-known {{types of}} Archaic {{sculpture}} are the kouros and kore, near life-size frontal statues {{of a young}} man or woman, which were developed around the middle of the seventh century BC in the Cyclades. [...] Probably the earliest kore produced was the Dedication of Nikandre, which was dedicated to Artemis at her temple on Delos between 660 and 650 BC, while kouroi began to be created shortly after this. [...] Kouroi and korai were used to represent both humans and divinities. [...] Some kouroi, such as the Colossus of the Naxians from around 600 BC, are known to represent Apollo, while the Phrasikleia Kore was meant to represent a young woman whose tomb it originally marked. Early in the seventh century around 650 BC when kore are widely introduced, Daedalic style made an appearance in Greek sculpture. This style consisted most noticeably of a geometric pattern of female subjects' hair framing their face. On male sculptures they were often posed with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front,</b> as if <b>in</b> motion.|$|R

They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the other.

Wat had hardly got back into his saddle when there was a clatter behind him like the fall of a woodstack, and there was the top bar in splinters, the horse on its belly, and the huntsman on hands and knees half a dozen yards in front of him. Wat pulled up for an instant, for the fall was a smasher; but he saw old Joe spring to his feet and get to his horse's bridle. The horse staggered up, but the moment it put <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the other, Wat saw that it was hopelessly lame--a slipped shoulder and a six weeks' job. There was nothing he could do, and Joe was shouting to him not to lose the hounds, so off he went again, the one solitary survivor of the whole hunt. When a man finds himself there, he can retire from fox-hunting, for he has tasted the highest which it has to offer. I remember once when I was out with the Royal Surrey--but I'll tell you that story afterwards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of a}} rehabilitation program using virtual reality (VR) in addition to conventional therapy for improvement of balance (BERG scale) and functional independence (FIM scale) in chronic stroke patients. Ten individuals, mean age of 51. 4 (± 6. 7 years), participated of eight 60 -minute sessions comprising kinesiotherapy (15 min), Nintendo Wii (30 min) and Learning transfer (15 min) exercises. After training, nonparametric statistical analysis showed significant improvement in total FIM (p=. 01) and BERG scores (p=. 00), and in some of their subitems: FIM - dressing lower body (p=. 01), transfer to bathtub/shower (p=. 02) and locomotion: stairs (p=. 03); BERG - reaching forward with outstretched arm (p=. 01), retrieving object from the floor (p=. 04), turning 360 º (p=. 01), placing alternate foot on step (p&# 8804;. 01), standing with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> (p=. 01), and one leg stand (p=. 03). These findings suggest a positive influence of virtual reality exercises adjunct to conventional therapy on rehabilitation of balance and functionality post stroke, and indicate the feasibility of the proposed VR-based rehabilitation program...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{examine whether}} {{selection}} of the nonparetic or paretic leg as the weight-bearing leg in item 13 (standing unsupported <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front)</b> and item 14 (standing on one leg) of the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) influences the item scores, and thus the total score. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting University-based rehabilitation laboratory. Participants Community-dwelling people (N= 63, aged ≥ 50 y) with chronic stroke. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measure BBS. Results The 4 BBS total scores ranged from 48. 4 to 50. 7. The total score was significantly lower when a participant was asked to step forward with the nonparetic leg in item 13, and stand on the paretic leg in item 14. Fewer participants received a maximum score with the BBS 1 formulation than the others. In addition, the correlations with walking speed and Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale scores were greatest with the BBS 1 score. Conclusions Our findings suggest that BBS 1 was the most challenging formulation for our participants; this might serve to minimize the ceiling effect of the BBS. These findings provide a rationale for amending the BBS administration guidelines with the BBS 1 formulation. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
50|$|The basic {{technique}} {{stands in}} contrast to hunt and peck typing in which the typist keeps his or {{her eyes on the}} source copy at all times. Touch typing also involves the use of the home row method, where typists keep their wrists up, rather than resting them on a desk or keyboard (which can cause carpal tunnel syndrome). To avoid this, typists should sit up tall, leaning slightly forward from the waist, place their {{feet flat on the floor}} <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> slightly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other, and keep their elbows close to their sides with forearms slanted slightly upward to the keyboard; fingers should be curved slightly and rest on the home row.|$|R

50|$|A front walkover is an acrobatic {{movement}} sequence. It {{begins with}} the performer standing up straight with arms raised and positioned near to the ears. The performer then lunges forward and quickly raises one leg, with the other leg following as if transitioning to a handstand. The legs are held straight in a split as they travel overhead. The back is then arched until the leading foot touches the floor, such that the performer is briefly in a back bridge position. After the trailing foot reaches the floor, the performer returns to a standing position. <b>In</b> gymnastics, a <b>front</b> walkover typically ends with <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> extended <b>in</b> <b>front</b> and arms raised. Front walkovers are performed in various activities, including acro dance, circus, and gymnastics.|$|R
50|$|Acrobats {{maintain}} their balance by positioning their {{centre of mass}} directly over their base of support, i.e. shifting most of their weight over their legs, arms or whatever part of their body they are using to hold them up.

In the case of highwire-walkers, their feet are parallel with each other, <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> positioned <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other while on the wire. Therefore, a tightwire walker's sway is side to side, their lateral support having been drastically reduced. In both cases, whether side by side or parallel, the ankle is the pivot point.|$|R

5|$|Jack Broughton, {{a celebrated}} boxing {{champion}} (and another {{who was also}} a swordsman), had gone some way to defining the rules of prizefighting in 1743, based on earlier work by Figg, but by Johnson's time the rules were still interpreted very loosely. The style of fighting was also very different from modern boxing; the contestants stood facing each other squarely with their <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> line and their fists raised level <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of them, rather than the present-day stance of generally having <b>one</b> <b>foot</b> slightly <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the other and one fist leading. Brute strength was the primary factor for success and knock-downs were frequent, a consequence of the instability inherent in the positioning of the fighters' feet. Rounds were not timed but instead lasted until a man was knocked down, with fighters permitted to wrestle each other to the ground. Moving around the ring, known as shifting, was deprecated and sometimes explicitly prohibited by the rules for a fight; going to ground without being hit could lead to claims that the man still standing had won. The fighters usually each provided an umpire of their choice, and there might also be a third, independent umpire present, to adjudicate between them.|$|R
