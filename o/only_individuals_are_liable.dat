50|$|However, the Khatt-i Humayun firman in 1856 - a {{cornerstone}} of the tanzimat reform process - explicitly granted more equal tax treatment to people of all religions. This would have abolished {{the use of the}} cizye system to maintain an all-Muslim army; but there was little interest in creating a multi-faith army, so the Porte replaced the cizye with bedl-i askeri, a tax which was only payable by non-Muslims who would have <b>been</b> <b>liable</b> for conscription. The bedl-i askeri was set at 50 lira per person. Not all men within a certain age-range would have <b>been</b> <b>liable</b> for conscription (in order to maintain a certain size of army), so <b>only</b> certain <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> <b>liable</b> - and the proportion shrank as the empire's population grew. Over time, this bedl-i askeri began to be shared out amongst most nonchristian men, not just those who would have been conscripted, so the new tax came to resemble the old cizye again, and each person's share might only be 5 to 7 piasters.|$|R

40|$|Abax ater (Coleoptera: Carabidae) was {{studied in}} a near-climax {{beechwood}} in Belgium. Population density fluctuated around {{an average of}} 2062 individuals per hectare, a roughly constant value for 13 yr. Locomotor activity was weakly correlated with daily temperature, and was higher in males. The spatial distribution of activity was weakly contagious, and increasingly approached a random distribution at larger scales. The contagious distribution was not explained by a small-scale heterogeneity in either temperature or food quantity. Movements appeared to conform to a typical random walk over relatively short distances; mean distance covered per day by males was 1. 8 m.

However, the court failed to address issues of “divided” direct infringement, where two or more entities combine and together complete each and every step of a method claim, but no single entity does all of the steps. This Note walks through the history of the judicial interpretation of §§ 271 (b) and (c) up until Akamai v. Limelight, discusses the decision itself, and acknowledges the accompanying criticism. This Note proposes a reformed test for cases of divided infringement: a finding of divided direct infringement should be a prerequisite for §§ 271 (b) and (c) liability, but divided direct infringement liability under § 271 (a) should not be possible absent the alleged infringer meeting the single entity rule...|$|R

40|$|Population {{synchrony}} over various geographical scales {{is known}} {{from a large}} number of taxa. Three main hypotheses have been put forward as explanations to this phenomenon. First, correlated environmental disturbances (so called Moran effect). Moran showed that at least for linear models, the population synchrony would exactly match that of the corresponding environment. Second, the migration, or dispersal, of <b>individuals</b> <b>is</b> <b>liable</b> to cause population synchrony. Third, nomadic predators have been proposed as a synchronising mechanism. In this paper, I analyse the first two explanations by linearizing a general population model with spatial structure. From this linear approximation I derive an expression for the population synchrony. The major results are: 1) Population synchrony can vary significantly depending on the timing of the population census. 2) The environmental correlation is always important. It sets the 'base level' of synchrony. 3) Dispersal is only an effective synchronising mechanism when the local dynamics are at least close to unstable. 4) These results are valid even in a model with delayed density dependence - with possibly cyclic dynamics. Time lag structure has little effect on synchrony. Some of the predictions presented here are supported by data from the literature...|$|R
