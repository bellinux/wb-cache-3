40|$|This {{study is}} about the types and {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech produced by Leopold in Kate and Leopold movie. The writer wants {{to find out the}} kind <b>of</b> Leopold?s <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech in his utterances and also to analyze the function <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech itself. The writer uses Perrine?s theory to analyzing types <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech and Searle?s theory to analyzing the function <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech. The writer describes this research design, in this case, the approach of the study and how she collects and analyzes the data. She uses qualitative approach as the method of the study. The analysis itself consists of choosing the type <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech, deciding the function <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech and mapping both of them into a table. From the findings, the writer may infer several points. From the findings, {{it can be seen that}} the most dominated <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech that Leopold used are simile and hyperbole. Moreover, the highest number <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech that can be seen in this study is hyperbole; it can be meant that the movie writer likes to express his message with exaggerated words. From the language function, the writer found that in this study the most dominated language function is expressive types. It can be conclude that <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech can be used to express feeling that can not or hard to explain through ordinary sentence. <b>Figure</b> <b>of</b> speech also helps to make the function of a sentence clearer and stronger...|$|R

5|$|Initially, as {{in some of}} the {{continental}} cathedrals, the interior was decorated with designs emphasizing the arch ribs and portal components. Even the brick was painted with red and white stripes. In the 15th century, frescos <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> in the Late Gothic style with decorative vine leaves were painted {{in various parts of the}} church. Traces of these have been found in the chancel and in the chapel which was originally dedicated to St Eric and St Olaf. Unfortunately, they have now been heavily restored.

He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size <b>of</b> <b>figures.</b> The underdrawings reveal a draughtsman of skill, dynamism and confidence; the figures appear fully formed with little evidence of reworking. Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled, for example St Ursula's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints, which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems.|$|E
