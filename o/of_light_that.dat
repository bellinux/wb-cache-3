5|$|Panavision 3D was {{a system}} for {{presenting}} 3-D film in a digital cinema. It was a passive stereoscopic 3D system that utilized spectral comb filters produced using thin-film optics technology. In such systems, the visible spectrum is broken into alternate bands <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>that</b> evenly span the entire visible spectrum.|$|E
5|$|Once a field {{had been}} selected, an observing {{strategy}} {{had to be}} developed. An important decision was to determine which filters the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including narrowband filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest, and broadband filters useful {{for the study of}} the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF depended on the 'throughput' of each filter—the total proportion <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>that</b> it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with bandpasses overlapping as little as possible were desirable.|$|E
5|$|Some animals {{including}} cephalopods like squid {{are able}} to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling. The mechanisms include reversible proteins which can be switched between two configurations. The configuration of reflectin proteins in chromatophore cells in {{the skin of the}} Doryteuthis pealeii squid is controlled by electric charge. When charge is absent, the proteins stack together tightly, forming a thin, more reflective layer; when charge is present, the molecules stack more loosely, forming a thicker layer. Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers, the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>that</b> is reflected.|$|E

50|$|Matches {{are three}} minutes long. During a match, two robots {{do their best}} to destroy each other using {{whatever}} means available. The match begins by a series <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> flash from yellow to green. The original Comedy Central version used a standard Christmas tree as seen in the sport of drag racing; the ABC revival uses just one box <b>of</b> <b>lights</b> <b>that</b> flash yellow three times, and then flash green.|$|R
5|$|The ponies {{collect the}} Elements and re-approach Discord, who casually passes off their threat. However, with all six ponies restored, the Elements activate, firing a rainbow-beam <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>that</b> engulfs Discord and Ponyville. In moments, Ponyville has been {{returned}} to normal and Discord is once again turned to stone. The ponies' victory is celebrated by a large ceremony at Canterlot, led by Celestia, who praises their heroism {{and the power of}} their friendship and reveals a new stained-glass window of the six ponies defeating Discord.|$|E
5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>that</b> appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E
5|$|As the Scions mourn their fallen comrade, Aymeric parleys for aid in Ishgard's {{defense against}} Nidhogg's forces. Minfilia and Alphinaud reluctantly pledge {{the support of}} the Scions and Crystal Braves, though the other Grand Company leaders decline to provide assistance, citing {{domestic}} troubles and remembering Ishgard's reticence during the three Garlean invasions. The adventurer leads a band of volunteers at the Steps of Faith, Ishgard's main bridge. They manage to repel the attack and a victory celebration is held at Ul'dah with the hopes of pressuring Ishgard to rejoin the Alliance. At the banquet, Sultana Nanamo Ul Namo privately discloses to the Warrior <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> <b>that</b> she plans to dissolve the monarchy in order to erode the power of the Syndicate which is the source of much of Ul'dah's corruption. However, the sultana's wine is poisoned and Teledji Adeledji bursts in to accuse the player of regicide just as Nanamo takes her last breath. Adeledji brings the adventurer forward to the banquet with his charges and denounces Raubahn for his negligence. Enraged, Raubahn murders Adeledji but Lolorito, another scheming Syndicate member, takes this as proof of Raubahn's guilt and has him arrested. The Crystal Braves are revealed to be in the pay of Lolorito and attempt to apprehend the fleeing Scions who are taken out one by one. Only a humbled Alphinaud and the Warrior of Light manage to escape with the help of Raubahn's son Pipin Tarupin. Cid takes them to Coerthas where the grateful Ishgardians grant them asylum from the Syndicate's pursuers.|$|E

5|$|The {{spectrum}} <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>that</b> {{comes from}} a single source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the spectrum of various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If {{the same pattern of}} intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below. Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency- or wavelength-range. In order to calculate the redshift one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source, in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require travelling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).|$|E

50|$|Cometary nuclei {{are among}} the darkest objects known {{to exist in the}} Solar System. The Giotto probe found that Comet Halley's nucleus {{reflects}} approximately 4% <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> <b>that</b> falls on it, and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects only 2.5-3.0% <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> <b>that</b> falls on it; by comparison, fresh asphalt reflects 7% <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> <b>that</b> falls on it.
