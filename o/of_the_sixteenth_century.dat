5|$|There {{are almost}} no {{reliable}} sources {{with which to}} track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest {{that by the end}} of the Middle Ages, the Black Death and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the plague, may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as half a million people. Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b> Almost half the years in the second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> saw local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584-8, 1595 and 1597–1609.|$|E
5|$|From this {{changing}} society emerged a common, unifying musical language, {{in particular}} the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school. The development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale.

Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated in the second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> in the work of composers such as Palestrina, Lassus, Victoria and William Byrd.|$|E

5|$|Although {{absolute}} {{in theory}} and in principle, the sultan's powers were limited in practice. Political decisions had {{to take into account}} the opinions and attitudes of important members of the dynasty, the bureaucratic and military establishments, as well as religious leaders. Beginning in the last decades <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the role of the Ottoman sultans in the government of the empire began to decrease, in a period known as the Transformation of the Ottoman Empire. Despite being barred from inheriting the throne, women of the Imperial Harem—especially the reigning sultan's mother, known as the Valide Sultan—also played an important behind-the-scenes political role, effectively ruling the empire during the period known as the Sultanate of Women.|$|E
5|$|In about 1500 the Scottish monarchy {{turned to}} the {{recording}} of royal likenesses in panel portraits. More impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> but it flourished after the Reformation. James VI employed Flemish artists Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson, who have left behind a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone, who was succeeded {{by a series of}} portrait painters as the fashion moved down the social scale to lairds and burgesses.|$|E
5|$|In {{between these}} works he {{found time to}} write Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy at the beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> and it is recorded {{as a form of}} typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.|$|E

5|$|Karnataka {{also has}} {{a special place in}} the world of Indian {{classical}} music, with both Karnataka (Carnatic) and Hindustani styles finding place in the state, and Karnataka has produced a number of stalwarts in both styles. The Haridasa movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> contributed significantly to the development of Karnataka (Carnatic) music as a performing art form. Purandara Dasa, one of the most revered Haridasas, is known as the Karnataka Sangeeta Pitamaha ('Father of Karnataka a.k.a. Carnatic music'). Celebrated Hindustani musicians like Gangubai Hangal, Mallikarjun Mansur, Bhimsen Joshi, Basavaraja Rajaguru, Sawai Gandharva and several others hail from Karnataka, and some of them have been recipients of the Kalidas Samman, Padma Bhushan and Padma Vibhushan awards. Noted Carnatic musicians include Violin T. Chowdiah, Veena Sheshanna, Mysore Vasudevachar, Doreswamy Iyengar and Thitte Krishna Iyengar.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{development was}} dominated by the Occident from 1400 on, indeed, the most profound changes occurred during the Renaissance period. Instruments took on other purposes than accompanying singing or dance, and performers used them as solo instruments. Keyboards and lutes developed as polyphonic instruments, and composers arranged increasingly complex pieces using more advanced tablature. Composers also began designing pieces of music for specific instruments. In the latter half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> orchestration came into common practice {{as a method of}} writing music for a variety of instruments. Composers now specified orchestration where individual performers once applied their own discretion. The polyphonic style dominated popular music, and the instrument makers responded accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland {{has been}} seen as {{reaching}} its peak in the first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> between the reigns of James IV and the deposition of Mary Queen of Scots. The loss of the church as a source of patronage in the 1560s and the court in 1603, changed and limited the further development of Renaissance ideas. In the same period civic humanism began to give way to private devotion and retreat from the world influenced by Stoicism. In art and architecture, Renaissance proportion began to give way to Mannerism and the more exaggerated style of the Baroque from about 1620.|$|E

5|$|The artist {{emerged in}} 1489 {{as part of}} the {{cultural}} world of Milan, beginning a successful career that turned him into a leading exponent of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia, distinguishing himself with works of cultural import such as his cycle of the Caesars for the Loggia palace in Brescia, as well as the Martinengo mausoleum. He introduced a powerful and highly expressive classical taste, as opposed to the hitherto existing refined decorativeness. During the first decade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Gasparo was able to win over public and private clients who sought to translate into stone their pride in their supposed historical descent from ancient Rome.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b> In his majority James V was probably {{more concerned with}} architectural expressions of royal identity. Mary Queen of Scots had been {{brought up in the}} French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, {{with the exception of the}} joint portrait with her second husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where heraldic display, or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait.|$|E
5|$|The work at Salò and {{associated}} documentation, reconstructed through the numerous bills and payments, {{attests to the}} complex relationship between Cairano and Mangiacavalli. They shared staff, which was directed by either of them depending on who was on site.

However, Cairano's attention was not directed to Salò, which he visited rarely, or even to San Pietro in Oliveto, which was mainly run by Sanmicheli, but to two works of greater importance and resonance: the grand staircase of the Loggia and the arch at Sant'Apollonio.|$|E

5|$|From a low base at the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> trade expanded in the 1530s, but suffered from the English invasions of the Rough Wooing in the 1540s. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The fortunes of Scottish burghs in the export trade changed across the century. Haddington, which {{had been one of}} the major centres of trade in the late Medieval period, saw its share of foreign exports collapse in the sixteenth century. Aberdeen's share of trade remained stable for most of the century, but slumped in the last decade. The small Fife ports grew in significance and Edinburgh took an increasing share of trade through its port of Leith. This forced smaller ports to diversify into other commodities and to undertake more coastal trading. Overall there was an increase in foreign trade from the 1570s, of which Edinburgh received the major share.|$|E
5|$|From the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century</b> {{through the}} eighteenth century, a period known as Reformed orthodoxy, Reformed baptismal {{theology}} {{further developed the}} covenantal meaning of baptism. Theologians more carefully defined the sacramental union of baptism, or {{the relationship between the}} outward washing with that which it signifies. In the high orthodox period (middle to late seventeenth century), theologians such as Hermann Witsius expanded the covenantal meaning of baptism using analogies such as Noah's Ark and the crossing of the Red Sea, which carried the theological themes of the resurrection and eternal life. This period also saw the emergence of Reformed Baptists. Reformed Baptist theologians had much in common with the Reformed, but saw baptism {{as a sign of the}} baptized's fellowship with Christ rather than a sign and seal of the covenant of grace, and as a result did not baptize their children.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Spain was split between two realms: Crown of Castile {{and the smaller}} Crown of Aragon. The marriage between King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile united the two crowns, and ultimately their grandson Charles would inherit both crowns (as Charles I of Spain, but better known as Charles V, per his regnal number as Holy Roman Emperor). Despite the union, the lands of the two crowns functioned very differently, with disparate laws, ruling priorities, and treatment of Muslims. There were also Muslims living in the Kingdom of Navarre, which was initially independent but was annexed by Castile in 1515. Forced conversion varied in timeline by ruling body: it was enacted by the Crown of Castile in 1500–1502, in Navarre in 1515–1516, and by the Crown of Aragon in 1523–1526.|$|E

5|$|Society in {{the urban}} {{settlements}} of the burghs was headed by wealthier merchants, who often held local office as a burgess, alderman, bailies, or {{as a member of}} the burgh council. Below them were craftsmen and workers that made up the majority of the urban population. Both merchants and craftsmen often served a long apprenticeship, acquiring skills and status, before they became freemen of a burgh, and could enjoy certain rights and privileges. Major sources of trade included the export of wool, fish, coal, salt and cattle. Imports included wine, sugar and other luxury goods. Important crafts included metal working, carpentry, leather working, pottery and later brewing and wig-making. There were frequent disputes between the burgesses and craftsmen over rights and political control of the burgh, occasionally bursting into violence, as occurred at Perth in the first half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
