The stars had a private bar, the Blues Club, built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> for themselves, crew, and friends. Carrie Fisher, Aykroyd's girlfriend at the time, says most of the bar's staff doubled as dealers, procuring any drug patrons desired.|$|E

5|$|During filming, {{the crew}} and several cast members objected to cinematographer Michael Seresin and camera {{operator}} John Stanier's European style of single-source lighting, which involved the use of incense burners.

5|$|House {{was filmed}} {{on one of}} Toho's largest sets, where Obayashi shot the film without a {{storyboard}} {{over a period of}} about two months. Obayashi described the attitude <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>set</b> as very upbeat as he often skipped, sang and played quiz games with the younger actresses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>set.</b> Despite having fun <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>set,</b> members of the Toho crew felt the film was nonsense. Obayashi found the acting of the seven girls to be poor while trying to direct them verbally. He began playing the film's soundtrack on set, which changed the way the girls were acting in the film as they got into the spirit of the music. Actress Kimiko Ikegami was uncomfortable about a nude scene in the film. To make her more comfortable, Yoko Minamida also took off her clothes. After Obayashi saw Minamida nude, he included a nude scene for her in the film which was not in the original script.|$|E
