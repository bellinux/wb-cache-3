5|$|Against the {{judgement}} <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{senior military}} officers, Hitler ordered {{an attack on}} France and the Low Countries, which began in May 1940. They quickly conquered Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium and France surrendered on 22 June. The unexpectedly swift defeat of France resulted in an upswing in Hitler's popularity and a strong upsurge in war fever.|$|E
5|$|Coggins {{taught his}} wife to paint, and she had success as an artist {{in her own right}} under the name Alma Woods. The couple would hold annual joint {{exhibitions}} for many years. Alma Coggins assisted her husband in the planning, research and typing <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> books, and he acknowledged her efforts with book dedications to her.|$|E
5|$|Well {{received}} by the show's fans, writers and directors, Abra has established an enduring popularity which has seen Edmondson invited back to the programme regularly. TV critics have proved almost entirely favourable to the character, even when commenting on the unrealistic quality <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> storylines.|$|E

25|$|The {{extent to}} which Theophrastus {{followed}} Aristotle's doctrines, or defined them more accurately, or conceived them in a different form, and what additional structures of thought he placed upon them, can only be partially determined because of the loss <b>of</b> so <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> writings. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> opinions have to be reconstructed from the works of later writers such as Alexander of Aphrodisias and Simplicius.|$|R
5|$|After resigning the {{presidency}} of MAC in 1879, Clark left academia to become {{the president of a}} mining company, Clark & Bothwell. The company, in operation from 1881 to 1882, purchased several silver mines, mostly in Utah and California. Clark's partner, John R. Bothwell, proved to be corrupt and the company quickly folded, destroying Clark's reputation, his own finances and the fortunes <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> friends and family. The subsequent scandal ruined Clark's health. He died of heart disease at his home in Amherst in 1886.|$|E
5|$|Chandler entered {{politics}} when he {{was named}} chairman of the Woodford County Democratic Committee. In 1928, he was appointed master commissioner of the Woodford County circuit court. The following year, he was elected as a Democrat to represent the Twenty-second district in the Kentucky Senate. As {{a member of the}} Senate, he was part of a Democratic coalition that passed legislation to strip Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> statutory powers.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare is well attested in sources {{contemporaneous}} {{with his}} reign. The tombs <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> courtiers {{and family members}} have been discovered in Giza, Saqqara and Abusir. They give insights into the administrative reforms that Djedkare conducted during his reign and, in a few cases, even record letters that the king sent to his officials. These letters, inscribed {{on the walls of}} tombs, typically present royal praises for the tomb owner.|$|E
50|$|Hazlewood wrote {{a number}} of {{instructional}} Scouting books, primarily on the subject <b>of</b> Scoutcraft. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> books were co-authored with his friend John Thurman.|$|R

50|$|As a painter, he {{specialized}} in baroque painting, religious paintings and the Great Plague <b>of</b> Marseille. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> paintings {{can be found}} in Roman Catholic churches in Provence.|$|R
5|$|During {{this time}} Ellet {{published}} several books. In 1839 she wrote The Characters of Schiller, a critical {{essay on the}} writer Friedrich Schiller including her translation <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> poems. She wrote Scenes in the Life of Joanna of Sicily, {{a history of the}} lifestyles of female nobility, and Rambles about the Country, a lively description of the scenery she had observed in her travels through the United States, in 1840. She continued writing poems, translations and essays on European literature which she contributed to the American Monthly, the North American Review, the Southern Literary Messenger, the Southern Quarterly Review and other periodicals. Ellet wrote abundantly {{in a wide variety of}} genres.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Alexander adopted some {{elements}} of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, {{and rarely}} visited by whalers {{or any other}} ships. If the party was to return to civilization it would be {{necessary}} to summon help. The only realistic way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800-mile (1,300km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island, because of the poor physical condition <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> party. Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia, but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.|$|E
50|$|After the war, {{he resumed}} {{his career as}} an architect. He {{took part in the}} {{reconstruction}} <b>of</b> Warsaw; <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> projects took him abroad (to Iraq, Peru, Yugoslavia and Vietnam).|$|R
50|$|English {{electronic}} musician Belbury Poly {{takes his}} name from the town <b>of</b> Belbury. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> peers on the Ghost Box Music label pay similar homage to Lewis' mythology of Belbury.|$|R

5|$|Fauré's {{ambidexterity}} {{is reflected}} in the layout <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard {{as well as in the}} bass. Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Laucke {{signed with}} the Waterloo Music Publishing Company, which that year {{published}} the sheet music of his transcription of Trois Gymnopédies, the first <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> transcriptions {{to be published by}} Waterloo and arguably the only version for guitar to include all of the notes of the original piano composition. In 1985, the company created The Michael Laucke Series of guitar arrangements and transcriptions.|$|E
5|$|In May 1878 Gaudí {{designed}} a display cabinet for the Esteban Comella glove factory, which was {{exhibited in the}} Spanish pavilion at the Paris World Exhibition that year. It was this work that {{attracted the attention of}} the entrepreneur Eusebi Güell, visiting the French capital; he was so impressed that he wanted to meet Gaudí on his return, beginning a long friendship and professional collaboration. Güell became Gaudí's main patron and sponsor <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> large projects.|$|E
50|$|Penn Jeffries Krouse (September 23, 1877-April 1944), usually {{known as}} P. J. Krouse was a {{prolific}} architect {{in the state}} <b>of</b> Mississippi. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> buildings were located in the Meridian area.|$|R

5|$|Johann Strauss I's {{influence}} over the local entertainment establishments meant {{that many of them}} were wary of offering the younger Strauss a contract for fear of angering the father. Strauss Jr. was able to persuade the Dommayer's Casino in Hietzing, a suburb of Vienna, to allow him to perform. The elder Strauss, in anger at his son's disobedience, and at that of the proprietor, refused to ever play at the Dommayer's Casino again, which had been the site <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> earlier triumphs.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's {{publications}} {{were rarely}} luxury goods: he priced his merchandise competitively, but always within {{the reach of}} the middle class, the audience he most wanted to serve. One way that he reduced costs was by printing texts in the provinces and then importing them to London; many of Priestley's works, for example, were printed locally in Birmingham. Johnson did not take great care with the printing <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> books; they are full of errors and poorly bound. But as they were often printed extremely quickly to respond to a particular event, this was expected by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's primary {{obligation}} as imperial mathematician {{was to provide}} astrological advice to the emperor. Though Kepler took {{a dim view of}} the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in Tübingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested in the work <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> court scholars (including numerous alchemists) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Jacobson {{published}} an update to his work, called Use Case 2.0, {{with the intention}} <b>of</b> incorporating <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> practical experiences <b>of</b> applying use cases since the original inception of the concept.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, Nieuwenhuys {{volunteered for}} the Royal Air Force, {{receiving}} Czechoslovakias Medal <b>of</b> Merit. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teammates, including compatriots Arthur Riley and Dirk Kemp, also enlisted in the British Armed Forces.|$|R
50|$|He {{worked in}} a wide variety <b>of</b> genres. <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works may be seen in the Museum of the Polish Peasant Movement. A street in the Azory {{district}} of Kraków is named after him.|$|R
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war, Huggins invited {{the leader of the}} opposition Labour Party, Harry Davies, to join a coalition government. Davies accepted without consulting his party caucus, much to the indignation <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries; Labour promptly split. The two Labour factions reconciled in 1943 and briefly threatened Huggins's premiership until a heated dispute over whether Labour should become multiracial led to the party's disintegration in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter's unpopularity led to {{the demise}} <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> proposals, {{regardless}} of their merits. He suggested a comprehensive system of public schools and, though the idea had been proposed by previous governors, Slaughter devised a means of funding it. The hostile legislature refused the plan and overrode Slaughter's vetoes of bills that allowed individual schools to be supported by lotteries. Slaughter further proposed a reform of the penal system and recommended internal improvements, including {{the creation of a}} state library. These measures were also rejected.|$|E
5|$|The 1840s were a {{turbulent}} decade in the Church of England. Following the earlier German Higher Critics, who {{argued for a}} historical approach to religious texts, David Strauss published Leben Jesu or The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined which argued that {{the events of the}} New Testament were not historical but rather mythical. In 1846 George Eliot published an English translation of Leben Jesu which became a source of religious doubts for Froude and many of his contemporaries. Critics have also identified Thomas Carlyle's novel Sartor Resartus and Spinoza as sources of Sutherland's doubts, and those <b>of</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries.|$|E
