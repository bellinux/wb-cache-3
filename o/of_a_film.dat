The project eventually collapsed when Coppola's American Zoetrope experienced financial problems. Tucker was revived in 1986 when Coppola's friend, George Lucas, joined as a producer.|$|E

Thuillier, a former colorist of glass and celluloid products, directed a studio of two hundred people painting directly on film stock with brushes, in the colors she chose and specified. Each worker was assigned a different color in assembly line style, with more than twenty separate colors often used for a single film. On average, Thuillier's lab produced about sixty hand-colored copies <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>film.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bartley and ÓBriain {{conceived}} {{of the film}} after Bartley returned from documenting {{the aftermath of the}} 1999 Vargas mudslides for an Irish charity. Following a visit to Venezuela to determine the feasibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> project, the pair formed a production company and applied to Ireland's film board, Bord Scannán na hÉireann (BSÉ), for a development grant. At BSÉ's request, the filmmakers partnered with a more experienced producer and shot a short pilot to show to potential investors. Funding for the €200,000 production was provided by BSÉ and several European broadcasters. Bartley and ÓBriain shot more than 200hours of material; editing focused on identifying footage that would make the film entertaining and drive the plot. It was at this stage that the film's coverage narrowed to concentrate more on the coup attempt.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{developed}} {{a passion for}} music {{as a child and}} taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> to be important, and from A Woman of Paris onwards he took an increasing interest in this area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for City Lights (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.|$|E
5|$|During filming on December 28, 1996, filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola filed {{a lawsuit}} against Warner Bros. and Sagan, who had died the {{previous}} week. Coppola claimed that Sagan's novel was based on a story the pair had developed for a television special back in 1975, titled First Contact. Under their development agreement, Coppola and Sagan were to split proceeds from the project, as well as from any novel Sagan would write, with American Zoetrope and Children's Television Workshop Productions. The TV program was never produced, but in 1985, Simon and Schuster published Contact and Warner moved forward with development <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> adaptation. Coppola sought at least $250,000 in compensatory damages and an injunction against production or distribution of the film.|$|E

5|$|During {{their first}} three appearances, the art {{competitions}} were grouped into five broad categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. The Dutch Organizing Committee for the 1928 Summer Olympics split these into subcategories {{in the hopes}} of increasing participation. Although it was a successful strategy, the 1932 Summer Olympics eliminated several of these subcategories, which led to fewer entries in the broader categories. For the 1936 Summer Olympics, the German government proposed the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> contest to the program, which was rejected.|$|E
5|$|Films {{generate}} {{income from}} several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings {{are the primary}} metric for trade publications in assessing the success <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>film,</b> mostly because {{of the availability of}} the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{followed}} the disappointment of For Your Eyes Only with Thunderball, the novelization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>film</b> script {{on which he}} had worked with others. The work had started in 1958 when Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce introduced him to a young Irish writer and director, Kevin McClory, and the three, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, worked on a script. In October McClory introduced experienced screenwriter Jack Whittingham to the newly formed team, and by December 1959 McClory and Whittingham sent Fleming a script. Fleming had been having second thoughts on McClory's involvement and, in January 1960, explained his intention of delivering the screenplay to MCA, with a recommendation from him and Bryce that McClory act as producer. He additionally told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory's involvement, then McClory should either sell himself to MCA, {{back out of the}} deal, or file a suit in court.|$|E
