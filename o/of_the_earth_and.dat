40|$|This {{research}} {{intends to}} develop a method based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict permanent earthquake-induced deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> dams <b>and</b> embankments. For this purpose, data sets of observations from 152 published case histories on <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> dams <b>and</b> embankments, during the past earthquakes, was used. In order to predict earthquake-induced deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> dams <b>and</b> embankments a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) analysis was used. A four-layer, feed-forward, back-propagation neural network, with a topology of 7 - 9 - 7 - 1 {{was found to be}} optimum. The results showed that an appropriately trained neural network could reliably predict permanent earthquake-induced deformation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> dams <b>and</b> embankments...|$|R

5|$|Rock {{units are}} first emplaced either by {{deposition}} {{onto the surface}} or intrude into the overlying rock. Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> <b>and</b> later lithify into sedimentary rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows, blanket the surface. Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{instrument}} carried {{aboard the}} station was the BST-1M multispectral telescope, which could carry out astronomical observations in the infrared, ultraviolet and submillimetre spectra using a 1.5metre-diameter mirror which was operated in cryogenic conditions at around 269°C.

5|$|A {{pendulum}} hangs straight downwards in a symmetrical gravitational field. However, if {{a sufficiently}} large mass {{such as a}} mountain is nearby, its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's plumb-bob slightly out of true. The change in plumb-line angle against a known objectsuch as a starcould be carefully measured {{on opposite sides of}} the mountain. If the mass of the mountain could be independently established from a determination of its volume and an estimate of the mean density of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> by extension, its mass.|$|E
5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National Environmental Policy Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project.

A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{question}} of who would represent the Earth as a whole, contact could create other international problems, such as the degree of involvement of governments foreign to the one whose radio astronomers received the signal. The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before the launch of the Voyager probes, which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a golden record in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence. Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity, what format they should take, how to convey the cultural history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> what international groups should be formed to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail.|$|E
5|$|As the {{microscopic}} world was expanding, the macroscopic world was shrinking. Botanists such as John Ray worked {{to incorporate the}} flood of newly discovered organisms shipped from across the globe into a coherent taxonomy, and a coherent theology (natural theology). Debate over another flood, the Noachian, catalyzed the development of paleontology; in 1669 Nicholas Steno published an essay on how the remains of living organisms could be trapped in layers of sediment and mineralized to produce fossils. Although Steno's ideas about fossilization were well known and much debated among natural philosophers, an organic origin for all fossils would not be accepted by all naturalists {{until the end of}} the 18th century due to philosophical and theological debate about issues such as the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> <b>and</b> extinction.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{computer}} models, {{the presence of}} the Moon appears to stabilize the obliquity of the Earth, which may help the planet to avoid dramatic climate changes. This stability is achieved because the Moon increases the precession rate of the Earth's spin axis (that is, the precession motion of the ecliptic), thereby avoiding resonances between the precession of the spin and precession of the planet's orbital plane relative to that of Jupiter. However, as the semimajor axis of the Moon's orbit continues to increase, this stabilizing effect will diminish. At some point, perturbation effects will probably cause chaotic variations in the obliquity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> <b>and</b> the axial tilt may change by angles as high as 90° from the plane of the orbit. This is expected to occur between 1.5 and 4.5 billion years from now.|$|E
