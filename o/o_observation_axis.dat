40|$|International audienceSimulations of CO, N 2 O and CH 4 from a coupled chemistry-climate model (CMAM) are {{compared}} with satellite measurements from Odin Sub-Millimeter Radiometer (Odin/SMR), Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS), and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (Aura/MLS). Pressure-latitude cross-sections and seasonal time series demonstrate that CMAM reproduces the observed global CO, N 2 O, and CH 4 distributions quite well. Generally, excellent agreement with measurements is found between CO simulations and observations {{in the stratosphere}} and mesosphere. Differences between the simulations and the ACE-FTS observations are generally within 30 %, and the differences between CMAM results and SMR and MLS observations are slightly larger. These differences are comparable with {{the difference between the}} instruments in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. Comparisons of N 2 O show that CMAM results are usually within 15 % of the measurements in the lower and middle stratosphere, and the observations are close to each other. However, the standard version of CMAM has a low N 2 O bias in the upper stratosphere. The CMAM CH 4 distribution also reproduces the observations in the lower stratosphere, but has a similar but smaller negative bias in the upper stratosphere. The negative bias may be due to that the gravity drag is not fully resolved in the model. The simulated polar CO evolution in the Arctic and Antarctic agrees with the ACE and MLS observations. CO measurements from 2006 show evidence of enhanced descent of air from the mesosphere into the stratosphere in the Arctic after strong stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs). CMAM also shows strong descent of air after SSWs. In the tropics, CMAM captures the annual oscillation in the lower stratosphere and the semiannual oscillations at the stratopause and mesopause seen in Aura/MLS CO and N 2 <b>O</b> <b>observations</b> and in Odin/SMR N 2 <b>O</b> <b>observations.</b> The Odin/SMR and Aura/MLS N 2 <b>O</b> <b>observations</b> also show a quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) in the upper stratosphere, whereas, the CMAM does not have QBO included.

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} middle {{atmospheric}} water vapor (H 2 O) and ozone (O 3) measurements obtained by ground-based microwave radiometers at three European locations in Bern (47 ° N), Onsala (57 ° N) and Sodankylä (67 ° N) during Northern winter 2009 / 2010. In January 2010, a major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) {{occurred in the}} Northern Hemisphere whose signatures {{are evident in the}} ground-based observations of H 2 O and O 3. The observed anomalies in H 2 O and O 3 are mostly explained by the relative location of the polar vortex with respect to the measurement locations. The SSW started on 26 January 2010 and was most pronounced by the end of January. The zonal mean temperature in the middle stratosphere (10 hPa) increased by approximately 25 Kelvin within a few days. The stratospheric vortex weakened during the SSW and shifted towards Europe. In the mesosphere, the vortex broke down, which lead to large scale mixing of polar and midlatitudinal air. After the warming, the polar vortex in the stratosphere split into two weaker vortices and in the mesosphere, a new, pole-centered vortex formed with maximum wind speed of 70 m s − 1 at approximately 40 ° N. The shift of the stratospheric vortex towards Europe was observed in Bern as an increase in stratospheric H 2 O and a decrease in O 3. The breakdown of the mesospheric vortex during the SSW was observed at Onsala and Sodankylä as a sudden increase in mesospheric H 2 O. The following large-scale descent inside the newly formed mesospheric vortex was well captured by the H 2 <b>O</b> <b>observations</b> in Sodankylä.

The study {{is made in}} the area of the Canary Islands in the subtropical northern Atlantic. As reference we use well calibrated in situ measurements made aboard an aircraft (between 200 and 6800 m a. s. l.) by the dedicated ISOWAT instrument and on the island of Tenerife at two different altitudes (at Izaña, 2370 m a. s. l., and at Teide, 3550 m a. s. l.) by two commercial Picarro L 2120 -i water isotopologue analysers. The comparison to the ISOWAT profile measurements shows that the remote sensors can well capture the variations in the water vapour isotopologues, and the scatter with respect to the in situ references suggests a δD random uncertainty for the FTIR product of much better than 45 ‰ in the lower troposphere and of about 15 ‰ for the middle troposphere.
