5|$|In {{addition}} to this, the ACWF {{played an important}} role internationally for the CPC. As a communist country in the Cold War, China had difficulty establishing diplomatic connections. ACWF was able to reach out to women’s movements abroad, and even hosted 23 delegations from <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> for the Asia Women’s Representative Conference in December 1949. This enabled the PRC to go around the diplomatic blockade and forge connections with other countries. However, soon the Cultural Revolution would begin in China, which forced the ACWF to discontinue many of its policies.|$|E
5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian.

Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} Lactarius, Lactifluus and Russula are valued as {{excellent}} edible mushrooms.

5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as in <b>other</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> since at least the early modern period.

Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E
