He narrated Design e2, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson. In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> donating their services.

5|$|The {{basic model}} can be {{extended}} to incorporate a supra-game played by {{the governments of the}} respective countries. In this case, each government chooses the level of subsidy it will provide to its firm, taking the other government's action as given, and anticipating the reaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> (in terms of quantity produced) to the subsidy. Brander and Spencer show that in the resulting Nash equilibrium the governments choose a level of subsidy that is too high and hence they do not manage to maximize social welfare. In fact, if the good produced is not consumed domestically, then the optimal level of subsidy is negative – an export tax., where m is a competitively produced numéraire good This is because the total quantity produced in the Cournot and the Stackelberg equilibrium is higher than the profit maximizing collusive monopoly level of output. Since both the home and foreign firm are producing for a third market, an export tax could reduce the total quantity produced down to the monopoly level, thus increasing both firms' profits. In that way the governments can effect a collusive outcome between their firms, at the expanse of the third country which imports the good.|$|E

40|$|There is no {{necessary}} {{connection between}} academics’ theories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> and judicial theories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm.</b> Economists and legal scholars may adopt one theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm,</b> and courts may adopt another.

There is another interpretation of corporate law worth considering, however. This Essay hypothesizes that much of corporate legal doctrine can be explained differently—not as <b>the</b> legal adoption <b>of</b> a particular theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm,</b> but rather as a response to judicial uncertainty regarding <b>the</b> correct theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm.</b> Theories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firm</b> still matter on this account— they motivate judicial reasoning—but they are not specifically adopted by corporate law...|$|R

The focus of the group had switched firmly by the late 1980s to the Asda store chain. In 1988, Asda had also acquired the Waring & Gillow, Colonel Gee, and Maple & Co furniture brands and Maples stores. Co-branded stores under the Allied Maples banner had appeared on major retail parks. But, in 1993, the whole fresh food division, including the Asda Produce, fruit and vegetable sourcing, processing and packing plant in Normanton, Wakefield, was sold off in a management buyout to other dairy and food processors. In the same year, Maples was divested in a management buyout, and became an independent company again until it went into liquidation in 1997, and the stores were bought out by the now defunct Allders department store chain. Allied Carpets {{and some of the}} co-branded Allied Maples stores were sold off to the now defunct Carpetland. This means that Asda has since had no connection with any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>firms</b> from which its name was derived. Having effectively outgrown and divested of its original parent company, Associated Dairies, where it was only initially believed in 1965, that the tiny Asda supermarket division would only be a minor contributor to the dairy divisions profits, which at that time consisted of their wider and more profitable interests, including farms, dairies, butcher's shops, bakeries and doorstep milk deliveries.|$|E
