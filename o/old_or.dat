5|$|Endometrial cancer forms {{when there}} are errors in normal endometrial cell growth. Usually, when cells grow <b>old</b> <b>or</b> get damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and <b>old</b> <b>or</b> damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These {{abnormal}} cancer cells have many genetic abnormalities that cause them to grow excessively.|$|E

5|$|Cortinarius iodes {{produces}} a rusty-brown spore print. Spores are elliptical, with a finely roughened surface, measuring 8–10 by 5–6.5μm.

Both cheliocystidia and pleurocystidia are {{absent from the}} hymenium; the gill edge is populated by basidia and their undeveloped equivalents, basidioles. The cap cuticle comprises a distinctive layer of 3–8μm-wide hyphae that form a layer usually 110–125μm thick; this layer is less distinct or thinner in <b>old</b> <b>or</b> poorly preserved specimens. Clamp connections are present in hyphae throughout the fruit body.|$|E
5|$|Dominican {{folk music}} is an oral tradition, learned informally through {{watching}} others perform. As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 years <b>old</b> <b>or</b> under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the floods, strong winds blew away many roofs and some entire houses made of mud, leaving thousands of people homeless. The combined effects of the preceding floods and Eline left about 463,000people displaced or homeless, including 46,000children five years <b>old</b> <b>or</b> younger. Overall, the preceding floods and Eline caused about 700deaths, half of whom in Chokwe. with damage estimated at $500million (2000USD). At least 17people died directly due to Eline, although many bodies were washed away and unable to be counted.

5|$|It {{had long}} been Markham's {{practice}} {{to take note of}} promising young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. He had first observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and had remembered him. Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , was looking for a path to career advancement, and a chance meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to apply for the leadership of the expedition. Scott {{had long been}} in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too <b>old,</b> <b>or</b> were no longer available. With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander.|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization {{has defined}} {{pneumonia}} in children clinically based on either a cough or difficulty breathing and a rapid respiratory rate, chest indrawing, or a decreased level of consciousness.

5|$|The {{bog turtle}} spends its life almost {{exclusively}} in the wetland where it hatched.

The Bronx Zoo houses several turtles 35years <b>old</b> <b>or</b> more, the oldest known bog turtles. The zoo's collection has successfully sustained itself for more than 35years. The age of a bog turtle is determined by {{counting the number of}} rings in a scute, minus the first one (which develops before birth).|$|E
5|$|The {{legal status}} and rights of Roman slaves {{also began to}} change. During the time of Emperor Claudius (reigned 41–54 AD), a {{constitution}} was enacted that made the killing of an <b>old</b> <b>or</b> infirm slave an act of murder, and decreed that if such slaves were abandoned by their owners, they became freedmen. Under Antoninus Pius (reigned 138–161 AD), laws further extended the rights of slaves, holding owners responsible for the killing of slaves, forcing the sale of slaves when it could be shown {{that they were being}} mistreated, and providing a (theoretically) neutral third party to which a slave could appeal. While these legal changes occurred much too late to be direct results of the Third Servile War, they represent the legal codification of changes in the Roman attitude toward slaves that evolved over decades.|$|E
