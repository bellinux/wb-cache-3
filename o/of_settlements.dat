5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent argument has been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads <b>of</b> <b>settlements.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{studying}} spatial distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement,</b> inluding their variations and respective influencing facctors. The ultimated objetives to be ahieved are studying variation of dsitribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement,</b> and the contribution of socio-economi facctors to the existing distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> under varying topographic areas. The study is conducted in Klaten District, covering 401 villages in the district. A survey method is secondary data analysis. Data are analyzed statistically using T test, varians analysis, correlation, and multiple regresion. The research shows {{that there is no}} significant differences in distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> between the Merapi volcanic slope, the lowland, and the hilly zone. Physical factors are not significantly influencing the distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in various topographic zone. A neglegible ifference in the index distribution pattern <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> can be observed. Hilly zone of the district reveals an index of 0. 959. lower than those in the volcanis slope (1. 035) and in low land (1. 058). distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in various topographi zone are ditermine by different sets of socio-economic variables. In the volcanic zone two variables i. e. population density and the portion of sawah area are strongly influencing the distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement.</b> In this zone population density contributes more than the sawh area. Where as in the low land areas housing density dictates the distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement.</b> Other variables such as population density, road density, and utilities are less significantly influencing settlement patterns in the low land areas. The same relation between settlement pattern and housing density is also obvious in the distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in this hill. In general distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> in the district are ontrolled by housing density, population density and road density. The higher housing densities, the distribution of hamlets are more spread. The same relation applies to population density. The higher road density the more clustered is the distribution patterns of settleent can be observed in the fast growing areas, rather than the opposite. No differences in distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>settlement</b> can be observed among development unit areas (SWP) in the district...|$|R

5|$|Archaeological discoveries {{show that}} the first {{settlements}} {{in the area of}} present-day Białystok occurred during the Stone Age.

In the early Iron Age a mix of Prussians, Yotvingians and Wielbark culture people settled in the area producing kurgans, the tombs of the chiefs in the area located in the current village of Rostołty.

5|$|From the 1st century AD onwards, Cassel {{developed}} into a key urban centre for the whole region with an extensive road network converging on the hill. Towards {{the end of the}} 3rd century, however, repeated invasions of Germanic tribes caused devastation throughout the region and at least 80% <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> in the area are thought to have been abandoned, accompanied by a general economic decline. Cassel was fortified with a circuit of walls at around this time but suffered its own decline, which was reflected in its loss of status as a regional capital; Tournai took over as the capital of the newly constituted Civitas Turnacensium.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his work, Johnston himself {{has become part of}} the history of volcanic eruptions. With Harry Glicken, he is one of two volcanologists from the United States to die in a volcanic eruption. Glicken was being mentored by Johnston, who relieved Glicken of his watch at the ColdwaterII observation post 13 hours before Mount St. Helens erupted. Glicken died in 1991, eleven years later, when a pyroclastic flow overran him and several others at Mount Unzen in Japan. Despite the deaths of other volcanologists in later eruptions at Mount Unzen and Galeras, prediction methods similar to Johnston's allowed scientists to convince residents <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> near the Mount Pinatubo volcano to evacuate, preventing thousands of deaths.|$|E

The Early Muisca Period, roughly defined from 800 to 1000 AD, showed an increase in long-distance trade with the Caribbean coastal indigenous populations, mummification {{and the introduction of}} goldworking. The transition between Early Muisca and Late Muisca is defined by a more complex society, interregional trade of pottery, population growth and settlements of larger sizes closer to the agricultural lands.

5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The {{landscape}} of the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist today. With the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> from early to modern times.|$|E

5|$|Although little {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> {{has been found}} in the Rhondda that date between the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, several cairns and cists have been discovered throughout the length of both valleys. The best example of a round-cairn was found at Crug yr Afan, near the summit of Graig Fawr, west of Cwmparc. The cairn consisted of an earthen mound with a surrounding ditch 28 metres in circumference and over 2 metres tall. Although most cairns discovered in the area are round, a ring cairn or cairn circle exists on Gelli Mountain. Known as the 'Rhondda Stonehenge' the cairn consists of 10 upright stones no more than 60cm in height encircling a central cist. All the cairns found within the Rhondda are located on high ground, many on ridgeways, and may have been used as waypoints.|$|E

5|$|Colony Ross, {{known as}} Fort Ross today, {{was built in}} California just north of San Francisco Bay.

The Ross Colony included a number <b>of</b> <b>settlements</b> spread out over an area stretching from Point Arena to Tomales Bay. The administrative center was Port Rumianstev at Bodega Harbor, off Bodega Bay. An artel hunting camp was located on the Farallon Islands. Three ranches were established: the Kostromitinov Ranch on the Russian River near the mouth of Willow Creek, the Khlebnikov Ranch in the Salmon Creek valley about a mile (1.6km) north of the present day Bodega, and the Chernykh Ranch near present-day Graton. Fort Ross employed native Alaskans to hunt seals and sea otters on the California coast. By 1840 California's sea otter population had been severely depleted.|$|E
