25|$|There {{are many}} species of fungi {{including}} lichen-forming species, and the mycobiota is less poorly known than in {{many other parts of}} the world. The most recent checklist of Basidiomycota (bracket fungi, jelly fungi, mushrooms and toadstools, puffballs, rusts and smuts), published in 2005, accepts over 3600 species. The most recent checklist of Ascomycota (cup fungi and their allies, including most lichen-forming fungi), published in 1985, accepts another 5100 species. These two lists did not include conidial fungi (fungi mostly with affinities in the Ascomycota but known only in their asexual state) <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> main fungal groups (Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and Zygomycota). The number of fungal species known very probably exceeds 10,000. There is widespread agreement among mycologists that many others are yet to be discovered.|$|E
25|$|The carving {{seems to}} have been {{completed}} by December 1658, for Symon White (who is evidently a superior workman, receiving 22d. a day, the highest wage paid to anyone, and who was the master carver) is no longer employed. No other carvers are mentioned, and as there is not a great deal of ornament, he may have done all the work himself, with the aid perhaps of his apprentices. Very probably he designed it also, and was, no doubt, trained in the new school of classic design, after the manner of Nicholas Stone, <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> carvers of that date, whose work could then be seen on St. Mary's Church porch, or elsewhere.

25|$|Besides Perfect One (Kamil), Most Perfect One (Akmal), and Perfect Master (Mukammil), Meher Baba {{described}} {{one other}} type of incarnate soul that has transcended the finite ego and merged {{in a state of}} God-consciousness, but cannot help others. This type is the Majzoob (Arabic: Absorbed). Unlike the Perfect Master, <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> sub-types of God-realized souls, the Majzoob is absorbed in God {{to such a degree that}} he cannot be of any direct assistance to anyone else in creation though he can be of indirect help to those who honor him. This is because he is a perfect mast and as such has no experience of the external physical or internal mental worlds. According to Meher Baba the Majzoob has no experience of the gross, subtle, or mental worlds, but is entirely absorbed in the bliss of his state of Godhood.|$|E
25|$|Neither Murphy <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> {{pilots were}} very {{successful}} in hitting their targets, but the high winds which regularly blow in the region in late {{spring and early summer}} most likely contributed to their inaccuracy. The first bomb to actually hit Arizona soil landed at 7:45 AM on April 2 and it was followed by others over the next few days. Murphy's bombing runs smashed windows and otherwise damaged several buildings on the American side of the border, including a garage, the Phelps-Dodge Mercantile and the Haas Pharmacy. One bomb also struck the post office building, making it a federal offense, and another landed next to one of the idle train cars used by the crowd of spectators. Other bombs left large craters in the dirt streets and other unpaved surfaces. Yet another bomb landed on and devastated a regal Dodge touring car owned by a Mexican Army officer, which had been left on the American side of the border for safekeeping during the expected hostilities.|$|E

500|$|Stephen Doig, a {{professor}} at Arizona State University, estimated that 1.1 millionpeople attended the inauguration ceremony using the same satellite image. Although the image was taken {{a little less than}} 45minutes before Obama's swearing-in ceremony, Doig adjusted his estimate to include people who were still arriving in the area before the event. In spite of his crowd estimate, Doig stated that [...] "if I had to bet, I would say the [...] Obama crowd is in fact bigger than those that showed up for [...] <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> things... I'm wholly prepared to think it was the largest crowd." [...] Approximately 1.2million people had attended the second inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.|$|E
500|$|By this time, Re d'Italia {{had been}} sunk and the coastal defense ship [...] was burning badly, {{soon to be}} {{destroyed}} by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. In the course of the battle, Salamander had been hit by 35shells, but the Italians had failed to inflict serious damage on Salamander <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Austrian ironclads.|$|E
500|$|BP Bridge {{begins in}} Millennium Park between the trellis system over the Jay Pritzker Pavilion's great lawn and the Lurie Garden; the design was changed {{so that the}} west ramp coincided with the boardwalk of the Lurie Garden seam. The bridge winds its way northward along {{the eastern edge of}} Millennium Park before {{crossing}} Columbus Drive in a C-shaped curve, above underground parking garage entrances. In Daley Bicentennial Plaza the bridge has an S-shape, then turns east. BP Bridge is designed so that its inclined surfaces have a continuous five percent slope rather than landings and switchback ramps, which provides easy access for the physically challenged. [...] The gently sloped ramp eliminates the need for lifts <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> common types of ramps (L-shaped, switchback, U-shaped, straight), and helped the park earn the 2005 Barrier-Free America Award for its exemplary barrier-free design.|$|E

500|$|Another chief {{influence}} {{on the development of}} art pop was the Pop art movement. The term [...] "pop art", first coined to describe the aesthetic value of mass-produced goods, was directly applicable to the contemporary phenomenon of rock and roll (including Elvis Presley, an early Pop art icon). According to Frith: [...] " [...] turned out to signal the end of Romanticism, to be an art without artists. Progressive rock was the bohemians' last bet... In this context the key Pop art theorist was not [...] Hamilton <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> British artists who, for all their interest in the mass market, remained its academic admirers only, but Andy Warhol. For Warhol the significant issue wasn't the relative merits of 'high' and 'low' art but the relationship between all art and 'commerce'." [...] Warhol's Factory house band the Velvet Underground was an American group who emulated Warhol's art/pop synthesis, echoing his emphasis on simplicity, and pioneering a modernist avant-garde approach to art rock that ignored the conventional hierarchies of artistic representation.|$|E
500|$|On September 12, 2009, the EPB commemorated the {{birthday}} of Albizu. Noting that he died after being jailed, the organization insisted that justice was not yet made, expressing chagrin {{at the idea that}} some of the responsible were now regarded as historically influential people. The EBP then drew a parallel between the death of Albizu and Ojeda Ríos, accusing the local and federal authorities of complicity, as well as some pro-independence organization ms due to their silence on the matter. The group closed by claiming that the General Inspector's report tried to blame Ojeda Ríos for the actions of a FBI squad that [...] "wanted to eliminate the real representative of armed resistance [...] " [...] and compared it to the actions taken during the Romero Barceló administration in regards to the Cerro Maravilla murders, and expressed disbelief that despite cooperating with the federal agencies the local government, most notably the Police of Puerto Rico, concluded that the scene was not tampered when they only saw photographic evidence provided by the FBI. Noting that the Civil Rights Commission investigating the case questioned if the scene was tampered, the organization lamented that the report concluded that no criminal charges could be presented against the federal agent identified as [...] "Brian" [...] <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> involved.|$|E
500|$|A major {{sticking}} point over NHL participation {{has been the}} insurance of players; for the 2014 Winter Olympics, the IOC paid around US$7 million to insure NHL players participating in the Games. In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in 2018, {{it would no longer}} cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that [...] "In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that’s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they are not willing to pay for the insurance or the travel <b>or</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang." [...] The New York Times felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that [...] "in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics." ...|$|E
