5|$|Before {{his tenure}} as {{government}} minister, Hareide had sat through one term in the municipal council of his native Bømlo, served as a deputy representative to the national parliament as well as working two years as a State Secretary. He was also second deputy leader <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> from 2003 to 2007, having come {{through the ranks of}} the party's youth organization.|$|E
5|$|After narrow {{defeat in}} the general {{election}} of 1964, Douglas-Home resigned the leadership <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> having instituted a new and less secretive method of electing the party leader. From 1970 to 1974 he served in the cabinet of Edward Heath as Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, an expanded version of the post of Foreign Secretary, which he had held earlier. After the defeat of the Heath government in 1974 he returned to the House of Lords as a life peer and retired from front-line politics.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, Walker {{continued}} {{to focus on}} finance, although his views on social policy sometimes saw him on the outside <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> He supported the White Australia policy but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader {{in opposition to the}} dictation test, by which a potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.|$|E
50|$|He was re-elected {{at the top}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> {{list for}} the South East England {{constituency}} in 2004.|$|R
50|$|A public breakfast was {{tendered}} to McDouall Stuart in White's Rooms on {{the return}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> fourth expedition into the interior.|$|R
50|$|In May 2007 he lost party {{preselection}} {{and retired}} at the 2007 federal election which had seen <b>his</b> <b>party</b> return to power. This {{meant that the}} entirety <b>of</b> <b>his</b> parliamentary career equated to the entirety <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> time in Opposition.|$|R
5|$|At the 1953 election, {{the young}} lawyer Don Dunstan {{was elected to}} the House of Assembly as the Labor member for Norwood, ousting the LCL incumbent. Playford had landed {{unexpectedly}} in his role as the undisputed leader <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> while Dunstan was, from the start of his parliamentary career, a stand-out among his own ranks and an excellent orator in parliament. Dunstan and Playford were each other's principal antagonists.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{leadership}} changed {{again during}} the Borneo Campaign. Prime Minister Curtin {{suffered a heart attack}} in November 1944 and Deputy Prime Minister Frank Forde acted in his place until 22 January 1945. Curtin was hospitalised with another bout of illness in April 1945 and Treasurer Ben Chifley became acting Prime Minister as Forde was attending the San Francisco Conference. Curtin died on 5 July 1945 and Forde was sworn in as Prime Minister. Forde did not have the support <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> however, and was replaced by Chifley after a leadership ballot was held on 13 July.|$|E
5|$|Bradley was {{unanimously}} {{chosen as}} a delegate-at-large to six consecutive Republican National Conventions. At the 1880 Republican National Convention in Chicago, he was unanimously chosen to second Roscoe Conkling's nomination of Ulysses S. Grant {{for a third}} term as president. His rousing oratory gained him the attention of prominent leaders <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> At the 1884 convention, he was instrumental in defeating a motion to curtail Southern states' representation. President Chester A. Arthur chose Bradley to help recover financial damages from postal officials involved in the Star Route Frauds in 1885, but Bradley resigned this responsibility over differences with U.S. Attorney General Benjamin H. Brewster regarding the prosecution of these cases.|$|E
2500|$|Florence Crauford Grove gave a {{detailed}} and wry account <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> first 1865 ascent of the Aiguille Bionnassay {{in an article}} published in The Alpine Journal: ...|$|R

50|$|The {{motion of}} {{confidence}} in Kenny was passed. He announced a major reshuffle <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> front bench on 1 July 2010, re-appointing Bruton, Coveney, O'Dowd, and Varadkar.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} President Grant ran for reelection in 1872, Grant's {{administration}} had been rocked by scandal, and some disaffected members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> formed the Liberal Republicans, naming Greeley as their candidate for president, a nomination soon joined {{in by the}} Democrats. Hay was unenthusiastic about the editor-turned-candidate, and in his editorials mostly took aim at Grant, who, despite the scandals, remained untarred, and who won a landslide victory in the election. Greeley died only weeks later, a broken man. Hay's stance endangered his hitherto sterling credentials in the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|Despite this he {{had neither}} an office nor office staff, {{dealing with all}} the {{correspondence}} himself. Much of the detail of his works were held in his memory. He travelled with a personal valet and later had a cashier. But all his letters were written by him; it is recorded that on one occasion after the rest <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> had gone to bed, 31 letters had been written by Brassey overnight. Although he won {{a large number of}} contracts, his bids were not always successful. It has been calculated that for every contract awarded, around six others had been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, {{and rarely}} visited by whalers {{or any other}} ships. If the party was to return to civilization it would be {{necessary}} to summon help. The only realistic way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800-mile (1,300km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island, because of the poor physical condition of many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia, but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.|$|E
2500|$|Dods {{political}} {{biography of}} Carswell describes {{him as being}} [...] "tall and Eurosceptic ... one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> radical thinkers". The Economist has dubbed him [...] "the thinking man's kipper".|$|R

5|$|In 1910, Muñoz Rivera ran for Resident Commissioner in the United States House of Representatives {{representing}} the Union of Puerto Rico party, and served from 1911 to 1916. After spending {{nearly a year}} perfecting his English, Muñoz Rivera began forming friendships with some congressmen. Among these were Henry L. Stimpson and Felix Frankfurter. In 1915 Muñoz Rivera proposed granting Puerto Rico greater autonomy without requesting independence from the United States, and equal rights without becoming a state. His proposal was greeted by opposition from many members <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> including José de Diego. Still in the end, his party agreed on his proposal.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Weizsäcker was the Presidential {{candidate}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> for {{the first}} time, but he lost to Walter Scheel of the FDP, who {{was supported by the}} ruling center-left coalition. Ahead of the 1976 elections, CDU chairman Helmut Kohl included him in his shadow cabinet for the party’s campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Schmidt as chancellor. Between 1979 and 1981, Weizsäcker served as Vice President of the Bundestag.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1840s Caxias {{became a member}} of the Reactionary Party, which evolved into the Party of Order and finally the Conservative Party. He was elected senator in 1846. The Emperor {{appointed}} him president of the Council of Ministers (prime minister) in 1856; he briefly held that office again in 1861, but fell when his party lost its parliamentary majority. Over the decades Caxias witnessed the growth and zenith <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> then its slow decline as internal conflict divided it. In 1875, he headed a cabinet for the last time, and after years of failing health he died in May 1880.|$|E
50|$|On March 9, 2007, {{one of the}} American victims {{published}} a book (The Only Road North) <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> exploits in Africa which culminates in the tragic events of April 7, 2005.|$|R

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1528, Montejo left Conil {{for the city of}} Chauaca, which was {{abandoned}} by its Maya inhabitants under cover of darkness. The following morning the inhabitants attacked the Spanish party but were defeated. The Spanish then continued to Ake, where they engaged in a major battle, which left more than 1,200 Maya dead. After this Spanish victory, the neighbouring Maya leaders all surrendered. Montejo's party then continued to Sisia and Loche before heading back to Xelha. Montejo arrived at Xelha with only 60 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> and found that only 12 of his 40-strong garrison survived, while the entire garrison at Pole had been slaughtered.|$|E
5|$|Mathias {{was elected}} to the Senate in 1968, {{unseating}} the incumbent Democrat, Daniel Brewster, who twenty years earlier had been his roommate while attending the University of Maryland School of Law. He continued his record as a liberal Republican in the Senate, and frequently clashed with the conservative wing <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> For a few months in late 1975 and early 1976, Mathias considered running an insurgent presidential campaign in an attempt to stave off the increasing influence of conservative Republicans led by Ronald Reagan.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{received}} a death {{threat in the}} form of an envelope containing a shotgun shell and a message advising him to not vote for the court packing plan. Many Democrats, fearing their re-election prospects, joined with Republicans and defeated the bill. Minton was unhappy with the loss and it cost him considerable support among his voters, but as a result of his close connection with the bill and the leaders <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party,</b> he gained more influence with the Democrats.|$|E
50|$|The {{election}} {{was seen as}} a judgement on whether or not United supporters agreed with their deal with Labour. Donald spoke in defence <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> record, claimed that a loss for <b>his</b> <b>party</b> could cause an election and that a small surplus would be announced in the budget.|$|R
50|$|On 12 April 2005, Ergün was {{appointed}} as the deputy chairman responsible for local authorities of the Justice and Development Party. On 8 August 2007, {{he was elected}} as the acting chairman <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> parliamentary group.|$|R
50|$|Takala {{was elected}} {{chairman}} of Minnesota's Pine County Republicans {{at the age}} of 18. He was re-elected against one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> former candidates for Congress in 2009 with 60% of the vote, and again in 2011.|$|R
5|$|Minton {{was pleased}} with Roosevelt's bill and quickly became its leading {{supporter}} in the Senate. The measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill. Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured. Minton's support of the bill helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage. Minton delivered six radio addresses on behalf <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> {{in support of the}} bill, but public opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats' favor.|$|E
5|$|On 1 October Welensky was soundly {{defeated}} by his RF opponent, with 633 votes to Dupont's 1079. In December he resigned the leadership <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party.</b> When the RF declared unilateral independence on 11 November 1965, Welensky was {{upset at the}} constitutional break with Britain. He believed that Rhodesia was entitled to her independence, and disagreed with the British government's demand for 'no independence before majority rule', but was opposed to illegal action.|$|E
5|$|On March 31, 1958, the Tories won what {{is still}} the largest {{majority}} (in terms of percentage of seats) in Canadian federal political history, winning 208 seats to the Liberals' 48, with the CCF winning 8 and Social Credit wiped out. The Progressive Conservatives won {{a majority of the}} votes and of the seats in every province except British Columbia (49.8%) and Newfoundland. Quebec's Union Nationale political machine had given the PC party little support, but with Quebec voters minded to support Diefenbaker, Union Nationale boss Maurice Duplessis threw the machinery <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party</b> behind the Tories.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the appeal <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>party's</b> platform, Trudeau's success has been credited to his performance both {{on the campaign trail}} and televised election debates exceeding the lowered expectations created by Conservative advertisements and conservative media outlets.|$|R
