5|$|Tornadoes {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} colors, {{depending}} on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris {{at the base of the}} funnel. Condensation funnels that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving funnels, which ingest a considerable amount <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color <b>of</b> <b>debris.</b> Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.|$|E
5|$|According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 1,464 residences {{throughout}} Texas {{were affected}} by Hurricane Humberto. Of these, 25 were destroyed, 96 sustained major damage and 240 sustained minor damage. The cost of individual assistance for those impacted by Humberto would cost $4,776,334; the cost <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> removal and other public assistance amounted to $6,682,074. In terms of per capita income, Jefferson County sustained the most impact, decreasing by $22.38.|$|E
40|$|Large inputs <b>of</b> woody <b>debris</b> to soil {{can improve}} the soil. We {{examined}} the fate <b>of</b> woody <b>debris</b> buried in soil after fire-free forest conversion to cropland in French Guiana. We measured the mass loss <b>of</b> woody <b>debris</b> > 4 mm on five sampling dates for 4 years after deforestation. Composition of the organic matter <b>of</b> woody <b>debris</b> was analysed with Rock-Eval pyrolysis, which enabled us to distinguish a labile carbon pool (C-lab) and a resistant carbon pool (C-res). Decomposition <b>of</b> woody <b>debris</b> followed a first-order function with a half-life of 17. 6 months. During the decomposition <b>of</b> woody <b>debris</b> > 4 mm, the C:N ratio, hydrogen index (HI) and pyrolysed carbon below 400 degrees C (R 400) decreased, suggesting that decarboxylation and dehydrogenation <b>of</b> woody <b>debris</b> occurred. Both C-lab and C-res stocks decreased with time, but the decrease in C-lab was faster. There was little humification <b>of</b> the <b>debris</b> and no long-term biogeochemical preservation <b>of</b> a woody <b>debris</b> fraction, which accords with the first-order decay observed. We conclude {{that the benefits of}} ligno-cellulosic inputs for soil organic carbon contents in a tropical humid climate occur during the first year following deforestation...|$|R

5|$|Further {{excavations}} {{were carried}} out by Louis Salzmann between 1906 and 1908, concentrating on the north-west sector of the Roman fort, the east gate and the north postern. Harry Sands undertook the clearing <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> around the medieval castle keep in 1906 and more extensive excavations in 1910. Further clearing work took place {{under the supervision of}} the Ministry of Works in 1926 following the acquisition of the castle by the state. In 1936 Frank Cottrill carried out an eight-month excavation in the area of the outer bailey. B. W. Pearce excavated outside the Roman west gate in 1938 and cleared the moat <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> the following year. The Second World War ended any further work, and it was not until 1964 that limited exploration by Stuart Rigold took place outside the south-east postern of the inner bailey. In 1993–95, a team from the University of Reading led by Professor Michael Fulford carried out a series of excavations in the area of the keep and on the Roman fortress's east side.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Impact <b>of</b> tsunami-borne <b>debris</b> {{causes a}} {{significant}} force on coastal structures. Tsunami bores can carry different geometrical shapes <b>of</b> floating <b>debris,</b> {{which are often}} the greatest cause of damage to inland structures. Despite such a serious threat, the impact <b>of</b> floating <b>debris</b> on structures has received limited attention. The objective {{of this paper is}} to introduce a new method for measuring the impact force <b>of</b> floating <b>debris</b> on the seaward wall of structures during tsunami events. This will improve the understanding <b>of</b> tsunami-borne <b>debris</b> impact forces on structures and increase the predictive capabilities required for estimates of such forces in design guidelines. The debris impact tests were conducted using two smart debris devices with different geometrical shapes. Impact accelerations and forces in the horizontal and vertical planes were investigated...|$|R

5|$|The first {{bridge to}} be {{constructed}} was a three-arch stone bridge, {{which was built}} in 1746.

The weight and force of the debris ultimately destroyed the bridge, which was then swept away down the river.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{of other}} species of caddisfly make nets rather than cases. These are silken webs {{stretching}} between aquatic vegetation and over stones. These net-making larvae usually live in running water, different species occupying different habitats with varying water speeds. There is a constant drift of invertebrates washed downstream by the current, and these animals, and bits <b>of</b> <b>debris,</b> accumulate in the nets which serve both as food traps and as retreats.|$|E

5|$|As {{the glaciers}} {{retreated to the}} {{northeast}} about 20,000 years ago, glacial lakes formed. Drainage from the melting glacier and lakes cut a sluiceway, or channel, that diverted the headwaters of South Branch Bowman Creek into the Glen Leigh branch of Kitchen Creek. The retreating glaciers also left deposits <b>of</b> <b>debris</b> 20to 30feet (6.1to 9.1m) thick, which formed a dam blocking water from draining into Big Run.
