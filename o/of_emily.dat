5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Martha Dickinson Bianchi and Millicent Todd Bingham kept the {{achievement}} <b>of</b> <b>Emily</b> Dickinson alive. Bianchi promoted Dickinson's poetic achievement. Bianchi inherited The Evergreens {{as well as}} the copyright for her aunt's poetry from her parents, publishing works such as Emily Dickinson Face to Face and Letters <b>of</b> <b>Emily</b> Dickinson, which stoked public curiosity about her aunt. Bianchi's books perpetrated legends about her aunt in the context of family tradition, personal recollection and correspondence. In contrast, Millicent Todd Bingham's took a more objective and realistic approach to the poet.|$|E

5|$|Although Dickinson's acquaintances {{were most}} likely aware of her writing, {{it was not until}} after her death in 1886—when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, {{discovered}} her cache of poems—that the breadth of her work became apparent to the public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems <b>of</b> <b>Emily</b> Dickinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, The Manuscript Books <b>of</b> <b>Emily</b> Dickinson was published. Using the {{physical}} evidence of the original papers, the poems were intended {{to be published in}} their original order for the first time. Editor Ralph W. Franklin relied on smudge marks, needle punctures and other clues to reassemble the poet's packets. Since then, many critics have argued for thematic unity in these small collections, believing the ordering of the poems to be more than chronological or convenient.|$|E

5|$|One day, Andy saves Miranda {{from being}} embarrassed at a charity benefit, and Miranda rewards her by {{offering}} {{to take her}} to the fall fashion shows in Paris instead <b>of</b> <b>Emily.</b> Andy hesitates to take this privilege away from Emily but is forced to accept the offer after being told by Miranda that she will lose her job if she declines. Andy tries to tell Emily on her way to work. However, Emily is hit by a car and Andy has to break the bad news while visiting Emily in the hospital.|$|E
5|$|She {{also became}} {{the theme of}} {{paintings}} by several artists of the epoch, among them Hyppolyte Bellange, Achille Deveria, Philipp Veit, Francois de Villain and Wojciech Kossak. In 1842, J. K. Salomoński published a short biography of Plater in New York, under the title <b>of</b> <b>Emily</b> Plater, The Polish Heroine; Life of the Countess Emily Plater. A lithograph by F. De Villaine, based on Deveria's work, {{became one of the}} most recognizable portraits of her, popularizing her image as a delicate and noble female warrior.|$|E
5|$|While {{bypassing}} the Outer Banks, Emily produced strong winds that coincided with high tides during a full moon, causing severe flooding along the Pamlico Sound. In Buxton, the floods left behind water marks {{as high as}} , and the entire villages of Avon and Hatteras were inundated. The storm downed thousands of trees and wrecked 553homes—168 of which completely destroyed—leaving {{a quarter of the}} Cape Hatteras population homeless. Structural damage in North Carolina was estimated at $35million. Along the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia, three swimmers drowned as a result <b>of</b> <b>Emily.</b>|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{potential}} for tropical cyclone development, Météo-France declared yellow cyclone alerts for Guadeloupe and Martinique, warning of imminent squally weather. Due to the presence <b>of</b> <b>Emily,</b> {{a state of emergency}} was declared for all of Puerto Rico. Officials ordered the preparation of over 400 storm shelters and ensured adequate water supply. The morning before the storm, government workers were dismissed, and national courtrooms remained closed. The United States Coast Guard issued a statement urging residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to avoid recreational boating and swimming until Emily had passed. JetBlue Airways waived fees for flights into the Dominican Republic because of the inclement weather conditions. Four cruise ships, Oasis of the Seas, Freedom of the Seas, Carnival Dream and Carnival Liberty altered their courses through the Caribbean to avoid the storm.|$|E
5|$|Despite its poor organization, Emily wrought havoc {{across many}} Caribbean nations. Gusty winds felled trees and heavy rains {{triggered}} widespread flooding throughout the Lesser Antilles; any significant damage in those islands {{was confined to}} Martinique, however, where one fatality occurred. In Puerto Rico, similar floods affected residences and roads, with infrastructural losses in the territory estimated at $5 million. Even after dissipating, the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Emily</b> continued to produce prolonged rainfall over much of Hispaniola. Extensive floods and mudslides in the Dominican Republic displaced over 7,000 residents, and three people drowned {{in the capital of}} Santo Domingo. In neighboring Haiti, hundreds of homes were flooded in the department of Artibonite, prompting evacuations. Only minor wind damage occurred throughout the country's southern peninsula, but one death was reported in the region.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored 2 was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception. Praised were the improvements made since the first game: the more challenging stealth, the adaptability <b>of</b> <b>Emily</b> and Corvo's abilities to both play styles, the art direction, the creative design of individual missions, {{the realization of the}} game's world as well as the replay-value and the artificial intelligence. Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably. Dishonored 2 won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and for Costume Design at the 2017 NAVGTR Awards.|$|E

5|$|Gradual {{intensification}} {{took place}} throughout September20, attaining {{the status of}} tropical storm by 1800UTC and received the name Emily. The storm tracked in a general west-northwest direction {{around the edge of}} a strong subtropical ridge. By 1200UTC on September21, the center <b>of</b> <b>Emily</b> passed directly over St. Vincent with winds of 50mph (85km/h). Situated underneath an anticyclone, rapid intensification took place as the storm quickly tracked towards Hispaniola. In the 24-hour span between 1800UTC on September21 and 1800UTC on September22, the central barometric pressure of the storm dropped 44mbar (hPa) to 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg) and winds increased to 125mph (205km/h), equivalent to a high-end Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. At the time of peak intensity, the hurricane hunters recorded flight-level winds of 155mph (250km/h) and unofficial pressure of 949mbar (hPa; 28.02inHg).|$|E
5|$|In January 1855, Brontë {{discovered}} she was pregnant. It {{was accompanied by}} severe illness and she died on 31 March 1855, officially from tuberculosis. Mr. Nicholls remained with Brontë's father for a further six years before returning to Banagher in 1861, taking with him his wife's portrait, her wedding dress (of which a copy has been made), some of Charlotte's letters and other mementoes. Forty years later, when the critic Clement Shorter prepared to write Charlotte Brontë and Her Circle, he found at Banagher among other relics, two diaries <b>of</b> <b>Emily</b> and Anne, in a tin box, and some of Charlotte's minute childhood writings wrapped in newspaper {{at the bottom of}} a drawer.|$|E
5|$|Preordering Dishonored 2 granted players {{access to}} the full game a day early. Bethesda {{announced}} a special collector's edition of the game as a pre-order on their online store.

Digital bonuses were {{also included in the}} form of the Digital Imperial Assassin's Pack, which included additional in-game content. Pre-orders for console versions of the collector's edition came with a copy of , a remastered version of the first game for the eighth generation of consoles with all downloadable content included.|$|E

5000|$|The poem {{exhibits}} several typical features <b>of</b> <b>Emily's</b> poems.

This is a less regular, more intimate, version of the common metre used in hymns such as Amazing Grace. The syllable count is not so strict and only the second and fourth lines are required to rhyme.|$|R
