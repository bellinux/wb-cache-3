5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed {{and he said that}} he hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E

5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston questioned her on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face)</b> <b>and</b> father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E

25|$|She had visible tan {{lines from}} a halter top or bikini, {{suggesting}} {{that she may}} have come from a region with abundant October–November sunshine, as sun tanning beds were uncommon in the 1970s, and upstate New York is not generally warm or sunny enough for such tanning during that period. There were freckles on the backs of her shoulders and acne <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> chest.|$|E
25|$|After a while Frotho {{was killed}} through treachery by a Saxon named Swerting (Swertingus). Frotho's son Ingild (Ingellus) lived a wanton life and married one of Swerting's daughters. This angered Starkad {{so much that}} he enlisted at the Swedish king Halfdan's (Haldanus) court instead. However, when he learnt that Helga, Ingild's sister, was about to marry a lowly goldsmith, Starkad {{appeared}} in disguise and castrated the goldsmith. He gave Helga a slap <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> lambasted her. Then he returned to Sweden and king Halfdan.|$|E
25|$|Lesley Visser {{missed the}} first half of the 1993 season due to {{injuries}} earlier suffered in a bizarre jogging accident in New York City's Central Park. Visser broke her hip and skidded face-first across the pavement, requiring reconstructive plastic surgery <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> more than a decade later required an artificial hip replacement. She missed the Major League Baseball All-Star Game. Jim Kaat would replace her while she recuperated. Jim Gray also served as a reporter for the All-Star Game and World Series.|$|E

25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin {{was soft and}} moist, with muscles that still allowed for {{her arms and legs}} to flex at the joints. All her organs and blood vessels were also intact, with small amounts of Type A blood being found in her veins. There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp {{on the back of her}} head. There was skin <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body was soaked in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E
500|$|According to Moss from MTV News, {{the video}} {{represents}} a [...] "literal take on somewhat abstract lyrics". It opens with shots of Lee playing the song on a piano at a snowy forest. At {{the start of}} the first verse, the band joins in, performing the song separately. Lee is seen lip-syncing the lyrics to the camera throughout; she dons a white dress, with light pale makeup <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> a bright red lipstick. Later on, she is also shown laying down, as snow falls around her and the camera focuses <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> expressions. As the song progresses to its final chorus, the singer is seen slowly walking towards a lake, as black petals start falling around her. During the song's last verse, she eventually submerges herself completely. Scenes of Lee in a black dress and singing the song while floating underwater are also interspersed throughout the entire clip. The music video was available online on November 27. Wind-up also released the video on the band's official website on the same day. The clip managed to peak at number four on TRL countdown list of the best music videos in January 2007. A behind-the-scenes clip from the filming set of the music video was posted on January 12, 2007 on the band's official YouTube channel.|$|E

During the promotional Making of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai TV special, Kajol stated that the accident was her most memorable part of shooting the film because she doesn't remember it. During preparation for the reunion scene where the two leads met after more than 8 years apart, the director told them to improvise and rehearse the reactions that they might use, but he secretly taped them, and was so pleased {{with the result that}} it was put into the film.|$|E

500|$|According to Houston, {{the song}} was direct, so she wanted the video to be direct and {{concentrate}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> on the lyrics. Whitaker also expressed a same opinion of the song. He said, [...] "I've seen the video [...] It's like a thing she has, you know, that I guess people would say is like a charisma kinda thing that it zooms, you know, comes up. It's beautiful [...] It's magic, it's spirit." [...] The video aired on MTV on October 10, 1995. According to Marla Shelton, a writer for Camera Obscura, a journal of feminism and film theory, [...] "the video concept's originality stops with Houston's hair style as its stark simplicity underscores the 'straight and narrow' politics of the film." [...] When the film was released, the video was shown as a trailer prior {{to the beginning of}} films on 450 General Cinema screens in some major US media markets.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} verse, a mad scientist, portrayed by Kinney, {{seemingly}} tortures Gaga, who {{is wearing a}} yellow dress with glasses made of barbwire, as another version of the singer, with teal-colored hair, performs a dance routine with her backup dancers in a barn. As the chorus begins for the second time, Gaga appears as Yüyi the Mermaid, with gills <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> neck, as she lies in a tub filled with dirty water. At {{the end of the}} chorus, the camera zooms to a brunette Gaga inside a water tank while she sings [...] "You and I" [...] in the desert scene, and in the cornfield with Calderone. Interspersing scenes again show Gaga having her wedding, Yüyi in her tub, and Gaga seated on a chair with a conveyor belt. During May's guitar solo, Gaga dances in the cornfield with other dancers dressed in the same white dress, as Yüyi and the scientist kiss. While singing the chorus for the final time, Gaga kisses Calderone in one sequence and runs across the field in another. As the video reaches its conclusion, the tortured Gaga is being slid down as the conveyor belt turns on. The video ends with Yüyi and the scientist together in the bath tub, as a depiction of their dream wedding flashes across, before a last shot of the barn as the screen turns black.|$|E

2500|$|Despite initial {{skepticism}} {{from the}} Catholic Church, Soubirous's claims were eventually declared [...] "worthy of belief" [...] after a canonical investigation, and the Marian apparition {{is now known}} as Our Lady of Lourdes. Since her death, Soubirous's body has apparently remained internally incorrupt, but it is not without blemish; during her third exhumation in 1925, the firm of Pierre Imans made light wax coverings for her face and her hands due to the discoloration that her skin had undergone. These masks were placed <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> hands before she was moved to her crystal reliquary in June 1925.|$|E

"Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature" [...] was {{originally}} published, in slightly edited form, as [...] "Yet Another Example of the Porousness of Certain Borders (VIII)" [...] in McSweeney's #1 (1998). According to Paul Giles, the title [...] "directly echoes" [...] Richard Rorty's celebrated book, Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature. In the story, an unnamed narrator recounts {{the story of}} his mother's botched facial plastic surgery, which left her with a look of constant terror <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> the litigation surrounding that surgery. The narrator also mentions throughout the story his own entanglement in litigation related to his black-widow spider farm.|$|E
