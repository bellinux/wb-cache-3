5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was {{the offspring of}} a human, Pasiphaë, and a white bull. More often, they are composites of the physical attributes {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|The Book of Moses {{begins with}} Moses' asking God about {{the purpose of}} creation. Moses is told in this account that God made the earth and heavens to bring humans to eternal life. The book also {{provides}} an enlarged account of the Genesis creation narrative and expands the story <b>of</b> <b>Enoch,</b> the ancestor of Noah. In the narrative, Enoch speaks with God, receives a prophetic calling, and eventually builds a city of Zion so righteous that it was taken to heaven. The book also elaborates and expands upon foreshadowing the coming of Christ, in effect Christianizing the Old Testament.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} Rabbinical literature, {{there are}} various views <b>of</b> <b>Enoch.</b> One view regarding Enoch was that found in the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, which thought <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> as a pious man, taken to Heaven, and receiving the title of Safra rabba (Great scribe). After Christendom was completely separated from Judaism, this view became the prevailing rabbinical idea of Enoch's character and exaltation.|$|E

25|$|Regarding the {{quotation}} in Jude, most of early Christianity considered it an independent quotation pre-dating the flood. Regarding the Book <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> itself Origen, Jerome and Augustin mention it, {{but as of}} no authority. Justin, Athenagoras, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus, Lactantius, and others borrowed an opinion out of this book <b>of</b> <b>Enoch,</b> that the angels had sexual relations with the daughters of men, of whom they had offspring ('the giants of the past'). Tertullian, in several places, speaks of this book with esteem and would persuade us that it was preserved by Noah during the deluge.|$|E
25|$|The Book <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> (60:7–9) {{describes}} Leviathan as {{a female}} monster dwelling in the watery abyss (as Tiamat), while Behemoth is a male monster living in the desert of Dunaydin ("east of Eden").|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} article entitled, ‘Is General Jurisprudence Interesting?’, David Enoch answers his own {{question}} resoundingly in the negative. This article critically examines the character <b>of</b> <b>Enoch’s</b> claim, the presuppositions it rests on, {{and the way in}} which he seeks to establish it. Having argued that many <b>of</b> <b>Enoch’s</b> views in this regard hinge on a narrow and idiosyncratic understanding of the questions that general jurisprudence addresses, and of the relations between those questions and many other inquiries concerning the character of law, the article concludes by offering its author’s own vision of what makes general jurisprudence engaging, intriguing, and … well … interesting...|$|R
5000|$|Some of {{the authors}} of the New Testament were {{familiar}} with some of the content of the story. A short section <b>of</b> 1 <b>Enoch</b> (1:9) is cited in the New Testament, Epistle of Jude, , and is attributed there to [...] "Enoch the Seventh from Adam" [...] (1 En 60:8), although this section <b>of</b> 1 <b>Enoch</b> is a midrash on Deuteronomy 33. Several copies of the earlier sections <b>of</b> 1 <b>Enoch</b> were preserved among the Dead Sea Scrolls.|$|R
2500|$|According to Jewish apocrypha, Metatron is {{the name}} Enoch received, after his {{transformation}} into an angel.

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1874 that Young {{initiated}} the United Order <b>of</b> <b>Enoch,</b> beginning in St. George, Utah, on February 9, 1874. There {{were a number of}} differences between the United Order <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> and United Order communities established years earlier by Joseph Smith. Under Young's leadership, producers would generally deed their property to the Order, and all members of the Order would share the cooperative's net income, often divided into shares based on the amount of property originally contributed. Sometimes, the members of the Order would receive wages for their work on the communal property.|$|E
25|$|The Book <b>of</b> <b>Enoch,</b> {{generally}} considered non-canonical, states {{that in the}} time of the great judgment God will give all those whose names are in the Book of Life fruit to eat from the Tree of Life.|$|E

50|$|The publication, in {{the early}} 1950s, of the first Aramaic {{fragments}} <b>of</b> 1 <b>Enoch</b> among the Dead Sea Scrolls profoundly changed {{the study of the}} document, as it provided evidence of its antiquity and original text.

50|$|In the 1890s {{it became}} obvious that {{expansion}} <b>of</b> St <b>Enoch</b> was essential, and on 18 August 1898 an Act for the extension <b>of</b> St <b>Enoch</b> station was passed.

25|$|In the Book <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> (22:7), {{regarded}} by most Christian and Jewish traditions as extra-biblical, {{the soul of}} Abel is described as having been appointed as the chief of martyrs, crying for vengeance, {{for the destruction of}} the seed of Cain. This view is later repeated in the Testament of Abraham (A:13 / B:11), where Abel has been raised to the position as the judge of the souls.|$|E

25|$|Others {{disagree}} with Ginzberg, {{suggesting that he}} failed {{to account for the}} regular travel of sages between Judea and Babylonia to collect and transmit scholarly teachings. Furthermore, scholar Hugh Odeberg has dated portions of the pseudepigraphal Third Book <b>of</b> <b>Enoch,</b> which discusses Metatron, to the first or second century CE, before the redaction of both the Jerusalem and the Babylonian Talmuds, and other scholars have found the concept of Metatron in texts older than 70 CE.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} authors in Old Church Slavonic {{after the death}} of Methodius and the dissolution of the Great Moravian academy were Clement of Ohrid (active also in Great Moravia), Constantine of Preslav, Chernorizetz Hrabar and John Exarch, all of whom worked in medieval Bulgaria {{at the end of the}} 9th and the beginning of the 10th century. The Second Book <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> was only preserved in Old Church Slavonic, although the original most certainly had been Greek or even Hebrew or Aramaic.|$|E
25|$|The Second Book <b>of</b> <b>Enoch</b> {{contains}} a section, called Exaltation of Melchizedek, {{which says that}} Melchizedek was born of a virgin, Sofonim (or Sopanima), the wife of Nir, a brother of Noah. The child came out from his mother after she had died {{and sat on the}} bed beside her corpse, already physically developed, clothed, speaking and blessing the Lord, and marked with the badge of priesthood. Forty days later, Melchizedek was taken by the archangel Gabriel (Michael in some manuscripts) to the Garden of Eden and was thus preserved from the Deluge without having to be in Noah's Ark.|$|E
