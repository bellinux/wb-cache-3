5|$|Beginning August 5, these {{divisions}} initiated numerous crossing {{attempts to}} assault the UN {{forces on the}} <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> {{in an attempt to}} capture Taegu and collapse the final UN defensive line. The U.S. forces were successful in repelling North Korean advances thanks to training and support, but forces in the South Korean sectors were not as successful. During this time, isolated reports and rumors of war crimes committed by both sides began to surface.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury {{is home to}} Shrewsbury School, {{a public}} school, on a large site ("Kingsland") {{just south of the}} town centre {{overlooking}} the loop of the Severn.

5|$|Around 1627, Robert Morton, {{the mayor}} of Hull, had an {{additional}} rectangular earthwork battery of four guns constructed around the south blockhouse to defend the estuary against a potential Spanish and French invasion threat. The South End Fort {{was built on the}} <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> from the South Blockhouse at the same time, provided supporting crossfire. In 1634, a survey showed the North Blockhouse to be mounting 24 pieces of artillery, the castle 29, and the South Blockhouse 24 guns. Catholic recusants continued to be detained in the castle and blockhouses, where they were ill-treated by the keepers, typically men with strong Puritan sympathies.|$|E

5|$|The Abercromby baronets owned a {{significant}} amount of property in Ireland, as most of the town of Fermoy had been purchased by them from John Anderson in the early 19th century. By 1814 Forglen was used as the main family seat of the Abercromby family; in 1877 they also acquired Dunlugas House, which was sited on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Deveron. Lady Jane Abercromby's son, Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet, continued to enhance the grandeur of the estate policies by commissioning the building of a new mansion and several other buildings.|$|E
5|$|The British {{soldiers}} marched out {{and laid}} {{down their arms}} in between the French and American armies, while many civilians watched. At this time, the troops on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> in Gloucester also surrendered. The British soldiers had been issued new uniforms hours before the surrender and until prevented by General O'Hara some threw down their muskets with the apparent intention of smashing them. Others wept or appeared to be drunk. In all, 8,000 troops, 214 artillery pieces, thousands of muskets, 24 transport ships, wagons and horses were captured.|$|E
5|$|The Natchez had {{prepared}} by seizing the galley of the West India Company anchored on the river, {{so that no}} Frenchmen could board it and attempt to escape.

5|$|San Marco, which {{eventually}} gave {{its name to}} the former area of South Jacksonville, broke ground in 1925 as the city's most ambitious development. It was constructed over 80 acres of the former Villa Alexandria estate, which had deteriorated after Martha Reed Mitchell's death in 1902. The developer was Telfair Stockton, who had previously established the exclusive Avondale neighborhood on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> San Marco, designed as a fashionable, upscale development in keeping with Villa Alexandria's reputation, comprised 250 lots and a commercial district. It was remarkably successful from the beginning; apparently driven by land speculation, San Marco shattered local records by selling every lot within three hours of putting them up for sale, even though very little work had begun.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the initial}} penetration, the 34th Infantry line moved south to Nonsan. The 19th Infantry moved its 2nd Battalion to fill {{some of the}} gaps left by the 34th, {{reinforced}} by Republic of Korea Army troops. The combined forces observed a large build-up of North Korean troops on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> At 03:00 on 16 July, the North Koreans launched a massive barrage of tank, artillery and mortar fire on the 19th Infantry's positions and North Korean troops began to cross the river in boats. The North Korean forces gathered {{on the west bank}} and assaulted the positions of 1st Battalion's C and E companies, followed by a second landing against B Company. North Korean forces pushed against the entire battalion, threatening to overwhelm it. The regimental commander ordered all support troops and officers to the line {{and they were able to}} repulse the assault. However, in the melee, North Korean forces infiltrated their rear elements, attacking the reserve forces and blocking supply lines. Stretched thin, the 19th Infantry was unable to hold the line at the Kum River and simultaneously repel the North Korean forces.|$|E
5|$|Gravesend Blockhouse was an {{artillery}} fortification constructed {{as part of}} Henry VIII's Device plan of 1539, in response to fears of an imminent invasion of England by France and the Holy Roman Empire. It was built at Gravesend in Kent along a strategic point along the River Thames and was operational by 1540. A two-storey, D-shaped building built from brick and stone, it had a circular bastion overlooking the river and gun platforms extending out {{to the east and}} west. It functioned in conjunction with Tilbury Fort on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> and was repaired in 1588 to deal with the threat of Spanish invasion, and again in 1667 when the Dutch navy raided the Thames. A 1778 report recommended alterations to the blockhouse and its defences, leading to the remodelling of the gun platforms and the construction of the new, larger New Tavern Fort alongside it. In the 1830s the government decided to rely entirely on the newer fort and the old blockhouse was demolished in 1844. Its remains were uncovered in archaeological excavations between 1975 and 1976.|$|E

5|$|On 25 August 2000, {{a patrol}} from 1 R IRISH left their base in Waterloo to visit Jordanian peacekeepers {{attached}} to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) and based at Masiaka. Over lunch, they were informed that the West Side Boys had begun to disarm, despite their initial reluctance, and the company commander—Major Alan Marshall—decided to take the patrol to investigate en route back to their base. The patrol turned off the main road onto a dirt track {{that led to the}} village of Magbeni, where the West Side Boys were based. As they approached the base, they were surrounded by a large group of West Side Boys, who used an anti-aircraft gun mounted on a Bedford truck to block the patrol's route. Marshall dismounted his vehicle, then resisted an attempt to grab his rifle and was beaten. He {{and the rest of the}} patrol were then forced into canoes at the bank of Rokel Creak and transported to Gberi Bana, a village on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> just upstream from the point of the initial confrontation.|$|E
5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew to the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through the night. They were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, {{some of the men}} were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E
5|$|After the viaduct {{the road}} becomes Southend Road, passing north of Walthamstow, and {{immediately}} before the Crooked Billet junction, the former site of Walthamstow greyhound racing track. It continues eastward, cutting through a southern section of Epping Forest and meeting the Woodford New Road at Waterworks Corner, before an elevated junction with the M11 motorway and Southend Road heading to Gants Hill. The South Woodford to Barking Relief Road (the section between the M11 and A13) opened in 1987. Previously, the A406 extended along Southend Road and Woodford Avenue as far east as Gants Hill. The current {{route of the}} North Circular Road turns south, passing Eastern Avenue (A12) on a flyover at the Redbridge roundabout. It passes Romford Road (the historic Roman Road from London to Colchester) {{to the west of}} Ilford and London Road, Barking, and ends at a roundabout with the A13 Newham Way / Alfred's Way in Beckton. To reach the Woolwich Ferry, traffic must follow local roads to the ferry terminal. This leads across the River Thames, connecting with the eastern end of the South Circular Road on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> The junction with the A13 has been built to enable the North Circular to be continued across the junction to the Thames Gateway Bridge if and when it is built.|$|E

5|$|As Scott's men {{reached an}} open prairie near the Wea {{settlement}} of Ouiatenon on June 1, they were discovered by an enemy scout {{and hurried to}} attack the villages before the residents could react. When the main force reached the villages, they found the residents hurriedly fleeing across the Wabash River in canoes. Aided by cover fire from a Kickapoo village on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> {{they were able to}} escape before Scott's men could attack. The river was too wide to ford at Scott's location, so he sent a detachment under James Wilkinson in one direction and a detachment under Thomas Barbee in the other {{to find a place to}} ford the river. Wilkinson did not find a suitable location, but located and killed a small band of Indians before returning. Barbee located a crossing and conducted a brief raid against the Indians on the other side before returning to Scott. The next morning, Scott's main force burned the nearby villages and crops, while a detachment under Wilkinson set out for the settlement of Kethtippecannunk. The inhabitants of this village had fled across Eel Creek, and after a brief and ineffective firefight, Wilkinson's men burned the city and returned to Scott. In his official report, Scott noted that many of Kethtippecannunk's residents were French and speculated that it was connected to, perhaps dependent upon, the French settlement of Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, at 19:30, B Company {{detected}} a North Korean force of around company-size {{preparing for a}} frontal assault, and called-in mortar fire to break up their formations, while a number of forward patrols had to be withdrawn by the Australians {{in order to prevent}} their encirclement. In response the North Koreans fired mortars at the Australian positions with limited effect. Half an hour later North Korean shells hit the 3 RAR battalion headquarters and C Company positions on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> however the rounds landed in the damp soil of the paddy field and failed to explode. Periodically they were also targeted by machine-gun fire, but it was mostly high and posed little threat. Perhaps also under the impression that the Australians had withdrawn, the North Koreans failed to press their attack. Yet they soon realised their mistake and heavy small arms fire began again at 22:30 with North Korean activity against A and B Companies increasing significantly, which resulted in B Company suffering two killed and three wounded. The Australian right flank was now exposed and following a request from Thirlwell, Chitts detached 1 Platoon under Lieutenant John Wathen to bolster B Company. At 23:00 further artillery and mortar fire missions were ordered by the Australians against the North Koreans in response to renewed concentrations in preparation for an assault. Around the same time 8 Platoon C Company under Lieutenant Colin Townsend was sent across the bridge in the darkness to further reinforce B Company, and they dug-in {{on each side of the}} road leading to the bridge. Telephone lines had been laid by the Australians to their forward companies, and despite the fighting they remained intact throughout the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Aspern-Essling {{started at}} 2:30pm on 21 May. The initial and poorly coordinated Austrian attacks against Aspern and the Gemeinde Au woods {{to the south}} failed completely, but Charles persisted. Eventually, the Austrians managed to capture the whole village but lost the eastern half. The Austrians did not attack Essling until 6pm because {{the fourth and fifth}} columns had longer marching routes. The French {{successfully}} repulsed the attacks against Essling throughout the 21st. Fighting commenced by 3am on the 22nd, and four hours later the French had captured Aspern again. Napoleon now had 71,000 men and 152 guns on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> but the French were still dangerously outnumbered. Napoleon then launched a massive assault against the Austrian center designed to give enough time for the III Corps to cross and clinch the victory. Lannes advanced with three infantry divisions and travelled for a mile before the Austrians, inspired by the personal heroics of Charles with his rally of the Zach Infantry Regiment (No. 15), unleashed a hail of fire on the French that caused the latter to fall back. At 9am, the French bridge broke again. Charles launched another massive assault an hour later and captured Aspern for good, but still could not lay claim to Essling. A few hours later, however, the Austrians returned and took all of Essling except the staunchly defended granary. Napoleon replied by sending a part of the Imperial Guard under Jean Rapp, who audaciously disobeyed Napoleon's orders by attacking Essling and expelling all Austrian forces. Charles then kept up a relentless artillery bombardment that counted Marshal Lannes as one of its many victims. Fighting diminished shortly afterwards, and the French pulled back all of their forces to Lobau. Charles had inflicted the first major defeat in Napoleon's military career.|$|E
