25|$|Broilers are {{not raised}} in cages. They are raised in large, open {{structures}} known as grow out houses. A farmer receives the birds from the hatchery at <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>old.</b> A grow out consist of 5 to 9 weeks according on {{how big the}} kill plant wants the chickens to be. These houses are equipped with mechanical systems to deliver feed and water to the birds. They have ventilation systems and heaters that function as needed. The {{floor of the house}} is covered with bedding material consisting of wood chips, rice hulls, or peanut shells. In some cases they can be grown over dry litter or compost. Because dry bedding helps maintain flock health, most growout houses have enclosed watering systems (“nipple drinkers”) which reduce spillage.|$|E
500|$|In sheep breeds lacking facial wool, {{the visual}} field is wide. In 10 sheep (Cambridge, Lleyn and Welsh Mountain breeds, which lack facial wool), the visual field ranged from 298° to 325°, {{averaging}} 313.1°, with binocular overlap ranging from 44.5° to 74°, averaging 61.7°. In some breeds, unshorn facial wool can limit the visual field; in some individuals, {{this may be}} enough to cause [...] "wool blindness". In 60 Merinos, visual fields ranged from 219.1° to 303.0°, averaging 269.9°, and the binocular field ranged from 8.9° to 77.7°, averaging 47.5°; 36% of the measurements were limited by wool, although photographs of the experiments indicate that only limited facial wool regrowth had occurred since shearing. In addition to facial wool (in some breeds), visual field limitations can include ears and (in some breeds) horns, so the visual field can be extended by tilting the head. Sheep eyes exhibit very low hyperopia and little astigmatism. Such visual characteristics are likely to produce a well-focused retinal image of objects in both the middle and long distance. Because sheep eyes have no accommodation, one might expect the image of very near objects to be blurred, but a rather clear near image {{could be provided by}} the tapetum and large retinal image of the sheep's eye, and adequate close vision may occur at muzzle length. Good depth perception, inferred from the sheep's sure-footedness, was confirmed in [...] "visual cliff" [...] experiments; behavioral responses indicating depth perception are seen in lambs at <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>old.</b> Sheep are thought to have colour vision, and can distinguish between a variety of colours: black, red, brown, green, yellow and white. Sight is a vital part of sheep communication, and when grazing, they maintain visual contact with each other. Each sheep lifts its head upwards to check the position of other sheep in the flock. This constant monitoring is probably what keeps the sheep in a flock as they move along grazing. Sheep become stressed when isolated; this stress is reduced if they are provided with a mirror, indicating that the sight of other sheep reduces stress.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the large}} numbers of {{apoptotic}} lymphocytes, the thymus was originally dismissed as a [...] "lymphocyte graveyard", without functional importance. [...] The importance of the thymus in the immune system was discovered in 1961 by Jacques Miller, by surgically removing the thymus from <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>old</b> mice, and observing the subsequent deficiency in a lymphocyte population, subsequently named T cells after the organ of their origin. [...] Recently, advances in immunology have allowed the function of the thymus in T-cell maturation to be more fully understood.|$|E

40|$|Artificial {{insemination}} is {{a well-established}} part of modern agricultural practice. A viable semen sample is {{judged by the}} total number of spermatozoa (sperm) in the sample and the motility of the sperm. In this paper, we report the development of a reusable measurement cell and electronics for screening semen samples based on the Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) and Universal Frequency to Digital Converter (UFDC- 1) to produce a low-cost sensor system. After introducing the semen sample at one end of the measurement cell, sperm swim down a channel before causing a frequency change on the QCM.
