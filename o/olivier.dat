5|$|In 1947 <b>Olivier</b> was knighted and Leigh {{accompanied}} him to Buckingham Palace for the investiture. She became Lady <b>Olivier.</b> After their divorce, {{according to the}} style granted to the divorced wife of a knight, she became known socially as Vivien, Lady <b>Olivier.</b>|$|E
5|$|In June 1937 the Old Vic company took up an {{invitation}} to perform Hamlet {{in the courtyard of}} the castle at Elsinore, where Shakespeare located the play. <b>Olivier</b> secured the casting of Leigh to replace Cherry Cottrell as Ophelia. Because of torrential rain the performance had to be moved from the castle courtyard to the ballroom of a local hotel, but the tradition of playing Hamlet at Elsinore was established, and <b>Olivier</b> was followed by, among others, Gielgud (1939), Redgrave (1950), Richard Burton (1954), Derek Jacobi (1979), Kenneth Branagh (1988) and Jude Law (2009). Back in London, the company staged Macbeth, with <b>Olivier</b> in the title role. The stylised production by Michel Saint-Denis was not well liked, but <b>Olivier</b> had some good notices among the bad. On returning from Denmark, <b>Olivier</b> and Leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over; Esmond moved out of the marital house and in with her mother. After <b>Olivier</b> and Leigh made a tour of Europe in mid 1937 they returned to separate film projects—A Yank at Oxford for her and The Divorce of Lady X for him—and moved into a property together in Iver, Buckinghamshire.|$|E
5|$|Mann's next fight (and {{third in}} the Cage Rage organisation) was against top {{domestic}} prospect, Robbie <b>Olivier.</b> The fight saw both fighters neutralise the other's ground game. In the stand-up, Mann was regarded as being unusually tentative, which gave <b>Olivier</b> {{the opportunity to take}} him to the floor, where again, neither fighter was able to advance position or do anything of note. After three rounds, <b>Olivier</b> was declared the winner via unanimous decision.|$|E
5|$|<b>Olivier</b> {{researched}} the role by traveling to Norfolk, Virginia {{to visit the}} MacArthur Museum, and speaking with Alexander Haig, who had served as aide-de-camp to MacArthur. Haig told <b>Olivier</b> that MacArthur's voice sounded like W. C. Fields, and <b>Olivier</b> tried to imitate this. He enjoyed working with accents, and obtained recordings of MacArthur's voice. He was interested in various inconsistencies in these recordings, {{and especially in the}} difference in vowel sounds made by MacArthur. During filming, the makeup process for <b>Olivier</b> took two and a half hours, but after it was complete, he thought he neither looked like himself nor like General MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|Selznick {{observed}} {{that she had}} shown no enthusiasm for the part until <b>Olivier</b> had been confirmed as the lead actor, so he cast Joan Fontaine. He refused {{to allow her to}} join <b>Olivier</b> in Pride and Prejudice (1940), and Greer Garson played the role Leigh had wanted for herself. Waterloo Bridge (1940) was to have starred <b>Olivier</b> and Leigh; however, Selznick replaced <b>Olivier</b> with Robert Taylor, then {{at the peak of his}} success as one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most popular male stars. Her top billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and the film was popular with audiences and critics.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to London briefly in mid-1939, the couple returned to America, Leigh to film the final takes for Gone with the Wind, and <b>Olivier</b> {{to prepare for}} filming of Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca—although the couple had hoped to appear in it together. Instead, Joan Fontaine was selected {{for the role of}} Mrs de Winter, as the producer David O. Selznick thought that not only was she more suitable for the role, but that it was best to keep <b>Olivier</b> and Leigh apart until their divorces came through. <b>Olivier</b> followed Rebecca with Pride and Prejudice, in the role of Mr. Darcy. To his disappointment Elizabeth Bennet was played by Greer Garson rather than Leigh. He received good reviews for both films and showed a more confident screen presence than he had in his early work. In January 1940 <b>Olivier</b> and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the public}} {{strongly}} identified Leigh with {{her second husband}} Laurence <b>Olivier,</b> who was her spouse from 1940 to 1960. Leigh and <b>Olivier</b> starred together in many stage productions, with <b>Olivier</b> often directing, and in three films. She earned {{a reputation for being}} difficult to work with, and for much of her adult life she suffered from bipolar disorder as well as recurrent bouts of chronic tuberculosis, which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s and ultimately claimed her life at the age of 53. Although her career had periods of inactivity, in 1999 the American Film Institute ranked Leigh as the 16th greatest female movie star of classic Hollywood cinema.|$|E
5|$|Ben Daniels (born David T Daniels on 10 June 1964) is an English actor. Initially {{a celebrated}} stage actor, Daniels was {{nominated}} for an <b>Olivier</b> Award for Best Supporting Actor for Never the Sinner (1991), the Evening Standard Award for Best Actor for 900 Oneonta (1994), Best Actor in the M.E.N. Theatre Awards for Martin Yesterday (1998), and won the 2001 <b>Olivier</b> Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the Arthur Miller play All My Sons.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, under Albery's management, John Gielgud staged Romeo and Juliet at the New Theatre, co-starring with Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans and <b>Olivier.</b> Gielgud {{had seen}} <b>Olivier</b> in Queen of Scots, spotted his potential, and now {{gave him a}} major step up in his career. For the first weeks of the run Gielgud played Mercutio and <b>Olivier</b> played Romeo, after which they {{exchanged}} roles. The production broke all box-office records for the play, running for 189 performances. <b>Olivier</b> was enraged at the notices after the first night, which praised the virility of his performance but fiercely criticised his speaking of Shakespeare's verse, contrasting it with his co-star's mastery of the poetry. The friendship {{between the two men}} was prickly, on Olivier's side, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In February 1960, for his {{contribution}} to the film industry, <b>Olivier</b> {{was inducted into the}} Hollywood Walk of Fame, with a star at 6319 Hollywood Boulevard; he is included in the American Theater Hall of Fame. In 1977 <b>Olivier</b> was awarded a British Film Institute Fellowship.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the naming of the National Theatre's largest auditorium in his honour, <b>Olivier</b> is commemorated in the Laurence <b>Olivier</b> Awards, bestowed annually since 1984 by the Society of West End Theatre. In 1991 Olivier's friend, the actor John Gielgud, unveiled a memorial stone commemorating <b>Olivier</b> in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey. In 2007, the centenary of Olivier's birth, a life-sized statue of him was unveiled on the South Bank, outside the National Theatre; the same year the British Film Institute held a retrospective season of his film work.|$|E
5|$|In late 1954 {{and early}} 1955 Richardson {{and his wife}} toured Australia {{together}} with Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, playing Terence Rattigan's plays The Sleeping Prince and Separate Tables. The following year he worked with <b>Olivier</b> again, playing Buckingham to Olivier's Richard in the 1955 film of Richard III. <b>Olivier,</b> who directed, was exasperated at his old friend's insistence on playing the role sympathetically.|$|E
5|$|In {{their third}} {{production}} of the 1955 Stratford season, <b>Olivier</b> played the title role in Titus Andronicus, with Leigh as Lavinia. Her notices in the part were damning, but the production by Peter Brook and Olivier's performance as Titus received the greatest ovation in Stratford history from the first-night audience, and the critics hailed the production as a landmark in post-war British theatre. <b>Olivier</b> and Brook revived the production for a continental tour in June 1957; its final performance, which closed the old Stoll Theatre in London, {{was the last time}} Leigh and <b>Olivier</b> acted together.|$|E
5|$|Laurence <b>Olivier</b> as Dr. Totenkopf, {{the mysterious}} mad {{scientist}} and supervillain; <b>Olivier</b> had been deceased for nearly 13 {{years at the}} time of filming, and was depicted in the film via computer manipulation of video and audio from {{when he was a young}} actor.|$|E
5|$|Mézières {{experiences}} in the United States have provided the inspiration for several magazine articles published in Pilote, Tintin, and GEO magazines {{as well as two}} books – <b>Olivier</b> chez les cow-boys (<b>Olivier</b> with the Cowboys), a children's book written by Pierre Christin with photographs and illustrations by Mézières about a visit Christin's son <b>Olivier</b> paid to the ranch Mézières worked on in Utah and Adieu, rêve américain... (Farewell, American dreams...), again written by Christin with photographs and illustrations by Mézières, a nostalgic look back at their time in the United States.|$|E
5|$|<b>Olivier</b> Cruveiller as Vincent Lehmann, L'éditeur, Marie's old boss.|$|E
5|$|<b>Olivier</b> Levasseur, dit La Buse (1672–1730), pirate.|$|E
5|$|<b>Olivier</b> Messiaen et les oiseaux (1973). Directed by Michel Fano and Denise Tual.|$|E
5|$|Olivier's {{life was}} under {{threat from the}} Nazis and pro-German sympathisers. The studio owners were {{concerned}} enough that Samuel Goldwyn and Cecil B. DeMille both provided support and security to ensure his safety. On the completion of filming, <b>Olivier</b> and Leigh returned to Britain. He had spent the previous year learning to fly and had completed nearly 250 hours {{by the time he}} left America. He intended to join the Royal Air Force but instead made another propaganda film, 49th Parallel, narrated short pieces for the Ministry of Information, and joined the Fleet Air Arm because Richardson was already in the service. Richardson had gained a reputation for crashing aircraft, which <b>Olivier</b> rapidly eclipsed. <b>Olivier</b> and Leigh settled in a cottage just outside RAF Worthy Down, where he was stationed with a training squadron; Noël Coward visited the couple and thought <b>Olivier</b> looked unhappy. <b>Olivier</b> spent much of his time taking part in broadcasts and making speeches to build morale, and in 1942 he was invited to make another propaganda film, The Demi-Paradise, in which he played a Soviet engineer who helps improve British-Russian relationships.|$|E

5|$|The West End {{production}} won the Evening Standard Radio 2 Audience Award for Best New Musical, {{which was}} based on voting by the public at the 2015 Evening Standard Theatre Awards. The show earned seven nominations for the 2016 Laurence <b>Olivier</b> Awards, which was second to a revival of Gypsy, which earned eight nominations. Kinky Boots won three <b>Olivier</b> Awards: Best New Musical, Best Actor in a Musical and Best Costume Design, trailing only Gypsys four awards.|$|E
5|$|The {{last two}} stage plays <b>Olivier</b> {{directed}} were Jean Giradoux's Amphitryon (1971) and Priestley's Eden End (1974). By {{the time of}} Eden End, {{he was no longer}} director of the National Theatre; Peter Hall took over on 1 November 1973. The succession was tactlessly handled by the board, and <b>Olivier</b> felt that he had been eased out—although he had declared his intention to go—and that he had not been properly consulted about the choice of successor. The largest of the three theatres within the National's new building was named in his honour, but his only appearance on the stage of the <b>Olivier</b> Theatre was at its official opening by the Queen in October 1976, when he made a speech of welcome, which Hall privately described as the most successful part of the evening.|$|E
5|$|The third, and final, season {{under the}} triumvirate was in 1946–47. <b>Olivier</b> played King Lear, and Richardson, Cyrano de Bergerac. <b>Olivier</b> would have {{preferred}} the roles to be cast the other way about, but Richardson {{did not wish to}} attempt Lear. Richardson's other roles in the season were Inspector Goole in An Inspector Calls, Face in The Alchemist and John of Gaunt in Richard II, which he directed, with Alec Guinness in the title role.|$|E
5|$|Warren Mitchell {{earned the}} Laurence <b>Olivier</b> Award for Actor of the Year in a Revival in 1979 for his West End theatre {{performance}} of the role. Dennehy earned a Laurence <b>Olivier</b> Award for Best Actor in 2006 for his reprisal of the role in the West End.|$|E
5|$|Besides screen acting, McAvoy has {{performed}} in several West End productions and received three nominations for the Laurence <b>Olivier</b> Award for Best Actor. He has also done voice work for animated films including Gnomeo & Juliet and Arthur Christmas (both 2011).|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{married the}} much younger Marie-Thérèse Houphouët-Boigny in 1962, having {{divorced}} {{his first wife}} in 1952. The couple had no children of their own, but they adopted one: <b>Olivier</b> Antoine in 1981.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Gerard <b>Olivier,</b> a habitually frugal man, {{told his}} son {{that not only}} must he gain {{admission}} to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but he must also gain a scholarship with a bursary to cover his tuition fees and living expenses. Olivier's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of Elsie Fogerty, the founder and principal of the school. <b>Olivier</b> later speculated that {{it was on the}} strength of this that Fogerty agreed to award him the bursary.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 <b>Olivier</b> was {{appointed}} a Knight Bachelor, and in 1970 {{he was given}} a life peerage; the Order of Merit was conferred on him in 1981. He also received honours from foreign governments. In 1949 he was made Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog by the Danish government; the French appointed him Officier, Legion of Honour, in 1953; the Italian government created him Grande Ufficiale, Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, in 1953; and in 1971 he was granted the Order of Yugoslav Flag with Golden Wreath. From academic and other institutions, <b>Olivier</b> received honorary doctorates from the university of Tufts, Massachusetts (1946), Oxford (1957) and Edinburgh (1964). He was also awarded the Danish Sonning Prize for outstanding contributions to European culture in 1966, the Gold Medallion of the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities in 1968; and the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1976. In February 1960, for his contribution to the film industry, <b>Olivier</b> was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with a star at 6319 Hollywood Boulevard; he is also included in the American Theater Hall of Fame. In 1977, <b>Olivier</b> was awarded a British Film Institute Fellowship.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Leigh and Laurence <b>Olivier</b> {{performed}} {{two plays}} about Cleopatra, William Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra and George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra, alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a {{season at the}} Ziegfeld Theatre into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but film critic Kenneth Tynan angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent that forced <b>Olivier</b> to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, dwelt on his comments and ignored the positive reviews of other critics.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Leigh {{took the}} lead role in the Noël Coward play South Sea Bubble, but withdrew from the {{production}} when she became pregnant. Several weeks later, she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months. She joined <b>Olivier</b> for a European tour of Titus Andronicus, but the tour was marred by Leigh's frequent outbursts against <b>Olivier</b> {{and other members of}} the company. After their return to London, her former husband, Leigh Holman, who could still exert a strong influence on her, stayed with the Oliviers and helped calm her.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, <b>Olivier</b> {{directed}} Peter O'Toole as Hamlet in {{the inaugural}} {{performance of the}} newly formed National Theatre; critics found resonance between O'Toole's Hamlet and John Osborne's hero, Jimmy Porter, from Look Back in Anger.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 <b>Olivier</b> {{was caught}} in the middle of a {{confrontation}} between Chandos and Tynan over the latter's proposal to stage Rolf Hochhuth's Soldiers. As the play speculatively depicted Churchill as complicit in the assassination of the Polish prime minister Władysław Sikorski, Chandos regarded it as indefensible. At his urging the board unanimously vetoed the production. Tynan considered resigning over this interference with the management's artistic freedom, but <b>Olivier</b> himself stayed firmly in place, and Tynan also remained. At about this time <b>Olivier</b> began a long struggle against a succession of illnesses. He was treated for prostate cancer and, during rehearsals for his production of Chekhov's Three Sisters he was hospitalised with pneumonia. He recovered enough to take the heavy role of Edgar in Strindberg's The Dance of Death, the finest of all his performances other than in Shakespeare, in Gielgud's view.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, aged 89, she {{received}} her first <b>Olivier</b> Award as Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Arcati, and in November 2015 {{was awarded the}} Oscar Hammerstein Award for Lifetime Achievement in Musical Theatre.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Cumberbatch led {{the revival}} of Terence Rattigan's After the Dance {{directed}} by Thea Sharrock at the Royal National Theatre. He played 1920s aristocrat David Scott-Fowler to commercial and critical success. The play eventually won four <b>Olivier</b> Awards including Best Revival.|$|E
5|$|It was {{estimated}} that UBS {{spent as much}} as US$600million to US$700million hiring top bankers in the U.S. during this three-year period. Among the bank's other major recruits during this period were <b>Olivier</b> Sarkozy, Ben Lorello, Blair Effron, and Jeff McDermott.|$|E
5|$|<b>Olivier</b> Messiaen {{often used}} birdsong as an {{inspiration}} for his music, and the yellowhammer features in Chronochromie, Catalogue d'oiseaux, La fauvette des jardins and Méditations sur le mystère de la Sainte Trinité, appearing in four movements of the last piece.|$|E
