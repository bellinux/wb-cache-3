500|$|While {{writing the}} lyrics to Lightning Bolt, Vedder tried to be less cryptic in expressing his {{feelings}} compared to the [...] "word games" [...] of previous Pearl Jam albums. The songs discuss lasting relationships, bad faith ("Getaway," [...] "Mind Your Manners"), {{the state of the}} world ("Infallible") and life's transience ("Pendulum"), which Vedder summed up as [...] "the same mysteries that I’ve been trying to unravel for a few decades now." [...] Gossard explained that the reflective tone was indicative of the bandmembers' age: [...] " [...] 40-something, almost 50-something, you're looking at life through your kids' eyes, through the filter of relationships that are 20 or 30 years long, through the filter <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> getting older and the passing of friends and relatives-relationships and all that they encompass, the difficulties of them and the sacrifices you make in them and also the joy they bring you." [...] Vedder at first was afraid of writing songs about mortality, but relented given he felt that [...] "death is everywhere" [...] and writing about death would help [...] "getting through it", as [...] "living to the day you die, and being cognizant of the end, you might lead a more appreciative life". One of the compositions about the theme was [...] "Future Days", which discusses the loss of Vedder's friend Dennis Flemion, who accidentally drowned in 2012. The concernment in the songs also owed to Vedder being a father, as the singer detailed that [...] "It’s going to be their world and what is their future? It feels like there is a lot that can be lost in the next 50 years if people don’t pay attention." ...|$|E

[...] The scholar said: [...] "think <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents</b> passing". [...] "Doesn't work", he responded. [...] "Your own last breath", [...] "no use". Whatever the scholar said didn't work. He finally got mad and said: [...] "so just come fuck me you ass". The guy responded: [...] "your holiness's wish is my command".|$|E
2500|$|After the {{completion}} of binary fission or cell reproduction involving mitosis, each daughter cell has {{the same amount of}} DNA (Z) as what the parental cell had before it replicated its DNA. These two types of cell reproduction produced two daughter cells that have the same number of chromosomes as the parental cell. Chromosomes duplicate prior to cell division when forming new skin cells for reproduction. After meiotic cell reproduction the four daughter cells have half the number of chromosomes that the parental cell originally had. This is the haploid amount of DNA, often symbolized as N. Meiosis is used by diploid organisms to produce haploid gametes. In a diploid organism such as the human organism, most cells of [...] the body have the diploid amount of DNA, 2N. Using this notation for counting chromosomes we say that human somatic cells have 46 chromosomes (2N = 46) while human sperm and eggs have 23 chromosomes (N = 23). Humans have 23 distinct types of chromosomes, the 22 autosomes and the special category of sex chromosomes. There are two distinct sex chromosomes, the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. A diploid human cell has 23 chromosomes from that person's father and 23 from the mother. That is, your body has two copies of human chromosome number 2, one from each <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents.</b>|$|E

Second cousins share great-grandparents. People occasionally mistake the child of their own first cousin as their [...] "second cousin" [...] - however that would actually be a first cousin once removed. The removal denotes the generational difference.|$|R
2500|$|Denisof {{had earlier}} {{stated that he}} thought [...] "it's better for the father [...] {{to be kept in}} the {{background}} and not become part of the story." [...] When Wesley's father finally did appear in Angel season five, he said:I had mixed feelings [...] It was {{a lot of pressure to}} have to define something that had been speculated about for many years. I was worried that by making it specific, it would lose its power, both in the mind of the character and in the minds of the audience. All my concerns disappeared as soon as I read it. There are responses to powerful figures in your life, like your parents, that you can't necessarily control. Wesley's a very controlled person on the exterior and presents a very collected persona to the people around him, being with his father he would no longer be able to control his responses. That's one of the things I wanted to explore with this, the subtle ways in which you respond to the conditioning <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>parents.</b> Wesley has difficulty around his father on a physical level, on an emotional scale, and on an intellectual scale. He is extremely intimidated by his father, and at the same time, still seeking the approval that we all essentially want from our parents when we're children. The shooting [...] was an exhilarating moment in which there was the most dangerous person in his life on every level, and there is a woman he is obsessed with. And to have the woman jeopardized by something as dangerous as his father [...] I played that moment as a moment of pure instinct. Wesley is centered in his intellect and is more uncertain in his emotional life, but in that moment, he becomes pure instinct because he has to choose between the woman he loves and his father.|$|E
