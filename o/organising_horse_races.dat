50|$|Horses {{had arrived}} in Australia with the First Fleet in 1788 and the first <b>organised</b> <b>horse</b> <b>race</b> was run at Hyde Park in 1810.

The first race meeting was held at Coopers Plains on 17 July 1843 and there was a racecourse at New Farm in Brisbane by May 1846. In 1848 the towns of Warwick, Ipswich and Drayton organised race meetings. Government authorities took racing seriously as more than a sport as horses were then the main means of transport for economic, military and recreational purposes and racing was thought to help improve breeding.|$|R

5000|$|After the Communist {{takeover}} of Shanghai in 1949, the Trustees of the Shanghai Recreation Fund {{wrote to the}} new Communist administration to voluntarily hand over {{the properties of the}} Recreation Club, including the sports ground at the centre of the Racecourse. Because the Race Club and the Recreation Club had by now effectively become one, the government waited until the next year to officially [...] "receive" [...] the properties of both the Race Club and the Recreation Club at the Racecourse. The Racecourse was placed under military administration on 31 May 1951. The land occupied by the Racecourse was resumed by the government, the Club's buildings remained in its hands, but it had to pay land tax. In September, the government began reconstruction of the race course as People's Park and People's Square. As the Club still could not <b>organise</b> <b>horse</b> <b>races,</b> it did not have any significant income, and by 1954 owed large amounts of land tax and staff salary. The Club {{had no choice but to}} hand over all of its properties to the government to pay these debts.|$|R

40|$|Introduction In its heyday, the 1920 s {{through the}} late 1950 s, <b>horse</b> <b>racing</b> was a highly popular spectator sport. But after decades of prosperity, <b>horse</b> <b>racing</b> has flashed warning signs of {{economic}} trouble. Throughout the industry, old tracks, like Hialeah, are closing and new tracks are experiencing economic difficulties due to legalized off-track betting {{and other forms of}} legalized gambling. 1 Off-track betting and inter-track wagering, along with the proliferation of other gambling options, have been cited by many as reasons for the recent decline in both on-track <b>horse</b> <b>racing</b> attendance and handle. A widening gap between <b>horse</b> <b>racing</b> and other forms of wagering represents a shift in American gambling behavior.

50|$|The terms <b>horse</b> <b>race</b> and handicapping the <b>horse</b> <b>race,</b> {{have been}} used to {{describe}} media coverage of elections.
