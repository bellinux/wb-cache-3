5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects <b>of</b> <b>inflation,</b> notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the devaluation of the currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates <b>of</b> <b>inflation</b> around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new measure <b>of</b> core <b>inflation</b> for the UK {{based on the}} idea that it is the persistence <b>of</b> individual <b>inflation</b> rates which matters in measuring the level <b>of</b> underlying <b>inflation.</b> The measure is based on the same components as RPIX, but it weights individual price changes by their past persistence, instead of their importance in households 9 ̆ 2 budgets, to derive a persistence-weighted core inflation measure, or RPIXP for short. This operationalises Blinder 9 ̆ 2 s concept <b>of</b> core <b>inflation</b> as the durable or persistence part <b>of</b> aggregate <b>inflation.</b> The paper evaluates this new measure against existing measures in terms of its ability to predict future RPIX inflation. It finds that the new RPIXP is a good predictor of RPIX 6 months and 12 months ahead, and outperforms most other core inflation measures, as well as current RPIX itself, in its predictive ability. Surprisingly, RPIX excluding food and energy - which is a popular way <b>of</b> measuring underlying <b>inflation</b> - is a poor predictor of RPIX.

40|$|Inflation in Albania fell rapidly once {{comprehensive}} stabilization {{policies and}} market-oriented reforms were launched, {{in contrast to}} other transition economies, where price liberalization was generally followed by persistently high inflation.

This also demonstrates the usefulness <b>of</b> estimating core <b>inflation</b> for transition economies. The early success in curbing inflation is attributed to the extremely broad scope of initial price liberalization coupled with key supporting measures. It also gives hope for early recovery from Albania’s 1997 economic crisis. ...|$|R

40|$|The Federal Reserve {{has made}} {{significant}} progress toward price stability {{over the last two}} decades. The annual inflation rate has declined from 13 percent in the early 1980 s to roughly 2 percent today. But, to be sure, the current low-inflation environment has come at a price. > One key cost <b>of</b> achieving low <b>inflation</b> is the output loss that generally accompanies a permanent decline in inflation, as occurred in the early 1980 s and early 1990 s. Another more subtle output cost <b>of</b> fighting <b>inflation</b> is the cost <b>of</b> preventing <b>inflation</b> from rising. As incipient inflation pressures build, tighter monetary policy can slow the economy and thereby preemptively forestall the rise in actual inflation. The slower output growth is the cost <b>of</b> resisting <b>inflation</b> pressures. Together, these two output costs <b>of</b> fighting <b>inflation</b> play important roles in determining how best to maintain low inflation and how to seek further disinflation toward price stability. > A significant factor determining the output cost <b>of</b> fighting <b>inflation</b> is the tradeoff between inflation and output, {{often referred to as the}} Phillips curve. Traditionally, estimates of this relationship assume the shape of this curve is linear. This implies that the slope of the Phillips curve is a constant and, therefore, independent of the stage of the business cycle, the speed of the disinflation, and how aggressively incipient inflation pressures are fought. Recent research, however, has begun to question whether the slope is constant. Assessing the output cost <b>of</b> fighting <b>inflation</b> may be more complicated than traditionally assumed. > Filardo investigates the shape of the Phillips curve and the associated output cost <b>of</b> fighting <b>inflation.</b> He concludes that, while the Phillips curve traditionally has been thought of as approximately linear, closer examination of the inflation-output relationship reveals important nonlinearities. This new evidence and its implications for the output cost <b>of</b> fighting <b>inflation</b> may require new policy strategies. Inflation (Finance); Phillips curve...|$|R
