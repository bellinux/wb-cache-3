40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{study on the}} step-controlled homoepitaxial growth on the (0001) Si-face of vicinal 4 H-SiC substrates was performed {{in order to establish}} epitaxial growth on 2 ° towards <b>off-cut</b> substrates and 4 ° towards <b>off-cut</b> substrates. A standard epitaxial growth process was developed by optimizing the growth temperature T, Si/H ratio and C/Si ratio for growth on 4 ° towards <b>off-cut</b> substrates. Thereby, step-controlled epitaxial growth was achieved within a broad operating window. The surface roughness of such epilayers varies typically between rms = 0. 5 nm and rms = 2. 5 nm and step-controlled growth is conserved even at a growth rate of 27 μm/h. Then, the standard growth process was applied to substrates with different <b>off-cut</b> angles of 2 °, 4 ° and 8 ° as well as with different <b>off-cut</b> directions and. The step-controlled growth was achieved also within a wide range of Si/H ratio and C/Si ratio for growth on 8 ° and 4 ° <b>off-cut</b> substrates, but the process window narrows strongly for growth on 2 ° <b>off-cut</b> substrates. The epilayers surface roughness increases with decreasing <b>off-cut</b> angle of the substrate. Epilayers grown on 4 ° towards <b>off-cut</b> substrates were significantly smoother than epilayers grown on 4 ° towards <b>off-cut</b> substrates. No influence of the substrates <b>off-cut</b> angle and direction on the growth rate was found. The experimental results of this {{comprehensive study}} are discussed globally in consideration of other relevant publications...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} the <b>off-cut</b> angle of a 4 H-SiC (0001) {{substrate}} on the growth of InN thick layer by RF-plasma assisted molecular beam epitaxy (RF-MBE) has been investigated. The <b>off-cut</b> angle {{used in this study}} was inclined from 0 ° (just surface) toward the [11 – 20] direction of 4 ° and 8 °. Crystalline quality and surface morphology were remarkably sensitive to the value of off-angle. Higher <b>off-cut</b> angles result in a reduction of the full-widths at half-maximum of HRXRD (0002) ω-scans, compared to that of the layer on the (0001) -just surface. In addition, the full-widths at halfmaximum of μ-Raman scattering spectra at 490 cm- 1, which is attributed to E 2 (high) phonon mode, was decreased with increase in <b>off-cut</b> angle. Furthermore, In-droplets, which are commonly observed on the (0001) InN grown surface under In rich-growth condition, were found to be suppressed owing to an improvement of a nucleation on the <b>off-cut</b> angle surface. In our case, the use of 8 °-off substrate increased film density and growth rate, while a surface roughness was reduced. These results clearly demonstrate that the larger <b>off-cut</b> angles improve the crystalline quality of InN film with reducing the In-droplets due to a higher step surface density on the <b>off-cut</b> angle surface...|$|E

The GaAs films were grown on off-oriented Ge substrates with growth temperature {{in the range of}} 600 - 700 oC, growth rate of 3 - 12 mm/hr and a V/III ratio of 29 - 88. The lattice indexing of HRTEM exhibits an excellent lattice line matching between GaAs and Ge substrate.

40|$|Homoepitaxial {{growth on}} 4 ° {{off-axis}} substrates with different <b>off-cut</b> directions, i. e. [11 - 20] and [1 - 100], was investigated using a commercial CVD reactor. The {{characteristics of the}} growth process on substrates with different <b>off-cut</b> directions were determined with respect to applicable C/Si ratio, growth rate and {{n- and p-type doping}} range. Stable step flow growth was achieved over a broad range of C/Si ratio at growth rates 15 m/h in both cases. The n-type doping level of epilayers can be controlled at least in the range from 5 × 1014 cm- 3 to 3 × 1017 cm - 3 on both types of substrates. Highly p-type epilayers with p = 2 × 1019 cm- 3 can also be grown on [1 - 100] <b>off-cut</b> substrates. Hence, the growth process for standard substrates was successfully transferred to [1 - 100] <b>off-cut</b> substrates resulting in epilayers with similar doping levels. The dislocation content of the grown epilayers was investigated by means of defect selective etching (DSE) in molten KOH. For both <b>off-cut</b> directions of the substrates, similar densities of threading edge dislocations (TED), threading screw dislocations (TSD) and basal plane dislocations (BPD) were found in the epilayers. Epilayers with very low BPD density can be grown on both kinds of substrates. The remaining BPDs in epilayers are inclined along the <b>off-cut</b> direction of the substrate. The surface morphology and roughness was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM).

40|$|AbstractSelf-assembled quantum {{structures}} {{have been}} successfully grown {{for some time now}} but control over their uniformity has proven difficult due to the stochastic nature of surface diffusion. We have investigated the effect of vicinal InP(001) substrates on the uniformity of InAs quantum wires grown on InGaAlAs lattice-matched to InP using molecular beam epitaxy. Dense quantum wires were grown on both nominally flat and vicinal substrates <b>off-cut</b> by 0. 9 ° toward the [110] direction for comparison. The <b>off-cut</b> angle was chosen to provide terraces which match the orientation and spacing of wires grown on nominally flat substrates. A modest but statistically significant improvement in the size distribution of the wires was observed on vicinal substrates through the analysis of ultrahigh resolution scanning electron micrographs. The interface between the wires and the <b>off-cut</b> substrate was studied using cross-sectional high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. In addition, a kinetic Monte Carlo model of epitaxial growth including full strain calculations was developed to further investigate the nucleation process. Using an anisotropic bond model to account for the surface energy of different crystallographic facets, our simulations produced wires similar to those observed experimentally while demonstrating the importance of anisotropic bonding compared to anisotropic diffusion. Growth on vicinal substrates is also simulated here and indicates that <b>off-cut</b> substrates should indeed improve the size distribution of quantum wires under proper growth conditions...|$|E
