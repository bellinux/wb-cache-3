5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents {{argue that it is}} irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.|$|E
5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} just {{as important}} an industry as whaling. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale <b>of</b> <b>seal</b> harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of the}} hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic fur seals may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E

5|$|Other {{marine mammal}} prey species include nearly 20 species <b>of</b> <b>seal,</b> sea lion and fur seal. Walruses and sea otters are less {{frequently}} taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing {{it in the}} air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. Sea lions are killed by head-butting or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbour seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 We {{evaluated}} {{the influences of}} environmental covariates on the proportion <b>of</b> harbor <b>seals</b> (Phoca vitulina richardsi) ashore on Tugidak Island using a series of photographic capture-recapture experiments and ground based counts. We used general linear models to examine the significance of combinations of covariates including quadratics terms. Time of day, tide height, rate of tide change, surf, and wind speed significantly influenced the number <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> ashore during the molting period. The model including all significant covariates best explained the probability <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> being hauled out. We observed {{a decline in the}} local population using the haulout suggesting that seasonal migration affects the number <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> ashore. The relationship between covariates and the number <b>of</b> <b>seals</b> hauled out on Tugidak Island differ in some respects from those reported at other sites in Alaska, implying that a region wide application of a single correction factor to counts of hauled out harbor seals may not adequately account for seals at sea...|$|R
