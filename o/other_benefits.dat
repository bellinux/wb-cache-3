5|$|Beginning in 2008, {{a bridge}} {{replacement}} and expansion project got underway on Illinois 22 at the interchange with Interstate 94. This {{was necessary for}} the tollway which travels underneath to be widened to eight lanes. The old bridge, which was five lanes wide, was rebuilt with one that is eight lanes and includes full length dual left turn lanes in both directions. <b>Other</b> <b>benefits</b> are the improved entrances and exits {{to and from the}} interstate, modernized traffic signals, and the use of concrete pavement. The bulk of the work was completed by December 2009, however both sets of dual left turn lanes were not in operation until the following spring.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} rapid {{industrial}} growth that began in Indiana during the gas boom of the late 19th-century, labor unions began to form with goals of increasing wages and providing <b>other</b> <b>benefits</b> to workers through collective bargaining. The Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company was founded to own and operate the streetcar terminal in downtown Indianapolis, and operate the Indianapolis Street Railway under a lease agreement for a term of 31 years. In 1892 the employees of Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company launched a short-lived strike. The company was the primary public transportation provider in Indianapolis and operated the central transportation hub {{for the city of}} Indianapolis and state of Indiana. The company offered small concessions, and the workers returned to work without unionizing.|$|E
5|$|Furry {{conventions}} {{are usually}} run and staffed by volunteers, though venues may require certain activities to be contracted out. Event funding typically relies on convention registrations. Many {{of the larger}} conventions are incorporated as non-profit organizations, usually to achieve tax-exempt status and safeguard the organizers' personal assets - in the US, some are 501(c)(3) charities, while others are registered as recreational clubs. The largest events may require up to a hundred volunteers, not including gofers. Volunteers are thanked for their participation during the closing ceremonies, which are usually well-attended, and often receive T-shirts or <b>other</b> <b>benefits.</b>|$|E

This first tour, however, was struck by misfortune; on 1 October 1956, while landing in bad weather at London Heathrow Airport at the completion of the world tour, XA897 was destroyed in a fatal accident.|$|E

The women were paid salaries and received <b>other</b> <b>benefits,</b> such as dowries and apartments in the ducal palace. Peverara received 300 scudi a year and lodging in the ducal palace for herself, her husband, and her mother - as well as a dowry of 10,000 scudi upon her marriage.|$|E

5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and <b>other</b> <b>benefits,</b> increasing the average cost of benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E
5|$|Local {{residents}} were evicted, including 1,200 {{people who lived}} in shacks around the barracks. Around 300 Jewish residents of Oświęcim were brought in to lay foundations. From 1940 to 1941, 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of Oświęcim were expelled from places adjacent to the camp. The Germans also ordered expulsions of Poles from the villages of Broszkowice, Babice, Brzezinka, Rajsko, Pławy, Harmęże, Bór, and Budy to the General Government. German citizens were offered tax concessions and <b>other</b> <b>benefits</b> if they would relocate to the area. By October 1943, more than 6,000 Reich Germans had arrived. The Nazis planned to build a model modern residential area for incoming Germans, including schools, playing fields, and other amenities. Some of the plans went forward, including the construction of several hundred apartments, but many were never fully implemented. Basic amenities such as water and sewage disposal were inadequate, and water-borne illnesses were commonplace.|$|E
