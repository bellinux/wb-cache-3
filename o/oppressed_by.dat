5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and <b>oppressed</b> <b>by</b> government officials, leading {{it to be}} {{the primary}} client of the ACLU. The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free speech rights of conservatives. This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.|$|E

Some women feel <b>oppressed</b> <b>by</b> make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard gameplay, the player {{will also have to}} defeat the games' main antagonist force, Team Plasma, a Knights Templar-esque group who claim that Pokémon are <b>oppressed</b> <b>by</b> humanity and seek to liberate them from their trainers. Team Plasma is led by N, a young man who was brought up alongside Pokémon and sees them as friends rather than tools for sport. Throughout the game, the player has some encounters with N, who claims that by capturing one of the legendary Pokémon (Reshiram and Zekrom) of Unova and defeating the Pokémon Champion Alder, he will be recognized as Unova's hero and will be able to convince the humans to part with their Pokémon. Depending on the game version, N will capture Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{consolidation}} of Wallachia, waves of nomadic peoples – the last of them being the Cumans and the Mongols – rode across the territory. The territory became a frontier area between the Golden Horde (the westernmost part of the Mongol Empire) and the Kingdom of Hungary after 1242. The Romanians in Muntenia, east of the Olt River, had {{to pay tribute to}} the Mongols; and west of the river, in Oltenia, they were <b>oppressed</b> <b>by</b> the Bans of Severin, appointed by the Kings of Hungary. The Golden Horde's domination decreased in the region {{at the end of the}} 13th century, and at that time the Kingdom of Hungary also underwent a strong political crisis. These events enabled the incipient states of the territory to consolidate their autonomy.|$|E

5|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} Lincoln's American {{reputation}} grew {{slowly in the}} late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he {{emerged as one of}} the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported the welfare state. In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those <b>oppressed</b> <b>by</b> communist regimes.|$|E
5|$|Döblin {{completed}} work on November 1918 in {{the spring}} of 1943, but was unable to find a publisher. The only work of his that was published in German during his American exile was a private printing of 250 copies of the Nocturno episode from November 1918. Döblin was embittered by his isolation and setbacks in exile, drawing a strong distinction between his own situation and that of more successful writers less <b>oppressed</b> <b>by</b> material concerns, such as Lion Feuchtwanger and Thomas Mann. In honor of his 65th birthday, Helene Weigel organized a party on 14 August 1943 in Santa Monica. In attendance were Thomas Mann, Franz Werfel, Lion Feuchtwanger, and Bertolt Brecht, among others. Heinrich Mann gave a speech, Fritz Kortner, Peter Lorre, and Alexander Granach read aloud from Döblin's works, and he was presented with notes of congratulation and praise from Brecht, Max Horkheimer, and Alfred Polgar, among others. Compositions by Hanns Eisler were performed, and Blandine Ebinger sang Berlin chansons. Yet the festivities were dampened when Döblin gave a speech in which he mentioned his conversion to Catholicism; the religious, moral tone proved alienating, and fell on unsympathetic ears.|$|E
5|$|Nationalist {{activity}} ceased {{during the}} course of World War I (WWI) and many nationalists were killed in the trenches. The nationalist movement was revived by the periodical Breiz Atao, which was founded in 1919. In 1923, it adopted Pan-Celticist ideals, drawing a line between Gauls and Bretons, and arguing that the traditionally federal Bretons were <b>oppressed</b> <b>by</b> the autocratic Latins of France. Support was instead to be sought in the north, the Easter Rising and the Irish War of Independence were portrayed as the implementations of a successful formula that was to be emulated shall France find itself in dire straits. The incorporation of Alsace-Lorraine into France as a consequence of Germany's defeat in WWI, {{led to the creation of}} an Alsatian autonomist movement that opposed the French imposition of Laïcité. In 1928, Breizh Atao established contacts with the Alsace-Lorraine Party, which in turn facilitated the spread of Nordism and Völkisch ideology into Breton nationalist circles. Ties with the ethnically German Alsatians strengthened and with them the idea of accepting Abwehr assistance, which was already being provided to the Flemish and Alsatians alike.|$|E
