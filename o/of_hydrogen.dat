40|$|Abstract—NMR {{experiments}} {{can provide}} distances between pairs <b>of</b> <b>hydrogens</b> <b>of</b> a protein molecule. The problem of identifying the coordinates <b>of</b> such <b>hydrogens</b> by exploiting {{the information on}} the distances is a Molecular Distance Geometry Problem (MDGP). In a previous work, we defined an artificial backbone <b>of</b> <b>hydrogens</b> related to the protein backbones, where a particular ordering was given to the hydrogens. This ordering allows to formulate the MDGP as a combinatorial optimization problem, to which we refer as the Discretizable MDGP (DMDGP) and that we efficiently solve by an exact algorithm, the Branch and Prune (BP) algorithm. Once the coordinates <b>of</b> the <b>hydrogens</b> have been found, the problem of finding the remaining backbone atoms (N, Cα and C) is another MDGP. In this short paper, we propose a simple method for solving the MDGP related to the backbone atoms N, Cα and C of a protein, where the coordinates <b>of</b> the <b>hydrogens</b> previously found by the BP algorithm are exploited.
