5|$|After {{an attempt}} on Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) life, Mark is {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective in the case. When he received conflicting information from the suspects he interviews, Mark struggled to identify the culprit. McGregor told a writer from SX News that he enjoyed {{being involved in the}} storyline, as he had never had that much responsibility before. To prepare for the role, McGregor chose to research his character's job. Mark was described as being handsome, charming and a perfectionist. He was dedicated to his job as a police detective and often put his work ahead <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b> As a consequence, Mark struggled to balance his work and personal lives. McGregor stated that he shared some similarities with Mark and he enjoyed getting into character.|$|E
25|$|He {{begins by}} briefly proving the {{immortality}} of the soul. A soul {{is always in}} motion and as a self-mover has no beginning. A self-mover is itself the source <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> that moves. So, by the same token, it cannot be destroyed. Bodily objects moved from the outside have no soul, while those that move from within have a soul. Moving from within, all souls are self-movers, and hence their immortality is necessary.|$|E
25|$|Another great {{irritant}} {{was that}} it was open to all pros including A pros. Indeed, one pro was in the mains of the pro car race and therefore had a real shot at becoming National no. 1 pro, despite being only an A pro. On top <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else,</b> A pro needn't had been a pro {{at the start of the}} season. An amateur could theoretically race the required number of nationals as an amateur, turn pro before the Grand National and have a shot at the Pro number one title and the car.|$|E

Many of the girls at Molly's school have a crush on him, and even Molly herself after she turned 12, but {{not as strong as}} Margie Lussman who hates seeing him with Molly. Tyler hates it when Molly comes up with plans {{involving}} Zoey since they all usually end with him getting punished along with Molly, but despite this he's still a major help in most of them.|$|E
500|$|In 1898 Law {{retired from}} the vice-presidency of W. & J. Sloane, moved {{with his family to}} the area and began devoting his time to agriculture. He rapidly added to his holdings, buying about forty parcels in less than ten years; by 1900, Law owned more than [...] of Westchester County and was its largest {{individual}} landholder. Some previous owners became tenant farmers; Law received half of the hay and straw from a [...] farm formerly owned by Jesse Bishop, and one-third <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b> Law and Briarcliff Farms initially deepened the Pocantico River for , taking out rifts so the stream would flow and adjacent swamps would drain. Workers also cut rock and took out trees lining the swamps to reclaim land for farming.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after he}} was cast, McGregor said that Mark was [...] "a no-nonsense type. Work is his life, and when he's not at work, he's {{thinking}} about work". McGregor told the show's official website that he did some research on police officers {{to prepare for the}} role. The writers also went through their research with him. Jackie Brygel from TV Week described Mark as being [...] "handsome" [...] and a [...] "charming investigator." [...] Mark is a perfectionist, who puts his work ahead <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> and he struggles to hold down a relationship because of it. His dedication to his job means that he does not have much time to socialise. When McGregor was asked if there were any similarities between him and Mark, he said that there was and that he liked getting into character.|$|E

500|$|In {{an essay}} condemning [...] "scientism {{in the study}} of man", Rothbard {{rejected}} the application of causal determinism to human beings, arguing that the actions of human beings, as opposed to those <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> in nature, are not determined by prior causes but by [...] "free will". He argued that [...] "determinism as applied to man, is a self-contradictory thesis, since the man who employs it relies implicitly on the existence of free will." [...] Rothbard opposed what he considered the overspecialization of the academy and sought to fuse the disciplines of economics, history, ethics, and political science to create a [...] "science of liberty." [...] Rothbard described the moral basis for his anarcho-capitalist position in two of his books: For a New Liberty, published in 1973, and The Ethics of Liberty, published in 1982. In his Power and Market (1970), Rothbard describes how a stateless economy might function.|$|E
500|$|For the 2002 album One Deep Breath, Joseph {{combines}} [...] "structured melodic {{pieces and}} free-form ambient compositions", which [...] "departs dramatically {{from the previous}} more explosive and dynamic music on his first two recordings, Hear the Masses and Rapture". [...] Binkelman writes, [...] "It is an album with two distinct 'feels' to it: the more serene new age/ambient soundscapes that bookend the inner tracks and the more radio-friendly and mainstream music in-between." [...] For instance, the song [...] "Dance of Life" [...] was inspired by Antonín Dvořák's opera, [...] "Rusalka". [...] It {{is a bit more}} straightforward in its piano presentation, and will probably appeal the most to hardcore fans of solo instrumental music, says Instrumental Weekly. [...] Then the album closes with its title track, [...] "One Deep Breath", that [...] "floats and meanders for more than ten minutes, bringing in ocean sounds". It is [...] "far and away the most ambient <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> to be found here", [...] and is [...] "stunning, both in its execution and how radical a change it is from what has come before".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning did {{not enjoy}} the green theme in the episode, reasoning that it [...] "just seemed {{to get in the}} way <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> happening in 'Sun Tea'." [...] He was not thrilled with Jack and Tracy's storyline, noting it was missing heart and emotion, and overall it felt [...] "flat". Canning felt that Al Gore's cameo was [...] "fun but wholly unnecessary." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad gave [...] "Sun Tea" [...] a mixed review, noting [...] "I don't know how funny it was, though. I mean, sure, there was still a ton of great lines tonight... but not all of them hit the mark like they usually do." [...] Nonetheless, Sassone concluded [...] "...any 30 Rock episode with Dr. Spaceman and a couple of digs at NBC's Green Week is still a pretty good one." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said this episode of 30 Rock was [...] "even more of a comedy drag race than usual." ...|$|E
50|$|While Willigis' was {{responsible}} for the coronation as archbishop <b>of</b> Mainz, <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> in this election was counter to tradition: the location of the conclave, the fact that Henry did not sit upon the Throne of Charlemagne and of course the fact that not all electors were present at the conclave.|$|R
5000|$|In its {{review of}} the 1997 reissue, Musician {{magazine}} stated, [...] "nobody had more emotional range or profound melodic gift than John Fahey....

500|$|Apart from Enesco, he was {{the most}} {{cultivated}} violinist I have ever known but while Enesco was a force of nature, Szigeti, slender, small, anxious, was a beautifully fashioned piece of porcelain, a priceless Sèvres vase. Curiously for a Hungarian, from whom one expects wild, energetic, spontaneous qualities, Szigeti travelled even farther up a one-way road of deliberate intellectualism. A young accompanist who worked with Szigeti told me that two hours concentration wouldn't get them beyond the first three bars of a sonata--so much analysis and ratiocination went into his practice ... A similar persnicketiness marked his adjudication. Shortly before he died in 1973, {{he was a member of}} our jury at the City of London Carl Flesch Concours ... I was struck not only by the sharpness of his intellect but also by what seemed to me the perversity of his opinions. Some particular aspect of a competitor's playing would hold his attention, and he would take violent issue with it, to the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else.</b> For him a violinist was made or broken, a prize awarded or withheld, on details that to me scarcely mattered.|$|E
500|$|Later {{that month}} Gasper complained that readers of Pink News had {{threatened}} her, declaring {{that they should}} be forcibly institutionalised under the Mental Health Act. In doing so, she compared her situation to that of Salman Rushdie during The Satanic Verses controversy. She then claimed that she had received email death threats and was under police protection, assertions that local police refused to either confirm or deny. Commenting to Cherwell, she claimed her views on LGBT issues were [...] "very, very middle ground" [...] and that she had not said anything homophobic, but been the victim of [...] "a malicious witch hunt". Roweena Russell, former chair of the International Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Youth and Student Organisation, emailed Gasper to discuss the latter's comments, to which Gasper responded that Russell too should be institutionalised. Russell proceeded to condemn Gasper, stating that [...] "as a long-term political activist I'm disgusted she used this kind of language. Using mental health as a slur on top <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> she's doing is just unacceptable." [...] Rafe Jeune, chair of Oxford's Pride parade, characterised Gasper's comments as [...] "abhorrent" [...] and [...] "disgusting", noting that there was no evidence to link paedophilia and homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|Mike Hale for the New York Times praised Mays' performance, noting: [...] "Jayma Mays {{registered}} Emma’s devastation {{with just}} the slightest widening of those enormous eyes. In fact all the best non-singing moments in the episode were hers." [...] Hale was less impressed {{with the rest of}} the episode, deeming the pregnancy storyline [...] "so boring that is hardly mattered". He noted that: [...] "For many viewers, the best moments in the episode probably came very early on and involved Jane Lynch’s Sue Sylvester, who still got all the best lines." [...] Jarett Wieselman for the New York Post agreed with this assessment, opining that although the episode was [...] "filled with more brilliant moments than ever before", the stand-out scene was Sue writing in her journal, which Wieselman deemed [...] "jam-packed with so many one liners, it acted as a vacuum, sucking the smart out <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> on TV from 9:05 to 9:07pm." [...] Fellow New York Post critic Maxine Shen deemed the episode her favorite of the series so far. Anna Pickard of The Guardian called the pseudoephedrine storyline [...] "relentlessly silly [...] but joyfully so", preferring the boys' performance to the girls' as [...] "some excellent comedy helped me forget about Finn's dodgy autotuned vocals for once".|$|E

500|$|A major effect {{required}} {{throughout the}} episode was face replacements, {{especially during the}} 'May vs. May' fight where it had to appear as if Wen was fighting herself. All the effects were completed in the two weeks between the filming and airing of the episode. Wen noted that [...] "Kevin Tancharoen directed [...] and he’s amazing with his directing with the Mortal Kombat series. So we had this really complicated sequence where we do this 360 and it reveals me and it reveals me again and there’s no cut and you wonder how that happens {{in one of the}} fight sequences. And that’s because they completely scanned and CGIed my face onto the stunt double. So there’s a tremendous amount of work that went into the fight scenes and we did not {{have a lot of time}} to do it." [...] She also elaborated that [...] "On the day of, you have the set and you have the cameras, and you have to deal with special effects, because on top <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> we had to scan my face and go through this incredible process of taking a million pictures so they were able to meld it onto Sam’s face." ...|$|E
2500|$|In any case, after {{clarifying}} {{the sense of}} the term [...] "denoting phrase" [...] and providing several examples to illustrate the idea, Russell explains the epistemological motivations for his theory. Russell believes at this point that there are essentially two modes of knowing: knowledge by description and knowledge by (direct) acquaintance. Knowledge by acquaintance is limited to the sense data of the phenomenal world and to one's own private inner experiences, while knowledge <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> (other minds, physical objects, and so on) can only be known by way of general descriptions.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{account is}} in full {{agreement}} with Aristotle's description of Plato's metaphysical doctrine. In Metaphysics he writes: [...] "Now since the Forms are the causes <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else,</b> he [...] supposed that their elements are the elements of all things. Accordingly the material principle is the Great and Small , and the essence is the One (τὸ ἕν), since the numbers are derived from the Great and Small by participation in the One" [...] (987 b). [...] "From this account {{it is clear that}} he only employed two causes: that of the essence, and the material cause; for the Forms are the cause of the essence in everything else, and the One is the cause of it in the Forms. He also tells us what the material substrate is of which the Forms are predicated in the case of sensible things, and the One in that of the Forms - that it is this the duality (the Dyad, ἡ δυάς), the Great and Small (τὸ μέγα καὶ τὸ μικρόν). Further, he assigned to these two elements respectively the causation of good and of evil" [...] (988 a).|$|E

5000|$|Richard Roeper stated, [...] "This is a {{competent}} but mostly unexceptional {{film about a}} most extraordinary man." [...] Lisa Kennedy, of the Denver Post, lauded the film, saying [...] "This story inspires and entertains with a vital chapter in this nation's history."

2500|$|... "Second Sons" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes surveyed 20 {{reviews of}} the episode and judged 100% {{of them to be}} positive with an average score of 8 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, [...] " [...] 'Second Sons' shines through efficient storytelling -- and a comparatively low number of storylines to keep track of this week." [...] Writing for IGN, Matt Fowler rated the episode a 9.0/10, and wrote [...] "This week's well-crafted and wonderfully acted Game of Thrones gave us a cold wedding, a hot bath and a blood-letting." [...] He especially praised the scenes between Sansa and Tyrion and between Ser Davos and Stannis. David Sims and Todd VanDerWerff, both writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode [...] "B" [...] ratings. Sims was frustrated by the episode's meandering pace, but praised the end of the episode, with Sam killing the white walker, as [...] "the most crucial, fascinating, electric moment of the night". VanDerWerff praised the use of nudity in the episode, writing [...] "...I actually think Game Of Thrones has gotten quite a bit better at utilizing nudity and sex in the midst <b>of</b> <b>everything</b> <b>else</b> as a method of telling its story. It’s {{come a long way from}} the 'sexposition' days of season one, when it sometimes seemed like the series would toss some breasts into the background of a scene just in case we got bored of hearing somebody talk at length." ...|$|E
