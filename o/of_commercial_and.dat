5|$|The Bronze Age (3200–1200 BCE) saw {{the birth}} of Lebanon's first {{fortified}} villages, the development <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> maritime activities and {{the invention of the}} world's first alphabet in Byblos. This collection includes the Museum's masterpiece: the sarcophagus of Ahiram, which holds the oldest text written in the Phoenician alphabet.|$|E
5|$|After this junction, NY12E crosses Guffin Creek on its {{way into}} the village of Chaumont. Here, NY12E becomes Main Street again as it {{transitions}} from a rural highway back to a residential street. In the southern part of Chaumont, the route connects to CR125, at which point NY12E begins to pass by a mix <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> residential properties. It crosses over a small creek leading away from Chaumont Bay before turning slightly westward and entering the Chaumont Historic District.|$|E
5|$|At State Street, NY38 leaves US20 and NY5 {{and heads}} north through the city's north side, {{crossing}} the Owasco Outlet and serving the Auburn Correctional Facility. The route passes through several blocks <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> residential development up to Grant Street, where {{it begins to}} taper off. It ceases almost entirely near the northern city line at York Street, where the homes along the highway become more sporadic and spaced apart.|$|E

5|$|Crossing north through Amherst still, NY78 and Transit Road {{becomes a}} mix <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> residential, passing large {{sections}} of fields north of Swormville. A short distance to the north, NY78 intersects with the northern terminus of NY263 (Millersport Highway). After crossing an intersection with Tonawanda Creek Road (CR2 and CR559) that also doubled as the former intersection with NY268, NY78 and Transit Road widen to four lanes and cross over Tonawanda Creek into Niagara County.|$|E
5|$|Egbert's conquests {{brought him}} wealth {{far greater than}} his {{predecessors}} had enjoyed, and enabled him to purchase the support which secured the West Saxon throne for his descendants. The stability brought by the dynastic succession of Egbert and Æthelwulf led to an expansion <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> agrarian resources, and to an expansion of royal income. The wealth of the West Saxon kings was also increased by the agreement in 838–39 with Archbishop Ceolnoth for the previously independent West Saxon minsters to accept the king as their secular lord in return for his protection. However, there was no certainty that the hegemony of Wessex would prove more permanent than that of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by these restrictions and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E

5|$|Scream was {{credited}} with revitalizing the horror genre in the 1990s, which {{was considered to be}} almost dead following an influx of direct-to-video titles and numerous sequels to established horror franchises of the 1970s and 1980s. These sequels drew decreasing financial and critical success, as they exploited clichés upon which films in the genre had become reliant. Screams success spawned a series of sequels, though only Scream 2, released in 1997, achieved a level <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> critical success equal to the original film. In the years following the release of Scream, the film was accused of inspiring and even inducing violent crimes and murders.|$|E
5|$|The O-Bahn {{has caused}} a {{clustering}} <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> community development near the Tea Tree Plaza Interchange, as service-providing organisations and businesses have sought to exploit the area's easy accessibility to public transport and the city centre. Market imperatives have also been aided by the zoning of the land around the area as commercial rather than residential. The area around Tea Tree Plaza {{is one of five}} designated regional centres within the Adelaide metropolis.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{also home}} to a number <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> public art galleries; {{including}} the newly expanded Whitechapel Gallery. The artists Gilbert and George have long made their home and workshop in Spitalfields, and the neighbourhood around Hoxton Square has become a centre for modern British art, including the White Cube gallery, with many artists from the Young British Artists movement living and working in the area. This has made the area around Hoxton and Shoreditch fashionable, with many former residents now driven out by higher property prices, and a busy nightlife has developed, with over 80 licensed premises around Shoreditch.|$|E

5|$|The diet of the {{bramble shark}} {{includes}} smaller sharks, bony fishes, and crabs, which this slow-moving species may capture via suction. It is aplacental viviparous, with females producing litters of 15–52 pups. Harmless to humans, {{it is an}} occasional bycatch <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> recreational fishers, and {{may be used for}} fishmeal and liver oil. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks enough information to assess the conservation status of this species. However, its population has declined substantially in the northeastern Atlantic since the 18th and 19th centuries, likely because of overfishing.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cadet training {{takes place at}} the local squadron during the regular school year, with a percentage of cadets selected for summer training courses at various cadet summer training centres located across Canada. Central to the air cadet program are the gliding and flying scholarships offered to air cadets who qualify. One in five private pilots in Canada is an ex-air cadet, and 67% <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> airline pilots began as air cadets. There are 456 squadrons located across the country with an approximate enrolment of 23,000 Air Cadets.|$|E

5|$|A trade {{route is}} a {{logistical}} network {{identified as a}} series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo. The term {{can also be used to}} refer to trade over bodies of water. Allowing goods to reach distant markets, a single trade route contains long distance arteries, which may further be connected to smaller networks <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> noncommercial transportation routes. Among notable trade routes was the Amber Road, which served as a dependable network for long-distance trade. Maritime trade along the Spice Route became prominent during the Middle Ages, when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route. During the Middle Ages, organizations such as the Hanseatic League, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants, and trade became increasingly prominent.|$|E
5|$|Solaris premiered at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival {{and won the}} Grand Prix Spécial du Jury and was {{nominated}} for the Palme d'Or. In the USSR, the film premiered in the Mir film theater in Moscow on February 5, 1973. Tarkovsky did not consider the Mir cinema the best projection venue. Despite the film's narrow release in only five film theaters in the USSR, the film nevertheless sold 10.5 million tickets. Unlike the vast majority <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> ideological films in the 1970s, Solaris was screened in the USSR in limited runs for 15 years without any breaks, giving it cult status. In the Eastern Bloc and in the West, Solaris premiered later. In the United States, a version of Solaris that was truncated by 30 minutes premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on October 6, 1976.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} and cutting {{teeth of the}} silky shark make it {{potentially}} dangerous, and it has behaved aggressively towards divers. However, attacks are rare, as few humans enter its oceanic habitat. Silky sharks are valued for their fins, {{and to a lesser}} extent their meat, hide, liver oil, and jaws. Because of their abundance, they form a major component <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> artisanal shark fisheries in many countries. Furthermore, their association with tuna results in many sharks being taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries. Although slow-reproducing like most other sharks, the wide distribution and large population size of the silky shark was once thought to buffer the species against these fishing pressures. However, data now suggest that silky shark numbers are declining around the world, which prompted the IUCN to reassess its conservation status from Least Concern to Near Threatened in 2007.|$|E

5|$|The pyjama shark is {{primarily}} nocturnal, {{spending most of}} the day lying motionless and hidden in a cave or crevice or among vegetation. It often forms groups, particularly during summer. This species is an opportunistic predator that feeds {{on a wide variety of}} fishes and invertebrates; it favors cephalopods and frequents the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo reynaudi). When threatened, it curls into a circle with its tail covering its head. Reproduction is oviparous, with females laying rectangular, dark brown egg cases two at a time year-round. This small and harmless shark adapts well to captivity and is commonly displayed in public aquariums. It is often caught as a bycatch <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> recreational fisheries. Many are killed by fishers who regard them as pests. Although there are no data suggesting its numbers have declined, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pyjama shark as Near Threatened because of expanding small shark fishery activities within its limited range.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{considered}} endangered in Ohio, Indiana, and New Jersey. It {{was removed from}} the threatened list of Illinois in 1999 and of Iowa in 2003. In Pennsylvania, limited hunting and trapping are once again allowed, after having been banned from 1970 to 1999. The bobcat also suffered population decline in New Jersey {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, mainly because <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> agricultural developments causing habitat fragmentation; by 1972, the bobcat was given full legal protection, and was listed as endangered in the state in 1991. L. r. escuinipae, the subspecies found in Mexico, was for a time considered endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, but was delisted in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{appointment}} of Irving Thalberg as general manager at Universal, Stroheim's defiance <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>and</b> industrial norms was no longer tolerated. After Thalberg's prior shutdown of Foolish Wives in 1921 (which shot nonstop for eleven months), and after six weeks of filming on Merry-Go-Round, Stroheim was finally fired from the studio on October 6, 1922. This was a step unprecedented in Hollywood, heralding {{a new era in}} which the producer and the studio would hold artistic control over actors and directors. However, by this time Stroheim had received several offers of contracts with other studios, even before being fired from Universal. He had met with executives of the Goldwyn Company on September 14, 1922, less than a month before, and he formally signed with them in late November.|$|E
