5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard <b>oral</b> <b>tradition</b> than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative {{represents a}} late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the <b>oral</b> <b>tradition.</b> In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E

40|$|Descriptions {{of natural}} events, such as fireballs and {{meteorite}} impacts, are found within Indigenous Australian <b>oral</b> <b>traditions.</b> Studies of <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> {{demonstrate that they}} extend {{beyond the realm of}} myth and legend; they contain structured knowledge about the natural world (science) as well as historic accounts of natural events and geo-hazards. These traditions could lead to the discovery of meteorites and impact sites previously unknown to Western science. In addition to benefiting the scientific study of meteoritics, this study can help social scientists better understand the nature and longevity of <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> and further support the growing body of evidence that <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> contain historical accounts of natural events. In a previous study led by the author in 2009, no meteorite-related <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> were identified that led to the discovery of meteorites and/or impact craters.

5|$|A Ghost Story for Christmas is {{a strand}} of annual British short {{television}} films originally broadcast on BBC One between 1971 and 1978, and revived in 2005 on BBC Four.

5|$|As most {{explicitly}} {{noted by}} the first quatrain, the poem was originally intended to be sung. Indeed, as noted by Stephen Medcalf, Emeritus professor at Sussex University, the text itself seems to imply melody and verse.

5|$|For centuries, the Bedouin {{tracked the}} ancestry of each horse through an <b>oral</b> <b>tradition.</b> Horses of the purest blood {{were known as}} Asil and {{crossbreeding}} with non-Asil horses was forbidden. Mares were the most valued, both for riding and breeding, and pedigree families were traced through the female line. The Bedouin {{did not believe in}} gelding male horses, and considered stallions too intractable to be good war horses, thus they kept very few colts, selling most, and culling those of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Innis {{argued that}} {{a balance between the}} spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of Plato.

The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.|$|E

This research looks at how ICTs can help in documentation and publication of <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> to the masses through designing and implementation of an Izaga Electronic Database which will be tested amongst linguistic students at a Zimbabwean university and selected IsiNdebele learners from the rural areas and around Bulawayo. This research uses modernism as its theoretical framework; it looks at the change from traditional {{ways of doing things}} where <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> were passed on from one person to another through oral communication, to the 21 st century utilization of ICTs where <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> can be captured by one individual and broadcasted to masses. The research established that <b>oral</b> <b>traditions</b> can be documented and published to the masses through the usage of ICTs as an Izaga Electronic Database was implemented. The response from the evaluators was overwhelming therefore proving that the usage of ICTs can help in the documentation of <b>oral</b> <b>traditions.</b> The research therefore recommends that the government should come up with an IT policy which will promote teaching of computers in schools and subsidize prices for ICT products for school or student purchases. Local universities should also offer computational linguistics to improve in the development of ICT packages in local languages...|$|R
