500|$|... "Margaritaville" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on March 25, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone said they had long planned to do an episode about the global recession, and they argued over whether to start the season with an episode about the economy, or [...] "The Ring," [...] an episode mocking the Jonas Brothers, a boy band which had recently grown in popularity. Stone argued the season premiere should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. During an interview {{a few weeks before the}} episode aired, Stone said, [...] "That's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>big</b> things we want to get right. We'll be talking about what kind of social commentary we want to make and do it right." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Ben Moody and David Hodges and {{produced}} by Dave Fortman. The Millennium Choir performed background vocals for the song. According to Lee, the song talks about celebrities who have completely false images. It has been misinterpreted as a message against Christian faith, due to the band's denial of being a Christian band. During an interview, Lee explained: [...] "My little sister was really getting into these, I don't want to offend anyone, but like really fake, cheesy, slutty female cracker-box idols, and it really pissed me off. She started dressing like them and she was like 8 years old. So I gave her the talk and I wrote a song." [...] She later revealed that the song was written for American pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera adding, [...] "At this point, everybody knows that Britney is fake. The song is not about Britney Spears; it's {{about a lot of}} people in this industry. It's so fake, the whole Hollywood thing. 'Look at how perfect I am!' Nobody looks like that. It's all fake and it's really hurting a lot of girls' and women's self images. Where are all the normal people?". According to the sheet music published by Alfred Music Publishing at the website Musicnotes.com, [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] is written in the key of F major. It is set in a time signature of common time and performed in a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Lee's vocals in the song range from the note of A3 to the note of D5. After the third single from Fallen, [...] "My Immortal" [...] continued to grow successfully, Lee revealed that [...] "Imaginary" [...] would become the band's next and final single from the album stating, [...] "I think it's very epic. It's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>big</b> Aerosmith or Black Sabbath kind of songs. It's like an opus, with the choir and the rock and the programming. I love that song." [...] However, the release of [...] "Imaginary" [...] was scrapped and [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] was released as the fourth single from Fallen on June 4, 2004, while a maxi single was released on April 28, 2004.|$|E

When I got the prototype from Bob, I loved the long sustain. This was done by cascading the circuit into additional sections, each one clipped by twin diodes. However, when you clip, the tone can be a bit raspy. So, I spent a couple of days changing capacitors to roll off distortion in the highs, and eventually found that the best long sustaining tone that was a sweet violin like sound was done by having three capacitors {{in different parts of the}} circuit rolling off the rasp. We plunged into production and I brought the very first units up to Henry, the boss at Manny's Music Store on 48th Street, NYC.

40|$|On 19 August 1981 Evelyn Conrad and I {{had left}} Crescent Lake NWR for Lakeside, when quite some {{distance}} away we saw a large bird, with a white head and tail, flying in front of us. We temporarily lost sight of it, but I was determined to find it if possible, so I stopped my car where I thought it might have landed. I scoped all the power poles, as {{there are no other}} perches there except haystacks. In a matter of seconds I discovered a large raptor, with an all-white head, breast, and belly, with obvious black shoulder patches, perched on a power cross arm. Both of us could see the striking yellow/orange cere, with a bill shading from the same color to black. The upright posture reminded us of a species we had seen in Texas. We studied the bird through a 20 x and 30 x spotting scope under excellent viewing conditions. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> days <b>of</b> <b>big,</b> fluffy thunderheads floating over, which helped to reduce the intensity of the sun 2 ̆ 7 s rays, improving the viewing immensely. We then walked to within 10 to 20 feet of the power pole and studied the bird through our binoculars before we flushed it. The long, thin wings were falcon shaped - most like an Osprey 2 ̆ 7 s - and the tail was long and straight, resembling the shape of an accipiter. The back and wings (mantle) were a reddish-brown, indicating that it still retained some juvenal plumage, and the feet were yellow. A Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s Hawk was on the next power pole, and we flushed {{it at the same time}} so we were able to make good comparisons as far as size and shape were concerned. We both agreed that it was from 2 / 3 to 3 / 4 of the size of the Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s. As soon as we reached Lakeside a few minutes later I called the Zeillemakers at the Refuge and described to each of them what we had seen, and asked each of them to identify it. Both immediately recognized the description of a White-tailed Kite - a species they were familiar with in California. Both of us had seen this species several times in Texas...|$|R
