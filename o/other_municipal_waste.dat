40|$|This report {{continues}} {{and further}} advances the work {{conducted by the}} JRC {{in the field of}} sustainable management of food waste, which resulted in the publication of the 2015 report “Improving Sustainability and Circularity of European Food Waste Management with a Life Cycle Approach”. It focuses on the broad European waste management context and, in particular, provides insight and analysis on the sustainability of food waste prevention strategies. Among <b>other</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> streams, food waste gained prominence in the political debate in light of the recent Circular Economy (CE) package. In fact, the CE Action Plan included food waste within the so-called “priority areas”, i. e. areas that should be carefully considered to strengthen the circularity of the European economy. Against this background, this report analyses and evaluates the efficacy of some selected strategies for food waste prevention implemented at Member States’ and regional levels. A streamlined ‘stakeholder analysis’ is also developed in order to identify the most relevant stakeholders along the food supply chain and analyse their influence/relation with the mechanisms that lead to food wastage. Moreover, the report presents a novel and straightforward life cycle based methodology that helps identifying sustainable targets for food waste prevention in different contexts. The analysis of food waste prevention strategies being implemented by Member States and presented in this report seems to indicate that reducing food waste generation is a very complex to achieve in practice. The key reasons for this are the complexity of the food supply chain and the fact that a variety of integrated and well-coordinated measures that involve all stakeholders along the food supply chain need to be adopted to effectively tackle the problem. Moreover, sometimes the lack of reliable and coherent data is posing a threat to the successful identification of the most appropriate measures. It is also noted that food waste prevention measures are often set without considering how their implementation will influence the sustainability performance of food waste management. On the other hand, this report stresses that the definition of food waste prevention targets should follow the definition of the desired improvement of the overall sustainability performance. Towards this goal, the methodology presented in this report tries to identify environmentally sustainable targets for food waste prevention that allows achieving a given reduction of the environmental impacts along the food supply chain.

40|$|SANITATION, PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT The {{approach}} to sanitation {{worldwide should be}} ecologically sustainable, i. e. concerned with protection of the environment. This means that sanitation systems should neither pollute ecosystems nor deplete scarce resources. It further implies that sanitation systems should not lead to degrading water or land and should, where possible, ameliorate existing problems caused by pollution. More research and better designs are needed. Human excreta can be rendered harmless, and toilet designs that do this in harmony with agricultural and social customs hold promise for the future. Problems with conventional sanitation systems {{have been shown to}} include inadequate institutional capacity to deal with the sanitation process, a fixation with providing either a full waterborne system or a VIP toilet, the social acceptability of various systems, and the perception that dry, on-site sanitation systems are inherently inferior. The basic purpose of any sanitation system is to contain human excreta (chiefly faeces) and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, while avoiding damage to the environment. An alternative sanitation technology known as urine-diversion (UD) performs these functions with fewer operational and maintenance problems than those associated with conventional VIP toilets, (for example, it is a major and expensive operation to desludge full pits, which is not the case with UD toilets as the vaults can be quickly and easily emptied using hand tools) and also provides a free, easily accessible and valuable agricultural resource for those who wish to use it. This technology represents one aspect of an approach, or philosophy, termed “ecological sanitation” or “ecosan. ” Key features of ecosan are prevention of pollution and disease caused by human excreta, treatment of human excreta as a resource rather than as waste, and recovery and recycling of the nutrients. In nature, excreta from humans and animals play an essential role in building healthy soils and providing valuable nutrients for plants. Conventional approaches to sanitation misplace these nutrients, dispose of them and break this cycle. UD systems have been successfully implemented in many countries, including South Africa where more than 60 000 of these toilets have been built since 1997. However, despite much research having been carried out internationally and locally, various questions still remain, particularly on the health aspects of operation, maintenance, and excreta use or disposal. Not enough is known about the dehydrating processes taking place inside the faeces vault, and there is still disagreement on safe retention periods and microbiological stability of the final product. The roles of dryness, pH, temperature and time in pathogen destruction also need to be further clarified. In addition, it is critically important that toilet users are able to operate and maintain their systems easily and safely, particularly while emptying the vaults and recycling or otherwise dealing with the contents. Engineers need to understand and take all these issues into consideration before they can properly design and implement sustainable UD sanitation systems. It is therefore important to develop guidelines for sanitation practitioners that set out best practices for construction and operation of UD toilets. Construction recommendations are important because good construction facilitates easy operation, and also promotes rapid pathogen destruction. Easy operation in turn directly influences the health risks associated with removing faecal material from the vaults. Handling of faecal material is an aspect inherent in the operation of UD ecological sanitation systems, because emptying of the vault is usually done using hand tools. If the faecal material is also used for agricultural purposes then further handling must of necessity take place. As such, there is a health concern, both for the person(s) handling the material and for the wider public who may be consumers of the fertilised crops. It is therefore necessary that these health concerns be quantified, in order that proper regulation may take place. 35 t/ha), while the helminth ova content varied, both in leaves and stems, depending on the quantity of material applied. Helminth ova content was, for both crops, more prevalent in leaves, suggesting that the ova adhere preferentially to plants rather than soil. It was thus illustrated that there is a health implication involved in growing edible crops in soils amended with ecosan biosolids. Even if in this case the spinach and carrots were cooked before consumption, normal handling of the crops during harvesting and preparation could have caused infection if personal hygiene was unsatisfactory. It is therefore important that crop growers and consumers, as well as proponents of biosolids use, are aware of the storage and treatment requirements for ecosan biosolids before these are applied to soils where crops are grown. DETAILED INVESTIGATION INTO VAULT PROCESSES It is hypothesised that the most advantageous {{approach to}} pathogen destruction in a UD toilet vault is to maximise the effects of various environmental factors, e. g. high pH, high temperature, low moisture, type of bulking agent and storage time. In order to quantify these effects a field experiment was set up consisting of 12 UD toilet vaults, each with a different combination of faeces and bulking agent (soil, ash, wood shavings, NaOH or straw), ventilation (ventpipe / no ventpipe) and vault lid material (concrete, metal or perspex). Faecal material was obtained from UD toilets in the eThekwini area, as described above. Temperature probes, which were connected to a data logger, were inserted in the heaps and the logger monitored over a period of nearly 10 months. This enabled a number of graphs to be drawn illustrating the effect of the above parameters on heap temperature over the experimental period. During the coldest week in winter the mean heap temperatures averaged 16, 8 °C, while the minimum and maximum averaged 14, 8 °C and 18, 8 °C respectively. During the warmest week in summer mean heap temperatures averaged 27, 6 °C, while the minimum and maximum averaged 25, 6 °C and 29, 3 °C respectively. In addition, samples were taken at various intervals from each vault {{as well as from the}} main heap of faecal material that was left exposed to the elements. The samples were subjected to microbiological testing in order to quantify the pathogen die-off over time for each vault as well as for the main heap. In the vaults, total coliform reduced by 3 log 10 (99, 9 %) at between 130 and 250 days, faecal coliform between 100 and 250 days, and faecal streptococci from 125 days and longer. In the main heap, these times varied from 115 days for both total and faecal coliform to 140 days for faecal streptococci. Viable Ascaris ova were reduced to zero between 44 and 174 days in the vaults and by 44 days in the main heap. The conclusions drawn from the xperimentation were the following: Influence of ventpipe Ventilation of the vault by means of a ventpipe does not result in any meaningful difference in either the vault temperature or rate of pathogen die-off. Influence of vault lid material The lid material, and by inference also the material of the vault walls, has no significant effect on the temperature of the heap or the associated pathogen die-off. Type of bulking agent While the type of bulking agent used does not significantly influence the temperature of the faecal material, it does have an effect on the rate of pathogen die-off. The ordinary soil mix was seen to give the best results, and this was ascribed to the effect of competing microorganisms in the soil itself. Influence of sunshine and rain The main heap of material (faeces/soil mix) that was exposed to the elements performed among the best in terms of pathogen die-off. Apart from the influence of competing microorganisms in the soil on the pathogens as described above, this good performance was also ascribed to the effect of UV radiation and alternate wetting/drying and heating/cooling cycles, which suggests that open-air exposure is likely to provide the best treatment. Comparing the results of this research with other local and international research, it appears that there is a great deal of convergence in the results. It is concluded that vaults of UD toilets should be sized for a storage period of 12 months from last use. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSTRUCTION, OPERATION AND REGULATION OF URINE-DIVERSION TOILETS The standard of UD toilets in South Africa varies greatly. While there are many good examples of the technology, there are also many that have been ill-conceived and are badly built and poorly operated. Project implementers are responsible for the quality of sanitation schemes and should be equipped with the necessary information to oversee the process. The guidelines are aimed at providing implementers with, firstly, the necessary technical information to build good quality UD toilets and, secondly, the basic operation and maintenance tasks that should be conveyed to the toilet owners. Basic regulatory guidelines for the responsible authorities are also given. The guidelines are intended to be a stand-alone document and some repetition of information from earlier chapters is thus unavoidable. The technology of urine diversion is introduced, followed by basic design and construction guidelines, including drawings, for the superstructure and vault of a UD toilet. Both single- and double-vault toilets are discussed. A number of photographs are also provided, illustrating good and bad building practices. Further aspects discussed are requirements for urine pipes and ventilation. Operation and maintenance of UD toilets are subsequently covered. Topics discussed are dehydration, odour, fly control, cleaning of the pedestal, disposal of anal cleansing material, urine collection and disposal, clearing of blockages in urine pipes, and faeces management. The above guidelines are aimed at designers, builders and toilet users. However, organisations responsible for administering public and environmental health, such as Departments of Health, Environmental Affairs, etc, as well as the local and regional authorities that actually implement the sanitation schemes, should become actively involved in regulating the operation of UD toilets, particularly the removal and disposal of faecal material. Some regulatory guidelines are therefore also included to assist these organisations to set uniform (high) standards in their respective jurisdictions. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH RELATED TO THIS THESIS It is deemed important that the field trials conducted in the various vaults as described earlier are repeated in other climatic areas, for example a hot and dry area, as it is likely that different results regarding recommended minimum storage periods will be obtained. This should be supplemented by trials involving co-composting of the faeces mix with other organic material, in order to compare the efficacy of this method with the dehydration process. Further, vault lids made of PVC should be tested for enhancing heat gain in the vaults. Finally, long-tem measurements of heap pH should be made in order to ascertain if high pH amendments (wood ash, lime, etc) do in fact maintain their initial pH level. Additional field trials, similar to those described earlier for spinach and carrots, should be undertaken with a view to making recommendations regarding maximum application rates of faecal material. These should consist of food crops where the edible portions are either in or near to the soil, such as beetroot, onion, potatoes, tomatoes, etc. Trials involving urine should also be considered in order to determine the most advantageous application rate for the various crops. Another important topic is recommended for further research on the subject of UD toilets. At present, virtually all the UD toilets built in the country have been for communities on the lower end of the income scale and who previously had no formal sanitation facility at all or, at best, an unimproved pit toilet. Research carried out by CSIR in a number of communities has revealed people’s resistance to handling their faecal material, while in others it has not been a problem. There is often a general viewpoint in a village that “the municipality must take the faeces away. ” However, willingness has also been expressed in some villages to pay for a faeces removal service. For instance, this has borne fruit in an area of Kimberley with UD toilets where householders pay a local resident to remove the faecal material on a regular basis. This is done by means of a wheelbarrow, and the material is stockpiled at a nearby approved facility from where it is destined for co-composting with <b>other</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>waste.</b> However, this has not yet been attempted on a large scale in an area with hundreds, or even thousands, of UD toilets. While a theoretical desktop study has been carried out on the feasibility of setting up a large-scale faeces collection concern, such an enterprise does not yet exist in the country. It is suggested that one be set up utilising a horse- or donkey-drawn cart in a village, or group of villages, with sufficient UD toilets available to ensure that a viable business can be conducted. The cooperation of the particular local authority will be required. If successful faeces collection/disposal services could be established in areas with UD toilets it would greatly enhance the social acceptability, and therefore the viability, of this sanitation technology.

Although all sampling sites showed the presence of all heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Cd and Pb), the concentration of metals at sites S 1, S 3 and S 4 was higher than at site S 5. The trend followed was site S 4 (near SKIMS institute) highly polluted followed by site S 1 (near agricultural fields), site S 3 (near plantation) and lowest at site S 5 (lake centre), which {{could be attributed to}} enhanced anthropogenic activities at the sites recording the highest concentrations. Metal concentration at most of the sites followed the order as Lemna minor >sediments>water. The water quality of Anchar lake has deteriorated considerably due to illegal encroachment {{along the banks of the}} lake, dumping of the sewage and <b>other</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>wastes</b> from different parts of the Srinagar city into the lake. Direct discharge of the human wastes from the nearby settlements into the lake has further aggravated the nature and extent of the pollution. Human encroachments and siltation combined with the other anthropogenic activities reduced the open water quantity within the lake. The elevated levels of heavy metals at different locations of the lake are of utmost concern due to their environmental threats as this lake is the harbour of many water birds, fish and grasses. Therefore, a strategy to control both the point and non-point sources of pollution around the lake should be developed for better protection of the lake.|$|R

This waste from {{all kinds of}} work places is similar to household refuse. It is collected both together with, as well as separately from household refuse. Usually a difference is made between industrial, commercial and institutional (IC and I) waste, collected with household refuse, and IC and I waste, similar to household refuse, but collected separately. Until now there were only incomplete data about quantity and composition, above all because available statistics did not include all work places in a district or because waste quantities were not recorded separately from <b>other</b> <b>municipal</b> <b>wastes.</b> Aim of the nation-wide industrial, commercial and institutional waste study (Bundesweite Gewerbeabfalluntersuchung- BWGU) was to determine quantity, composition and statistical characteristics of both kinds of IC and I waste. In 15 German districts (all belonging to the 'former' Federal Republic of Germany, meaning prior to German reunification in 1989) IC and I waste was inspected or sorted and compared, according to trade sector and size (number of employees) of the work places. The study was rounded off by a thorough questionnaire of the work places analysed and by an evaluation of the 1987 national work place census. The resulting statistical characteristics describe the waste quantity, the waste composition and the densities of the waste fractions, according to trade sector clusters (formed by cluster analysis {{on the basis of a}} three-digit trade key).

The main objective of this thesis is to create a model of production of <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> with a focus on so-called commercial waste or an industrial waste, {{which is part of the}} <b>waste,</b> produced from <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> management systems. The work is based on statistical data of <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> production, statistics on the representation of small-scale industries of the Czech municipalities, and uses correlative and regressive analyses...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of my thesis is {{to map the}} legal {{regulation}} of <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> management in the Czech Republic. The reason {{for the study of}} the legal regulation is to establish whether the regulation has sufficient instruments to treat the <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> in compliance of the waste management hierarchy that is grounded in the European Union's Waste Framework Directive. The thesis also deals with the different concept of the <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> in Czech and European legislation. It mentions the differences that would be carried out to the field of <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> by the planned legislation...|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{analysis}} of hydrologic series in irrigated areas allows identifying the main waterbalance components, minimizing closingerrors and assessing {{changes in the}} hydrologic regime. The main water inputs [irrigation (I) and precipitation (P) ] and outputs [outflow (Q) and potential (ETc) crop evapotranspiration] in the 4000 -ha LaVioladairrigationdistrict (VID) (Ebro River Basin, Spain) were measured or estimated from 1995 to 2008. A first-step, simplified waterbalance assuming steady state conditions (with errorɛ = I + P − Q − ETc) showed that inputs were much lower than outputs in all years (average ɛ = − 577 mm yr− 1 or − 33 % closingerror). A second-step, improved waterbalance with the inclusion of <b>other</b> inputs (<b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> waters, canal releases and lateral surface runoff) and the estimation of crop's actual evapotranspiration (ETa) through a daily soil waterbalance reduced the average closingerror to − 13 %. Since errors were always higher during the irrigated periods, when canals are full of water, a third-step, final waterbalance considered canal seepage (CS) as an additional input. The change in water storage in the system (ΔW) was also included in this step. CS and ΔW were estimated through a monthly soil–aquifer waterbalance, showing that CS was a significant component in VID. With the inclusion of CS and ΔW in the waterbalance equation, the 1998 – 2008 annual closingerrors were within ± 10 % of total water outputs. This long-term, sequentialwaterbalance analysis in VID was an appropriate approach to accurately identify and quantify the most important waterbalance components while minimizing waterbalanceclosingerrors...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{monitoring}} and {{the analysis of the}} recent connection between the two largest district heating networks in Geneva, Switzerland. Each network has its own owner, operator and type of supply. Before the connection, one was supplied by gas boilers and the <b>other</b> by the <b>municipal</b> <b>waste</b> incineration combined heat and power (CHP) plant. The connection aims at improving heat recovery from the CHP. In this paper, the overall district heating system is analyzed by a systemic approach where both supply and demand side for thermal energy is studied, as well as its impact on the electrical energy production. Based on actual hourly data, an analysis of the resource availability, heat and power production and load profile is made. An input-output model of the system is developed in order to evaluate the heat recovery potential and elaborate scenarios regarding future district heating extensions and buildings refurbishment. Considering the present heat demand profile and waste availability, heat recovery from the waste incineration plant could increase from 142 to 233 GWhth thanks to the connection. Network extensions could increase it to near 300 GWhth even if a share of the heat demand is reduced by energy saving measures...|$|R
