500|$|Various plotlines leaked {{before the}} episode's release, {{the most notable}} being {{the death of the}} Lone Gunmen. The choice to kill off the trio was controversial; Gilligan himself later {{admitted}} that [...] "I still think we made the wrong choice on that one." [...] Spotnitz later said, [...] "I can't say I regret killing them off, as you know, no one really dies in The X-Files [...] But I do feel tonally {{it was a mistake to}} end the episode on such a somber note. I wish we'd ended it on a laugh or smile." [...] The actors who played The Lone Gunmen complimented the script. Harwood admitted that the episode would have either featured the trio's death or would have featured them [...] "walk <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunset</b> without hobo bags over our shoulders." [...] Ultimately, he concluded that [...] "I was glad we were killed off in the end". Dean Haglund said that he [...] "liked the way we were sent off", and called the ending [...] "cool".|$|E

On stage, the duo appear in clown makeup at one point and quickly go through a number of costume changes. Jackson flirts with a young woman portrayed by his real-life sister La Toya.

25|$|In {{the final}} {{hour or so}} of Full Metal Jacket, Stanley Kubrick's 1987 movie portraying the Vietnam War, Matthew Modine (Private Joker), Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother) and their platoon go into Huế, a Vietnamese city, to clear it of Viet Cong and snipers. Kubrick had the whole {{gasworks}} selectively demolished and the art department then dressed the 'set' with latticework and appropriate advertising hoardings to make it believable. At one point the soldiers enter a building to flush out a sniper. This building {{was one of several}} located between the central buildings of the old gasworks and about 200 yards from the river Thames. The final scene sees <b>the</b> soldiers marching <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> (London) <b>sunset</b> against <b>the</b> silhouettes of the burning gasworks' chimneys and buildings, singing the Mickey Mouse March from the US children's TV show. In the film a period of several days takes place in the protagonist's lives as they travel through the industrial quarters of Huế city; in reality the action took place within just one square mile. According to Kubrick collaborator Leon Vitali, who worked on Full Metal Jacket, the gasworks were built by an architectural firm that also constructed much of Huế.|$|R
5000|$|A chase ensues {{in which}} Cora, Quito, Sgt. Hook, and Fred, in the wagon, attempt to outdistance Nanchez {{and his men}} on horseback. Sgt.

Fighting for his son, Nanchez is shot and killed by Fred, who is fighting to hold on to Cora. Simultaneously, Fred is killed by an Apache arrow. Seeing Nanchez fall, the Apache warriors abandon the pursuit and depart. [...] Quito stoically accepts his father’s death, an observation that Sgt. Hook makes as a positive “Indian trait” of taking whatever happens in stride. As they drive away, Sgt. Hook suggests to Cora that his enlistment is up in 4 months’ time and that she and Quito can wait for him at the settlement next to the fort, if she will have him. Cora asks about his wife and children. Sgt. Hook admits to Cora that he made them up as a shield against wives at posts who relentlessly try to fix up bachelors. Cora exclaims that she always suspected the wife and daughters were fictitious. Quito makes a remark in Apache dialect. Sgt. Hook looks affectionately at Quito and says he now needs to learn English, as he hands a delighted Quito the reins and lets the young boy pretend to drive. Sgt. Hook slips an arm around Cora.

Donovan mortally wounds Henry in order to force Indy to risk his life in the traps to find the Grail and use its healing power to save Henry. Using the information in the diary and followed by Donovan and Elsa, Indy safely overcomes the traps and reaches the Grail's chamber, which is guarded by a knight. He has been kept alive for seven hundred years by the power of the Grail, which is hidden among dozens of false Grails; only the true Grail brings life, while a false one claims it. Elsa purposefully selects the most princely grail, a golden chalice studded with emeralds, for Donovan, who ages into dust after drinking from it, because the one Elsa chose was a false one. Indy selects the true Grail, a simple wooden cup, which the knight warns cannot be taken beyond the temple's entrance. Indy fills the Grail with holy water and takes it to Henry, which heals him instantly. [...] Elsa, disregarding the knight's warning, then takes the Grail and attempts to leave with it. [...] The temple begins to collapse and Elsa falls to her death trying to recover the Grail. Indy nearly suffers the same fate but Henry persuades him to let it go. The Joneses, Marcus, and Sallah escape the temple and ride <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunset.</b>|$|E
500|$|Screen Rant's Kevin Yeoman, gave much praise in the episode. Like Paste {{magazine}} {{and other critics}} reviews, Yeoman claimed that [...] "there was certainly disappointment in finding out that Awake wouldn't see a second season, and would instead be looked at as a 13-episode miniseries". He claimed that the episode has the puzzling and high points {{that are similar to}} [...] "That's Not My Penguin" [...] and [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend". Again, Screen Crush's Kevin Fitzpatrick was also disappointed that there would not be a second season. Verne Gay of Newsday gave the episode a complimenting review. He called it [...] "promising". He noted that he could see [...] "why Awake was canceled". He blessed [...] "the show for at least trying". He called it [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "original". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode [...] "fascinating", [...] "puzzling" [...] and [...] "moving". Carl Cortez of Assignment X, again, enjoyed the episode. In his [...] "B+" [...] grade review, he noted that [...] "you can view it as another missed opportunity". He claimed that parts of the episode were [...] "confusing". He stated that he would [...] "prefer to have more questions than answers". He argued that the episode felt more like a [...] "Series Finale, than Season Finale", which he called [...] "a good thing", [...] "Too many good shows go <b>off</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunset</b> without a single resolution and this one at least strives for something more". He also argued that NBC should have [...] "put a little more promotional push". He called it [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "interesting".|$|E
500|$|Kidnapped {{and thrown}} on a plane, they {{land on a}} remote island. They are led by the men in suits through a jungle {{wilderness}} to a large stone temple. The Dean of the Secret Order of Dirty Joke Writers appears from the shadows and leads the group into a large library, where the world's greatest geniuses study. The Dean explains {{that many of the}} world's greatest geniuses have come together to create dirty jokes and tailor jokes to where the need is greatest. The Dean takes them into a dark room. He reveals {{that they will not be}} permitted to leave the island now that they know about the network of joke distribution agents, like the bellhop. They are locked in a jail cell. As a diversion, Peter stabs Cleveland with a pencil. When the guard opens the door to investigate, the prisoners escape. They are recaptured by the Dean and his armed guards immediately. As they are about to be shot by the guards, an old man claims he has just written the world's greatest dirty joke and then suddenly dies. Peter snatches a small piece of paper that the man dropped as he died, containing the joke. The prisoners escape with the joke on a small plane.

5000|$|The TV episodes and the 1994 movie, {{like the}} radio series, ended {{with one or}} the other of them making a corny joke about the {{adventure}} they had just completed. They would laugh, saying, [...] "'O, Pancho!" [...] "'O, Cisco!", before galloping <b>off,</b> while laughing, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>sunset</b> and Spanish-styled Western theme music was heard as the credits rolled. That [...] "Pancho" [...] and [...] "Cisco" [...] are Spanish nicknames for [...] "Francisco" [...] makes the sign-off with laughter an inside joke for Spanish speakers. Throughout the TV series, Pancho addressed Renaldo as [...] "Cisco" [...] - although that is the name of a town near Abilene, Texas, and the character's real name is never mentioned - and others (mostly Anglo characters) refer to him as [...] "the Kid" [...] (Renaldo was 46 years old when the TV series began). Although both Pancho and Cisco are clearly identifiable as Mexicans, throughout the entire series they spoke to each other in English, with Pancho speaking a thickly accented and very tortured English, as if the two of them were not both fluent and comfortable in Spanish. Of course, the series was intended for initial release in the United States and for a primarily English-speaking audience so, as is still the practice today in such cases, the dialog was written and delivered in English and the audience filled in the rest.|$|R

500|$|With {{their new}} allies, Ironheade manages {{to push the}} Drowning Doom back towards the Sea of Black Tears; defeated, Ophelia denies Eddie's belief that she is Doviculus' spy, again {{claiming}} that Eddie's the traitor. As they argue, Doviculus arrives and confirms that Succoria is not Ophelia, but Eddie's mother. In the past, Succoria, an even more vicious demon empress, also sought the Titans' secrets in the future. However, after discovering that humans eventually become the dominant species, Succoria {{fell into a deep}} despair. Riggnarok, who had followed Succoria through time to assassinate her, took pity on her in her misery, and the two fell in love and bore Eddie. Now in the past, Eddie's demon nature has borne out, and has also inadvertently revealed the Titans' secrets to Doviculus as well. Having no more use for Ophelia, Doviculus rips out her heart, taking her powers alongside his own and causing Ophelia to dissipate. While Ironheade battles Doviculus' forces, Eddie engages Doviculus in a one-on-one confrontation, which ends with the demon emperor's decapitation. As Eddie escapes the Sea, he recovers Ophelia's heart from Doviculus, containing his mother's necklace he gave her when they first met, and then proceeds to rescue the real Ophelia from the ocean floor. Ashore, they rekindle their love as Ironheade celebrates their victory over Doviculus and the Tainted Coil.
