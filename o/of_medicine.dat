40|$|Background : This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of price regulation at the first level of anatomicherapeutic-chemical (ATC) classification <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> in order to present their developments by medicines structure. Methods : The analysis included 760 regulated wholesale prices <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> prescribed on outpatient prescription, which are partly or completely financed by public expenditures in the period 2003 – 2010. They are classified at the first level, i. e., anatomic main groups by ATC classification. The impact of price regulation on the patterns in wholesale price developments <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> is estimated by the Lasyperes index and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results : The Laspeyres index confirmed the reduction in regulated wholesale prices <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> {{for the majority of}} anatomical main groups <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> by ATC classification in the years 2003 – 2010. With some exceptions, this finding was also confirmed by statistically significant differences in the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Conclusions : Differences in the movement of wholesale prices of anatomic main groups <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> by ATC classification are associated with the measures of price regulation for medicines and over time. The greatest reductions in prices <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> are found for the anatomic main groups with a greater number <b>of</b> generic <b>medicines</b> and interchangeable medicines and vice versa, the least reductions or even increases are found for medicines with fewer generic medicines and limited or even nonexistent interchangeability. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} knowledge <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> {{and sources}} <b>of</b> information about <b>medicines</b> among adolescents in Malta. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire {{was used to}} survey knowledge <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> and information sources among adolescents attending secondary schools in Malta. A random stratified sample design generated a sample size of 514 students. Knowledge <b>of</b> <b>medicines</b> was investigated by questions that included topics about the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>medicines,</b> proper communication during a medical consultation, the safety <b>of</b> <b>medicines,</b> antibiotic use and pictograms. Results: The analytical sample, of which 53. 8 % were girls, {{was made up of}} 474 students, aged 14 - 16 years.

Conclusion: Although the level <b>of</b> knowledge about <b>medicines</b> among this study sample of Maltese students was good, there appeared to be particular misconceptions with regard to important aspects associated with the proper use <b>of</b> <b>medicines.</b> These findings highlight the need to educate adolescents about the proper use <b>of</b> <b>medicines.</b> The most important information providers about medicines appeared to be the physician, pharmacist and parents.
