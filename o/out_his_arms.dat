5|$|D'Amory was supplanted in the king's favour by Hugh Despenser the Younger, and d'Amory {{fought against}} the king in the Despenser War of 1321-22. After the war, Edward placed the Marches {{under the control of}} the Despensers, with Hugh Despenser the Elder taking {{particular}} responsibility for St Briavels. The Despensers appointed Robert Sapy as the keeper of St Briavels and the other confiscated castles across the Marches. Violence began to break out across the region in response to the Despenser's harsh rule, and Sapy's deputy was attacked in July 1325 on his way back from St Briavels Castle to London; his eyes were torn <b>out,</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and legs broken and all his records and money stolen. Edward and the Despensers were deposed shortly afterwards by Edward's wife, Isabella of France. Isabella set about expanding her own lands after her victory, and took St Briavels Castle and various other royal castles into her own possession. When Isabella herself was overthrown by her son, Edward III, in 1330 the castle then reverted to the crown.|$|E

Jackson forgave her parents for her stifled upbringing reasoning, [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} as we get older, we grow and learn a lot more. And I think that my father and my mother, they raised children the best way they know how." [...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, he held <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> and just hugged me. I was crying saying: 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.' He just held me tight and said: 'I am your brother, I always knew it wasn't you saying those words." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of June 23, 1855, after {{the rest of his}} family had gone to bed, Robert Newsom came to Celia’s cabin, as he had told her he would. Celia made an attempt to reject his sexual advances, and when he refused to back down, she clubbed him over the head with the stick that she had brought into her cabin earlier that day. After she hit him the first time, he reached <b>out</b> <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> as if he was trying to grab her and she clubbed him a second time, killing him. She then moved his body into her {{fireplace}} and {{spent the rest of the}} night burning his remains. She crushed some of Newsom’s smaller bones with a rock, and hid the bones that were too big to crush “under the hearth, and under the floor between a sleeper and the fire-place.” The next morning, Celia enlisted the help of Newsom’s grandson, twelve-year-old Coffee Wainscott, in scattering the ashes of Robert Newsom. According to Coffee’s testimony, Celia told him “she would give [...] two dozen walnuts if [...] would carry the ashes out.” ...|$|E
