50|$|A {{method by}} which a large <b>one-way</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is {{inserted}} {{just prior to the}} throttle body, enabling air to bypass the turbo, intercooler, and piping during periods where there is negative air pressure at the throttle body inlet. This results in more air combusting, which means more air driving the turbine side of the turbo. As soon as positive pressure is reached in the intercooler hosing, the valve closes.|$|E
50|$|There {{is usually}} a {{transition}} point to move the milk from the pipeline under vacuum to the bulk tank, which is at normal atmospheric pressure. This is done by having the milk flow into a receiver bowl or globe, which is a large hollow glass container with electronic liquid-detecting probes in the center. As the milk rises to a certain height in the bowl, a transfer pump is used to push it through a <b>one-way</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and into a pipe that transfers it to the bulk tank. When the level has dropped far enough in the bowl, the transfer pump turns off. Without the check valve, the milk in the bulk tank could be sucked back into the receiver bowl when the pump is not running.|$|E
40|$|This new utility patent is {{an active}} design that relies on the lung's role as an organic heat {{exchanger}} for providing deep body core heating of air. It {{is based on the}} fact that the greatest heat loss mechanism for an insulated human body immersed in a cold water environment is due to heat loss through respiration. This innovation successfully merges two existing technologies (cold immersion suit and existing valve technologies) to produce a new product that helps prevent against the onset of hypothermia at sea. During normal operations, a human maintains an approximate body temperature of [98. 6 F (37 C) ]. A mechanism was developed to recover the warm temperature from the body and reticulate it in a survival suit. The primary intention is to develop an encompassing systems design that can both easily and cost effectively be integrated in all existing currently manufactured cold water survival suits, and as such, it should be noted that the cold water immersion suit is only used as a framework or tool for laying out the required design elements. At the heart of the suit is the Warm Air Recovery (WAR) system, which relies on a single, large Main Purge Valve (MPV) and secondary Purge Valves (PV) to operate. The main purge valve has a thin membrane, which is normally closed, and acts as a <b>one-way</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> When warm air is expelled from the lungs, it causes the main purge valve to open. Air forced from the MPV is dumped directly into the suit, thereby providing warmth to the torso, legs, and arms. A slight positive over-pressure in the suit causes warm waste air (or water if the suit is punctured) to be safely vented into the sea through large PVs located at the bottom of each arm and leg. The secondary purge valves act to prevent the buildup of large concentrations of CO 2 gas and help guard against asphyxia. It is noted that the MPV causes the inhalation and exhalation cycles to be completely isolated from one another in the current suit design...|$|E

40|$|A vacuum {{compressor}} {{has been}} designed to compress CO 2 from approximately equal to 1 psia (approximately equal to 6. 9 kPa absolute pressure) to approximately equal to 75 psia (approximately equal to 0. 52 MPa), to be insensitive to moisture, to have a long operational life, and to be lightweight, compact, and efficient. The compressor consists mainly of (1) a compression head that includes hydraulic diaphragms, a gas-compression diaphragm, and check valves; and (2) oscillating linear drive that includes a linear motor and a drive spring, through which compression force is applied to the hydraulic diaphragms. The motor is driven at the resonance vibrational frequency of the motor/spring/compression-head system, the compression head acting as a damper that takes energy out of the oscillation. The net effect of the oscillation is to cause cyclic expansion and contraction of the gas-compression diaphragm, and, hence, of the volume bounded by this diaphragm. <b>One-way</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> admit gas into this volume from the low-pressure side during expansion and allow the gas to flow out to the high-pressure side during contraction. Fatigue data and the results of diaphragm stress calculations have been interpreted as signifying that the compressor can be expected to have an operational life of greater than 30 years with a confidence level of 99. 9 percent...|$|R

50|$|These {{tools are}} {{primarily}} used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) {{located in the}} tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a downhole tool attached to the wireline toolstring {{that is used to}} 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection {{to the top of a}} variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), <b>one-way</b> <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop downhole tool which is pinned in place.|$|R

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{stability}} and reliability of the piezoelectric micro-pump, the cause of air block phenomenon is analyzed {{on the structure of}} wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> During the movement of the bubble in the micro-channel, pressure drop occurs, the main factor which influences the bubble going through is opening height of the wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> Five groups of wheel <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> with different structures are used to test the wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> opening height and air block probability. The experiment results show that reducing the wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> thickness or diameter ratio can both increase the wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> opening height, and decrease the air block probability. Through experiment, the optimum combination of the wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> structure is obtained within the samples: as the thickness is 0. 02 mm, the diameter ratio is 1. 2, the wheel <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> opening height gets 252 µm, and within the given bubble volume, the air block probability is less than 2 %...|$|R
40|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valve</b> in a {{pipeline}} {{is supposed to}} prevent the reverse flow and to allow the flow in the positive direction. The construction of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> follows these requirements, but the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> must not cause pressure pulsations in transients. It means when the fluid is accelerating or decelerating. The article describes an experimental investigation of a swing <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> when the flow is changing its direction. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> was placed in an experimental circuit, where {{the pressure on the}} upstream and downstream side of the valve was measured and the current value of flow rate was determined.

50|$|Other {{causes of}} water hammer are pump failure and <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam (due to sudden deceleration, a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> may slam shut rapidly, {{depending}} on the dynamic characteristic of the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and {{the mass of the}} water between a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and tank). To alleviate this situation, it is recommended to install non-slam <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> as they do not rely on gravity or fluid flow for their closure. For vertical pipes, other suggestions include installing new piping that can be designed to include air chambers to alleviate the possible shockwave of water due to excess water flow.|$|R

The experimen-tal results show that the <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> with low inertia, assisted by springs or small travelling distance/angle, gave better performance under pressure transient conditions as compared to <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> without these features. Although different amounts of air entrainment were found to affect the experimental readings, the general characteristics of each <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> remain the same when compared between valves.

40|$|<b>Check</b> <b>valves</b> for <b>checking</b> reverse {{water flows}} in {{drainage}} systems sometimes make large impacts through their sudden closure caused by accidental cutoff of drain pumps. In order to characterize such phenomena {{and to find}} design criteria for impactless <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> we observed the motion of a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and measured its impact acceleration and pressures in the drainage pipe, using a subscale drainage system. Two peaks of impact acceleration were observed; The first one seemed due to collision of the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and the valve seat, whereas the second one did due to water column separation and recombination caused by the low pressure during the closure state of the valve. The former can be reduced by adding mass to the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and by setting an appropriate valve-seat angle. The latter possibly can be reduced by relaxing the low pressure during the closure.

40|$|The use of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in {{the nuclear}} {{industry}} is of great importance from a safety precaution point ofview (McElhaney, 1995). Choosing <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> for these high-pressurized systems comes with agreat challenge. The valves causes what is called <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slams when closing, leading to a hugepressure wave traveling through the system. To prevent this from happening calculations have to bedone {{to see what kind}} of forces are generated during a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam. When the forces are known itis easier designing systems that will endure these slams. A commonly used software {{in the nuclear}}industry is RELAP 5 (Reactor Excursion and Leak Analysis Program), its main purpose is to calculatetransients in piping systems. This program can also be used when calculating a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam. Buthow precise is the code compared to the real event? By doing an experiment measuring pressures created by swing <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> during slams, the codewas compared to real data and analyzed to decide what was of importance when modeling for thesetypes of simulations. The RELAP 5 code was not initially designed to calculate transients during a <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> slam. This isclearly shown when the code overestimates the pressure waves in the system when using themanufacturer data for the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> model. Matching the data from the simulations in RELAP 5 withthe data recorded from the experiment is not easy. The parameters used for this have no connection tothe specifications for the <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> which means that transients are hard to estimate withoutexperimental data...|$|R

40|$|A semi-empirical {{method is}} {{developed}} {{to describe the}} dynamic behaviour of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in pipeline systems. The method is based on parameterized valve models and dimensionless valve characteristics, which may be obtained from experiments. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is considered as a black box with certain input and output characteristics. The <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closure and associated pressure surges are the dominant phenomena. Undamped <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> may {{be considered as a}} special case of damped <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> Much attention is paid to the description of the hydrodynamic (fluid) forces on the internal, moving valve elements. These elements may be considered as translating or rotating bodies with (at least) one plane of symmetry. The equations of motion for the constrained, unsteady motion of such a body in an unconfined, unsteady fluid flow are based on the dynamical theory of Kirchhoff, extended to an unsteady fluid flow. The equivalent equations for a body in a confined fluid are based on Lagrange's method of generalized coordinates. A general (dimensionless) valve equation of motion is developed, which is valid for most of the existing <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> types. Basic differential equations are derived for the transient flow in a pipe with constant initial flow deceleration. The equations are applied to describe the <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> closure under reflection free and reflecting boundary conditions in the form of dimensionless, analytical equations. The theory is based on conventional waterhammer theory. The pipe and valve equations are coupled via the integral form of the momentum equation. The uncoupled and coupled, (dimensionless) pipe and valve equations show formally which (dimensionless) variables and valve, system and fluid parameters are relevant to the dynamic behaviour of <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> in pipeline systems. In that sense they are used in a dimensional analysis to develop (dimensionless) valve characteristics and dynamic scale laws. Based on the dimensionless valve characteristics, models for undamped and damped <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> are developed and implemented in the waterhammer computer code CVWP (<b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Waterhammer Program). Experiments are performed in the test facility at Delft Hydraulics to measure several valve characteristics of weakly and strongly damped <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b> The dynamic scale laws are validated by means of numerical simulations. The valve models are validated against experimental data. The study has been performed within the <b>Check</b> <b>Valve</b> Research Project (CVRP) ...|$|R
