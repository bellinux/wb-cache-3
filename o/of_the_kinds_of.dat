5|$|The bulk of {{information}} about Lōʻihi comes from dives made {{in response to the}} 1996 eruption. In a dive conducted almost immediately after seismic activity was reported, visibility was greatly reduced by high concentrations of displaced minerals and large floating mats of bacteria in the water. The bacteria that feed on the dissolved nutrients had already begun colonizing the new hydrothermal vents at Pele's Pit (formed from the collapse of the old ones), and may be indicators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> material ejected from the newly formed vents. They were carefully sampled for further analysis in a laboratory. An OBO briefly sat on the summit before a more permanent probe could be installed.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, a {{conditional}} correspondence exists. There {{are three}} relevant kinds of wall here: purely diathermal, adiabatic, and permeable to matter. If {{two of those}} kinds of wall are sealed off, leaving only one that permits transfers of energy, as work, as heat, or with matter, then the remaining permitted terms correspond precisely. If two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> wall are left unsealed, then energy transfer can be shared between them, so that the two remaining permitted terms do not correspond precisely.|$|E

Experiments of the nuclear Overhauser variety may be employed to establish distances between atoms, as for example by 2D-FTNMR of molecules in solution.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the fossils}} are oval in outline. [...] Elongated {{specimens}} illustrate that the organism {{was capable of}} stretching in an anterior-posterior direction, perhaps {{by as much as}} a factor of two. The only type of symmetry visible in the White Sea specimens is bilateral; {{there is no sign of}} any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> radial symmetry that are normal in the Cnidaria, the group that includes jellyfish, sea anemones and hydras. The Australian fossils were originally described as a type of jellyfish, but this is inconsistent with the bilateral symmetry in the fossils. The White Sea fossils and the surrounding sediments also show that Kimberella lived on the surface of the sea-floor.|$|E

When he was sent galley proofs of a new edition, Tolkien {{was surprised to find}} the sample text had been incorporated. In The Lord of the Rings, the original version of the riddle game is explained as a [...] "lie" [...] made up by Bilbo under the harmful influence of the Ring, whereas the revised version contains the [...] "true" [...] account. The revised text became the second edition, published in 1951 in both the UK and the US.|$|E

500|$|Another {{influence}} from Old English sources is {{the appearance of}} named blades of renown, adorned in runes. In using his elf-blade Bilbo finally takes his first independent heroic action. By his naming the blade [...] "Sting" [...] we see Bilbo's acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> cultural and linguistic practices found in Beowulf, signifying his entrance into the ancient world in which he found himself. This progression culminates in Bilbo stealing a cup from the dragon's hoard, rousing him to wrath—an incident directly mirroring Beowulf and an action entirely determined by traditional narrative patterns. As Tolkien wrote, [...] "The episode of the theft arose naturally (and almost inevitably) from the circumstances. It is difficult to think of any other way of conducting the story at this point. I fancy the author of Beowulf would say much the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Music {{journalist}} Paul Lester locates [...] "the {{golden age}} of adroit, intelligent art-pop" [...] to when the bands 10cc, Roxy Music and Sparks [...] "were mixing and matching from different genres and eras, well before the term 'postmodern' existed in the pop realm." [...] The effect of the Velvet Underground gave rock musicians like Iggy Pop of the Stooges a self-consciousness about their work. Iggy was inspired to transform his personality into an art object, which would in turn influence singer David Bowie, {{and led to the}} Stooges' role as the group linking 1960s hard rock to 1970s punk. In the 1970s, a similarly self-conscious art/pop community (which Frith calls [...] "the most significant" [...] of the period) began to coalesce in the Mercer Arts Center in New York. The school encouraged the continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> collaboration between high and low art once exemplified by the Factory, as drummer Jerry Harrison (later of Talking Heads) explained: [...] "it started with the Velvet Underground and {{all of the things that}} were identified with Andy Warhol." ...|$|E

2500|$|Besides the numismatic exhibition, the Museum {{collection}} {{includes many}} other ancient Ukrainian historical artifacts: antique ceramics and items of ancient Russian fine art. Medieval small art plastics of Kievan Rus' form the separate Museum's collection reflecting the diversity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> ancient Ukrainian {{arts and crafts}} in their historical development: from pieces of ornamental and decoration dating from the Pre-Christian period of Kievan Rus (pendants, brooches [...] "lunnitsa", amulets, signet rings) to the antiquities of the Christian Epoch (icons, crosses, cross - amulets [...] "enkolpyons"). Metal breast plates with the Princely heraldry of Rurik dynasty (two-prong and trident) are very rare and have a special interest for Ukrainian historians.|$|E
2500|$|Ozu {{was widely}} noted for a style {{characterized}} by a frequent avoidance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> camera movements—such as panning shots, tracking shots or crane shots—employed by most film directors. (As he himself would sometimes remark, [...] "I'm not a dynamic director like Akira Kurosawa.") Bordwell notes that, of all the common technical practices that Ozu refused to emulate, he was [...] "most absolute" [...] in refusing to reframe (for example, by panning slightly) the moving human figure {{in order to keep}} it in view; this critic claims {{that there is not a}} single reframing in all of Ozu's films from 1930 on. In the late films (that is, those from Late Spring on), the director [...] "will use walls, screens, or doors to block off the sides of the frame so that people walk into a central depth," [...] thus maintaining focus on the human figure without any motion of the camera.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} Atlas Shrugged {{dramatically}} expresses Rand's ethical egoism, her advocacy of [...] "rational selfishness", whereby {{all of the}} principal virtues and vices are applications {{of the role of}} reason as man's basic tool of survival (or a failure to apply it): rationality, honesty, justice, independence, integrity, productiveness, and pride. Rand's characters often personify her view of the archetypes of various schools of philosophy for living and working in the world. Robert James Bidinotto wrote, [...] "Rand rejected the literary convention that depth and plausibility demand characters who are naturalistic replicas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> people we meet in everyday life, uttering everyday dialogue and pursuing everyday values. But she also rejected the notion that characters should be symbolic rather than realistic." [...] and Rand herself stated, [...] "My characters are never symbols, they are merely men in sharper focus than the audience can see with unaided sight. ...My characters are persons in whom certain human attributes are focused more sharply and consistently than in average human beings".|$|E
2500|$|Kennedy's {{successor}} Lyndon B. Johnson {{was able}} to persuade the largely conservative Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and, with a more progressive Congress in 1965, passed much of the Great Society, which consisted of an array of social programs designed to help the poor. Kennedy and Johnson's advocacy of civil rights further solidified black support for the Democrats, but {{had the effect of}} alienating southern whites, who would eventually gravitate towards the Republican party, particularly after the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency in 1980. The United States' involvement in the Vietnam War in the 1960s was another divisive issue that further fractured the fault lines of the Democrats' coalition. [...] After the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, President Johnson committed a large contingency of combat troops to Vietnam, but the escalation failed to drive the Viet Cong from South Vietnam, resulting in an increasing quagmire, which by 1968 had become the subject of widespread anti-war protests in the United States and elsewhere. [...] With increasing casualties and nightly news reports bringing home troubling images from Vietnam, the costly military engagement became increasingly unpopular, alienating many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> young voters that the Democrats had attracted the early 1960s. The protests that year along with assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (younger brother of John F. Kennedy) climaxed in turbulence at the hotly contested Democratic National Convention that summer in Chicago (which, amongst the ensuing turmoil inside and outside of the convention hall, nominated Vice President Hubert Humphrey), in a series of events that proved to mark a significant turning point in the decline of the Democratic party's broad coalition.|$|E
