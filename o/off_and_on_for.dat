40|$|Abstract Background Perforation of gut by sharp {{metallic}} objects is {{rare and}} rarer still is their migration to sites like liver. The symptoms may be non-specific {{and the discovery}} of foreign body {{may come as a}} radiological surprise to the unsuspecting clinician since the history of ingestion is difficult to obtain. Case report A unique case of a broken sewing needle in the liver causing a hepatic abscess and detected as a radiological surprise is presented. The patient had received <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> treatment <b>for</b> pyrexia for the past one year at a remote primary health center. Exploratory laparotomy along with drainage of abscess and retrieval of foreign body relieved the patient of his symptoms and nearly one-year follow up reveals a satisfactory recovery. Conclusion It is very rare for an ingested foreign body to lodge in the liver and present as a liver abscess. An ultrasound and a high clinical suspicion index {{is the only way to}} diagnose these unusual presentations of migrating foreign bodies. The management is retrieval of the foreign body either by open surgery or by percutaneous transhepatic approach but since adequate drainage of the abscess and ruling out of a fistulous communication between the gut and the liver is mandatory, open surgery is preferred. </p...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. In treatment of tumor by hyperthermia, the temperature profile around the heat source is the major factor influencing the effect of hyperthermia. In this study, a mathematical model of the transient temperature profiles around a cylindrical heat source inside an in vitro tissue has been developed. Experiments with an in vitro pork liver have been conducted to study the change of liver temperature around a nickel­-chromium alloy wire heated by direct current at fixed power. Computer simulation of the mathematical model {{can be used to}} help doctors to predict the change of temperature profiles in the tissue during thermal therapy The results show that liver temperature near the heating source can be controlled in a desired range for hyperthermia, say, 45 - 70 "C, by a simple on-off control of the power of heat source. For example, heating power is switched <b>on</b> <b>for</b> 300 seconds firstly, then <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> each <b>for</b> 50 seconds repeatedly. The results also show that as the distance from the heat source increases, the tissue temperature decreases, and the magnitude of temperature oscillation due to power <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> decreases too. There are two parameters, thermal conductivity (k) and heat transfer coefficient (h), in the mathematical model. It has been found that there exists a zone, in the range of 0. 66 ≤k≤ 0. 74 W/m-K and 130 ≤h≤ 155 W/m 2 -K, where the average error between mathematical model and experimental model is less than 2. 40 "C. When temperature dependency of thermal conductivity, k= 0. 4981 + 0. 0008 T, is considered, there exists a minimum of average error of 2. 59 "C at h 210 W/m 2 -K.

40|$|A {{memory device}} using an organic field effect {{transistor}} (OFET) with copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) as active material was fabricated and studied. For this purpose, SiO 2 dielectric surface was modified with a disordered self assembled monolayer (SAM) of octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) molecule which was found to induce large disorder in CuPc film thereby generating more traps for charge carriers. Drain current-drain voltage characteristics at zero gate voltage exhibited large hysteresis which was not observed in OFET devices with ordered OTS monolayer modified and unmodified SiO 2 dielectrics. The extent of hysteresis and drain current on/off ratio, reading voltage etc. {{were found to be}} dependent on the sweep rate/step voltage employed during scanning. Highest hysteresis with on/off ratio of about 240 was obtained for an optimum step voltage of 2 V while it decreased with further reduction in the same. This was attributed to the longer scanning time leading to release of trapped carriers during forward scan itself.

Calcium malabsorption has been considered as an important contributing factor. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the treatment of choice in PBC, improving survival, but its effect on calcium absorption is unknown. In this study, we have measured fractional calcium absorption, using a single isotope method, {{in a group of}} female PBC patients (median age: 60 years, range: 46 - 78 years) and age-matched female controls (median age: 58 years, range: 36 - 74). Bone mineral density (BMD) in PBC patients was significantly lower than age-matched controls (g/cm(2) +/- SEM; lumbar spine: controls 1. 139 +/- 0. 028, PBC patients 1. 004 +/- 0. 026, p = 0. 0028; femoral neck: controls 0. 944 +/- 0. 034, PBC patients 0. 819 +/- 0. 023, p = 0. 0032). Twenty two PBC patients, who were not vitamin D-deficient, were <b>off</b> <b>and</b> <b>on</b> UDCA <b>for</b> approximately 1 month and approximately 8 weeks, respectively. Fractional calcium absorption in PBC patients prior to UDCA treatment (mean +/- SEM, 33. 8 +/- 2. 6 %) was significantly lower than controls (52. 0 +/- 2. 4 %, p< 0. 001). Following UDCA therapy, fractional calcium absorption increased significantly (Off UDCA: 33. 1 +/- 2. 6 %, On UDCA: 36. 6 +/- 2. 5 %, p< 0. 0058). Osteocalcin levels were significantly raised in the PBC group (mean +/- SEM, ng/ml, 41. 4 +/- 2. 02) compared to controls (31. 1 +/- 2. 64, p = 0. 002). There were no differences in parathyroid hormone (PTH) or 25 -hydroxyvitamin D levels between these two groups or following UDCA therapy. In conclusion, we found that PBC patients display low spinal and femoral neck BMD, reduced fractional calcium absorption, and elevated plasma osteocalcin.
