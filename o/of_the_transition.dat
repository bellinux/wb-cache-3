5|$|Still other chemists further {{exclude the}} group 3 {{elements}} from {{the definition of}} a transition metal. They do so on the basis that the group 3 elements do not form any ions having a partially occupied d shell and do not therefore exhibit any properties characteristic of transition metal chemistry. In this case, only groups 4–11 are regarded as transition metals. However, though the group 3 elements show few of the characteristic chemical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> metals, they do show some of their characteristic physical properties (on account of the presence in each atom of a single d electron).|$|E

5|$|The rate of a {{reaction}} {{is dependent on}} the activation energy needed to form the transition state which then decays into products. Enzymes increase reaction rates by lowering the energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> state. First, binding forms a low energy enzyme-substrate complex (ES). Secondly the enzyme stabilises the transition state such that it requires less energy to achieve compared to the uncatalyzed reaction (ES‡). Finally the enzyme-product complex (EP) dissociates to release the products.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{circumstances}} {{where this is}} not the case, and it is desirable to make the width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> line larger than the Doppler profile. For instance, when tracking a quickly accelerating object, the band-pass of the ALF must include within it the maximum and minimum values for the reflected light. The accepted method for increasing the band-pass involves placing an inert gas in the vapor cell. This gas both widens the spectral line and increases the transmission rate of the filter.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{exceptions}} to this general rule. Gallium and germanium have higher electronegativities than aluminium and silicon respectively because of the d-block contraction. Elements of the fourth period immediately after the first row <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition</b> metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity. The anomalously high electronegativity of lead, particularly when compared to thallium and bismuth, {{appears to be an}} artifact of data selection (and data availability)—methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.|$|E

5|$|As Rafael moved northward, it {{continued}} to intensify rapidly in spite of moderate wind shear. An eye became visible on microwave imagery during the morning hours of October16, during which time the cyclone attained its peak intensity as a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 90mph (150km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 969mb (hPa; 28.61inHg). By the afternoon hours of that same day, data from an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft indicated that Rafael {{was on the verge}} of a weakening trend, attributed to decreasing sea surface temperatures and higher wind shear. Though the system retained hurricane-force winds, it began to transition into an extratropical cyclone on October17, a process it completed by 1800UTC that same day after interacting with a cold front; at the time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>transition,</b> Rafael was positioned well southwest of Nova Scotia. The remnants of the cyclone looped around a larger extratropical low, over the north-central Atlantic Ocean for several days, before resuming its eastward motion. The extratropical remnant of Rafael later made landfall on Portugal and dissipated by 1800UTC on October26.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the above}} formulations, most silver {{compounds}} have significant covalent character {{due to the}} small size and high first ionization energy (730.8kJ/mol) of silver.
