25|$|In 2000, the Government in {{the form}} of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (OPDM) set up a review of the fire safety {{legislation}} led by the Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott MP and found that there were some 80 Acts of Parliament or parts of Acts which specified fire safety legislation.

25|$|In 1977, {{recombinant}} DNA technology enabled biologists {{to start}} to explore the genetic control of development. The growth of evolutionary developmental biology from 1978, when Edward B. Lewis discovered homeotic genes, showed that many so-called toolkit genes act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. It also revealed that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> genes are extremely ancient, so that animals as different as insects and mammals share control mechanisms; for example, the Pax6 gene is involved in forming the eyes of mice and of fruit flies. Such deep homology provided strong evidence for evolution and indicated the paths that evolution had taken.|$|E

25|$|Although {{most of the}} {{glucokinase}} in {{the body}} is in the liver, smaller amounts in the beta and alpha cells of the pancreas, certain hypothalamic neurons, and specific cells (enterocytes) of the gut play an increasingly appreciated role in regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. In the context of glucokinase function, these cell types are collectively referred to as neuroendocrine tissues, and they share some aspects of glucokinase regulation and function, especially the common neuroendocrine promoter. Of the neuroendocrine cells, the beta cells of the pancreatic islets are the most-studied and best-understood. It is likely that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> relationships discovered in the beta cells will also exist in the other neuroendocrine tissues with glucokinase.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1991, the {{electricity}} sector in Argentina was vertically integrated. The sector experienced a serious {{crisis in the}} summers of 1988/1989, primarily {{due to the lack}} of maintenance of the country's thermal power plants (50% were unavailable). Shortly after the crisis, the government of Carlos Menem introduced a new legal framework for {{the electricity}} sector through Law 24,065, which included the following elements: vertical and horizontal unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution; opening up of all segments to the private sector; and separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> function from policy setting. As a result of the new law, there was substantial private investment which, together with the public power plants that started production in the 1990s, transformed a situation of power shortage and low quality into one of abundance and reliability at lower prices.|$|E
25|$|Model {{validation}} (MV) {{takes the}} models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group {{might well be}} seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.|$|E

500|$|Cell cycle {{progression}} {{is controlled}} by ordered action of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), activated by specific cyclins that demarcate phases of the cell cycle. Mitotic cyclins, which persist in the cell {{for only a few}} minutes, have one of the shortest life spans of all intracellular proteins. After a CDK-cyclin complex has performed its function, the associated cyclin is polyubiquitinated and destroyed by the proteasome, which provides directionality for the cell cycle. In particular, exit from mitosis requires the proteasome-dependent dissociation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> component cyclin B from the mitosis promoting factor complex. In vertebrate cells, [...] "slippage" [...] through the mitotic checkpoint leading to premature M phase exit can occur despite the delay of this exit by the spindle checkpoint.|$|E
500|$|The Glanville Davies {{affair was}} a {{scandal in the}} English legal {{profession}} which resulted in greater reform <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> processes for solicitors {{and was one of}} the justifications for the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. Glanville Davies was a well-respected solicitor and a member of the Council of the Law Society of England and Wales who massively overcharged his client, Leslie Persons, sending him a bill for Â£197,000 that was reduced on taxation to Â£67,000. Davies was not punished by the Law Society's internal regulatory committees, which allowed him to resign from the council on the grounds of ill-health with his reputation intact. Following litigation and public criticism, the Law Society commissioned an internal report that found [...] "administrative failures, wrong decisions, mistakes, errors of judgement, failures in communication and insensitivity". A private member's bill reformed the way in which the Law Society investigated disciplinary complaints, although not to the extent initially proposed, and paved the way for the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 that created an independent disciplinary body.|$|E
500|$|The protein {{products}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>regulatory</b> toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, {{but by a}} complex mosaic of pleiotropy, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular cis-regulatory elements. For example, while a non-pleiotropic rhodopsin gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element {{just a few hundred}} base pairs long, the pleiotropic eyeless cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs. The regulatory networks involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls [...] "scores to hundreds" [...] of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each. All this complexity enables genes involved {{in the development of the}} embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.|$|E
