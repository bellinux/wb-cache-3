40|$|Peroxisomal {{disorders}} are characterized biochemically by {{elevated levels of}} very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in serum. Herein, we describe a novel approach for quantification of VLCFAs in serum, namely, eicosanoic acid (C 20 : 0), docosanoic acid (C 22 : 0), tetracosanoic acid (C 24 : 0), and hexacosanoic acid (C 26 : 0). The methodology is based on (i) enrichment of VLCFA derivatives using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs); (ii) quantification using stable isotope-labeled internal standards; and (iii) direct detection using MWCNT-based surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SALDI-TOFMS). Four kinds of MWCNTs (Aldrich 636843, 636495, 636509, and 636819) of different lengths and diameters were tested using the developed technique. The data show that 636843, the MWCNT with the largest <b>outer</b> <b>diameter</b> (o. <b>d.),</b> the widest wall thickness, and shortest length, had the best limit of detection (0. 5 - 1 mu g/mL) We also {{found that there was}} no significant difference in enrichment efficiency of VLCFAs between the four MWCNTs, which suggests that the size of the MWCNT may contribute to desorption/ionization efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test the enrichment of VLCFAs using MWCNTs of different sizes. We have shown that the VLCFAs adsorbed by MWCNTs can be analyzed by SALDI-TOFMS. In addition, this method does not require liquid/gas chromatography separation, thereby allowing for high-throughput screening of VLCFAs in peroxisomal disorders...|$|R

Here, we demonstrate nanocontact-based large-area fabrication of a novel, LSPR-active Au architecture consisting of periodic arrays of reduced-symmetry nanoantennas having sub- 50 nm, out-of-plane features. Namely, by combining nanosphere and molecular self-assembly processes, we have patterned evaporated polycrystalline Au films for chemical etching of nanocups with controlled aspect ratios (<b>outer</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>d</b> = 100 nm and void volumes = 18 or 39 zL). The resulting nanoantennas were highly ordered, forming a hexagonal lattice structure over centimeter-sized glass substrates, and they displayed characteristic LSPR absorption in the visible/near-infrared spectral range. Theoretical simulations indicated electric field confinement and enhancement patterns located not only around the rims but also inside the nanocups. We also explored how these patterns and the overall spectral characteristics depended on the nanocup aspect ratio {{as well as on}} electric field coupling in the arrays.

The load was introduced {{only on the}} concrete core by means of two high strength steel cylinders placed at the column ends to evaluate the passive confinement provided by the steel tube. The columns were filled with structural concretes with compressive strengths of 30, 60, 80 and 100 MPa. The <b>outer</b> <b>diameter</b> (<b>D)</b> of the column was 114. 3 mm, and the length/diameter (L/D) ratios considered were 3, 5, 7 and 10. The wall thicknesses of the tubes (t) were 3. 35 mm and 6. 0 mm, resulting in diameter/thickness (D/t) ratios of 34 and 19, respectively. The force vs. axial strain curves obtained from the tests showed, in general, a good post-peak behavior of the CFT columns, even for those columns filled with high strength concrete. Three analytical models of confinement for short concrete-filled columns {{found in the literature}} were used to predict the axial capacity of the columns tested. To apply these models to slender columns, a correction factor was introduced to penalize the calculated results, giving good agreement with the experimental values. Additional results of 63 CFT columns tested by other researchers were also compared to the predictions of the modified analytical models and presented satisfactory results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The {{size of the}} leakage hole (d) is a variable ranging from 0. 1 m to 0. 3 m with increment of 0. 1 m whereas the other parameter is fixed. A computational rectangular domain with length of 20 m and height of 15 m was simulated in Gambit 2. 4. The length of computational domain is large enough, which {{is larger than the}} longest horizontal distance the oil droplets migrate when they reach the sea surface.

The patches are circular (with <b>outer</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>D)</b> and {{are made of}} several identical circular cylinders (height, H and diameter, d). The bulk aspect ratio of all the patches (AR = H~D) was fixed at 1 and the patch density ([phi] = Ncd 2 ~D 2) is altered by varying the number of cylinders(Nc) in the patch. Drag measurements show that the patch drag coefficient increases with increasing density. The drag coefficient of the highest investigated density ([phi]= 0. 25) {{is greater than the}} drag coefficient of a solid patch (i. e. [phi] = 1, which is a solid cylinder with AR = 1). PIV measurements were carried out along streamwise-wall-normal (x - y) plane along the centreline of patch and in the streamwise-spanwise (x - z) plane at its mid height (i. e. y = H~ 2). Mean velocity fields show that the porosity of the patch promotes bleeding along all directions. It was observed that bleeding along the vertical/horizontal direction increases/decreases with increasing [phi]. Furthermore, it was also observed that bleeding along the lateral direction dictates the point of flow separation along the sides of the patch and makes it independent of [phi]. All these aspects make wakes for porous patches markedly different from their solid counterpart and provide a basis to explain the observed trends in the drag coefficient. The wakes generating behind three-dimensional porous patches can be divided in two distinct regions: the very near wake, where the wake properties are constant along the height of the model,as a first approximation, and the near wake, where the velocity profiles for different patches collapse, regardless of patch density. Scaling laws and parameters for the velocity profiles are introduced. Subsequently, an analysis of the trend of these parameters with [phi] and y is carried out and, where possible, a predictive model is evaluated. The wakes are also found to be self similar at the mid height horizontal plane, if scaled with appropriate scaling parameters, and the trend of these parameter with patch density is analysed. The analysis of fluctuating quantities confirms the presence of two distinct regions in the patches’ wakes, and suggests the presence of an alternate vortex street whose intensity and coherence increases with increasing patch density...|$|E
