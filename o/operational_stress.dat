The paper also discusses the basic failure theory and method to establish failure model of power transformer. Insulation ageing {{is a problem}} due to dielectric, chemical, thermal and electro-mechanic stresses, which is highly depending on operational conditions. Life management of power transformer should include research of fault diagnostic, monitor methods and insulation reclamation to extend life, and establish life model of power transformer. Life management of power transformer should not only consider the fault model, quantitative assessment of the relevant remnant withstands strengths of transformers and <b>operational</b> <b>stresses,</b> but also establish the maintenance standard for power transformer...|$|R

50|$|A proof shot is {{not used}} in combat but to confirm that a new gun barrel can {{withstand}} <b>operational</b> <b>stresses.</b> The proof shot is heavier than a normal shot or shell, and an oversize propelling charge is used, subjecting the barrel to greater than normal stress. The proof shot is inert (no explosive or functioning filling) and is often a solid unit, although water, sand or iron powder filled versions {{may be used for}} testing the gun mounting. Although the proof shot resembles a functioning shell (of whatever sort), so that it behaves as a real shell in the barrel, it is not aerodynamic as its job is over once it has left the muzzle of the gun. Consequently, it travels a much shorter distance and is usually stopped by an earth bank for safety measures.|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{high costs}} {{associated}} with manufacturing and testing materials for rotor seals, a procedure needs to be developed to quickly and accurately test candidate materials as they are released. The test should {{reduce the amount of}} fabrication required and model working conditions in order to accurately assess the tribological behavior of candidate materials. A possible solution was examined that utilized a rig meant to model <b>operational</b> <b>stresses</b> and wear. Compression modulus data was then taken in order to quantify the accumulation of damage due to microcracking, the primary mode of failure, through a damage index parameter. Testing results concluded that the methods used do not recreate working conditions accurately enough to obtain reliable tribological data due to high variability in the rig, the introduction of damage not typically seen in working rotor seals, and only one failure mode is being accounted for...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the {{opposite}} (left-handed, counterclockwise, reverse) sense of threading {{is used for}} a special reason. A thread might need to be left-handed to prevent <b>operational</b> <b>stresses</b> from loosening it. For example, some older cars and trucks had right-handed lug nuts on the right wheels and left-handed ones on the left wheels, so that, as the vehicle moved forward, the lug nuts tended to tighten rather than loosen. For bicycle pedals, {{the one on the}} left must be reverse-threaded to prevent it unscrewing during use. Similarly, the flyer whorl of a spinning wheel uses a left-hand thread to keep it from loosening. A turnbuckle has right-handed threads on one end and left-handed threads on the other. Some gas fittings are left-handed to prevent disastrous misconnections: oxygen fittings are right-handed, but acetylene, propane, and other flammable gases are unmistakably distinguished by left-handed fittings.|$|R

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} monitoring provides effective {{evaluation of}} power cables, particularly of joints that are installed on site. Continuous on-line monitoring can {{provide information about}} progressing degradation under <b>operational</b> <b>stresses,</b> thus reducing the likelihood of breakdown. A novel PD continuous online monitoring technique has been developed by the authors. The mechanism applies PD signals across a LiNbO 3 electro-optic modulator to modulate {{the intensity of the}} transmitted light. This technique does not require a voltage supply near the cable joints as the EO modulator is passive. In earlier investigations a fibre laser was used as the light source. The polarisation state of the laser light needs to be maintained to suit the polarisation dependent EO modulator. This paper investigates the application of a superluminescent light emitting diode, which provides unpolarised light, as the light source. The alternative monitoring system is investigated using both simulated experiments and practical PD tests on a 132 kV prefabricated cable joint...|$|R
40|$|ALS top-off mode of {{operation}} will require injection of the electron beam from the Booster Ring into the Storage Ring at the full ALS energy level of 1. 9 GeV. Currently the Booster delivers a beam at 1. 5 GeV to the Storage Ring where it is then ramped to the full energy and stored for the user operation. The higher Booster beam energy will require the pulse magnets in the Booster and Storage Rings to operate at proportionally higher magnetic gap fields. Our group studied and tested the possible design and installation modifications required to operate the magnets and drivers at "top-off" levels. Our results and experiments show that with minor electrical modifications all the existing pulse magnet systems can be used at the higher energy levels, and the increased <b>operational</b> <b>stresses</b> should have a negligible impact on magnet reliability. Furthermore, simple electrical modifications to the storage ring thick septum will greatly reduce the present level of septum stray leakage fields into the storage ring beam...|$|R
