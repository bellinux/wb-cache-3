5|$|Taft and his Secretary of State, Philander Knox, {{instituted a}} policy of Dollar Diplomacy towards Latin America, believing U.S. {{investment}} would benefit all involved, while diminishing European influence in regions where the Monroe Doctrine applied. The policy was unpopular among Latin American states that {{did not wish to}} become financial protectorates of the United States, {{as well as in the}} U.S. Senate, many of whose members believed the U.S. should not interfere abroad. No foreign affairs controversy tested Taft's policy more than the collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> regime and subsequent turmoil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> Revolution.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first developed on September 14 over the Pacific Ocean west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> coast.

5|$|Although some in {{the front}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis {{became one of the}} first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
5|$|Judicial {{authorities}} {{investigating the}} charges said the alleged victims {{were not being}} fully cooperative, whereas former members were suspicious <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexican</b> legal system, arguing that it favored the church.

After the first volley a small group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mexicans</b> advanced and Lieutenant Maus went to speak with them. Maus told the group that they were American soldiers and would not return fire.
