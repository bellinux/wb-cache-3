[...] Of {{all ages and}} sexes they swarmed round the carriage, which the driver had instinctively slowed to oblige them, and thrust forward their hands and hats. Colville gave Effie his small change to {{distribute}} among them, at sight of which they streamed {{down the street from}} every direction. Those who had received brought forward the halt and blind, and did not scruple to propose being rewarded for this service. At the same time they did not mind his laughing in their faces; they laughed too, and went <b>off</b> <b>content,</b> or as nearly so as beggars ever are. He buttoned up his pocket as they drove on more rapidly. [...] "I am the only person of no principle--except Effie--in the carriage, and yet I am at this moment carrying more blessings out of this village than I shall ever know what to do with. Mrs. Bowen, I know, is regarding me with severe disapproval. She thinks that I ought to have sent the beggars of San Domenico to Florence, where they would all be shut up in the Pia Casa di Ricovero, and taught some useful occupation. It's terrible in Florence. You can walk through Florence now and have no appeal made to your better nature that is not made at the appellant's risk of imprisonment. When I was there before, you had opportunities of giving at every turn." ...|$|E

The fight was very sharp for the time, and near 700 men, on both sides, were killed; but Sir William would not put it to a general engagement, so the prince drew <b>off,</b> <b>contenting</b> himself to have insulted him in his quarters.|$|R

This is part of Swift's overwhelming honesty as a writer: he writes the way that life goes. He describes a married couple who are well <b>off,</b> <b>content</b> in their working lives and still ardent in bed. The world must contain many such people, though fiction does not - as though happiness were the most inadmissible secret of all." ...|$|E
50|$|In The Transformer, we resume where Phaedrus left <b>off.</b> <b>Content</b> {{with his}} life, a few adopted {{children}} and a gather-woman. He is recognized {{as an adviser to}} the local ruler because of his efforts at providing peace. Unfortunately, there is more to the researchers than we originally supposed. Before Phaedrus was Rael, he was a woman named Jedily Tulily. Interestingly, Jedily was originally an observer who somehow displeased the Regents of Heliarctos and was dumped into The Mask Factory to be used up as a test subject. Upon discovering that Phaedrus still exists, they dispatch assassins to destroy him. Through a convenient quirk of fate, Phaedrus is summoned to the local ruler when the attempt occurs. His lover and adopted children are not so lucky. Initiating Change again, Phaedrus becomes Nazarine, a young woman who is barely out of her teens. Nazarine realizes both that she cannot Change again without becoming an infant and that the Regents (unknown to her at this point) won't stop trying to kill her.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new concept}} for scalable video coding, which is content adaptive and art-directable. Video retargeting is applied to scale video between different resolutions and aspect ratios without introducing inacceptable distortions or cutting <b>off</b> <b>content.</b> The non-linear warping operations are integrated into a spatial scalability framework, which includes two new building blocks, i. e. non-linear warping prediction and warp coding. Efficient algorithms for both processes are presented, tested and optimized. The presented results indicate that our non-linear scaling and warp coding algorithms provide efficient performance compared to standard linear scaling methods. Further, our advanced scaling algorithms, i. e. EWA splatting in combination with backward mapping, may be very useful for linear scaling as well. Index Terms — Scalable video coding, vide...|$|E

The addition of Nd 3 + {{leads to a}} higher emission peak, and a longer lifetime of 270 mu s for Dy 3 + 2. 9 mu m emission, benefited by the low <b>Off</b> <b>content</b> (0. 032 cm(- 1)) host and effective energy transfer of Nd 3 +: F- 4 (5 / 2), H- 2 (9 / 2) -> Dy 3 +: F- 6 (5 / 2) with a energy transfer coefficient of 3. 0 x 10 (- 46) cm(6) /s. Radiative and emission parameters were calculated based on the Judd-Ofelt theory, which shows that the Dy 3 +/Nd 3 + co-doped sample possesses a high calculated spontaneous transition probability (38. 3 s(- 1)) together with a large emission cross section (5. 22 x 10 (- 21) cm(2)). The FWHM is as wide as 260 nm, indicating it is suitable for tunable laser medium. These results prove the fluoride glass {{could be used as}} a potential candidate for compact and efficient eye safe mid-IR lasers...|$|E
