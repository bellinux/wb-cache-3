60|$|What <b>official</b> <b>arrangements</b> {{were made}} for Proconsuls in regard to money, when in command of a province, we do not know. The amounts allowed were no doubt splendid, {{but it was not}} to them that the Roman {{governor}} looked as the source of that fortune which he expected to amass. The means of plunder were infinite, but of plunder always subject to the danger of an accusation. We remember how Verres calculated that he could divide his spoil into three sufficient parts--one for the lawyers, one for the judges, so as to insure his acquittal, and then one for himself. This plundering was common--so common as to have become almost a matter of course; but it was illegal, and subjected some unfortunate culprits to exile, and to the disgorging of a part of what they had taken. No accusation was made against Cicero. As to others there were constantly threats, if no more than threats. Cicero was not even threatened. But he had saved out of his legitimate expenses a sum equal to £18,000 of our money--from which we may learn how noble were the appanages of a Roman governor. The expenses of all his staff passed through his own hands, and many of those of his army. Any saving effected would therefore be to his own personal advantage. On this money he counted much when his affairs were in trouble, as he was going to join Pompey at Pharsalia in the following year. He then begged Atticus to arrange his matters for him, telling him that the sum was at his call in Asia,[116] but he never saw it again: Pompey borrowed it--or took it; and when Pompey had been killed the money was of course gone.|$|E

Glynn's theme reverts to the traditional key of E minor, {{even though it is}} slightly detuned in some episodes (perhaps {{as a result of a}} mistake in the dubbing stage). The bassline was performed on a Roland Juno-6 synthesiser, while the melody and filtered noise effects were performed on a Yamaha DX21 and Korg 770 respectively.

50|$|In January 1885, LDS President John Taylor {{visited the}} Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua, {{selecting}} the Casas Grandes valley {{for the place}} where settlements were to be established.

In May 1885 approximately 400 prospective settlers, mostly plural families from Arizona established temporary camps {{on the shores of}} Casas Grandes River. Most of the settlers arrived before land negotiations were completed. They were forced to wait in their temporary camps, where money, resources and comfort were compromised. Within weeks most colonists in Casas Grandes were reduced to poverty and sickness. Surprisingly, President Díaz interceded in behalf of the colonists, which lead to the first official settlement, named by their intercessor: Colonia Díaz.|$|E

[...] Rael Isaac defended the book in Commentary, claiming: [...] "Much of Finkelstein's malevolent attack is similarly wrong. He incorrectly adds 40,000 Arabs to Miss Peters's projections of the number of Arabs who could have been expected, on the basis of natural increase, to live in the Galilee and Negev (what she calls [...] "Area IV") in 1947, and then accuses her of not accounting for them properly. He charges her with [...] "falsifying" [...] the Anglo-American Survey of Palestine of 1945-46 by claiming that it discloses tens of thousands of Arab illegal immigrants who had been brought into Palestine during the war when in fact (according to Finkelstein) it states only that 3,800 laborers had been brought in. Yet the Survey does list many thousands of laborers who were brought in under <b>official</b> <b>arrangements</b> or came on their own." [...] Peters was criticized for relying on different sources for establishing the Jewish and non-Jewish population in 1893, but Isaac defended this {{on the grounds that the}} Ottoman census would have excluded most Jews as non-citizens, while the figures cited from French geographer Vital Cuinet were likely close to the truth. Isaac conceded that Peters' attempts to reconstruct the population were tentative and overstated, and acknowledged some errors in the book, but concluded that they did not undermine Peters' thesis. Isaac also cited Arieh Avneri's The Claim of Dispossession as further supporting Peters' claims [...] "with regard both to Arab in-migration and to Arab immigration." ...|$|E

40|$|The first Spanish Migration Law was {{approved}} in 1907. The article forty six {{of this law}} dealt with the subsidized repatriation of {{those who could not}} stay in the immigration countries {{because of the lack of}} means of support. According to this law, the shipping companies had to provide a half passage up to twenty per cent of the passengers who were shipped to the Americas during the previous three months. In this paper we explain the way in which these repatriations were carried out, and the <b>official</b> <b>arrangements</b> and economic measures taken during the period between 1907 and 1936. We have analyzed the official communication between the Spanish foreign affairs bureau and its network of consulates and embassies in the American countries, as well as with the main Spanish shipping company and, finally, with some of the main associations of the Spanish communities. Three periods have been established to analyze the legal and financial changes in the repatriation process: 1907 - 1924, 1924 - 1931 and 1931 - 1936. We found that most of the repatriation requests were concentrated during economic crisis when the unemployment affected to the Spanish workers. The ambiguity of the law as well as the lack of financial funds made the repatriation an inefficient and scarce resource to bring people back to their homeland...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{which is}} {{embedded}} in the special issue of the Journal which focuses on the comparative research project ‘Policing European Metropolises’, the general aim is to provide an answer to the research question: ‘Are underlying Anglo-American assumptions regarding trends towards plural policing recognisable in European local geographical settings’? Our underlying question in this article concerns whether or not the local empirical situation in Sofia differs from more general evolutions of policing in Europe. This article will inquire specifically about the (national) influence of a ‘country in transition’ (Bulgaria) on the territory of the city of Sofia. For reasons of feasibility the article is limited to an exploration of the organisation of Bulgarian police. The following main questions are answered in this article: (1) What {{is the nature of the}} division between the national police apparatus and local policing bodies?, (2) Are tendencies towards fragmentation and centralisation determined at the same time? and (3) Are tendencies towards private governance present within the public domain? Answering these questions requires an exploration of the historical and contextual background, so that insight into the related Bulgarian realities, particularly those of Sofia, might be gained. This article explores the <b>official</b> <b>arrangements</b> regarding the policing of crime and disorder in Sofia; it is based on desktop research, mostly internal research from the Ministry of the Interior. In the concluding section, the article summarises the different aspects of policing security in Sofia, framing the reality of this city within the article’s theoretical starting points regarding security governance and plural policing.

40|$|Aged care {{is one of}} {{the more}} {{controversial}} and problematic areas of healthcare in Australia in the 21 st century. Whilst most people today accept that residential care is an essential service for those who can no longer cope on their own in the community, few people want to end up in a nursing home, and few nurses aspire to work there. But was this always the case? This diachronic study integrates archival research and oral history interviews to explore the history of aged care in one state of Australia, Tasmania. Tasmania began its white history as Van Diemen’s Land, a penal settlement on a remote island intended to be the ‘gaol for the entire British Empire’. The high number of convicts transported to the colony and the resulting large emancipist population, many of whom were both impoverished and without family to help them as they aged, meant that the colonial administration was forced to make <b>official</b> <b>arrangements</b> for their care from almost the first days of the state’s existence. These arrangements bore some similarities to those in other Australian states and in the mother country, but the peculiarities of life on the edge of civilization brought their own unique solutions in that century, and the next. This thesis follows the development of Tasmanian aged care from the early colonial charitable institutions, to the early 20 th century period of ‘making do’, to the ennursement of aged care in the middle of that century, and finally to developments in the 1980 s that led to today’s highly regulated and businesslike aged care sector. It illuminates the changes and continuities in conditions and practices within homes for the aged, and the shifting attitudes of Tasmanian society towards the elderly and those that cared for them. Official records paint an almost uniformly positive picture of aged care. In contrast, public opinion is almost equally negative. This study provides a more balanced story, in the hope that an understanding of the successes and failures of the past will provide some guidance for the future to assist our aging population in the 21 st century...|$|E

40|$|Provision {{for free}} {{medicines}} was {{one aspect of}} the universal health service outlined in Part III of Labour's Social Security Act 1938. The <b>official</b> <b>arrangements</b> made during the next three years to supply medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme were intended to benefit the ill, but also protected the interests of doctors and pharmacists. The Government's introduction of these benefits coincided with dramatic advances in organic chemistry and the subsequent development of synthetic drugs in Europe and the United States. These events transformed the pharmaceutical industry from a commodity business to a sophisticated international industry producing mainly synthetic, mass-produced medicines, well protected by patents. While no government in the early 1940 s could have guessed at the cost of providing such products, no government committed to a public health service could deny these products once they were commercially available. Pharmaceutical benefits quickly became a crucial aspect of patients' rights to free medical care in general but, at the same time, represented income and profit to pharmacists, drug manufacturers and wholesalers, and an important aspect of doctors' professional and economic status. This tension between state commitments and private interests, still unresolved, is the central theme of this history. Through its control of access to the New Zealand market, the Department of Health was in theory in a strong position to bargain with local producers over drug prices. But in practice it was powerless to confront individual companies which held the patents on behalf of their overseas parent companies. Indeed the policies of the Department of Industries and Commerce were crucial in promoting the prosperity and profits of this small local pharmaceutical industry so as to guarantee access to paid employment and conserve precious foreign exchange. New Zealand was not alone in grappling with such problems and conflicts of interest. Governments in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Australia all had great difficulty controlling doctors' prescribing, and also had ambivalent aims when bargaining with local pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers. This thesis contributes to many studies on collaboration and compromise in government policy. It vividly demonstrates Heclo and Wildavsky's claim that governments operate as a federation of departments each linked to client groups. More importantly, this New Zealand history of the state provision of medicines extends and modifies British, Canadian, United States and Australian literature on the politics of national health services. Because discussion of state-funded and state-organised prescription medicines schemes in these studies is dominated by the politics of the medical profession, pharmaceutical companies and pharmacists are often only a shadowy presence. This thesis, for the first time, brings together the history of the medicines themselves, {{and the way in which}} they came to mean different things to each different provider - to doctors, drug companies, pharmacists and the state itself. An understanding of the history of this one aspect of government health services also enriches our understanding of the wider history of the New Zealand welfare state...|$|E
