5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century {{epizootics}} in livestock caused by viruses continue to have serious consequences. Bluetongue disease, a disease caused by an <b>orbivirus</b> broke out in sheep in France in 2007.

5|$|In late 1998, 120–130 tammar {{wallabies}} {{died suddenly}} in research facilities and zoos in New South Wales and Queensland, perishing less than twelve hours after exhibiting the first symptoms, with most exhibiting no symptoms at all. Post mortem examination revealed haemorrhage of muscle, and abdominal and thoracic organs. The syndrome {{is known as}} tammar sudden death syndrome and the pathogen is an <b>orbivirus</b> of the family Reoviridae. It does not occur south of Sydney. Captive populations of tammar wallabies in New South Wales have subsequently suffered infections in summer months. No treatment has been attempted due to the rapid progression of the disease.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{determined}} the complete genome sequences of Tribeč virus (TRBV) and Kemerovo virus (KEMV), two tick-transmitted <b>Orbiviruses</b> {{that can cause}} diseases of {{the central nervous system}} and that are currently classified into the Great Island virus serogroup. VP 2 proteins of TRBV and KEMV show very low sequence similarity to the homologous VP 4 protein of tick-transmitted Great Island virus (GIV). The new sequence data support previous serological classification of these <b>Orbiviruses</b> into the Kemerovo serogroup, which is different from the Great Island virus serogroup. Genome segment 9 of TRBV and KEMV encodes several overlapping ORF's in the + 1 reading frame relative to VP 6 (Hel). A co-phylogenetic analysis indicates a host switch from insect-borne <b>Orbiviruses</b> toward Ixodes species, which is in disagreement with previously published data...|$|R
2500|$|Bluetongue {{is caused}} by the {{pathogenic}} virus, Bluetongue virus (BTV), of the genus <b>Orbivirus,</b> [...] of the Reoviridae family. Twenty-six serotypes are now recognised for this virus.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Coltivirus" [...] {{is derived}} from the main member in the family, the Colorado tick fever virus ("Colorado tick"). Coltivirus is in the family Reoviridae, which {{contains}} eight genera. Orthoreovirus, <b>Orbivirus,</b> Coltivirus, Rotavirus, Aquareovirus, Cypovirus, Phytoreovirus, and Fijivirus. [...] Coltivirus and <b>Orbivirus</b> together contain about 109 serotypes, and only four of these cause human disease. Ticks are the main vectors of Coltiviruses (5). The type species of Coltivirus is Colorado tick fever virus, but European Eyach virus is another member of the genus. Colorado tick fever was originally recorded in the 19th century, and today {{it is one of the}} most common tick-borne diseases in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|His {{original}} {{idea was to}} suggest the name [...] "urbivirus" [...] because of the structural similarity of rotavirus to <b>orbivirus.</b> Ruth Bishop, {{who was the first}} to describe rotaviruses as a cause of gastroenteritis had suggested [...] "duovirus" [...] because these viruses replicate in the [...] duodenum and, at the time, were thought to have a double protein outer coat. [...] The early research papers from the 1970s use both names.|$|E
50|$|An open {{reading frame}} spans almost {{the entire length of}} genome segment-9 and encodes VP6 (the viral helicase). A second {{open reading frame}} (OrfX) is also present on this segment and encodes a fourth non {{structural}} protein (NS4), which was predicted from sequence analysis of various <b>orbiviruses</b> including Segment 9 of Great Island virus which contained a long NS4 ORF (approximately 21kDa). The existence of NS4 was experimentally confirmed in both insect-borne and tick-borne <b>orbiviruses</b> in 2011.|$|R

40|$|Corresponding {{double-stranded}} RNA {{segments of}} the related <b>orbiviruses</b> Wallal and Mudjinbarry produced distinctly different RNase T 1 fingerprint patterns. No extensive sequence reiteration was observed between segments of Mudjinbarry virus. Fingerprint analysis of the genome of recombinant <b>orbiviruses</b> confirmed segment reassortment as a mechanism of interchange of genetic information. When temperature-sensitive mutants of each virus were crossed in mixed infection, a consistent pattern of segment reassortment was correlated with generation of the wild-type phenotype. Thus, the temperature-sensitive lesion of group II Wallal serogroup mutants was mapped to segment 1. The group I mutant lesion appears to be located in segment 2...|$|R

50|$|In 1719, African horse {{sickness}} virus {{caused the}} first major recorded <b>orbivirus</b> epidemic, killing 1,500 animals. The most historically significant outbreak of <b>orbivirus</b> occurred in 1854-1855, when AHSV infected 70,000 horses. AHSV was discovered to be a virus in 1900 and bluetongue disease followed shortly thereafter in 1905. Outbreaks have occurred sporadically in the 20th and 21st centuries.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of genome segment reassortment between two antigenically related <b>orbiviruses</b> was demonstrated in cattle.

A minimum of six genome segments participated in reassortment, with 16 unique reassortant constellations being identified.

40|$|A new {{virus was}} found to be {{associated}} with acute gastroenteritis in children. In duodenal biopsies, it was observed infecting only intestinal epithelial cells, and it resembled <b>orbiviruses</b> in its morphogenesis.

Two forms of particles were seen: double-sheeled particles (70 to 75 nm in diameter) resembling those of reovirus with a sharper outline, and single-shelled particles (60 nm in diameter) with obvious capsomer structure and resembling those of <b>orbiviruses.</b> The morphological resemblance of this human virus to the viruses of "Nebraska" calf scours and epizootic diarrhoea of infant mice is emphasized...|$|R
50|$|Many <b>orbiviruses</b> {{preferentially}} infect vascular endothelial cells. <b>Orbiviruses</b> {{enter the}} host cell by endocytosis {{and the outer}} capsid is subsequently removed. The whole cycle of viral replication takes place within the cytoplasm of the host cell. Transcription of the viral genome into mRNA occurs within the core particle and mRNA is translated into proteins using the host cell ribosomes. Viral proteins are synthesized 2-14 days after initial infection. New virons self-assemble within the cytoplasm and are then released from the host cell by budding. During the budding process they transiently acquire a lipid envelope which can be detected {{for a short period}} of time following their release but this is subsequently lost.|$|R

40|$|Although {{recognized}} as causing emerging and re-emerging disease outbreaks worldwide {{since the late}} 1800 s, there has been growing interest in the United States and Europe {{in recent years in}} <b>orbiviruses,</b> their insect vectors, and the diseases they cause in domestic livestock and wildlife. This is due, in part, to the emergence of bluetongue (BT) in northern Europe in 2006 - 2007 resulting in a devastating outbreak, as well as severe BT outbreaks in sheep and epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) outbreaks in deer and cattle in the United States. Of notable concern is the isolation of as many as 10 new BT virus (BTV) serotypes in the United States since 1999 and their associated unknowns, such as route of introduction, virulence to mammals, and indigenous competent vectors. This review, based on a gap analysis workshop composed of international experts on <b>orbiviruses</b> conducted in 2013, gives a global perspective of current basic virological understanding of <b>orbiviruses,</b> with particular attention to BTV and the closely related epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), and identifies a multitude of basic virology research gaps, critical for predicting and preventing outbreaks...|$|R
