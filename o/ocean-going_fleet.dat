The municipality is considered to be among the ports in the world with the largest <b>ocean-going</b> fishing trawler <b>fleet.</b> Since the 1980s, the offshore oil industry and fish farming industry have both grown to be important industries in Austevoll.|$|R
50|$|The first German Naval Law of 1898 legislated the {{construction}} of an <b>ocean-going</b> battle <b>fleet</b> by Imperial Germany. To accompany the squadrons of battleships and cruisers, the law called for {{the construction}} of flotillas of large torpedo-boats (große Torpedoboote), considerably larger, better armed and more seaworthy than the previous torpedo boats built by Germany. Although they were initially given numbers in the same series as the smaller torpedo-boats(GE), officially they were called ocean-going torpedo-boats (Hochseetorpedoboote) and they were in many ways the equivalent of the contemporary destroyers in other navies (they were often referred to as such by their crews). During the next 20 years a total of 336 such vessels were ordered for the German navy; these vessels are listed in this article.|$|R
50|$|During World War II the French Vichy {{government}} interned {{foreign nationals}} in Mỹ Tho. In May 1945, the Japanese {{seized control of}} the camps fearing an allied attack. Foreign nationals were confined throughout the war. As the regional capital Mỹ Tho is the main market dealing in all the produce from the region as well as fish and seafood from Mỹ Tho's large <b>ocean-going</b> fishing <b>fleet.</b> The very large and exuberant market is one of South Vietnam's biggest sources for dried fish and other dried seafood products such as Kho Muc (dried squid). At night the market {{is dedicated to the}} dealing and sorting of Mekong River fish, particularly catfish for Hồ Chí Minh City's wholesale markets. Produce, especially fruit and vegetables, watch, is delivered by boat directly to markets. It is a popular starting point for tourists to take a boat trip on the Mekong River.|$|R
5000|$|Axel Ax:son Johnson, or the Consul-General as {{he called}} himself, took over from his father in 1910, aged 34. New {{technology}} was introduced and old technology was sold before anyone else understood that it had become out-dated, such as the sale of steam vessels and the purchase of diesel-driven ships. Slightly more than 20 years later, in 1936, the Johnson Group was an exponent of modern Sweden. The Consul-General, who was described as [...] "a collector of synergies," [...] already had three major industrial deeds behind him by that time. At {{the start of the}} 1920s, Nordstjernan had the world's first diesel-driven <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fleet</b> and the head-start on competitors meant the ability to open new routes, particularly the Pacific Lines to the west coasts of North and South America via the Panama Canal. In 1924, he launched stainless steel in Sweden and, in 1928, he had Sweden's first oil refinery built in Nynäshamn.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Tooze {{wrote that}} the German success could not be {{attributed}} to a great superiority in the machinery of industrial warfare. German rearmament showed no evidence of a strategic synthesis claimed by the supporters of the blitzkrieg thesis. There had been an acceleration in war spending after 1933 but no obvious strategy or realistic prediction of the war Germany would come to fight. The huge armaments plans of 1936 and 1938 were for a big partially-mechanised army, a strategic air force and an <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fleet.</b> In early 1939, a balance of payments crisis led chaos in the armaments programme; {{the beginning of the war}} led to armaments output increasing again but still with no sign of a blitzkrieg concept determining the programme. The same discrepancy between German military-industrial preparations and the campaign can be seen in the plans formed for the war in the west. There was no plan before September 1939 and the first version in October was a compromise that satisfied no-one but the capture the Channel coast to conduct an air war against Britain, was apparently the purpose determining armaments production from December 1939.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{freshwater}} lakes {{are less}} corrosive to ships than the salt {{water of the}} oceans, many of the Lakers remain in service for long periods and the fleet has a much higher average age than the <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fleet.</b> The average lifespan of a laker is 40-50 years however, ships older than 50 years are not uncommon. Until 2014, , built in 1906 as William P. Snyder (552 ft), was the oldest ship in active duty on the Lakes. She was managed by Port City Steamship and owned by St. Mary's Cement, a subsidiary of Votorantim Cimentos. E. M. Ford {{had one of the}} longest careers, having been built in 1898 (as Presque Isle - 428 ft) and still sailing the lakes 98 years later in 1996. In 2007 she was still afloat as a stationary transfer vessel at a riverside cement silo in Saginaw. She went to the scrap yard in November 2010 at Purvis Marine. J. B. Ford, built in 1904, last sailed in 1985 and in 2007 served in the same capacity as E. M. Ford at a different cement silo in Superior, Wisconsin. Several decorated World War II veteran ships are still in active, although civilian, use such as the tankers Chiwawa and Neshanic, now the bulk freighters Lee A. Tregurtha and American Victory, respectively, and the Landing Craft Tank 203, now the working vessel Outer Island.|$|E
50|$|The final {{battle of}} the war was the costly Battle of Scheveningen in August. The Dutch desperately tried to break the English blockade; after heavy {{fighting}} with much damage on both sides, the defeated Dutch retreated to the Texel, but the English had to abandon the blockade. Tromp was killed early in the battle, a blow to morale which increased the Dutch desire to end the war. Similar feelings arose in England. Although many had been enriched by the war (Dutch prizes taken during the war, about 1200 merchantmen or 8% of their total mercantile fleet, amounted to double the value of England's entire <b>ocean-going</b> merchant <b>fleet)</b> trade as a whole had suffered. Cromwell himself was exasperated that two Protestant nations should exhaust themselves in this useless conflict that he had started, while Catholic Spain profited. He decided to begin negotiations in earnest with the four Dutch envoys who had arrived in late June. Hostilities largely ended until the conclusion of peace.|$|R
50|$|After {{this initial}} burst of activity, the Atlantic {{campaign}} quieted down. Admiral Karl Dönitz, {{commander of the}} U-boat fleet, had planned a maximum submarine effort for {{the first month of}} the war, with almost all the available U-boats out on patrol in September. That level of deployment could not be sustained; the boats needed to return to harbour to refuel, re-arm, re-stock supplies, and refit. The harsh winter of 1939-40, which froze over many of the Baltic ports, seriously hampered the German offensive by trapping several new U-boats in the ice. Hitler's plans to invade Norway and Denmark in the spring of 1940 led to the withdrawal of the fleet's surface warships and most of the <b>ocean-going</b> U-boats for <b>fleet</b> operations in Operation Weserübung.|$|R
40|$|This {{dictionary}} is {{the first}} attempt to express the wealth of archaic logbook wind force terms {{in a form that}} is comprehensible to the modern-day reader. Oliver and Kington (1970) and Lamb (1982) have drawn attention to the importance of logbooks in climatic studies, and Lamb (1991) offered a conversion scale for early eighteenth century English wind force terms, but no studies have thus far pursued the matter to any greater depth. This text attempts to make good this deficiency, and is derived from the research undertaken by the CLIWOC project 1 in which British, Dutch, French and Spanish naval and merchant logbooks from the period 1750 to 1850 were used to derive a global database of climatic information. At an early stage in the project it was apparent that many of the logbook weather terms, whilst conforming to a conventional vocabulary, possessed meanings that were unclear to twenty-first century readers or had changed over time. This was particularly the case for the important element of wind force; but no special plea is entered for the evolution in nautical vocabulary, which often reflected more wide-ranging changes in the respective native languages. The key objective was to translate the archaic vocabulary of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century mariner into expressions directly comparable with the Beaufort Scale (see Appendix I). Only then could the projects scientific programme be embarked upon. This dictionary {{is the result of the}} largest undertaking into logbook studies that has yet been carried out. Several thousand logbooks from British, Dutch, French and Spanish archives were examined, and the exercise offered a unique opportunity to explore the vocabulary of the one hundred year period beginning in 1750. The logbooks from which the raw data have been abstracted range widely across the North and South Atlantic and the Indian Oceans. Only the Pacific, largely in consequence of the paucity of regular naval activity in that area, is not well represented. The range of climates encountered in this otherwise wide geographic domain gives ample opportunity for the full range of the mariners nautical weather vocabulary to be assessed, from the calms of the Equatorial regions, through the gales of the mid-latitude systems to the fearsome storms of the tropical latitudes. The Trade Winds belts, the Doldrums, the unsettled mid-latitudes, even the icy wastes of the high latitudes, are all embraced in this study. It is not here intended to pass any judgements on the climatological record of the logbooks, and this text seeks only to provide a means of understanding archaic wind force terms and, other than to indicate those items that were not commonly used, no information is given on the frequency with which different terms appeared in the logbooks. Attention is, furthermore, confined to Dutch, English, French and Spanish because these once great imperial powers were the only nations able to support wide-ranging <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fleets</b> with their attendant collections of logbooks and documents over this long period of time. The work is offered to the wider academic community in the hope that they will prove to be of as much value as it has been to the CLIWOC team...|$|R

40|$|The {{critical}} role shipping taxation {{has played in}} the structure and evolution of the shipping business {{over the last century}} can easily be recognised. Whether connected with the actual initiation of the open registries scheme or as a means to improve competitiveness of traditional flags, shipping taxation attracts the attention of shipping practitioners and policy makers and constitutes an always topical focus of study. Recent years have particularly seen the rise and growth of tonnage tax system as no longer merely an inventive tax format but as a global standard of shipping taxation, which is in operation for 70 % of the global <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fleet.</b> An examination of the European Union (EU) shipping taxation policy exhibits particular interest not only {{due to the fact that}} a number of significant traditional ship-owning nations are part of the EU – for example, Greece and the UK – but also due to the presence of fairly recently joined countries with a substantial role in international shipping as popular open registries – for example, Cyprus and Malta. The aim of this paper is to investigate the shipping taxation policy of the EU by concentrating on the forms this takes in selected European countries and to examine critically the comparative position of Greek shipping in this context...|$|E
40|$|In an {{era that}} {{national}} flags are dying off (Sletmo 2001) {{there is no}} dispute about the success of Greek flagged shipping. How can a small nation like Greece retain {{the highest percentage of}} all national fleets? Literature identifies that this success is due to several reasons. However, what are the elements that contribute to the success of Greek-flagged shipping? This study establishes that ‘the success of Greek ocean-going flagged shipping is a blend of a tendency for governments to experiment with various policies intended to promote national competitiveness, individual entrepreneurship, the cluster as well as culture, knowledge and skill’. Litrature from different disciplines and sources are summarised, compared, contrasted, and synthesised in order to develop a coherent outcome and gain a new perspective in the respective field. Since “policy is like beauty {{in the eye of the}} beholder…” (Roe 2007 c) a multilevel, holistic, exploratory, inductive, deductive, abductive, and overall pragmatic methodological approach is considered, as the only viable option for complex research questions related to maritime policy. A three-method approach is applied with every method contributing to each other: the Timeline A to Ω and Literature Analysis, Delphi Method, and the Application of Porter’s diamond on national competitiveness. The belief that traditional flags are dying off, implies that they are not dead yet. The Greek Registry, and every ship registry is a system of people, organisations, and processes and it is that system that contributes to the success of the flag. Contrary to the belief of some players, government policy affects the size and the quality of the national flag <b>ocean-going</b> <b>fleet</b> undertaking various polices intented to promote national competitiveness. This study contributes to academic knowledge as well as to the Greek and any other registry’s competitiveness, as well as to the govenemental decision making and development of maritime policies. Recommendations are made for the Greek flag and the maritime policy, as well as for the application of the GREKON MODEL to the real maritime world and academia...|$|E
5000|$|As {{early as}} 1861, the first armor-clad ships were {{built for the}} Baltic Fleet. In 1863, during the American Civil War, most of the <b>Fleet's</b> <b>ocean-going</b> ships, {{including}} the flagship [...] "Alexander Nevsky" [...] were sent to New York City. At the same time ten [...] "Uragan"-class monitors based on an American-designed [...] "Passaic" [...] monitor were launched. Here it was {{the policy of the}} Czar and his government to show support for the Northern Union Army in the United States during their Civil War, observing and exchanging naval tactics and cooperation. In 1869, the fleet commissioned the first turret on a battleship in the world - [...] "Petr Veliky". Furthermore, {{in the second half of}} the 19th and early 20th Century a strong network of coastal artillery batteries was created to cover the approaches to St. Petersburg, Riga, and other important bases.The Baltic Fleet took a prominent part in the Russo-Japanese War. After the defeat of earlier Far East Fleet vessels, in September 1904, a squadron under the command of Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky was sent on a famous high-speed dash around South Africa - stopping in French, German and Portuguese colonial ports: Tangier in Morocco, Dakar in Senegal, Gabon, Baía dos Tigres, Lüderitz Bay, and Nossi Be (Madagascar), then across the Indian Ocean to Cam Ranh Bay in French Indochina and then northward to its doomed encounter with the Japanese fleet at the Battle of Tsushima off the east coast of Korea in 1905, ending the Russo-Japanese War. The Imperial German civilian passenger Hamburg-Amerika Line provided 60 colliers to supply the Baltic Fleet on its epic journey. During its passage through the North Sea the Fleet mistook a fleet of British fishing boats for Japanese torpedo boats and opened fire, killing three sailors in what is known as the [...] "Dogger Bank incident". The decision to send the Fleet to the Pacific was made after Russia had suffered a string of naval defeats in the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan off the coast of China and Korea near its Far East naval base and colony at the hands of the newly emergent Imperial Japanese Navy and Army in Manchuria. This historic naval battle broke Russian strength in East Asia and set the stage for the unsuccessful uprising in the abortive Russian Revolution of 1905, which began the decline that would see the Romanov dynasty monarchy eventually brought down with the strains of World War I in 1917.|$|R
