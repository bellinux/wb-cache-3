5|$|Industrial {{production}} {{in the twentieth century}} relied <b>on</b> <b>treatment</b> with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.|$|E

5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be unacceptable to the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist <b>on</b> <b>treatment</b> that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E
5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; <b>on</b> <b>treatment,</b> these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a getter for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E

40|$|Present in {{excessive}} amounts, micronutrient boron {{may become}} toxic for plants. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate boron tolerance in seedlings of 12 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes treated with boric acid. Selection criterion was root growth suppression in the presence of boron, which varied between 15. 2 (Apache) and 46. 3 % (Renan). Root lengths on control and root growth suppression <b>on</b> <b>treatments</b> were not correlated. Boron content and dry weight of seedlings varied in vast intervals in all groups on control, as well as <b>on</b> <b>treatments,</b> which is probably caused by different boron tolerance mechanisms. Root growth suppression in genotypes Apache, Trakija and Bezostaja 1 was less than 20 % and they may be considered as boron tolerant. Renan, Fundulea 4, Magdalena, Pergamino Gaboto and Donjecka 48 are marked as boron sensitive owing to more than 30 % shorter roots <b>on</b> boron <b>treatments.</b> Norin 10 /Brevor 14, Radika, Žitarka and Mironovska 808 were medium tolerant to excess boron. ...|$|R
