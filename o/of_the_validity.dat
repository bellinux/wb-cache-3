5|$|In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., the U.S. Supreme Court {{ruled that}} the {{corporation}} tax act of 1909 did not violate the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Court did not rule that excise taxes consisted only of taxes on corporations and corporate privileges, {{to the exclusion of}} taxes on individuals (natural persons). The issue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of an income tax imposed on individuals was neither presented to the Court nor decided by the Court.|$|E

This means that although the Tribunal lies outside the normal hierarchy of the courts since it does not hear appeals from any courts, its opinions are binding on all other courts. It is technically open for the President, on Cabinet's advice, to refer the same matter to the Tribunal for its re-consideration.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} young physicists, Rabi was closely {{following}} momentous events in Europe. He was astounded by the Stern–Gerlach experiment, which convinced him <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of quantum mechanics. With Ralph Kronig, Francis Bitter, Mark Zemansky and others, {{he set out}} to extend the Schrödinger equation to symmetric top molecules and find the energy states of such a mechanical system. The problem was that none of them could solve the resulting equation, a second-order partial differential equation. Rabi found the answer in a book by the 19th-century mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. The equation had the form of a hypergeometric equation to which Jacobi had found a solution. Kronig and Rabi wrote up their result and sent it to Physical Review, which published it in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Philosophies of the {{particular}} sciences range from questions {{about the nature of}} time raised by Einstein's general relativity, to the implications of economics for public policy. A central theme is whether one scientific discipline can be reduced to the terms of another. That is, can chemistry be reduced to physics, or can sociology be reduced to individual psychology? The general questions of philosophy of science also arise with greater specificity in some particular sciences. For instance, the question <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of scientific reasoning is seen in a different guise in the foundations of statistics. The question of what counts as science and what should be excluded arises as a life-or-death matter in the philosophy of medicine. Additionally, the philosophies of biology, of psychology, and of the social sciences explore whether the scientific studies of human nature can achieve objectivity or are inevitably shaped by values and by social relations.|$|E
5|$|Supporters {{said that}} the {{publication}} of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of free speech regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of the expression, {{that it was important to}} openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as Islamophobic, racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} sign of dissent {{occurred}} in 1989 when a WCG minister, Gerald Flurry, published a manuscript outlining {{what he and}} others believed were disturbing trends in the work, including {{the beginnings of the}} doctrinal departure from what had been established by Armstrong. Flurry and another minister, John Amos, were disfellowshipped and went on to form the Philadelphia Church of God (PCG). The PCG began an alternative radio program and magazine, and {{over the next several years}} a few thousand WCG members left to join the PCG. Despite this, Tkach continued to implement additional changes in thinking including: the shift in emphasis away from observing world events primarily through the lens of prophetic interpretation; the removal of the prohibition of interracial marriage; the allowance of work on the Sabbath; the acceptance of the trinitarian doctrine; and the acceptance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> of other Christian denominations, among many other changes. Older Armstrong publications that supported the church's once unique doctrines were allowed to go out-of-print.|$|E

40|$|Common wisdom {{tells us}} that more {{information}} can only help and never hurt. Goldstein and Gigerenzer (2002) highlighted an instance violating this intuition. Specifically, {{in an analysis of}} their recognition heuristic, they found a counterintuitive less-ismore effect in inference: An individual recognizing fewer objects than another individual can, nevertheless, make more accurate inferences. Goldstein and Gigerenzer emphasized that a sufficient condition for this effect is that <b>the</b> recognition <b>validity</b> be higher than <b>the</b> knowledge <b>validity,</b> assuming that <b>the</b> <b>validities</b> are uncorrelated with <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> recognized objects, n. But how is <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> less-is-more effect affected when this independence assumption is violated? I show that validity dependencies (i. e., correlations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>validities</b> with n) abound in empirical data sets, and I demonstrate by computer simulations that these dependencies often have a strong limiting effect on the less-is-more effect. Moreover, I discuss what cognitive (e. g., memory) and ecological (e. g., distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criterion variable, environmental frequencies) factors can give rise to a dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recognition <b>validity</b> on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> recognizedobjects...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> family {{background}} variables instrumenting education in income regressions {{has been much}} criticized. In this paper, we use data from the 2004 German Socio-Economic Panel and Bayesian analysis to analyze to what degree violations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strict <b>validity</b> assumption affect <b>the</b> estimation results. We show that, in case of moderate direct effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument on the dependent variable, the results do not deviate much from <b>the</b> benchmark case <b>of</b> no such effect (perfect <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument's exclusion restriction). In many cases, <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bias is smaller than <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 95 % posterior interval for <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> education on income. Thus, a violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strict <b>validity</b> assumption does not necessarily lead to results which are strongly different from those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strict <b>validity</b> case.
