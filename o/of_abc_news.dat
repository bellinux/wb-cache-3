5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested to Reagan to have Regan fired.|$|E

25|$|In May 2010, KGO-TV began {{carrying}} the Disney/ABC-owned Live Well HD (now Live Well Network) on its second digital subchannel; KGO-TV also produces the cooking show Good Cookin' with Bruce Aidells for the network. In 2007, KGO {{was among the}} few commercial television stations in California that scheduled an alternative set of programs on a digital subchannel; at the time, the 7.2 subchannel ran simulcasts and rebroadcasts of most KGO newscasts and other locally produced programs, along with repeats <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> programs in non-traditional timeslots (for example, the weeknight editions of ABC World News Tonight aired at 7 p.m, while Nightline aired most weekdays at 9 a.m. and 7:30p.m.).

25|$|After McCain {{announced}} Palin as {{his running}} mate, Newsweek and Time put Palin on their magazine covers, {{as some of the}} media alleged that McCain's campaign was restricting press access to Palin by allowing only three one-on-one interviews and no press conferences with her. Among the reasons that the news organizations criticized the restrictions was Palin's first major interview, with Charles Gibson <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News,</b> met with mixed reviews. Her interview five days later with Fox News's Sean Hannity focuses on many of the same questions from Gibson's interview. However, Palin's performance in her third interview, with Katie Couric of CBS News, was widely criticized. Palin's responses to several of Couric's questions were considered embarrassing, most notably failing to name any newspapers she read. The fallout from the interview prompted a decline in her poll numbers, concern among Republicans that she was becoming a political liability, and calls from some conservative commentators for Palin to resign from the Presidential ticket. Other conservatives remain ardent in their support for Palin, accusing the columnists of elitism. Following this interview, some Republicans, including Mitt Romney and Bill Kristol, questioned the McCain campaign's strategy of sheltering Palin from unscripted encounters with the press.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} compete with CNN, ABC {{proposed}} a 24-hour news channel called ABC Cable News, with plans to launch the network in 1995; however, the plan would ultimately be shelved by company management. ABC would reattempt such a concept in July 2004 with the launch <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> Now, a 24-hour news channel distributed for viewing on the Internet and mobile phones. On August 29, 1994, ABC purchased Flint, Michigan affiliate WJRT-TV and WTVG in Toledo, Ohio (which was previously affiliated with ABC from 1958 to 1970) from SJL Broadcast Management, with the latter switching to ABC once its contract with NBC expired {{two months after the}} purchase was finalized in early 1995. Both stations were acquired as a contingency plan in the event that CBS reached an affiliation deal with WXYZ-TV (to replace WJBK, which switched to Fox {{as a result of that}} network's group affiliation agreement with New World Communications) in order to allow the network to retain some over-the-air presence in the Detroit market (the E.W. Scripps Company and ABC would reach a group affiliation deal that renewed affiliation agreements with WXYZ and WEWS, and switch four other stations, including two whose Fox affiliations were displaced by the New World deal, with the network).|$|E
25|$|The merger between ABC and Capital Cities {{received}} federal approval on September 5, 1985. After the ABC/Capital Cities merger was finalized on January 3, 1986, {{the combined}} company – which {{became known as}} Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. – added four television stations (WPVI-TV/Philadelphia, KTRK-TV/Houston, KFSN-TV/Fresno and WTVD/Raleigh) and several radio stations to ABC's broadcasting portfolio, and also included Fairchild Publications and four newspapers (including The Kansas City Star and Fort Worth Star-Telegram). It also initiated several changes in its management: Frederick S. Pierce was named president of ABC's broadcasting division; Michael P. Millardi became vice president of ABC Broadcasting, and president of ABC Owned Stations and ABC Video Enterprises; John B. Sias was appointed president of the ABC Television Network; Brandon Stoddard became president of ABC Entertainment (a position {{to which he had}} been appointed in November 1985); and Roone Arledge became president <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News</b> and ABC Sports. In February 1986, Thomas S. Murphy, who had been serving as CEO of Capital Cities since 1964, was appointed chairman and CEO emeritus of ABC. Jim Duffy stepped down as ABC Television president for a management position at ABC Communications, a subsidiary that specialized in community service programming, including shows related to literary education.|$|E
25|$|Voter {{demographic}} data for 2016 {{were collected by}} Edison Research for the National Election Pool, a consortium <b>of</b> <b>ABC</b> <b>News,</b> CBS News, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News and the Associated Press. The voter survey is based on questionnaires completed by 24,537 voters leaving 350 voting places throughout the United States on Election Day, in addition to 4,398 telephone interviews with early and absentee voters. Trump's crucial victories in the Midwest were aided {{in large part by}} his strong margins among non-college whites – while Obama lost those voters by a margin of 10 points in 2012, Clinton lost this group by 20 percent. The election also represented the first time that Republicans performed better among lower-income whites than among affluent white voters. To some analysts' surprise, Trump narrowed Clinton's margin compared to Obama by 7 points among blacks and African-Americans, 8 points among Latinos, and 11 points among Asian-Americans. Meanwhile, Trump increased his lead with non-Hispanic white voters through 1 percent over Mitt Romney's performance, and American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders shifted their support towards the Republican candidate using the same relative amount. Additionally, although 74 percent of Muslim voters supported Clinton, Trump nearly doubled his support there compared to Mitt Romney, according to the New York Times exit poll. However, exit polls are believed to have overstated sectors of the electorate oftentimes in the past, and further study with additional data is generally recommended by experts, as it {{is considered to be a}} more accurate representation of voting behavior in presidential elections.|$|E

The move in oversight will likely not generate any noticeable changes in The View's content (in recent years, the remainder <b>of</b> <b>ABC's</b> <b>news</b> content has become similarly slanted towards soft news, entertainment, and popular culture); it will, however, allow the show to leverage <b>ABC</b> <b>News's</b> resources more frequently than before, as well as create the possibility of making deals to land big-name guests (something generally forbidden on the newsgathering side).
