5|$|A {{homophonic}} texture may be homorhythmic, {{which means}} that all parts have the same rhythm. Chorale texture is another variant of homophony. The {{most common type of}} homophony is melody-dominated homophony, in which one voice, <b>often</b> <b>the</b> highest, plays a distinct melody, and the accompanying voices work together to articulate an underlying harmony.|$|E
5|$|After 1302 {{the island}} kingdom was {{sometimes}} called the Kingdom of Trinacria. <b>Often</b> <b>the</b> kingship was vested in another monarch such as the King of Aragon, the King of Spain or the Holy Roman Emperor. In 1816 the island Kingdom of Sicily merged with the Kingdom of Naples to form the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. In 1861 the Two Sicilies were amalgamated with Sardinia and several northern city-states and duchies to form the Kingdom of Italy.|$|E

5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was <b>often</b> <b>the</b> target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A large body of literature {{has been written about}} Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} twenty-eight Treehouse of Horror episodes, with one airing every year. They {{are known for}} being more violent than an average Simpsons episode and contain several {{different}} trademarks, including the alien characters Kang and Kodos who have appeared in every episode. Quite <b>often</b> <b>the</b> segments will parody well-known movies, books, radio shows, and television shows. The Twilight Zone has been parodied quite often, and {{has served as the}} inspiration for numerous segments.|$|E
5|$|Between the 13th and 15th centuries Magna Carta was {{reconfirmed}} 32 times {{according to}} Sir Edward Coke, and possibly {{as many as}} 45 times. <b>Often</b> <b>the</b> first item of parliamentary business was a public reading and reaffirmation of the Charter, and, {{as in the previous}} century, parliaments often exacted confirmation of it from the monarch. The Charter was confirmed in 1423 by King Henry VI.|$|E

5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. <b>Often,</b> <b>the</b> impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.|$|E
5|$|Book of the Dead papyri were <b>often</b> <b>the</b> work {{of several}} {{different}} scribes and artists whose work was literally pasted together. It is usually {{possible to identify}} the style {{of more than one}} scribe used on a given manuscript, even when the manuscript is a shorter one. The text and illustrations were produced by different scribes; {{there are a number of}} Books where the text was completed but the illustrations were left empty.|$|E
5|$|By 1903 {{the synagogue}} was well {{established}} on Rivington Street, and, {{due to its}} capacity and prominence, was <b>often</b> <b>the</b> site of significant or mass meetings. In April 1903 a service to honor the memory of Reform rabbi and Zionist leader Gustav Gottheil was held there, and a similar service was held for Theodore Herzl the following year. At the latter service, which was boycotted by Orthodox rabbis, Herzl was not eulogized, nor was his name mentioned.|$|E

5|$|By 1934, the {{executive}} branch consisted of sixty-nine boards, commissions, and agencies {{in addition to the}} constitutional officers, although the members of these commissions were <b>often</b> <b>the</b> constitutional officers themselves. Governor Ruby Laffoon proposed the Administrative Reorganization Act of 1934 to organize these boards and commissions into seventeen executive departments and seven independent agencies. The General Assembly passed this legislation, giving {{the executive}} branch some semblance of structure for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Car/SUV – Used {{either as}} a fly-car for rapid {{response}} or for patients who can sit, these are standard car models adapted {{to the requirements of}} the service using them. Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position.|$|E
5|$|Casting metalware in Chamba is {{an ancient}} tradition, {{dating back to the}} Bronze Age period, with items {{typically}} made out of copper or brass, and also iron, especially in the traditional making of implements and weapons by blacksmiths. Of particular note in this trade are the large plaques with reliefs, commonly used for wall decoration. The temple cupolas in Chamba district are often furnished with copper and brass items made in Chamba and <b>often</b> <b>the</b> golden kalasha or vessel crowning them is produced here.|$|E
50|$|British English <b>often</b> uses <b>the</b> single {{quotation}} mark where American English {{would use the}} double {{quotation mark}}. Thus American style treats the double as the root or default, and alternates to single when nesting, whereas British style <b>often</b> does <b>the</b> reverse.|$|R
50|$|Several {{early modern}} writers, {{including}} Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680) and Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772), hypothesized contact with Mars. Early science fiction about Mars <b>often</b> involved <b>the</b> first voyages to the planet, sometimes as an invasion force, more <b>often</b> for <b>the</b> purposes of exploration.|$|R
2500|$|The {{simplest}} case of Zipf's {{law is a}} [...] "1⁄f function." [...] Given a set of Zipfian distributed frequencies, sorted {{from most}} common to least common, {{the second most common}} frequency will occur ½ as <b>often</b> as <b>the</b> first. [...] The third most common frequency will occur ⅓ as <b>often</b> as <b>the</b> first. The fourth most common frequency will occur ¼ as <b>often</b> as <b>the</b> first. The nth most common frequency will occur 1⁄n as <b>often</b> as <b>the</b> first. However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.|$|R
5|$|Concordant rites exist {{with the}} blessing and <b>often</b> <b>the</b> active support of regular masonic lodges. There are several {{concordant}} bodies in the United States which admit the wives and female relatives of Freemasons. The Dutch Order of Weavers admits only the wives, while in the American orders {{the men and women}} share in the ritual. Like the lodges of adoption, they have their own ceremonies, which means that some grand lodges view them as irregular.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is <b>often</b> <b>the</b> people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|Diamante Azul's {{real name}} {{is not a matter}} of public record, as is <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans.

60|$|There is {{no doubt}} of the fact as to a {{temporary}} effect; and camphire is therefore a strong and immediate antidote to an overdose of 'cantharides'. Yet there are, doubtless, sorts and cases of [Greek: anaphrodisia], which camphire might relieve. Opium is occasionally an aphrodisiac, but far <b>oftener</b> <b>the</b> contrary. The {{same is true of}} 'bang', or powdered hemp leaves, and, I suppose, of the whole tribe of narcotic stimulants.|$|R
