Azaria previously owned the fifth-floor co-op loft at 84 Mercer Street in Manhattan's Soho neighborhood, which he bought in 2005 from photographer Cindy Sherman, before selling it in 2013.|$|E

The survey has been criticised as suffering from a poor response rate and therefore open to bias, though this issue has been recognised and rationalised by the report's authors.|$|E

5|$|When {{a member}} of the family died there were varying degrees of prostration and display of piety amongst family members, each one {{behaving}} differently according to the custom of kinship association with the deceased. There was to be no flashy or colorful attire while in the period of mourning, and proper funerary rituals were observed such as cleansing and clothing the deceased to rid him or her of impurities. This was one of the necessary steps in the observance of the deceased as one of the worshipped ancestors, which in turn raised the prestige of the family. Funerals were often expensive. A geomancer had to be consulted <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> bury the dead, caterers were hired to furnish the funeral banquet, and there was always the purchase of the coffin, which was burned along with paper images of horses, carriages, and servants in order for them to accompany the deceased into the next life. Due to the high cost of burial, most families opted for the cheaper practice of cremation. This was frowned upon by Confucian officials due to beliefs in the ancestral cult. They sought to ban the practice with prohibitions in 963 and 972; despite this, cremation amongst the poor and middle classes persisted. By the 12th century, the government came up with the solution of installing public cemeteries where a family's deceased could be buried on state owned property.|$|E

Below Battery Street, this study considers the neighborhood to extend inland to First Avenue. Above Battery Street, they consider the neighborhood to extend only to Elliott Avenue, taking in facilities such as the World Trade Center. The southern cutoff at Columbia Street completely excludes the Pioneer Square neighborhood, while the extension inland to First Avenue means that they consider the former warehouse district along Western Avenue and the entire Pike Place Market Historical District as part of the Central Waterfront.|$|E
25|$|Kademlia is a {{distributed}} {{hash table}} for decentralized peer-to-peer computer networks designed by Petar Maymounkov and David Mazières in 2002. It specifies {{the structure of}} the network and the exchange of information through node lookups. Kademlia nodes communicate among themselves using UDP. A virtual or overlay network is formed by the participant nodes. Each node is identified by a number or node ID. The node ID serves not only as identification, but the Kademlia algorithm uses the node ID to locate values (usually file hashes or keywords). In fact, the node ID provides a direct map to file hashes and that node stores information <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> obtain the file or resource.|$|E
25|$|According to NYC Parks {{spokeswoman}} Vickie Karp, {{the city}} was looking to relocate The Sphere in summer 2012, when construction began to restore Battery Park’s lawn, requiring the sculpture to be moved. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), which owns The Sphere, considered placing the sculpture in Liberty Park, located between the 90 West Street building and the World Trade Center Memorial site. Liberty Park wasn't to be constructed until at least 2014, so a location was needed to place The Sphere until Liberty Park was completed. By February 2011, PANYNJ had not made an official final decision <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> place the sculpture once Battery Park construction commences, forcing the sculpture to move, possibly into storage.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} half of season five, Walt, Jesse and Mike {{eliminate}} their connection to the destroyed lab, and start a new meth production system with a corrupt pest control company, using residents' homes to cook meth while they are fumigated. They are aided by Lydia Rodarte-Quayle (Laura Fraser), a representative for the conglomerate that owned Gus's franchise. Lydia leaks them information <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> obtain the required chemicals and in return wants some of the meth to sell to the Czech Republic. A young boy sees them during one robbery, and Todd Alquist (Jesse Plemons), one of the pest control workers, kills him. Horrified, Jesse and Mike leave the business once they obtain their money from the last meth batch. When Walt learns Hank has connected the blue meth to Mike, he contacts Todd's uncle Jack (Michael Bowen), a criminal with ties to the Aryan Brotherhood, to kill nine of Mike's associates simultaneously to defer suspicion; Walt kills Mike personally. After a few months, Walt has earned more than $80 million from meth, and Skyler convinces him to stop.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after, the {{government}} of New York City {{made a series of}} decisions announcing its intent to acquire ownership of the ferry. The Sinking Fund Commission decided in 1903 that the city could acquire the Staten Island ferry route in 1903. The city would pay $3.2 million to take over operations of the ferry, including $2 million for five new screw-propelled ships. From 1902 to 1903, there were debates <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> put the new Whitehall terminal; the location at Whitehall Street was decided as the best location. The locations of the Staten Island terminal were also debated, with the terminal proposed to be built in West Brighton, Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Port Richmond. In 1904, after the Staten Island Railway Company refused the city's offer of $500,000 for the two terminals, the city started a process to condemn the land around the terminals. The B's access to the Whitehall Street terminal was revoked on October 25, 1905. The city's Department of Docks and Ferries assumed ownership of the ferry and terminals. A new St. George Terminal was then built by the city for $2,318,720. The city acquired five boats from the B operation. The five new ships, one named for each of the new boroughs, were commissioned and entered service in 1905.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s it {{had become}} clear to the local {{authorities}} that Malmö's interest for football and other sports was becoming too big for Malmö IP to accommodate. Malmö FF in particular had high average attendances year on year, and matches were often sold out. Apart from the issue of growing popularity, the large crowds raised security issues that became apparent in the Scanian derby game between Malmö FF and Helsingborgs IF in 1951—amid considerable commotion in the stands some people were pushed against poles and fences, but nobody was seriously injured. Plans for a new stadium were first drawn up in 1943, when local officials deemed Malmö IP to be too small for major events, but council members differed <b>on</b> <b>where</b> <b>to</b> build the new stadium. The matter was dropped until 1954, when Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup, with matches {{to take place in}} Malmö. The new ground's location was a central issue in the discussion: some suggested a suburban location in Jägersro, to the city's south-east, while others called for a stadium in central Malmö, near the city's main park, Pildammsparken. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954. Malmö Stadion was built on the southern side of Pildammsparken, opposite from the northern site occupied by Malmö IP. Malmö FF and IFK Malmö both moved to Malmö Stadion on its completion in 1958.|$|E
