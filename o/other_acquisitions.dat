5|$|Wholesale {{reform of}} Oxford {{examinations}} {{began in the}} late eighteenth century, proposed by, among others, Brasenose's John Napleton in his pamphlet Considerations on the Public Exercises for the First and Second Degrees in the University of Oxford. It was Cleaver and his successor Frodsham Hodson that would continue the reforms and apply them to Brasenose itself. Cleaver was from the minor gentry and set out from the start to make Brasenose the place of rich men. Unable to secure the librarianship of the Bodleian whilst fellow, he had instead become tutor to his patron George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham – a position which he used to lead two of the Duke's sons {{and other members of the}} family to Brasenose; the sons' uncle, Baron Grenville, became the University's Chancellor. Under his leadership into the early nineteenth century, numbers improved dramatically and so did the class of people coming: Brasenose began to be dominated by gentlemen like the Egertons, the Grenvilles, and of Richard Rainshaw Rothwell I. Its income over doubled between 1790 and 1810 to £9,200 per annum, with the college maintaining its links to the north-west. Among the <b>other</b> <b>acquisitions</b> of Cleaver was the services of Hodson, a Liverpudlian.|$|E

25|$|The 2005–06 NBA {{season began}} with Stoudemire {{undergoing}} microfracture surgery in his knee on October 18, 2005. He missed {{all but three}} games that year. Along with that, shooting guard Joe Johnson demanded a sign-and-trade deal to the Atlanta Hawks, in which the Suns got Boris Diaw along with two future first round picks. <b>Other</b> <b>acquisitions</b> that year included Raja Bell and Kurt Thomas. Despite the turnover in players, the Suns were once again able to win the Pacific going 54–28 and capturing the second seed in the Western Conference. Nash was awarded a second consecutive NBA Most Valuable Player Award, becoming the second point-guard (Magic Johnson was the first) to win the award in consecutive seasons. Also, Diaw was named NBA Most Improved Player.|$|E
25|$|Sargent's {{friends and}} {{supporters}} included Henry James, Isabella Stewart Gardner (who commissioned and purchased works from Sargent, and sought his advice on <b>other</b> <b>acquisitions),</b> Edward VII, and Paul César Helleu. His associations also included Prince Edmond de Polignac and Count Robert de Montesquiou. Other artists Sargent associated with were Dennis Miller Bunker, James Carroll Beckwith, Edwin Austin Abbey and John Elliott (who also {{worked on the}} Boston Public Library murals), Francis David Millet and Claude Monet, whom Sargent painted. Between 1905 and 1914, Sargent's frequent traveling companions were the married artist couple Wilfrid de Glehn and Jane Emmet de Glehn. The trio would often spend summers in France, Spain or Italy and all three would depict one another in their paintings during their travels.|$|E
25|$|The team saw over 15 {{new players}} brought in on both short- and {{long-term}} deals, including Rob Lee, David Connolly, Marlon Harewood, Matthew Etherington, Kevin Horlock, Hayden Mullins, Nigel Reo-Coker, Andy Melville, Bobby Zamora and Brian Deane. The turnover of players continued, however, with these and <b>other</b> <b>acquisitions</b> {{funded by the}} loss of David James, Jermain Defoe and Ian Pearce. The squad was bolstered with a contingent of loan signings such as Wayne Quinn, Neil Mellor, Matthew Kilgallon, Niclas Alexandersson, Robbie Stockdale and Jon Harley. As a result, the team routinely lacked cohesion and without Defoe for a large part lacked a quality striker in front of goal – though Connolly's immediate impact (five in the nine opening league games) and positive attitude coupled with Harewood's form went some way {{to make up for the}} loss of the future England international.|$|E

25|$|After {{peace was}} {{concluded}} with the emperor-elect, Savoy was deprived of Payerne and Gümmenen, the protectorates of Morat and Bern, and the dower lands of Louis's aunt Margaret (died 1273), wife of Hartmann the Old, Count of Kyburg. All these losses would {{significantly reduce the}} sphere of influence of whichever Savoyard prince ruled the Vaud. By the peace treaty, Moudon and the important castle of Romont would remain fiefs of the Count of Savoy. Both these places had been acquired by Savoy under Thomas I, and only the acquisitions in the region made by Peter II before he became count were left to Louis. In accordance with this principle, Peter's <b>other</b> <b>acquisitions</b> in the pays de Gex and the Genevois were ceded to Amadeus. This seems to have sparked another grievance from Louis. In March 1284, he and Amadeus met at Lyon in order for Margaret and Robert II, Duke of Burgundy, to mediate their conflict. The brothers swore not to make any private alliances {{with the goal of}} furthering their claims on the succession. If the mediation of Count Philip or Queen Margaret failed to appease both parties, then they swore to abide by the judgement of Duke Robert.|$|E

He commissioned Sir George Gilbert Scott, a friend and regular guest at Denbies, to design an estate church on Ranmore Common. Completed in 1859, it was named after St Barnabas. Ashcombe also ensured that the basic medical needs of his workers were attended to, by having a cottage built {{to serve as a}} dispensary and a place for physicians from the nearby towns to hold twice-weekly surgeries. The cottage was also the venue for a domestic training school where the daughters of his workers received a year of education in the rudiments of domestic service before either being employed in his household or those of other country houses.|$|E

Kikukawa dismissed the article as [...] "tabloid, sensationalist journalism". Upon learning about a second article referring to payments by Olympus to [...] "anti-social forces", a euphemism for yakuza (Japanese criminal organizations), The Japan Times notes that from the start, Facta remained the lone Japanese journal to scoop the Olympus accounting irregularities until the scandal broke in Western media sources after Woodford exposed the matter. Woodford began to write a series of six letters to Mori and/or Kikukawa regarding his concerns as to governance issues [...] "relating to the company's M (acquisitions) activities".

60|$|Our {{readers may}} {{recollect}} a certain smooth-tongued, lank-haired, buckram-suited, Scottish scrivener, who, {{in the earlier}} part of this history, appeared {{in the character of}} a protege of George Heriot. It is to his house we are about to remove, but times have changed with him. The petty booth hath become a chamber of importance--the buckram suit is changed into black velvet; and although the wearer retains his puritanical humility and politeness to clients of consequence, he can now look others broad in the face, and treat them with a full allowance of superior opulence, and the insolence arising from it. It was but a short period that had achieved these alterations, nor was the party himself as yet entirely accustomed to them, but the change was becoming less embarrassing to him with every day's practice. Among <b>other</b> <b>acquisitions</b> of wealth, you may see one of Davy Ramsay's best timepieces on the table, and his eye is frequently observing its revolutions, while a boy, whom he employs as a scribe, is occasionally sent out to compare its progress with the clock of Saint Dunstan.|$|E
