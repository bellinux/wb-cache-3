5|$|Allen {{appeared}} before the Continental Congress as early as September 1778 on behalf <b>of</b> <b>Vermont,</b> seeking recognition as an independent state.

Between 1780 and 1783 Allen participated, along with his brother Ira, Vermont Governor Thomas Chittenden, and others, in negotiations with Frederick Haldimand, the governor of Quebec, that were ostensibly about prisoner exchanges, but were really about establishing Vermont as a new British province and gaining military protection for its residents. The negotiations, once details of them were published, were often described by opponents <b>of</b> <b>Vermont</b> statehood as treasonous, but no such formal charges were ever laid against anyone involved.|$|E
