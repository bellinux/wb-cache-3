5|$|In the 19th century, a politico-economic {{discourse}} emerged. It concerned {{itself with}} distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying {{the place of}} Greek slavery. The influence <b>of</b> <b>Marx</b> is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery {{as a mode of}} production. The Positivists represented by the historian Eduard Meyer (Slavery in Antiquity, 1898) were soon to oppose the Marxist theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomenon, and not economic.|$|E
5|$|Marx's {{ideas have}} had a {{profound}} impact on world politics and intellectual thought. Followers <b>of</b> <b>Marx</b> have frequently debated amongst themselves over how to interpret Marx's writings and apply his concepts to the modern world. The legacy of Marx's thought has become contested between numerous tendencies, each of which sees itself as Marx's most accurate interpreter. In the political realm, these tendencies include Leninism, Marxism–Leninism, Trotskyism, Maoism, Luxemburgism and libertarian Marxism. Various currents have also developed in academic Marxism, often under influence of other views, resulting in structuralist Marxism, historical Marxism, phenomenological Marxism, analytical Marxism and Hegelian Marxism.|$|E

5|$|In {{this book}} I {{maintained}} that a sphere of freedom is still desirable {{even in a}} socialist state, but this sphere has to be defined afresh and not in liberal terms. This doctrine I still hold. The thesis of this book seems to me important, and I hoped that it would attract more attention than it has done. It {{was intended as a}} refutation both <b>of</b> <b>Marx</b> and of the classical economists, not on a point of detail, but on the fundamental assumptions that they shared. I argued that power, rather than wealth, should be the basic concept in social theory, and that social justice should consist in equalisation of power to the greatest practicable degree. It followed that State ownership of land and capital was no advance unless the State was democratic, and even then only if methods were devised for curbing the power of officials. A part of my thesis was taken up and popularised in Burnham's Managerial Revolution, but otherwise the book fell rather flat. I still hold, however, that what it has to say is of very great importance if the evils of totalitarianism are to be avoided, particularly under a Socialist régime.|$|E

It demonstrates how the consistency <b>of</b> <b>Marx’s</b> logic emerges on the basis of a temporal interpretation <b>of</b> <b>Marx’s</b> value theory.

25|$|There are {{views of}} Hegel's thought as a {{representation}} of the summit of early 19th-century Germany's movement of philosophical idealism.

25|$|Much {{sophisticated}} and important thought {{has taken place}} after the writing <b>of</b> <b>Marx</b> and Engels; much or perhaps even all {{of it has been}} influenced, subtly or overtly, by Marxism.

50|$|Bawerk {{provides}} a critique <b>of</b> <b>Marx's</b> Capital.

He maintains that since the law of value is not directly controlling in capitalist production, the theory of value must be abandoned. Bawerk also attacks Marx for downplaying the influence of supply and demand in determining permanent price, and for deliberate ambiguity with such concepts.|$|R

25|$|Religion is {{the opium}} of the people: this saying <b>of</b> <b>Marx</b> is the {{cornerstone}} of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion.
