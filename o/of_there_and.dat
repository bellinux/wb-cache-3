We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished.

500|$|Idlewild South was the band's first {{effort with}} Tom Dowd, {{known for his}} work with Cream and John Coltrane. Dowd first heard the band rehearsing while visiting Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, asking their name and {{remarking}} to Walden, [...] "Get them the hell out <b>of</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> give them {{to me in the}} studio. They don't need to rehearse; they're ready to record". Dowd was initially scheduled to work with the band on their debut album but was called away at the last minute. Initially, the band had asked friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin to produce their second album, but as recording inched closer, it became obvious they wanted him to co-produce with Dowd. In one of their first sessions, Sandlin was giving suggestions and acting as a co-producer, though no one had informed Dowd; Sandlin was embarrassed and did not return to the studio.|$|E
500|$|Upon leaving Ladysmith, US8 {{passes through}} the {{communities}} of Tony, Glen Flora, Ingram (where it meets the northern terminus of WIS73) and Hawkins on {{its way out of}} Rusk County. In Price County, US8 passes through Kennan and Catawba. WIS111 terminates at its south end on US8 just east of Catawba. US8 meets WIS13 at a diamond interchange northwest of Prentice and passes north of the city. The highway passes through Brantwood and enters Lincoln County at Clifford. Further east, [...] US8 crosses Tripoli and McCord and runs north of Tomahawk as it {{passes through the}} Lake Nokomis area. US51 crosses US8 northeast of Tomahawk. US8 turns northeast into Oneida County and onto a twisting northeasterly alignment. The highway passes through Woodboro and expands to a divided highway into Rhinelander. It merges with WIS47 on the southwest side of Rhinelander. WIS17 north joins the highways [...] to the southeast, creating a wrong-way concurrency with WIS47; along this section of highway, eastbound US8 is also southbound WIS47 and northbound WIS17 and vice versa. WIS17 turns to the north [...] southeast <b>of</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> US8 and WIS47 head eastbound out of the Rhinelander area.|$|E

500|$|One {{scene that}} {{was cut from}} the film {{occurred}} during Ripley's final escape from the Nostromo: she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially cocooned by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was becoming an alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger. Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had [...] "become sort of food for the alien creature", while Ivor Powell suggested that [...] "Dallas {{is found in the}} ship as an egg, still alive." [...] Scott remarked that [...] "they're morphing, metamorphosing, they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg." [...] The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough, but also because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence. Tom Skerritt remarked that [...] "The picture had to have that pace. Her trying {{to get the hell out}} of there, we're all rooting for her to get out <b>of</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> for her to slow up and have a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate." [...] The footage was included with other deleted scenes as a special feature on the Laserdisc release of Alien, and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 Director's Cut which was re-released in theaters and on DVD.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{employed}} a fanciful translation of [...] to imagine God's {{response to the}} Israelites' complaints in the wilderness. The Midrash taught that God asked the Israelites whether when a mortal king went into the wilderness, the king found there the same ease, the same food, or the same drink that he enjoyed in his own palace. The Midrash taught that the Israelites, however, were slaves in Egypt, and God brought them out <b>of</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> caused them to recline on lordly couches. In support of this, the Midrash reread [...] "But God led the people about, ( [...] , vayaseiv) by {{the way of the}} wilderness," [...] reading , vayaseiv, to mean God caused them [...] "to recline" [...] (using the same root , svv) in the manner of kings reclining upon their couches.|$|E

2500|$|... 2016: Hamlin took {{command of}} the field and moved ahead of the No. 2 car. Eventually, Keselowski moved by him coming to the line and took the lead on lap 34. Hamlin shot ahead of Keselowski on the backstretch to take the lead back the next lap. Keselowski used a push from {{teammate}} Joey Logano to retake the lead on lap 37. Just like his first stint in the lead, he picked up another piece of debris that covered his grill. The third caution of the race flew on lap 44 for a single-car spin on the backstretch. Going down the backstretch, Johnson made contact with Mears that sent him spinning through the grass. His car dug into the ground and ripped off the front fender. He said afterwards that he [...] "did a decent job of backing out <b>of</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> not causing a big one as the door shut on me." [...] Keselowski opted to stay out {{while the rest of the}} field opted to pit, The race restarted with two laps to go in overtime, The field passed the overtime line and the race was official at that point.

[...] Mr. Glascock said that he was living between Naples and Florence,--going {{occasionally}} to Naples, a place that he hated, to see his father, and coming back at intervals to the capital. Nora sat by, and hardly spoke a word. She was nicely dressed, with an exquisite little bonnet, which had been bought as they came through Paris; and Lady Rowley, with natural pride, felt that if he was ever in love with her child, that love must come back upon him now. American girls, she had been told, were hard, and dry, and sharp, and angular. She had seen some at the Mandarins, with whom she thought it must be impossible that any Englishman should be in love. There never, surely, had been an American girl like her Nora. [...] "Are you fond of pictures, Mr. Glascock?" [...] she asked. Mr. Glascock was not very fond of pictures, and thought that he was rather tired of them. What was he fond of? Of sitting at home and doing nothing. That was his reply, at least; and a very unsatisfactory reply it was, as Lady Rowley could hardly propose that they should come and sit and do nothing with him. Could he have been lured into churches or galleries, Nora might have been once more thrown into his company. Then Lady Rowley took courage, and asked him whether he knew the Spaldings. They were going to Mrs. Spalding's that very evening,--she and her daughters. Mr. Glascock replied that he did know the Spaldings, and that he also should be at their house. Lady Rowley thought that she discovered something like a blush about his cheekbones and brow, as he made his answer. Then he left them, giving his hand to Nora as he went;--but there was nothing in his manner to justify the slightest hope.|$|E
