40|$|Hot mixed asphalt {{concrete}} {{is a composite}} material of aggregate particles of crushed rock of different sizes, glued together with an asphalt binder, which is much softer than the aggregate. The term <b>open</b> <b>graded</b> is used since the percentage of air voids in it, are more than 20 %, which {{is much higher than}} that in the normal {{asphalt concrete}} mixes. These mixes are used as a crack relief layer for mitigation of reflection cracking on asphalt concrete overlays. Bailey Method for gradation selection (Vavrik et al. 2002) is used for deciding aggregate gradation, because the method advocates a strong aggregate skeleton for rut resistance along with adequate voids in mineral aggregate for good durability.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 30 th Annual Southern African Transport Conference 11 - 14 July 2011 "Africa on the Move", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Noise {{is defined as a}} loud sound of any sort that is disagreeable or unwanted. Throughout the ages of civilized history, noise has been an annoying irritant to mankind. In recent years the noise level of freeways in urban and suburban areas in the United States has increased perceptibly as freeway traffic has increased and more people are living closer to freeways. To reduce such a noisy irritant generated by traffic on concrete or asphalt pavements Arizona has employed either a 12. 5 or 25 mm asphalt-rubber <b>open</b> <b>graded</b> friction course hot mix surfacing. This paper reviews the experience and research in Arizona and California with using asphalt-rubber <b>open</b> <b>graded</b> friction course pavements to reduce the noise by 3 - 12 decibels. These findings have led to Arizona developing a large scale program of covering over 2000 lane kilometers of concrete pavement with a 25 mm asphalt-rubber <b>open</b> <b>graded</b> friction hot mix surface course to substantially reduce noise. This program started in 2002 and is referred to in Arizona as the Quiet Pavements Program and has been very successful. In addition Texas has noted an improvement in safety due to the use of <b>open</b> <b>graded</b> permeable surface courses.

40|$|The {{presence}} of free {{water on the}} pavement surface exerts critical effects on the stability of vehicles, thus increasing the risk of expected accidents. <b>Open</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures {{are considered to be}} potentially effective solutions to avoid these types of risk on pavement. One of the most important factors affecting the safety of pavement is the ability of <b>open</b> <b>graded</b> mixtures to prevent water from remaining within the pavement itself. This ability is strongly related to the permeability. Traditionally, an empirical approach is followed to identify the pavement permeability, but {{it is very difficult to}} predict because it is a function of many variables. In this case, the main consequence is to obtain overestimated values of the hydraulic permeability. In this paper, a new method for the prediction of the Darcy hydraulic permeability of pavement is presented, through numerical simulation processes. The model integrates two modules, one for the simulation of the physical micro-structure of the mixture, and one simulating the fluid flow in <b>open</b> <b>graded</b> mixes on the basis of the Lattice– Boltzmann method (LB). The reliability of the simulation model is both verified through experimental tests and analytical predictions. This full numerical method allows to predict pavement permeability of open-graded pavement in order to optimize the mix design, to effectively manage economical resources and to prevent the risk of accidents in rainfall events...|$|E

Much of the reduction in service life was due to two early failing Modified Class D HMA projects on I- 90.

40|$|Wet pavement-related {{collisions}} {{represent a}} significant traffic safety concern, {{due in part}} to the lack of adequate friction between tire and pavement, known as skid resistance. State agencies employ a skid number (SN) system, based on a standard test procedure in which a locked wheel is towed at 40 mph and the skid number (SN 40) is calculated from the measured resistance. SN 40 is used as a reference value for speeds both greater than and less than 40 mph. For most Departments of Transportation (DOTs) in the nation, excluding California, pavements for which the SN 40 is below 30 are deemed unacceptable and corrective actions are required.
