He {{was known for}} his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> agility.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{dissolution}} of the court in 1597, the musical style which was inspired by the concerto delle donne spread throughout Europe, and remained prominent for almost fifty years. The concerto delle donne was so influential and often imitated that it became a clich√© of northern Italian courts. The concerto brought Alfonso and his court international prestige, as the ladies' reputation spread throughout Italy and southern Germany. It functioned as a powerful tool of propaganda, projecting an image <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> affluence.|$|E

5|$|The General and {{his entourage}} arrive {{at the port of}} Mompox. Here they are stopped by police, who fail to {{recognize}} the General. They ask for his passport, but he is unable to produce one. Eventually, the police discover his identity and escort him into the port. The people still believe him to be the President of Gran Colombia and prepare banquets in his honor; but these festivities are wasted on him due to his lack <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> appetite.

5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E
5|$|As Lucas' {{business}} prospers, {{he makes}} a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the Fight of the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.|$|E

5|$|By 1420, James's {{standing}} at Henry V's court improved greatly; he {{ceased to be}} regarded as a hostage and more of a guest. James's value to Henry became apparent in 1420 when he accompanied the English king to France where his presence was used against the Scots fighting on the Dauphinist side. Following the English success at the siege of Melun, a town southeast of Paris, the contingent of Scots were hanged for treason against their king. James attended Catherine of Valois's coronation on 23 February 1421 and was honoured by sitting immediately on the queen's left at the coronation banquet. In March, Henry began a circuit of the important towns in England as a show <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> it was during this tour that James was knighted on Saint George's day. By July, the two kings were back campaigning in France where James, evidently approving of Henry's methods of kingship, seemed content to endorse the English king's desire for the French crown. Henry appointed the Duke of Bedford and James as the joint commanders of the siege of Dreux on 18 July 1421 and on 20 August they received the surrender of the garrison. Henry died of dysentery on 31 August 1422 and in September James was part of the escort taking the English king's body back to London.|$|E

5|$|On 13 December, after a British {{merchant}} vessel had been boarded and its crew briefly arrested, the British demanded an apology, {{and failing to}} receive it, launched a bombardment of Venezuelan forts at Puerto Cabello, assisted by the German SMS Vineta. The same day, London and Berlin received from Washington a request forwarded from Castro to submit the dispute to arbitration, which neither Power relished, because of concerns over enforceability of any settlement. In addition, Castro's offer initially covered only claims arising from the 1898 civil war, and {{made no mention of}} other claims. Germany believed that these claims should not be subject to arbitration, but London was more willing to agree, accepting arbitration in principle, and suggested a compromise.The threat of arbitration made London move to the next stage in order to negotiate from a position <b>of</b> <b>strength,</b> <b>and</b> 20 December was set for the begin of the official blockade. As a result of a combination of communications issues and practical delays, the British notice of an official blockade was published on 20 December, but the German blockade of Puerto Cabello was only effected on 22 December, and on Maracaibo on 24 December.|$|E

The shoulders and croup are sloping, with a relatively high-set tail. Overall, the breed gives the impression <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> agility. Their heavy and wavy mane and tail, arched necks and finely boned heads are all reminiscent of Andalusian and Barb ancestry. Their trot is described as flashy. They are hardy horses and easy keepers. Today, most Canadian horses are used as riding and driving horses, and {{are known for their}} jumping ability. They are seen in competition in almost every discipline, as well as for leisure riding. They can also be found in light draft work, trail riding, and working as a stock horse.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Artillery Monument {{attempted}} {{a very different}} effect. Jagger takes a realist approach to his figures, embracing detailed images of military power {{with none of the}} classical symbolism of other monuments, or even Jagger's own pre-war pieces. The art historian Reginald Wilenski likens the memorial to the work of Frank Brangwyn, who focused on depicting the physical labour of soldiers and workers during the war. The memorial shows the three upright bronze figures stood at ease, rather than to attention; the driver even leans back against the parapet, his cape hanging over his outstretched arms, suggesting an attitude of exhaustion or contemplation. The faceless, heavily laden statue of the fallen soldier appears less at rest than tired, pulled down as if by a great weight. At the same time, the sheer size of the memorial, including the oversized gun and the larger-than-life bronze figures, exudes a sense <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> power; the figures are stocky, confident and imposing. This strength and power contributes to the sense of masculinity that pervades the work, from the phallic image of the howitzer, to the solid, muscular figures of the gunners.|$|E
5|$|The author {{noted that}} the {{character}} of Lavi was popular with fans, placing third in a poll (behind Allen and Kanda) despite infrequent appearances in later story arcs, and she promised that Lavi would return. The story arc involving Alma Karma, featuring several characters, was difficult for the author; as a result, the next arc in which Allen leaves the Black Order contained fewer characters per chapter due to its different format. The character of Apocryphos was introduced to hint at the Heart, a plot element briefly described in a past storyline which would later reappear. Due to Jump Square (the manga's magazine at the time) readership‚Äîolder men, rather than children‚ÄîHoshino found Allen the most difficult character to write. She does not want Allen's problems in recent story arcs to lead to portraying him as a troubled teenager, preferring to show him as a cheerful person with a balance <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> sorrow. After D.Gray-man dark narrative, Hoshino plans to write more lighthearted series in the future.|$|E

To design a model <b>of</b> goaltender's <b>strength,</b> speed <b>and</b> coordination training and to find suitable methods, means and forms of the stimulation <b>of</b> <b>strength,</b> speed <b>and</b> coordination abilities focused on youth teams and older goaltenders. Method: Qualitative analysis of document contents was used to identify the main theoretical basis of stimulation <b>of</b> goaltenders <b>strength,</b> speed <b>and</b> coordination abilities. Determiners <b>of</b> goaltenders' <b>strength,</b> speed <b>and</b> coordination development were described {{on the basis of}} deeper analysis.

5|$|While {{heavy metal}} {{throughout}} its history has referenced the occult, Viking metal bands use {{a very specific}} mythology, which informs their textual choices, album imagery, and, frequently, musical compositions. Despite a whole pantheon of Norse gods to choose from, Viking metal bands typically focus on Odin, the god of war, and on Thor and his hammer. Alcohol, particularly mead, is also a common lyrical focus. Viking metal bands tend to follow one of two approaches. The first is one of romanticism and escapist ideas, where bands cultivate an image <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> <b>and</b> barbarism and quote passages from various poems and sagas. The second approach emphasizes historical accuracy, typically relying on Norse mythology as the sole focus of lyricism and identity. Many Viking metal bands identify first with local roots‚Äì for instance, Moonsorrow with Finland or Einherjer with Norway‚Äì with a wider northern European identity coming second.|$|E
