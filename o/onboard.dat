40|$|Background: Recruitment and <b>onboarding</b> of {{software}} developers are essential steps in software development undertakings. The need for adding new people is {{often associated with}} large-scale long-living projects and globally distributed projects. The formers are challenging because they may contain large amounts of legacy (and often complex) code (legacy projects). The latters are challenging, because the inability to find sufficient resources in-house may lead to <b>onboarding</b> people at a distance, and often in many distinct sites. While <b>onboarding</b> is of great importance for companies, there is little research about the challenges and implications associated with <b>onboarding</b> software developers and teams in large-scale globally distributed projects with large amounts of legacy code. Furthermore, no study has proposed any systematic approaches to support the design of <b>onboarding</b> strategies and evaluation of <b>onboarding</b> results in the aforementioned context. Objective: The aim of this thesis is two-fold: i) identify the challenges and implications associated with <b>onboarding</b> software developers and teams in large-scale globally distributed legacy projects; and ii) propose solutions to support the design of <b>onboarding</b> strategies and evaluation of <b>onboarding</b> results in large-scale globally distributed legacy projects. Method: In this thesis, we employed literature review, case study, and business process modeling. The main case investigated in this thesis is the development of a legacy telecommunication software product in Ericsson. Results: The results show that the performance (productivity, autonomy, and lead time) of new developers/teams <b>onboarded</b> in remote locations in large-scale distributed legacy projects is much lower than the performance of mature teams. This suggests that new teams have a considerable performance gap to overcome. Furthermore, we learned that <b>onboarding</b> problems can be amplified by the following challenges: the complexity of the product and technology stack, distance to the main source of product knowledge, lack of team stability, training expectation misalignment, and lack of formalism and control over <b>onboarding</b> strategies employed in different sites of globally distributed projects. To help companies addressing the challenges we identified in this thesis, we propose a process to support the design of <b>onboarding</b> strategies and the evaluation of <b>onboarding</b> results. Conclusions: The results show that scale, distribution and complex legacy code may make <b>onboarding</b> more difficult and demand longer periods of time for new developers and teams to achieve high performance. This means that <b>onboarding</b> in large-scale globally distributed legacy projects must be planned well ahead and companies must be prepared to provide extended periods of mentoring by expensive and scarce resources, such as software architects. Failure to foresee and plan such resources may result in effort estimates on one hand, and unavailability of mentors on another, if not planned in advance. The process put forward herein can help companies to deal with the aforementioned problems through more systematic, effective and repeatable <b>onboarding</b> strategies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examines}} <b>onboarding</b> from an organisational change perspective (Armenakis & Bedeian, 1999). The barriers and enablers encountered in an <b>onboarding</b> change {{program will be}} examined, compared and contrasted to highlight the particular challenges of successful implementation. Theoretical insights for both <b>onboarding</b> and organisational change are anticipated from this study. Originality: <b>Onboarding</b> (Snell, 2006) {{is a relatively new}} term which we define as the period from the letter of offer to the new recruit up until the new recruit’s full productivity. While extensive work has been done in this sphere it is from a purely commercial perspective, that of a consultant implementing <b>onboarding</b> within organisations, very little academic research has been undertaken. Key literature /theoretical perspective: All organisations engage in some form of induction activities. Many firms appear to have induction processes that are inefficient and lack rigour. Some organisations, however, demonstrate superior induction activities, known as <b>onboarding</b> (Snell, 2006). <b>Onboarding</b> encompasses many diverse functions within the organisation. This diversity creates complexities for whole-of-organisation change (Armenakis & Bedeian, 1999). Design/Methodology approach: A case study approach (Yin, 1989) will be used to examine a number of organisations across a range of industries. Findings: The cases reflect different stages of implementation of the <b>onboarding</b> change project, ranging from approval stages to those already completed and in use. These cases will illuminate the issues regarding change management. This presentation will discuss initial ideas for the study and report the results for the pilot case study already in progress. Research limitations/implications: This research is only focussing on the employer perspective in respect to change management and <b>onboarding.</b> Practical and social implications: As so little research has been undertaken in this area, the findings will assist organisations to implement <b>onboarding</b> programs that are more aware of the change management processes that must be considered upon implementation. 2 page(s...|$|R

The study aims to discover what aspects of <b>onboarding</b> play a critical role. Theory: <b>Onboarding,</b> or organizational socialization, is a branch of socialization theory that seeks to explain the ways in which new employees acquire the skills, knowledge and dispositions required to become effective members of a workplace environment. Therefore, the authors primarily use organizational socialization theory. Method: This thesis depended greatly upon primary data. 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted, including new employees, HR professionals, and managers of an automotive engineering company in Sweden. Hence, the thesis is considered as a qualitative research. Result: Despite that the company has an <b>onboarding</b> plan, it is not thoroughly carried out by managers and HR professionals. The lack of cooperation, motivation and resources to fully implement the <b>onboarding</b> plan, caused frustration between HR professionals and managers. Therefore, a number of new employees experienced the <b>onboarding</b> as insufficient. Yet, new employees valued interpersonal connections, such as having a mentor for guidance and supportive colleagues...|$|R

This research methodology is exploratory and it employed both qualitative and quantitative methods in analyzing the findings using questionnaires,focus group, telephone and unstructured interview and SPSS The participants were selected randomly from the ten different sites of Dalkia, and they were divided into two groups of twenty five participants per group for the traditional <b>Onboarding</b> program and blended learning <b>Onboarding</b> program The description of the research design and process explores the differences between the acceleration rates of the socialization process of the traditional and blended learning <b>Onboarding</b> approaches. The measurement {{of the participants in the}} <b>Onboarding</b> session is based on the acceleration rate of socialization and integration into the organization when comparing the blended approach and traditional approach the results indicated that there was significant acceleration rate of socialization and integration process when web 2 0 technology tools were applied in the blended learning <b>Onboarding</b> program than in the traditional <b>onboarding</b> program without the mixture of technology. Future research could employ a larger sample during the corroboration of the results process Further areas of study could explore the opportunity for organizations to employ more learning modalities in the blended learning approach The research closes with a recommendation for organizations to modify the <b>Onboarding</b> program to increase the socialization and integration based on the result of the study...|$|R
