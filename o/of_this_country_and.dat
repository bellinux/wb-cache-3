The articles of the Constitution touching on the official religion of Islam, the monarchy, the status of Malay as the national language, and Malay special rights were described as [...] "clearly spell out the acknowledgment and recognition that the Malays are the indigenous 'pribumi' [...] of this land."

500|$|In 1934, {{two years}} after his wife Margaret's death from cancer, Davies married Sephora Davies, a schoolteacher from Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen in Carmarthenshire who shared Davies's {{political}} outlook. The couple lived at Gwynfryn Park Terrace in Merthyr Tydfil, and had two sons. In November 1936, having been returned in the 1935 general election with an increased majority, Davies ridiculed the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, for his refusal to meet a delegation from the National Unemployed Workers' Movement's 1936 Hunger March, which included a large contingent from South Wales: [...] "A bigger man would meet these people who have tramped the roads <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> would show that he had sympathy with them". In 1938, having modified his earlier position, Davies supported a bill introduced by the Labour opposition for the nationalisation of the coal industry. Miners worked, he said, in intolerable conditions to ensure that cheap raw material was available to industry. Reasonable wages and working conditions would never be granted by private coal-owners. The bill was defeated.|$|E
500|$|As Europe moved towards war in {{the late}} 1930s, Davies opposed the {{appeasement}} policies of the Chamberlain government. He doubted {{the will of the}} British ruling classes to wage a determined war against fascism, and called for a workers' [...] "Popular Front" [...] of resistance to the dictators. After the outbreak of war in September 1939 Davies demanded from the British government [...] "a more specific and detailed statement" [...] of war aims, to allay [...] "suspicions... as to the real and possibly as yet unstated war aims <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> of France". He criticised Labour's decision in May 1940 to join Churchill's wartime coalition government, and thereafter opposed many of the coalition's domestic policies, such as indiscriminate internment of aliens, restrictions on industrial action, and the suppression of the communist newspaper the Daily Worker. The bitterness of Davies's personal attack on Herbert Morrison, the Home Secretary who had authorised the paper's closure, shocked even the British Communist Party's general secretary, Harry Pollitt, who cautioned Davies that [...] "personal abuse has been our stock-in-trade for twenty years and has got us nowhere".|$|E

2500|$|By 1610, however, Owen McHugh had {{effectively}} been sidelined by {{his cousin}} as {{master of the}} Fews {{and leader of the}} O'Neill of the Fews.

40|$|The {{objective}} <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{paper is}} to assess if the recent economic evolution <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>countries</b> <b>and</b> their expected developments for the next years {{put them in a}} better or a worst position to join the euro. Using structural VAR models, the results show that shocks are more asymmetric in candidate countries than in current Euro area members and that the situation has worsened in the most recent years. However, it seems that monetary policies in accession countries are closely influenced by monetary conditions in the euro area. If this is the case, then the costs of loosing monetary independence when joining the euro would be reduced. In any case, and taking into account that, in average, correlations are still far away from the values of the Euro area countries, the flexibility of real sector and labour markets will be essential for the sustainability of joining the euro...|$|R
