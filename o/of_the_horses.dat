40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>horse</b> in pre-imperial China {{motivated by}} <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> studies on <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> as an interdisciplinary field. Among archaeological finds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pre-imperial era, <b>horse</b> corpses and horse harnesses {{have been an}} essential part of cultural relics. Documentary sources on <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{can be traced back to}} the earliest Chinese writings. In this dissertation it is suggested that the domestication was a long, staged process, and <b>the</b> transmission route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> from <b>the</b> Urals to China via Central Asia will be proposed. ^ A comprehensive survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> archaeological remains related to <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> in <b>the</b> pre-imperial era constitutes the second main aspect of this dissertation, while documentary sources focusing on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> in civil and military affairs and <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> and human beings. After comparing <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> in China with that in other ancient civilizations, such as Greece, India and Persia, the discussion will end up with a summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contributions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domesticated <b>horse</b> to pre-imperial China. Thousands of miles of roads were constructed for equestrian transport, and politically <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> accelerated <b>the</b> pace <b>of</b> militaristic expansion and consolidation <b>of</b> territory. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> also facilitated agriculture and trade, and thus propelled the society forward into the imperial era. ...|$|R
500|$|Each {{dictator}} {{appointed a}} Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse</b> (magister equitum or Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights), {{to serve as}} his most senior lieutenant. <b>The</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse</b> had constitutional command authority (imperium) equivalent to a praetor, and often, when they authorized <b>the</b> appointment <b>of</b> a dictator, <b>the</b> senate specified who was to be <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse.</b> In many respects, he functioned more as a parallel magistrate (like an inferior co-consul) than he did as a direct subordinate. Whenever a dictator's term ended, <b>the</b> term <b>of</b> his Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse</b> ended as well. Often, the dictator functioned principally as <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> infantry (and thus the legions), while <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse</b> (as <b>the</b> name implies) functioned as <b>the</b> master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cavalry. The dictator, while not elected by the people, was technically a magistrate since he was nominated by an elected consul. <b>The</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Horse</b> was also technically a magistrate, since he was nominated by the dictator. Thus, both of these magistrates were referred to as [...] "Extraordinary Magistrates".|$|R

Vital signs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse</b> {{will also be}} assessed along with an examination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horse’s</b> eyes, teeth and manure.

5|$|The Shortest Way {{with the}} Dissenters; or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church is a {{pamphlet}} consisting of twenty-nine pages. It opens with the fable of the Cock and the Horses.

5|$|The breed {{is popular}} for {{recreational}} and competitive driving, {{to which it}} is well suited in temperament. In 1997, the rules of driving events in France were modified {{to take into account the}} speed of execution of the course, which made lighter, faster horses more competitive. The Norman Cob and the lighter type of Boulonnais were particularly affected. The Norman Cob's gaits, calm temperament and willingness to master technical movements make it an excellent competitor, and in 2011, more than a third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>horses</b> represented in the French driving championships were Norman Cobs. Many Norman Cobs represent France in driving events at the international level.|$|E
