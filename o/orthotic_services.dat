Several studies have investigated user satisfaction with orthoses. Few studies have investigated user satisfaction with orthoses in Taiwan. Therefore, {{the purpose of}} this study was to investigate the user satisfaction with <b>orthotic</b> devices and <b>service</b> using the Taiwanese version of Quebec User Evaluation of Satisfaction with Assistive Technology. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 280 subjects who had used orthoses and received services. The results showed that the mean satisfaction score was 3. 74 for the devices and 3. 56 for service. Concerning the participants, 69. 1 % and 59. 6 % were quite satisfied or very satisfied with their devices and service, respectively. The satisfaction score of <b>orthotic</b> <b>service</b> was lower than that of the devices. Regarding demographic characteristics, participants living in different areas differed only in service score (p = 0. 002). The participants living in eastern area and offshore islands were the least satisfied with the <b>orthotic</b> <b>service.</b> For clinical characteristics, there was a significant difference in satisfaction scores among severity of disability (all p = 0. 015), types of orthoses (all p = 0. 001), and duration of usage (all p = 0. 001). The participants with mild disability, wearing the pressure garment and using the orthosis for less than one year, were the most satisfied with their <b>orthotic</b> devices and <b>service.</b> There is a need for improved <b>orthotic</b> devices and <b>services,</b> especially with respect to the comfort of the devices and the provision of subsidy funding...|$|R

40|$|Background: The aim was {{to compare}} {{findings}} related to experiences of prosthetics and orthotic service delivery in Tanzania, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Pakistan, {{from the perspective of}} local professionals. Method: In total 49 prosthetists/orthotists and prosthetic/orthotic technicians participated from four countries. A comparative analysis {{of the results of the}} three published papers was conducted. The analytical approach used was a second ordered concept analysis where subthemes, categories and conceptions were aggregated into themes. Results: Four common themes to Tanzania, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Pakistan emerged; Low awareness and prioritising of prosthetic and orthotic services; Difficulty managing specific pathological conditions and problems with materials; Limited access to prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services</b> available and The need for further education and desire for professional development. One theme was found to be unique to Sierra Leone; People with disabilities have low social status in Sierra Leone. Conclusion: The perspective of local professionals was that they had a sense of inability to deliver high-quality prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services.</b> Educating prosthetic and orthotic professionals to a higher level and providing opportunities for professional development was desired. Low awareness and low priority on behalf of the government when it comes to prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services</b> was identified as a barrier to providing effective rehabilitation.

40|$|Background: Education and {{training}} in prosthetics and orthotics typically comply with International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics standards based on three categories of prosthetic and orthotic professionals. Objective: This scoping study sought to describe the evidence base available to answer the question, How are prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services</b> influenced by the training of staff providing them? Study design: Scoping review. Methods: A structured search of the peer-reviewed literature catalogued in major electronic databases yielded 3039 papers. Following review of title and abstract, 93 articles were considered relevant. Full-text review reduced this number to 25. Results: Only two articles were identified as providing direct evidence {{of the effects of}} training and education on service provision. While both suggested that there was an impact, {{it is difficult to see}} how the more specific conclusions of either could be generalised. The other 23 articles provide a useful background to a range of issues including the specification of competencies that training programmes should deliver (3 articles), descriptions of a range of training programmes and the effects of training and education on student knowledge and skills.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} experiences of attitudes in the society of Sierra Leone from the perspective of individuals with poliomyelitis and people with amputations using orthotic or prosthetic devices. Methods: Individual interviews were conducted using open-ended questions. Twelve participants with amputations or polio were included. Content analysis was applied to the data. Results: The following six themes emerged during data analysis: Experience of negative attitudes; Neglected and respected by family; Traditional beliefs; The importance of assistive devices; People with disability struggle with poverty; and The need for governmental and international support. Conclusions: In Sierra Leone, people with disabilities face severe discrimination. They need to be included, recognized, and supported to a greater extent by the society, the community, and the family, as well as by the government and international organizations. Traditional beliefs have a negative impact on people with physical disabilities and are an important cause of discrimination in Sierra Leone. Prosthetic and orthotic devices are vital for people with physical disability and offer increased dignity. Prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services</b> need to be accessible and affordable. Poverty affects access to education, employment, and health care for Sierra Leoneans with physical disabilities, forcing them to resort to begging to cover basic living needs. Implications for RehabilitationIn Sierra Leone, traditional beliefs related to disability and public attitudes need to change in order to protect the human rights of people with disabilities. Increased public awareness of disability and implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) at different levels in society is needed. To increase access to prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services</b> in Sierra Leone, these services need to be affordable and related costs, such as transport, need to be covered by support.

40|$|Background: Maintaining and {{improving}} the quality of prosthetics and orthotics education at the Tanzania Training Centre for Orthopaedic Technologists is essential for the provision of appropriate prosthetics and <b>orthotics</b> <b>services</b> in African countries. Objectives: To describe how Tanzanian and Malawian graduates’ of the Diploma in Orthopaedic Technology perceive their education and how it could be improved or supplemented to facilitate clinical practice of graduates. Methods: Nineteen graduates from the diploma course in orthopaedic technology were interviewed and phenomenographic analysis was applied to the data. Results: Seven descriptive categories emerged, namely varied awareness of the profession before starting education, well-equipped teaching facilities, aspects lacking in the learning context, need for changes in the curriculum, enabling people to walk is motivating, obstacles in working conditions and the need for continuous professional development. All participants perceived possible improvements to the content and learning environment. Conclusions: Prosthetic and orthotic education can be better provided by modifying the content of the diploma programme by dedicating more time to the clinical management of different patient groups and applied biomechanics as well as reducing the programme content focusing on technical aspects of prosthetic and orthotic practice.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Standards and {{guidelines}} {{are an integral}} part of prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>service</b> delivery in the developed world underpinned by an assumption that they lead to improved services. Implementing them has a cost, however, and that cost needs to be justified, particularly in resource-limited environments. This scoping review thus asks the question, "What is the evidence of the impact of standards {{and guidelines}} on service delivery outcomes in prosthetics and orthotics?" MATERIALS AND METHODS: A structured search of three electronic databases (Medline, Scopus and Web of Science) followed by manual searching of title, abstract and full text, yielded 29 articles. RESULTS: Four categories of papers were identified: Descriptions and Commentaries (17 papers), Guideline Development (7), Guideline Testing (2) and Standards implementation (3). No articles were explicitly designed to assess the impact of standards and guidelines on service delivery outcomes in prosthetics and orthotics. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Studies tended to be commentaries on or descriptions of guideline development, testing or implementation of standards. The literature is not sufficiently well developed to warrant the cost and effort of a systematic review. Future primary research should seek to demonstrate whether and how guidelines and standards improve the outcomes for people that require prostheses, orthoses and other assistive devices. Implications for Rehabilitation International Standards and Clinical Guidelines are now an integral part of clinical service provision in prosthetics and orthotics in the developed world. Complying with standards and guidelines has a cost and, particularly in resource-limited environments, it should be possible to justify this in terms of the resulting benefits.

These children were suffering from a mainly atonic form of cerebral palsy.

Due to their inability to sit they tended to lie in their cots and to have a very restricted view of the world. Attempts were made to sit them up, but they tended to sag and fall over. It seemed logical to fit these children with a spinal support that would hold their spine in a corrected position, so that the fixed spinal deformity could be prevented.

40|$|BACKGROUND Madagascar is {{the fourth}} biggest island {{and one of the}} poorest {{countries}} in the world, with more than 75 % of the 24 million inhabitants living under poverty line. The health care system in the country is under development, as well as the field of rehabilitation services and the area of prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services</b> in specific. There is very limited published research concerning rehabilitation services for people with physical disability in Madagascar. AIM The aim {{of this study was to}} describe and explore the rehabilitation services in Madagascar, with a focus on prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services,</b> from the perspective of local rehabilitation staff. METHOD Eight staff members from two rehabilitation centres in Madagascar were interviewed, including one medical doctor, two prosthetic and orthotic technicians, two physiotherapists, one nurse, one social worker, and, one shoemaker. One centre was public and the other centre was run by a nongovernmental organization. Interviews were conducted in English with interpreter to Malagasy. A semi-structured interview guide was used. The data were analysed by using manifest content analysis. RESULTS Three main categories emerged from the analysis: i) Financial situation, distance, attitudes and lack of knowledge stops people from getting rehabilitation service. Dissemination of information about physical disabilities and rehabilitation services were needed to increase the awareness of people in general. There was also a need of more rehabilitation centres with staff to increase the access to rehabilitation services. Many persons with disability could not afford rehabilitation service, and the available financial assistance was not enough to support all who needed the services. However, all people with disability that were coming to the rehabilitation centres were treated equally; ii) Materials, equipment and level of knowledge among staff affect the rehabilitation services. The available materials and equipment differed a lot between the two rehabilitation centres. Further education for the staff was required to improve the quality of rehabilitation service. Appearance and information given by the staff affected acceptance of the assistive devices. Mobility skills were depending on the assistive device, type of disability, and the attitude of the individual patient; iii) Collaboration and communication need to be improved to give a more efficient rehabilitation service. Multidisciplinary approach contributed to good outcome for the patients. Collaboration with, and sponsorship from, nongovernment organizations could increase the quality of rehabilitation service. Furthermore, communication between different professions needed to be improved. An increased collaboration between rehabilitation centres and the Ministry of Health was needed. Finally, community based rehabilitation programs and mobility teams facilitated follow-up services. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION In order to improve rehabilitation services in Madagascar a combination of measures including increased availability to rehabilitation services and increased financial assistance to people with disability is required. Sustainable economic and material supply chains for rehabilitation centres, and, opportunities for the rehabilitation staff to receive professional relevant basic and continuous training is also required. It was highlighted that awareness and knowledge concerning the needs of persons with disability and the existing rehabilitation service should be increased both among politicians and among the general public in Madagascar...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{establishes}} {{a framework for}} understanding {{the role of a}} supplier {{within the context of a}} business ecosystem. Suppliers typically define their business in terms of capturing value by meeting the demands of direct customers. However, the framework recognises the importance of understanding how a supplier captures indirect value by meeting the demands of indirect customers. These indirect customers increasingly use a supplier’s products and services over time in combination with those of other suppliers. This type of indirect demand is difficult for the supplier to anticipate because it is asymmetric to their own definition of demand. Customers pay the costs of aligning products and services to their particular needs by expending time and effort, for example, to link disparate social technologies or to coordinate healthcare services to address their particular condition. The accelerating tempo of variation in individual needs increases the costs of aligning products and services for customers. A supplier’s ability to reduce its indirect customers’ costs of alignment represents an opportunity to capture indirect value. The hypothesis is that modelling the supplier's relationship to indirect demands improves the supplier’s ability to identify opportunities for capturing indirect value. The framework supports the construction and analysis of such models. It enables the description of the distinct forms of competitive advantage that satisfy a given variety of indirect demands, and of the agility of business platforms supporting that variety of indirect demands. Models constructed using this framework are ‘triply-articulated’ in that they articulate the relationships among three sub-models: (i) the technical behaviours generating products and services, (ii) the social entities managing their supply, and (iii) the organisation of value defined by indirect customers’ demands. The framework enables the derivation from such a model of a layered analysis of the risks to which the capture of indirect value exposes the supplier, and provides the basis for an economic valuation of the agility of the supporting platform architectures. The interdisciplinary research underlying the thesis is based on the use of tools and methods developed by the author in support of his consulting practice within large and complex organisations. The hypothesis is tested by an implementation of the modeling approach applied to suppliers within their ecosystems in three cases: (a) UK Unmanned Airborne Systems, (b) NATO Airborne Warning and Control Systems, both within their respective theatres of operation, and (c) <b>Orthotics</b> <b>Services</b> within the UK's National Health Service. These cases use this implementation of the modeling approach to analyse the value of platforms, their architectural design choices, and the risks suppliers face in their use. The thesis has implications for the forms of leadership involved in managing such platform-based strategies, and for the economic impact such strategies can have on their larger ecosystem. It informs the design of suppliers’ platforms as system-of-system infrastructures supporting collaborations within larger ecosystems. And the ‘triple-articulation’ of the modelling approach makes new demands on the mathematics of systems modeling. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{generate}} further knowledge about prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services</b> in developing countries. In particular, the thesis focused on patient mobility and satisfaction with prosthetic and orthotic devices, satisfaction with service delivery, and the views of staff regarding clinical practice and education. Methods: Questionnaires, including QUEST 2. 0, were used to collect self-reported data from 83 patients in Malawi and 139 patients in Sierra Leone. In addition, 15 prosthetic/orthotic technicians in Sierra Leone and 15 prosthetists/orthotists in Pakistan were interviewed. Results: The majority of patients used their prosthetic or orthotic devices (90 % in Malawi, and 86 % in Sierra Leone), but half of the assistive devices in use needed repair. Approximately one third of patients reported pain when using their assistive device (40 % in Malawi and 34 % in Sierra Leone). Patients had difficulties, or could not walk at all, with their prosthetic and/or orthotic device in the following situations; uneven ground (41 % in Malawi and 65 % in Sierra Leone), up and down hills (78 % in Malawi and 75 % in Sierra Leone), on stairs (60 % in Malawi and 66 % in Sierra Leone). Patients were quite satisfied or very satisfied with their assistive device (mean 3. 9 in Malawi and 3. 7 in Sierra Leone out of 5) and the services provided (mean 4. 4 in Malawi and 3. 7 in Sierra Leone out of 5), (p< 0. 001), but reported many problems (418 comments made in Malawi and 886 in Sierra Leone). About half of the patients did not, or sometimes did not, {{have the ability to}} access services (71 % in Malawi and 40 % in Sierra Leone). In relation to mobility and service delivery, orthotic patients and patients using above-knee assistive devices in Malawi and Sierra Leone had the poorest results. In Sierra Leone, women had poorer results than men. The general condition of devices and the ability to walk on uneven ground and on stairs were associated with both satisfaction of assistive devices and service received. Professionals’ views of service delivery and related education resulted in four themes common to Sierra Leone and Pakistan: 1) Low awareness and prioritising of prosthetic and orthotic services; 2) Difficulty managing specific pathological conditions and problems with materials; 3) The need for further education and desire for professional development; 4) Desire for improvements in prosthetic and orthotic education. A further two themes were unique to Sierra Leone; 1) People with disabilities have low social status; 2) Limited access to prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services.</b> Conclusion: High levels of satisfaction and mobility while using assistive devices were reported in Malawi and Sierra Leone, although patients experienced pain and difficulties when walking on challenging surfaces. Limitations to the effectiveness of assistive devices, poor comfort, and limited access to follow-up services and repairs were issues that needed to be addressed. Educating prosthetic and orthotic staff to a higher level was considered necessary in Sierra Leone. In Pakistan, prosthetic and orthotic education could be improved by modifying programme content, improving teachers’ knowledge, improving access to information, and addressing issues of gender equality...|$|E
40|$|Background Specialist 'therapeutic' {{footwear}} {{is recommended}} for patients with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a beneficial intervention for reducing foot pain, improving foot health, and increasing general mobility. However, many patients choose not to wear this footwear. Recommendations from previous studies have been implemented but have had little impact in improving this situation. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore RA patients' experiences of this footwear to ascertain the factors which influence their choice to wear it or not. Method Ten females and three males with RA and experience of wearing specialist footwear were recruited from four National Health Service <b>orthotic</b> <b>services.</b> Semi-structured interviews were carried out in the participants own homes. A hermeneutic phenomenological analysis of the transcripts was carried out to identify themes. Results The analysis revealed two main themes from both the female and male groups. These were the participants' feelings about their footwear and their experiences of the practitioner/s involved in providing the footwear. In addition, further themes were revealed from the female participants. These were feelings about their feet, behaviour associated with the footwear, and their feelings about what would have improved their experience. Conclusion Unlike any other intervention specialist therapeutic footwear replaces something that is normally worn and is part of an individual's body image. It has much more of a negative impact on the female patients' emotions and activities than previously acknowledged and this influences their behaviour with it. The patients' consultations with the referring and dispensing practitioners are pivotal moments within the patient/practitioner relationship that have the potential to influence whether patients choose to wear the footwear or not. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND People {{with disabilities}} {{have the right}} to {{personal}} mobility and available and affordable assistive technology, according to the Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Few studies have investigated overall satisfaction with prostheses fabricated using low-cost technology. Evidence-based recommendations for prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services</b> in low-income countries are needed in order to more effectively provide services. Detailed analysis of variables which influence patient satisfaction with assistive devices are therefore of significance to investigate for improving of clinical rehabilitation practice. AIM The aims were to investigate similarities and differences between Sierra Leone and Malawi concerning participants’ mobility and satisfaction with their lower-limb prosthetic or orthotic device and related service delivery, and to identify variables associated with patients’ satisfaction with assistive devices and associated services in the entire study group from these two low-income countries. METHOD This is a cross-sectional survey study in two low-income countries with correlative and comparative design. Questionnaires, including QUEST, were answered by a total of 222 patients in Sierra Leone and Malawi. RESULTS Eighty-six per cent of assistive devices were in use, but half needed repair. One third of participants reported pain when using their assistive device. A higher percentage (66 %) of participants in Sierra Leone had difficulties or could not walk at all on uneven ground compared with 42 % in Malawi. The majority in both countries had difficulties or could not walk at all up and down hills, or on stairs. Participants in both countries were quite satisfied (mean 3. 7 – 3. 9 of 5) with their assistive device. Participants were most dissatisfied with: comfort (46 %), dimensions (39 %), and safety (38 %) of their assistive device. In Sierra Leone participants were less satisfied than in Malawi with service delivery (mean 3. 7; 4. 4, p<. 001). Access to repairs and servicing of their assistive device was considered the most important item. In Sierra Leone patients were less satisfied with follow-up services (41 %) than patients in Malawi were (22 %). The significant association with satisfaction with assistive device was pain, general condition of the device, ability to walk on uneven ground/roads, ability to walk on stairs, and ability {{to get in and out}} of a car. The significant association with satisfaction with service was general condition of the device, ability to walk on uneven ground, ability to pay for costs associated with receiving the service appliances, accommodation, travel, and ability to walk on stairs. DISCUSSION Implications of the results is that the design and manufacture of prostheses and orthoses using low-cost technology needs be improved, specifically towards appropriate dimensions, increased comfort, and increasing the ability of patients to ambulate on challenging surfaces with their assistive device, as well as increasing patients’ ability to walk long distances with reduced pain. Increased or simulated ankle joint range of motion, careful dynamic alignment, more optimal dimensioning of assistive devices, and better training could facilitate the desired improvements. Access to repairs and follow-up services were important to participants, and should be addressed both by professionals operating within the rehabilitation field and policymakers, as it has the potential to improve mobility and satisfaction levels as well as reduce pain. The quality of assistive devices and service delivery could be enhanced by addressing the education level of staff. CONCLUSION Participants reported high levels of use and mobility with their assistive device, in spite of pain and difficulties walking on uneven ground, which were also associated with the level of satisfaction with the assistive device. More than half of the assistive devices were in need of repair. Access to repairs and follow-up services were the most important to patients, and should be addressed. Country was associated with satisfaction with service, with participants in Sierra Leone significantly less satisfied. REFERENCES Magnusson L, Ahlström G.

40|$|To {{understand}} what is required to improve prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> provision and <b>services</b> for persons with disabilities in low-income countries, it is of interest to investigate their well-being in terms of quality of life, access to mobility, education, health, rehabilitation, work and employment and their experiences of attitudes in the society. Data was collected using WHOQOL questionnaires measuring quality of life from 277 participants in India. In addition to this, individual qualitative {{interviews were conducted with}} 16 participants in Nepal and 12 participants in Sierra Leone. Statistical analysis and qualitative content analysis was applied to the data. In India participants with disabilities scored significantly lower than the persons without disabilities in three of the four domains; physical health, psychological and environmental domain. In Sierra Leone and Nepal participants were limited by poverty that affects access to education, employment and health care and wanted increased independence. Prosthetic and orthotic devices are vital for people with physical disability and offer increased dignity. In Sierra Leone, traditional beliefs {{have a negative impact on}} people with physical disabilities and are a cause for discrimination. In Nepal participants stressed that access to education and vocational training had the potential to improve their living situation...|$|R
40|$|Background: About 73 % of the {{population}} in Sierra Leone live in multidimensional poverty which makes Sierra Leone {{to be one of the}} poorest countries in the world. Sierra Leone suffered from a decade long civil war, 1991 - 2002, where humiliating methods were used such as machete amputations of civilians and the progress of eradicating poliomyelitis was hindered. Purpose: The aim of this study was to describe experiences of attitudes in the society of Sierra Leone from the perspective of poliomyelitis victims and people with amputations using orthotic and prosthetic devices. Methods: Individual interviews were conducted using open-ended questions. Twelve participants with polio and amputations were included. Content analysis was applied to the data. Results: The following six themes emerged during data analysis: Experience of negative attitudes; Neglected and respected by family; Traditional beliefs; The importance of assistive devices; People with disability struggle with poverty; and The need for governmental and international support. Participants experienced being discriminated in the society and the community but wanted to be treated as equals. Due to stigmatisation participants preferred living together in segregated communities. Half of the participants experienced being rejected by their families due to disability and half experienced being respected and included in their families. Traditionally the mentality in Sierra Leone was that disability is due to witchcraft. Participants experienced being more accepted in society when not being recognised as persons with disabilities and therefore preferred to use orthotics and prosthetics which also improved the possibility to walk and stand up straight. They expressed being stressed and discouraged since not being financial independent and felt forced in to begging. People with polio and amputations expect help by the government and international support to receive education and health care. Conclusions: In Sierra Leone, people with disabilities face severe discrimination. They need to be included, recognized and supported to a greater extent by the society, the community, and the family, as well as by the government and international organizations. Traditional beliefs have a negative impact on people with physical disabilities and are a cause of discrimination in Sierra Leone. Prosthetic and orthotic devices are vital for people with physical disability and offer increased dignity. Prosthetic and <b>orthotic</b> <b>services</b> need to be accessible and affordable. Poverty affects access to education, employment and health care for Sierra Leoneans with physical disabilities. They have to resort to begging to cover basic living needs.
