Homozygous lines containing FRE 1, FRE 2, <b>or</b> <b>FRE</b> 1 plus FRE 2 were generated. Northern-blot analyses revealed mRNA of two different sizes in FRE 1 lines, whereas all FRE 2 lines had mRNA only of the expected length. Fe(III) reduction, chlorophyll contents, and Fe levels were determined in transgenic and control plants under Fe-sufficient and Fe-deficient conditions. In a normal growth environment, the highest root Fe(III) reduction, 4 -fold higher than in controls, occurred in the double transformant (FRE 1 + FRE 2). Elevated Fe(III) reduction was also observed in all FRE 2 and some FRE 1 lines. The increased Fe(III) reduction occurred along the entire length of the roots and on shoot sections. FRE 2 and double transformants were more tolerant to Fe deficiency in hydroponic culture, as shown by higher chlorophyll and Fe concentrations in younger leaves, whereas FRE 1 transformants did not differ from the controls.

Methods. After constipation induction, yoghurt containing FRe (BFRe; 0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, or 1 %) was administered orally once per day for 6 days. Results. Loperamide treatment caused marked decreases in fecal pellet numbers and water content discharged, {{as well as in}} the surface mucosal thickness of the colonic lumen, intestinal charcoal transit ratio, thickness, and number of mucous-producing goblet cells in the colonic mucosa, whereas it increased the remnant fecal pellet number and the mean diameter of the colonic lumen. However, this loperamide-induced constipation was ameliorated by treatment with FRe, yoghurt single formula, or 0. 05 %, 0. 1 %, or 1 % BFRe (10 [*]mL/kg).

40|$|Biomass burning is an {{important}} global phenomenon affecting atmospheric composition with significant implications for climatic forcing. Wildland fire is the main global source of fine primary carbonaceous aerosols {{in the form of}} organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC), but uncertainty in aerosol emission estimates from biomass burning is still rather large. Application of satellite based measures of fire radiative power (FRP) has been demonstrated to offer an alternative approach to estimate biomass consumed with the potential to estimate the associated emissions from fires. To date, though, no study has derived integrated FRP (referred to as fire radiative energy <b>or</b> <b>FRE)</b> at a global scale, in part due to limitations in temporal or spatial resolution of satellite sensors. The main objective of this research was to quantify global biomass burning emissions of organic and black carbon aerosols and the corresponding effect on planetary radiative forcing. The approach is based on the geophysical relationship between the flux of FRE emitted, biomass consumed, and aerosol emissions. Aqua and Terra MODIS observations were used to estimate FRE using a simple model to parameterize the fire diurnal cycle based on the long term ratio between Terra and Aqua MODIS FRP and cases of diurnal satellite measurements of FRP made by the geostationary sensor SEVIRI, precessing sensor VIRS, and high latitude (and thus high overpass frequency) observations by MODIS. Investigation of the atmospheric attenuation of MODIS channels using a parametric model based on the MODTRAN radiative transfer model indicates a small bias in FRE estimates which was accounted for. Accuracy assessment shows that the FRE estimates are precise (R 2 = 0. 85), but may be underestimated. Global estimates of FRE show that Africa and South America dominate biomass burning, accounting for nearly 70 % of the annual FRE generated. 	The relationship between FRE and OCBC estimates made with a new MODIS-derived inversion product of daily integrated biomass burning aerosol emissions was explored. The slope of the relationship within each of several biomes yielded a FRE-based emission factor. The biome specific emission factors and FRE monthly data were used to estimate OCBC emissions from fires on a global basis for 2001 to 2007. The annual average was 17. 23 Tg which was comparable to previously published values, but slightly lower. The result in terms of global radiative forcing suggests a cooling effect at both the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) and surface approaching almost - 0. 5 K which implies that biomass burning aerosols could dampen the warming effect of green house gas emissions. 	An error budget was developed to explore the sources and total uncertainty in the OCBC estimation. The results yielded an uncertainty value of 58 % with specific components of the process warranting future consideration and improvement. The uncertainty estimate does not demonstrate a significant improvement over current methods to estimate biomass burning aerosols, but given the simplicity of the approach should allow for refinements to be made with relative ease...|$|E
40|$|Artemisinins are {{proposed}} {{to act in}} the malaria parasite cytosol by oxidizing dihydroflavin cofactors of redox-active flavoenzymes, and under aerobic conditions by inducing their autoxidation. Perturbation of redox homeostasis coupled with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ensues. Ascorbic acid-methylene blue (MB), N-benzyl- 1, 4 -dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) -MB, BNAH-lumiflavine, BNAH-riboflavin (RF), and NADPH-FAD-E. coli flavin reductase (Fre) systems at pH 7. 4 generate leucomethylene blue (LMB) and reduced flavins that are rapidly oxidized in situ by artemisinins. These oxidations are inhibited by the 4 -aminoquinolines piperaquine (PPQ), chloroquine (CQ), and others. In contrast, the arylmethanols lumefantrine, mefloquine (MFQ), and quinine (QN) have little or no effect. Inhibition correlates with the antagonism exerted by 4 -aminoquinolines on the antimalarial activities of MB, RF, and artemisinins. Lack of inhibition correlates with the additivity/synergism between the arylmethanols and artemisinins. We propose association via pi complex formation between the 4 -aminoquinolines and LMB or the dihydroflavins; this hinders hydride transfer from the reduced conjugates to the artemisinins. The arylmethanols have a decreased tendency to form pi complexes, and so exert no effect. The parallel between chemical reactivity and antagonism or additivity/synergism draws attention to the mechanism of action of all drugs described herein. CQ and QN inhibit the formation of hemozoin in the parasite digestive vacuole (DV). The buildup of heme-Fe-III results in an enhanced efflux from the DV into the cytosol. In addition, the lipophilic heme-Fe-III complexes of CQ and QN that form in the DV {{are proposed}} to diffuse across the DV membrane. At the higher pH of the cytosol, the complexes decompose to liberate heme-Fe-III. The quinoline or arylmethanol reenters the DV, and so transfers more heme-Fe-III out of the DV. In this way, the 4 -aminoquinolines and arylmethanols exert antimalarial activities by enhancing heme-Fe-III and thence free Fe-III concentrations in the cytosol. The iron species enter into redox cycles through reduction of Fe-III to Fe-II largely mediated by reduced flavin cofactors and likely also by NAD(P) H-Fre. Generation of ROS through oxidation of Fe-II by oxygen will also result. The cytotoxicities of artemisinins are thereby reinforced by the iron. Other aspects of drug action are emphasized. In the cytosol or DV, association by pi complex formation between pairs of lipophilic drugs must adversely influence the pharmacokinetics of each drug. This explains the antagonism between PPQ and MFQ, for example. The basis for the antimalarial activity of RF mirrors that of MB, wherein it participates in redox cycling that involves flavoenzymes <b>or</b> <b>Fre,</b> resulting in attrition of NAD(P) H. The generation of ROS by artemisinins and ensuing Fenton chemistry accommodate the ability of artemisinins to induce membrane damage and to affect the parasite SERCA PfATP 6 Ca 2 + transporter. Thus, the effect exerted by artemisinins is more likely a downstream event involving ROS that will also be modulated by mutations in PfATP 6. Such mutations attenuate, but cannot abrogate, antimalarial activities of artemisinins. Overall, parasite resistance to artemisinins arises through enhancement of antioxidant defense mechanisms...|$|E

We {{set out to}} investigate which IOS measurements are related to airflow obstruction, airway conductance and lung volumes in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). MethodsNinety-four COPD patients were recruited and 58 agreed to follow up after 1 year. IOS measurements (R 5, R 20, X 5 & Fres), body plethysmography (sGaw, FRC, TLC, RV & IC) and spirometry (FEV 1) were performed. Pearson or Spearman correlation determined the relationships between IOS and other measurements. ResultsR 5, X 5 and Fres were all significantly associated (p< 0. 05) with FEV 1, sGaw, TLC, RV and IC. However, R 20 was not related to any of these measurements except for RV. The strongest associations were observed between FEV 1 and the reactance measurements X 5 (r= 0. 48) and Fres (r=− 0. 44), and sGaw with X 5 (r= 0. 47) and Fres (r= 0. 51). The r values for the associations with TLC and IC were all < 0. 25. There was no statistically significant change in the FEV 1, R 5, X 5 <b>or</b> <b>Fres</b> after 1 year, but R 20 significantly increased over the year. The changes in R 5 and R 20 did not significantly correlate with the changes in FEV 1.

40|$|A {{major focus}} in global change {{research}} is to quantify the amount of gaseous and particulate pollutants emitted from terrestrial vegetation fires. Determination of the emitted radiant energy released during biomass combustion episodes (the so-called fire radiative energy <b>or</b> <b>FRE)</b> has been suggested as a new tool for determining variations in biomass combustion rates {{and the rate of}} production of atmospheric pollutants. We review the physical principals behind the remote determination of FRE and present an alternative method for its derivation via analysis of `fire pixel' radiances in the middle infrared spectral region. We compare our method to the existing FRE retrieval approach used in the EOS Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) fire products, and to retrievals of FRE based on derived fire temperature and area made via the so-called Bi-spectral method. We test each FRE retrieval method using both simulated data and imagery from a new experimental space mission, the Bi-spectral InfraRed Detection (BIRD) small satellite, which has sensors specifically designed for the study of active fires. We analyse near simultaneous MODIS and BIRD data of the fires that burned around Sydney, Australia in January 2002. Despite the markedly different pixel size and spectral coverage of these sensors, where the spatial extent of the fire pixel groups detected by MODIS and BIRD are similar, the derived values of FRE for these fires agree to within ± 15 %. However, in certain fires, the lower spatial resolution of MODIS appears to prevent many of the less intensely radiating fire pixels being detected as such, meaning MODIS underestimates FRE for these fires by up to 46 % in comparison to BIRD. Though the FRE release of each of these low intensity fire pixels is relatively low, their comparatively large number makes their overall FRE significant. Thus, total FRE release of the Sydney fires on 5 January 2002 is estimated to be 6. 5 × 109 J s- 1 via BIRD but 4. 0 × 109 J s- 1 via MODIS. The ability of BIRD to resolve individual fire fronts further allows the first accurate calculation of `radiative' fireline intensity from spaceborne measurements, providing values of 15  75 kJ s- 1 m- 1 for fire fronts that are up to 9 km in length. Finally, we analyse the effectiveness of the satellite-based FRE retrieval methods in estimating the FRE from the active flaming and smouldering components only (FREActive, believed to be proportional to the rate of biomass combustion), despite the sensor receiving additional radiance from the `cooling ground'. The MIR radiance method appears particularly strong in this regard, allowing FREActive to be estimated to within ± 30 % in the range 100  100, 000 J s- 1 m- 2. These results provide further confidence in the ability of spaceborne missions to derive physically meaningful values of FRE {{that could be used to}} support biomass burning emissions inventories. Future comparisons between FRE derived via MODIS and those from higher spatial resolution BIRD or airborne imagery may allow the MODIS-derived FRE values to be `calibrated' for any systematic underestimation. We therefore expect FRE to become an important tool for enhancing global studies of terrestrial vegetation fires with infrared remote sensing, particularly as the majority of large fires are now imaged four times per day via the MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft...|$|E
40|$|Biomass burning occurs {{seasonally}} in most vegetated {{parts of}} the world, consuming large amounts of biomass fuel, generating intense heat energy, and emitting corresponding amounts of smoke plumes that comprise different species of aerosols and trace gases. Accurate estimates of these emissions are required as model inputs to evaluate and forecast smoke plume transport and impacts on air quality, human health, clouds, weather, radiation, and climate. Emissions estimates have long been based on bottom-up approaches that are not only complex, but also fraught with compounding uncertainties. Fortunately, a series of recent studies have revealed that both the rate of biomass consumption {{and the rate of}} emission of aerosol particulate matter (PM) by open biomass burning are directly proportional to the rate of release of fire radiative energy (FRE), which is fire radiative power (FRP) that is measurable from satellite. This direct relationship enables the determination of coefficients of emission (C e), which can be used to convert FRP <b>or</b> <b>FRE</b> to smoke aerosol emissions {{in the same manner as}} emission factors (EFs) are used to convert burned biomass to emissions. We have leveraged this relationship to generate the first global 1 ° × 1 ° gridded C e product for smoke aerosol or total particulate matter (TPM) emissions using coincident measurements of FRP and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. This new Fire Energetics and Emissions Research version 1. 0 (FEER. v 1) C e product has now been released to the community and can be obtained from [URL], along with the corresponding 1 -to- 1 mapping of their quality assurance (QA) flags that will enable the C e values to be filtered by quality for use in various applications. The regional averages of C e values for different ecosystem types were found to be in the ranges of: 16 – 21 g MJ − 1 for savanna and grasslands, 15 – 32 g MJ − 1 for tropical forest, 9 – 12 g MJ − 1 for North American boreal forest, about ~ 24 g MJ − 1 for Russian boreal forest, and 18 – 26 g MJ − 1 for Russian croplands and natural vegetation. The FEER. v 1 C e product was multiplied with FRP data to generate smoke TPM emissions, which were compared with equivalent emissions products from three existing inventories. The smoke TPM emissions results from FEER. v 1 showed higher and more reasonable estimates than those of two other emissions inventories that are based on bottom up approaches and already reported in the literature to be too low, but portrayed an overall reasonable agreement with those of another inventory based on a hybrid method that includes the top-down approach, thereby suggesting that top-down approaches may hold better promise and need to be further developed to accelerate the reduction of uncertainty associated with fire emissions estimation in air-quality and climate research and applications. Based on analysis of data covering the period of 2004 – 2011, FEER. v 1 results show that ~ 65 – 85 Tg yr − 1 of TPM is emitted globally from open biomass burning, with a generally decreasing trend over this short time period. The FEER. v 1 C e product is the first global gridded product in the family of "emission factors", that is based essentially on satellite measurements, and requires only direct satellite FRP measurements of an actively burning fire anywhere to evaluate its emission rate in near real time, which is essential for operational activities, such as the monitoring and forecasting of smoke emission impacts on air quality...|$|E

40|$|Fine root endophytes (FRE) are arbuscule-forming fungi {{presently}} {{considered as}} a single species—Glomus tenue in the Glomeromycota (Glomeromycotina) —but probably belong within the Mucoromycotina. Thus, FRE are the only known arbuscule-forming fungi not within the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; Glomeromycotina) as currently understood. Phylogenetic differences between FRE and AMF could reflect ecological differences. To synthesize current ecological knowledge, we reviewed the literature on FRE and identified 108 papers that noted the presence of FRE and, in some, the colonization levels for <b>FRE</b> <b>or</b> AMF (or both). We categorized these records by geographic region, host-plant family and environment (agriculture, moderate-natural, low-temperature, high-altitude and other) and determined their influence on the percentage of root length colonized by FRE in a meta-analysis. We found that FRE are globally distributed, with many observations from Poaceae, perhaps due to grasses being widely distributed. In agricultural environments, colonization by <b>FRE</b> often equalled <b>or</b> exceeded that of AMF, particularly in Australasia. In moderate-natural and high-altitude environments, average colonization by FRE (~ 10 %) was {{lower than that of}} AMF (~ 35 %), whereas in low-temperature environments, colonization was similar (~ 20 %). Several studies suggested that FRE can enhance host-plant phosphorus uptake and growth, and may be more resilient than AMF to environmental stress in some host plants. Further research is required on the functioning of FRE in relation to the environment, host plant and co-occurring AMF and, in particular, to examine whether FRE are important for plant growth in stressful environments. Targeted molecular primers are urgently needed for further research on FRE...|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{examples}} of writers in recent years who have made critical assessments of Greenleaf's work, and of legal apologists who model their arguments on his book. Howard Richard Packham is a retired foreign language instructor and former part-time estate planning attorney who holds to an atheist worldview. He has written an internet article criticising the technical arguments set forth by Greenleaf and others. http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_packham/montgmry.html Packham holds that what Greenleaf submits as eyewitness testimony is technically hearsay and therefore does not comprise direct evidence to demonstrate the resurrection of Jesus. He also holds that the criteria for the [...] "ancient documents rule" [...] is not met by the gospel documents and that the force of Greenleaf's argument is thereby undermined. Packham argues that the ancient documents rule technically only applies to a limited genre of legal documents, such as wills and contracts and other specific legal instruments, to which the gospels do not belong. However, there are problems in Packham's argument. The Ancient Documents Rule {{is not limited to}} express legal instruments, but covers any type of documents. The criteria for the Ancient Documents Rule is simple and straightforward. According to legal authorities, documents of any type must meet three criteria in order to qualify for the Ancient Documents Rule: 1) that the document is at least 20 years old, 2) presumed to be genuine, 3) come from proper custody (cf. Black's Law Dictionary, FRE 901(b)(8)). Greenleaf, as a writer of highest legal authority, concluded that the Gospels should be received under the ancient documents rule. In §9 of his Testimony of the Evangelists, Greenleaf cites the legal reception by the British Record Commission of the Domesday Book and Ancient Statues of Wales, as well as many other ancient writings. Packham maintains that in a court procedure it is up to a judge to decide if a document may be admitted. However, the issue of allowing any evidence is whether the evidence has enough value for the trier of fact to reach a conclusion, whether for <b>or</b> against (<b>FRE</b> 104 (b) notes). Packham also argues that admitting a document is not tantamount to saying that its contents have automatically been authenticated by the judge's decision. However, that means the written document is allowed into evidence in the case and that evidence of its contents have to be further weighed by the trier of fact. The interesting dilemma is that both advocates and opponents must cite the Gospels in order to admit or omit their contents. Thus the probative value, and the logical and conditional relevancy of the Gospel materials is exhibited. Packham liberally cites the Gospel material and biblical higher critics in order to make his points.|$|R
