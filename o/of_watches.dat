5|$|Hurricane Dean {{was very}} {{difficult}} to forecast in its early stages as the storm approached the eastern Caribbean. Even though most forecast models predicted that Dean would skirt the Leeward Islands, the track prediction models were not consistent and, as a result, uncertainty existed in justifying the posting <b>of</b> <b>watches</b> and warnings for the Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. One track predicted Dean to threaten South Florida within three to fourdays.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{forecasts}} significantly {{underestimated the}} intensification of Emilia, {{which was one of}} three tropical cyclones to attain Category5 status in the central Pacific during the season. On July 16, a 72-hour forecast misjudged the strengthening of Emilia by 41m/s (92mph). Later, winds at 72hours were 31m/s (69mph) too high when the cyclone began to weaken. Tropical cyclone forecast models consistently predicted Emilia to remain south of the Hawaiian Islands because of the upper troughs' climatologically weak nature during the summer. This led to high confidence in the forecasts, resulting in a lack <b>of</b> <b>watches</b> or warnings. Nonetheless, a high surf advisory was issued for the south and east coasts of all islands.|$|E
