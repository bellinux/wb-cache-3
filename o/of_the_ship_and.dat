5|$|A ship {{received}} {{by a pair}} of induction coils hung on opposite sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> <b>and</b> fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.|$|E
5|$|Among the anecdotes of {{navigation}} by bioluminescence, the Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell recounted how as a navy pilot {{he had found}} {{his way back to}} his aircraft carrier USS Shangri-La when his navigation systems failed. Turning off his cabin lights, he saw the glowing wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> <b>and</b> was able to fly to it and land safely.|$|E

5|$|The chained {{slaves were}} packed under {{the deck of}} a small vessel named The Schooner York to be shipped to the island (other sources say the voyage took place aboard The Morovia). During this voyage the Igbo slaves rose up in rebellion, taking control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> {{drowning}} their captors in the process causing the grounding of the Morovia in Dunbar Creek at the site now locally known as Igbo Landing.|$|E
5|$|The next day, however, loyal {{crew members}} regained control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> they ran her aground and {{surrendered}} to the authorities. In August 1905, 75 mutineers were tried. Koshuba and two others were executed and 19 sailors got 185 years of hard labour.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of ten 28 cm SK L/50 guns in five twin gun turrets. Her {{secondary}} armament consisted of twelve 15cm SK L/45 guns in casemates in the central portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> twelve 8.8cm SK L/45 guns in the bow, in the stern, and around the forward conning tower. She was also equipped with four 50cm (20in) submerged torpedo tubes.|$|E

5|$|A {{fathometer}} was {{not required}} under USCG regulations, and Fitzgerald lacked one, even though fathometers were {{available at the time}} of her sinking. Instead, a hand line was the only method Fitzgerald had to take depth soundings. The hand line consisted of a piece of line knotted at measured intervals with a lead weight on the end. The line was thrown over the bow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> the count of the knots measured the water depth. The NTSB investigation concluded that a fathometer would have provided Fitzgerald additional navigational data and made her less dependent on Anderson for navigational assistance.|$|E
5|$|After the side-scan sonar aboard Geosounder was {{switched}} {{out for the}} ROV (again {{delayed by}} technical issues and more bad weather), the survey ship returned to Sydneys wreck site on 3 April, and performed a detailed study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> her debris field. Inspections were also carried out on Kormoran and the believed battle site (the latter found to be outcrops of pillow lava), before Mearns declared the search over on 7 April. In April 2015, an expedition to the wrecks by Curtin University and the Western Australian Museum commenced, {{with the objective of}} using 3D imaging to map the wrecksites for further study, and to determine if any deterioration since the 2008 discovery requires the development of a conservation management plan.|$|E
5|$|Although Stowe {{describes}} Minnah and Judy {{with some}} tempered exasperation, she praises a riverboat stewardess named Commodore Rose. Once a slave {{owned by the}} captain, Rose had since been freed for saving his life during a boating accident and continues {{to work for him}} following emancipation. She is as forthright as Minnah and Judy, but Rose knows every portion of the river as well as the houses and sites along the banks, and their histories. Her knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> its guests is unparalleled, and all the crew and guests revere her opinion in all matters.|$|E

5|$|Blonde, {{the eighth}} and last ship of that name, was laid down on No. 5 Slipway at Pembroke Royal Dockyard, on 6 December 1909 and {{launched}} on 22 July 1910 by Lady Frances Williams, wife of Sir Osmond Williams, 1st Baronet. She {{was completed in}} May 1911 with Captain Thomas Bonham in command and became {{the leader of the}} 7th Destroyer Flotilla in the Mediterranean through 1912. Captain Arthur Hulbert assumed command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> the 1st Destroyer Flotilla of the First Fleet on 10 May 1912. He was lost at sea on 12 January 1913 and replaced by Captain Thomas Shelford. He was relieved by Captain William Blunt on 25 April and transferred to the scout cruiser, , when that ship was assigned to the flotilla. The ship had been transferred to the 4th Battle Squadron as of 18 June and Captain Albert Scott assumed command on 5 July.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping water out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port {{to be handed over}} to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be written off as a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|E
5|$|In {{the remains}} of a small cabin in the bow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> in a few other {{locations}} around the wreck was found the earliest dated set of navigation instruments in Europe found so far: compasses, divider calipers, a stick used for charting, protractors, sounding leads, tide calculators and a logreel, an instrument for calculating speed. Several of these objects are not only unique in having such an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators {{during the first half of}} the 16th century, compasses were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.|$|E

5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to be}} able to splice ropes, reef a sail, work a ship in sailing and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected {{to be able to keep}} a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship,</b> <b>and</b> to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|E
5|$|López de Salcedo {{was under}} orders to {{investigate}} the state of affairs in the troubled province, and take whatever actions were necessary to impose order. He and his immediate successors promoted their own personal ambitions over the good government of Honduras, sowing division amongst the colonists, and instituting harsh policies against the indigenous population. In 1527 the natives rebelled against their brutal treatment. The punishment meted out to the rebellious Indians only served to incite further revolts. López de Salcedo arrested Saavedra and his supporters and shipped them to Santo Domingo to be tried by the Audiencia. The prisoners seized control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> sailed for Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Maggie Faris (Amy Seimetz) is {{the lander}} pilot serving aboard the Covenant and Tennessee's wife. Faris pilots the lander {{carrying}} the excursion team {{down through the}} ionic storm, {{to the surface of}} the planet. While the excursion team makes their way to the crashed Engineer ship, Faris stays with the lander, to calibrate its instruments and communicate with Tennessee. She receives communications from Karine Oram that Ledward is ill, prompting her to prepare the medical bay. Upon seeing Ledward's deadly and potentially contagious condition, Faris locks Karine and him in the medical bay, refusing to allow Karine to escape. When the Neomorph emerges and escapes the room, Faris arms herself and attempts to kill it. In the process, she inadvertently damages the lander, causing it to explode. A burning Faris stumbles out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> succumbs to her injuries on the foot ramp.|$|E

5|$|Massasoit and Squanto were {{apprehensive}} about the Pilgrims. In Massasoit's first {{contact with the}} English, several men of his tribe {{had been killed in}} an unprovoked attack by English sailors. He also knew of the Pilgrims' theft of the corn stores in their landings at Provincetown. Squanto had been abducted in 1614 by English explorer Thomas Hunt and had spent five years in Europe, first as a slave for a group of Spanish monks, then in England. He had returned to New England in 1619, acting as a guide to explorer Capt. Robert Gorges. Massasoit and his men had massacred the crew <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> had taken in Squanto.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Bonnet's crew {{represented}} him {{as being}} a leader, and it appears likely that, after his rescue of Blackbeard's marooned crewmen, he became at least a co-equal commander aboard the Royal James. He {{appears to have been}} entrusted with the company's treasure, and made most major command decisions such as the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ship</b> <b>and</b> what vessels to attack. Most significantly, at Delaware Bay he ordered two of his crew to be flogged for breaches of discipline. Pirates did not lightly submit to flogging, as they resented the frequent use of this punishment in the naval and merchant services from which most of them came, and thus only a leader who commanded the obedience of his crew could successfully order such penalties.|$|E
