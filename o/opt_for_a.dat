5|$|In 1984, Holden {{introduced}} the VK Commodore, with significant styling changes {{from the previous}} VH. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the VL, which had new front and rear styling. Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0-litre Nissan RB30 six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local motoring magazine Wheels from reporting on the matter. The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume unleaded petrol. Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on unleaded fuel, the Nissan engine {{was chosen as the}} best engine available. However, changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission {{over the life of the}} VL. The decision to <b>opt</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holden's mounted losses of A$780million on 19 December 1986. At GM headquarters' request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process. This involved the splitting of Holden into Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC). For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder Family II engines for use in cars built overseas. The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 VN, a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre Buick V6 engine.|$|E

Between 1983 and 1996, <b>a</b> firm that <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quotation on the Second Market, had the choice between (i) an auction-like procedure (there were two variants) and (ii) a fixed-price introduction procedure. Several interesting results are presented. First, the choice <b>for</b> <b>an</b> auction-like procedure appears to be positively related to firm valuation uncertainty at the IPO. Second, the likelihood of <b>opting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> auction-like procedure decreases as the reputation of the investment bank guiding the flotation increases. Third, the likelihood of <b>opting</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> auction is increasing in the number of secondary shares sold by venture capitalists and investment banks.
