5|$|A {{polar ice}} cap, or polar ice sheet, is a high-latitude region <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> or moon that {{is covered in}} ice.

5|$|Follow-up {{observations}} {{were conducted by}} a European and American science team at the 1.2m Leonhard Euler Telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile, which further {{raised the possibility of}} the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> in WASP-15's orbit; use of the CORALIE spectrograph on the Euler Telescope between March 6, 2008 and July 17, 2008 revealed that the variations in radial velocity measurements were not because of an eclipsing binary star system.|$|E
5|$|In {{all cases}} {{this means that}} the {{position}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> along its orbit ultimately becomes impossible to predict with any certainty (so, for example, the timing of winter and summer become uncertain), but in some cases the orbits themselves may change dramatically. Such chaos manifests most strongly as changes in eccentricity, with some planets' orbits becoming significantly more—or less—elliptical.|$|E

5|$|The European Southern Observatory (ESO) has {{confirmed}} the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet,</b> Beta Pictoris b, matching previous predictions, {{through the use}} of direct imagery, orbiting in the plane of the debris disk surrounding the star.

5|$|The {{defining}} {{dynamic characteristic}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> {{is that it}} has cleared its neighborhood. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated as part of the IAU's official definition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets. Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.|$|E
5|$|The high {{eccentricity}} of the planet's orbit {{suggests that}} either the Kozai mechanism (there is an exchange between the inclination <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> and its eccentricity) is at work, or that the planet's orbit was distorted by the unstable orbit of other planets {{that used to be}} part of the HD 154672 system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new mission concept for planetary exploration, {{based on the}} deployment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large number <b>of</b> small spherical mobile robots (“microbots”) over vast areas <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet’s</b> surface and subsurface, including structures such as caves and near-surface crevasses (see Figure 1). This would allow extremely large-scale in situ analysis of terrain composition and history. This approach re{{presents a}}n alternative to rover and lander-based planetary exploration, which is limited to studying small areas <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet’s</b> surface at <b>a</b> small number <b>of</b> sites. The proposed approach is also distinct from balloon or aerial vehicle-based missions, in that it would allow direct in situ measurement. In the proposed mission, a large number (i. e. hundreds or thousands) of cm-scale, sub-kilogram microbots would be distributed over <b>a</b> <b>planet’s</b> surface by <b>an</b> orbital craft and would employ hopping, bouncing and rolling as a locomotion mode to reach scientifically interesting artifacts in very rugged terrain. They would be powered by high energy-density polymer “muscle ” actuators, and equipped with <b>a</b> suite <b>of</b> miniaturized imagers, spectrometers, sampling devices, and chemical detection sensors to conduct in situ measurements of terrain and rock composition, structure, etc. Multiple microbots would coordinate to share information, cooperatively analyze large portions <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet’s</b> surface or subsurface, and provide context for scientific measurements...|$|R

5|$|The {{search for}} Gliese 3634 b {{started with a}} single {{exposure}} taken with HARPS on March 25, 2009. The results helped verify that Gliese 3634 was an ideal target for a planet search using the radial velocity method (in which the gravitational pull <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> on its star is measured by observing the resulting Doppler shift), as stellar activity would not overly mask or mimic Doppler spectroscopy measurements. It was also confirmed that Gliese 3634 is neither a binary star nor a quickly rotating star, common false positives when searching for transiting planets. Gliese 3634 was observed two weeks later for ten consecutive nights. Analysis of the resulting data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated the existence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> like Saturn.|$|E
5|$|As a start, the {{spectrum}} of HAT-P-33 was composed using the digital speedometer at the 1.5-meter Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona. The collected data found that the star was a single dwarf star exhibiting a slight rotation. Several of its parameters, including its effective temperature and surface gravity, were found. Additionally, the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at a 1.93-meter telescope at France's Haute-Provence Observatory was used to observe the star. The resulting data invited the possibility that radial velocity measurements, which can exhibit anomalies that often indicate the presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet,</b> may have been because of background distortion (and not a planet). This possibility significantly complicated the ability of scientists to verify this planet. After the observations, follow-ups were postponed for several years.|$|E

5|$|Ceres (2.77AU) is {{the largest}} asteroid, a protoplanet, and a dwarf planet. It has a {{diameter}} of slightly under 1,000km, and a mass large enough for its own gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. Ceres was considered a planet when it was discovered in 1801, and was reclassified to asteroid in the 1850s as further observations revealed additional asteroids.

5|$|Close {{encounters}} {{between the}} Sun and other stars in its birth cluster could {{have resulted in}} the capture <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> from beyond the Solar System. Three-body interactions during these encounters can perturb the path of planets on distant orbits around another star, or free-floating planets, in a process similar to the capture of irregular satellites around the giant planets, leaving one in a stable orbit around the Sun. A planet that originated in a system with a number of Neptune-massed planets and without Jupiter-massed planets, could be scattered into a more long-lasting distant eccentric orbit, increasing its chances of capture by another star. Although this increases the odds of the Sun capturing another planet from another star, a wide variety of orbits are possible, reducing the probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>planet</b> being captured on an orbit like that proposed for Planet Nine to 1–2 percent. In a simulation where the capture takes place between co-planar systems a large number of other objects are also captured into orbits aligned with the planet, potentially allowing this capture scenario to be distinguished from others. The likelihood of the capture of a free-floating planet is much smaller, with only 5–10 of 10,000 simulated free-floating planets being captured on orbits similar to that proposed for Planet Nine.|$|E
5|$|Data on Kepler-40 was {{analyzed}} {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, who first tested for false positives.
