25|$|A lack of {{verification}} of financial documents by investors or by independent auditors has, in some cases, assisted in fraud. In the mid-2000s, Kirk Wright of International Management Associates {{was accused of}} mail fraud and <b>other</b> <b>securities</b> violations which allegedly defrauded clients of close to US$180 million. In December 2008, Bernard Madoff was arrested for running a US$50 billion Ponzi scheme that closely resembled a hedge fund and was incorrectly described as one. Several feeder hedge funds, of which the largest was Fairfield Sentry, channeled money to it. Following the Madoff case, the SEC adopted reforms in December 2009 that required hedge funds managed by registered investment advisers to have their assets {{in the custody of}} a qualified custodian and subjected them to an audit requirement.|$|E
25|$|Fed chair Ben Bernanke {{explained}} in 2010 that vulnerabilities {{in the global}} financial system built up {{over a long period}} of time, and then specific triggering events set the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis into motion. For example, vulnerabilities included failure to regulate the risk-taking of the non-depository banking sector, the so-called shadow banks such as investment banks and mortgage companies. These companies had outgrown the regulated depository banking sector, but did not have the same safeguards. Further, financial connections were established between the depository banks and shadow banks (e.g., via securitization and special purpose entities) that created dependencies that were not well understood by regulators. Certain types of derivatives, essentially bets on the performance of <b>other</b> <b>securities,</b> remained largely unregulated and were another opaque source of dependencies.|$|E
25|$|Insider {{trading is}} the trading of a corporation's stock or <b>other</b> <b>securities</b> (e.g. bonds or stock options) by {{individuals}} with potential access to non-public {{information about the}} company. In most countries, trading by corporate insiders such as officers, key employees, directors, and large shareholders may be legal, if this trading is done {{in a way that}} does not take advantage of non-public information. However, the term is frequently used to refer to a practice in which an insider or a related party trades based on material non-public information obtained during the performance of the insider's duties at the corporation, or otherwise in breach of a fiduciary or other relationship of trust and confidence or where the non-public information was misappropriated from the company. Illegal insider trading is believed to raise the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth.|$|E

25|$|At first, Lithuania did {{not have}} gold or any <b>other</b> <b>securities</b> {{to back up the}} litas. Lithuania needed to find about 200 million U.S. dollars to form the {{stabilization}} fund. First, it sought to recover its pre-war gold reserves (about 10 tons) from France, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, etc. In the interwar period Lithuania stored its gold reserve in foreign banks. After the occupation in 1940 those reserves were “nobody’s”: there was no Lithuania and most Western countries condemned the occupation as illegal and did not recognize the Soviet Union as a successor. The Bank of England, for example, sold the reserves to the Soviets in 1967. However, in January 1992 it announced that this action was a “betrayal {{of the people of the}} Baltic states” and that it would return the originally deposited amount of gold, now worth about 90 million pounds sterling, to the three Baltic states. Lithuania received 18.5 million pounds or 95,000 ounces of gold and remained a customer of the bank. Similarly, in March 1992 Lithuania reclaimed gold from the Bank of France and later from the Bank of Sweden.|$|E
