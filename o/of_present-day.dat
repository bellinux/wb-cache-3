5|$|On 10 April, senior Ustaše {{commander}} Slavko Kvaternik {{proclaimed the}} establishment of the Independent State of Croatia (Nezavisna Država Hrvatska, NDH). The declaration came exactly one week before the VKJ's unconditional surrender to the Axis powers. The leader of the Ustaše, Ante Pavelić, was in Rome at the time and made arrangements to travel to Karlovac, just west of Zagreb. He arrived in Karlovac on 13 April, accompanied by 250–400 of his followers. Pavelić reached Zagreb on 15 April, having granted territorial cessions to Italy at Croatia's expense and promised the Germans {{he had no intention of}} pursuing a foreign policy independent of Berlin. That same day, Germany and Italy extended diplomatic recognition to the NDH. Pavelić was declared Poglavnik ("leader") of the Ustaše-led Croatian state, which combined the territory of much <b>of</b> <b>present-day</b> Croatia, all <b>of</b> <b>present-day</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina and parts <b>of</b> <b>present-day</b> Serbia.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{boundaries of}} the Indiana Territory included {{the area of the}} Northwest Territory west of a line running from the bank opposite the mouth of the Kentucky River northeast to Fort Recovery, and from there due northward along a line approximately 84 deg 45 min W longitude. The territory initially included most <b>of</b> <b>present-day</b> Indiana and all <b>of</b> <b>present-day</b> Illinois, and Wisconsin, as well as fragments of three other states: the part of Minnesota east of the Mississippi River, almost all of the Upper Peninsula <b>of</b> <b>present-day</b> Michigan and the western half of the Lower Peninsula, and finally, a narrow strip <b>of</b> <b>present-day</b> Ohio lying to the north and west of Fort Recovery. This latter parcel became part of the state of Ohio when it was admitted to the Union in 1803. At the same time in 1803, the southeast boundary shifted to the mouth of the Great Miami River from its former location at the point opposite the mouth of the Kentucky River. The eastern part of Michigan was added to the Indiana Territory at that time. The area of the Indiana Territory was reduced in 1805 by the creation of the Michigan Territory, and in 1809 by the creation of the Illinois Territory.|$|E
5|$|This process {{affected}} the southern and western parts <b>of</b> <b>present-day</b> Mali most significantly, {{but in the}} northern and eastern parts of the colony large numbers of slaves remained in servitude to their masters.

In the 1920s, most Tuareg households still had slaves who tended to the house and animals.|$|E

However, these first deposits, and later discoveries in Southern California mountains, attracted little notice and were of limited consequence economically.|$|E

5|$|In 324, Constantine I chose Byzantium {{to be the}} {{new capital}} of the Roman Empire, {{renaming}} it New Rome. Following the death of Theodosius I in 395 and the permanent division of the Roman Empire between his two sons, the city, which would popularly {{come to be known as}} Constantinople, became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. This empire, which would later be branded by historians as the Byzantine Empire, ruled most of the territory <b>of</b> <b>present-day</b> Turkey until the Late Middle Ages; although the eastern regions remained in firm Sasanian hands up to the first half of the seventh century. The frequent Byzantine-Sassanid Wars, as part of the centuries long-lasting Roman-Persian Wars, fought between the neighbouring rivalling Byzantines and Sasanians, took place in various parts <b>of</b> <b>present-day</b> Turkey and decided much of the latter's history from the fourth century up to the first half of the seventh century.|$|E
