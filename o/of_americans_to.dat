5|$|In March 1794, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to Shelby's concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional powers {{in the event of}} an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson's successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby's letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Genêt. Two months later Genêt's agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> trade on the river.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread {{slowly at}} first. The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people who}} lived near California or people who heard the news from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery began entrenching {{his troops}} around the fort on September 18, and {{constructing}} a mortar battery {{south of the}} fort. He ordered Brown to establish a position at La Prairie, one of the sites {{where there was a}} crossing of the Saint Lawrence River to Montreal. Ethan Allen went with a small company <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> collect Canadiens that Livingston had been recruiting, and take them to monitor Longueuil, the other major crossing point. Livingston had established a base at Point-Olivier, below Fort Chambly, another aging fort at the base of some rapids in the Richelieu River, and was urging his compatriots to join him there. Some Loyalists attempted to dissuade others from joining with Livingston; Livingston's supporters sometimes violently opposed attempts by Loyalists to organize, and Carleton did nothing at the time to assist the Loyalists outside the city.|$|E

5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get into the front lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E

25|$|Part of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project (1935–39) was a New Deal {{program to}} fund theatre and other live artistic {{performances}} and entertainment {{programs in the}} United States during the Great Depression.

25|$|A recent ABC-TV 20/20 {{report on}} Healthcare, based on footage taken {{from within the}} island, criticized Michael Moore's portrayals of the Cuban Healthcare system in the movie Sicko.

The report highlights the dilapidated conditions of some hospitals that are accessible to regular Cubans by pointing to the bleak conditions of hospital rooms and the filthy conditions of the facilities. The report also addressed the quality of care available to Cubans by arguing that patient neglect was a common phenomenon. Finally, in discussing the infant mortality rate, the report highlights the government's alleged efforts to promote abortions of potentially infirm fetuses and other alleged government efforts to manipulate the rate.|$|E

He stated that it is in the interest <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>to</b> remain in Iraq and be involved in the [...] "Middle East issue" [...] because if not, America is [...] "going to end up with a major war".

On May 27, Gilmore {{appeared on}} ABC's This Week and continued the strategy of attacking his opponents in the race for president. On the show, he criticized the credentials of former Senator and potential candidate Fred Thompson of Tennessee. He reminded the audience that Thompson is [...] "a one-term senator" [...] and that [...] "he's well known because of his Law & Order appearance. But the question is, is there a solid, consistent record there of supporting conservative principles?" ...|$|E

After these terms are established, The Lieutenant opens fire on General Victor and his men and a battle ensues. General Victor, Colonel Smythe and The Lieutenant and several of his men are killed.
