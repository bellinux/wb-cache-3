Instead of waving off the start, <b>official</b> <b>assessed</b> Fittipaldi a stop-and-go penalty.

Danny Sullivan took the lead on lap 48. In the closing laps, Galles Racing teammates Sullivan and Al Unser Jr. were running 1st-2nd. On lap 69, Unser challenged Sullivan for the lead, but was forced down to the inside, and knocked down three cones. Officials charged Unser with going off-course, and assessed him a stop-and-go penalty.

40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2013.

This thesis provides local government officials with a concise stand-alone social media implementation guide that will help public <b>officials</b> <b>assess</b> their organizations and stimulate questions like if they should pursue social media while defining the process for developing policies, strategies, and assessment tools. Agencies need to reflect on organizational limitations, potential benefits and possible concerns throughout the process and experts generally believe that these steps will improve the likelihood of successful social media implementation. This thesis discusses the existing research on social networking use by public agencies and my experience interning with the Yolo County Public Information Officer. My findings are summarized in the social media implementation guide. With regular assessment and reevaluation of the successes and failures agencies will be better prepared to realize the benefits of social media, mitigate concerns, and define their role in the digital community.

40|$|Reliability and {{performance}} of fire protection systems in a building are important considerations in the new objective/performance-based code environment. An increased reliability {{and performance}} would provide {{a higher level of}} life safety to the occupants. To help designers and building <b>officials</b> <b>assess</b> the impact of reliability {{and performance of}} fire protection systems, assessment tools are essential. In this paper, the computer fire risk-cost assessment model that is being developed at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) is used to show, as an example, how the impact of reliability of fire alarms and automatic sprinklers on life safety in a building can be quantitatively assessed. The NRC model is called FiRECAM^TM (Fire Risk Evaluation and Cost Assessment Model). FiRECAM^TM evaluates the life risks to the occupants and fire costs as a result of all probable fires in a building and by simulating the dynamic interaction of fire growth, smoke movement, occupant response and fire department intervention. These interactions are affected by the reliability of fire alarms and automatic sprinklers, as well as the performance of other fire protection systems that are installed.

The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of Section 88 to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of child welfare. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial <b>officials</b> <b>assessed</b> the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report Native Children and the Child Welfare System. Often taken without the consent of their parents or community elders, some children were placed in state-run child welfare facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.|$|R
