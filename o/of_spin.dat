He died in hospital in Sutherland in 1992, aged 86. O'Reilly lamented the decline <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> during his twilight years, and in the 1980s he was often derided by younger people who felt that his advocacy <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> bowling—which they deemed to be obsolete—was misplaced. He died just months before Shane Warne revived the art of leg spin on the international stage.|$|E

5|$|In his research, Chadwick {{continued}} {{to probe the}} nucleus. In 1925, the concept <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> had allowed physicists to explain the Zeeman effect, but it also created unexplained anomalies. At {{the time it was}} believed that the nucleus consisted of protons and electrons, so nitrogen's nucleus, for example, with a mass number of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. This gave it the right mass and charge, but the wrong spin.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea is that}} if each spin is {{connected}} to a large number <b>of</b> <b>spins,</b> only the average ratio <b>of</b> + <b>spins</b> to − spins is important, since the fluctuations about this mean will be small. The mean field H is the average fraction <b>of</b> <b>spins</b> which are + minus the average fraction <b>of</b> <b>spins</b> which are−. The energy cost of flipping a single spin in the mean field H is ±2JNH. It is convenient to redefine J to absorb the factor N, so that the limit N → ∞ is smooth. In terms of the new J, the energy cost for flipping a spin is ±2JH.|$|R

Representations appear {{in the description of}} fields in classical field theory, most importantly the electromagnetic field, and of particles in relativistic quantum mechanics, as well as of both particles and quantum fields in quantum field theory and of various objects in string theory and beyond. The representation theory also provides the theoretical ground for the concept <b>of</b> <b>spin.</b> The theory enters into general relativity in the sense that in small enough regions of spacetime, physics is that of special relativity.|$|E
5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support for climate change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting these companies have attempted to influence public opinion on the matter. Washington and Cook write that politicians {{have a tendency to}} use weasel words as part of a propaganda tactic through use <b>of</b> <b>spin,</b> as a way to deflect public interest away from climate change and remain passive on the issue. The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} {{gyroscopic}} effect in most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean.

5|$|After the Indian Premier League's {{second season}} {{demonstrated}} the importance <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> bowling in Twenty20 cricket, {{and due to}} Somerset's lack of a front-line spin bowler, Somerset picked young leg spinner Max Waller to make his Twenty20 debut in their opening match of the campaign. He claimed three wickets in two overs to help Somerset win by one run, and finished the competition as Somerset's joint second-highest wicket-taker with 10 wickets. Despite a number of good performances by Somerset's bowlers, a batsman was named man of the match {{in each of the}} team's victories: James Hildreth, Craig Kieswetter and Marcus Trescothick were all awarded the accolade once, while Zander de Bruyn picked up the award on three occasions. Somerset completed the group stage with six wins, three losses and one no result, placing them third in the Midlands/Wales/West Division. They qualified for the knockout-stage as they were the best third-placed team in the three groups.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was neither}} aesthetically nor {{technically}} {{among the best}} batsmen, Leyland {{had a reputation for}} batting well under pressure. He performed most effectively against the best teams and bowlers, and in difficult situations; his Test batting record is better than his first-class figures, and against Australia his average is even higher. Outside of Tests, he had some success with the ball, and {{had it not been for}} the depth <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> bowling in Yorkshire, he might have been a leading bowler. He was one of the first to bowl left-arm wrist-spin, and may have invented the name to describe such deliveries—"chinamen". Very popular with team-mates and spectators, Leyland had a reputation as a humorist, and many stories were told about him.|$|E
5|$|Degenerate {{stars have}} {{contracted}} into a compact mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentum—the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate <b>of</b> <b>spin.</b> A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E

5|$|England {{began their}} second innings {{on the third}} afternoon. Late in the day, after scoring 13 in 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind by Don Tallon after {{attempting}} a cut shot from Johnson’s bowling. Edrich did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. Denis Compton came in and he ran down the pitch before the first ball was bowled; he had to quickly block {{the ball on the}} run. He then survived a confident lbw appeal from the bowling of Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate and ready to walk, but umpire Frank Chester declined the appeal. During this passage of play, Johnson extracted a substantial amount <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> from the surface. England closed the day at 2/121.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the first}} five runs were leg byes; Miller then removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot that was caught by Tallon. The batsman was displeased with the umpire's {{decision}} and gestured to a red mark on his shirt, indicating he felt the ball had touched his body and not the bat. Edrich came in and while he continued to struggle, he defiantly held up {{his end of the}} pitch. After scoring 13 from 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England 39/2. Johnson was extracting a substantial amount <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> from the surface.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{played for}} Gala Cricket Club in 1896 and 1897, as an all-rounder {{who opened the}} batting and bowled medium paced seamers. He took 92 wickets in his first season, and {{discovered}} that bowling an occasional slow ball brought him some success. He decided to change his bowling style to spin, and spent the winter of 1896–97 practising on the family farm while also working again on the railway, this time as a signalman. Over several months, Rhodes used his practice sessions to develop control <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> and different types of delivery. Consequently, {{in his second season}} at Galashiels, now bowling slow left-arm, he took fewer wickets but at a better average. At the end of the 1897 season, encouraged by a Scottish member of the MCC, he resigned from Gala to look for work in England.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} analytically a {{star network}} <b>of</b> <b>spins,</b> {{in which all}} spins interact exclusively with a central spin through Heisenberg XX couplings of equal strength. We find that the central spin correlates and entangles the other spins at zero temperature {{to a degree that}} depends on the total number <b>of</b> <b>spins.</b> Surprisingly, the entanglement depends on the evenness or oddness of this number and some correlations are substantial even for an infinite collection <b>of</b> <b>spins.</b> We show how symmetric multi-party states for optimal sharing and splitting of entanglement can be obtained in this system using a magnetic field.

5|$|The book {{identifies}} {{a corporate}} underpinning influencing public opinion {{by way of}} companies which derive profit from the fossil fuel industry. Washington and Cook write that politicians often use weasel words as a form <b>of</b> <b>spin</b> and propaganda, in order {{to act as if}} they are going to do something about climate change, while in actuality remaining passive on the issue. The authors go on to identify a greater level of denial— within the wider public itself. They argue that society enables denial of climate science through inaction and resistance to the scientific consensus. The authors conclude that if the public stopped denying climate change, the problem itself could realistically be significantly addressed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} <b>of</b> <b>Spin</b> Alternative Record Guide was {{published}} on October 10, 1995, by Vintage Books. It {{was the first}} book compiled by Spin. Having edited their book, Weisbard put his pursuit of a PhD at UC Berkeley on hold and accepted a job offer from the magazine, which {{marked the beginning of}} his career as a rock critic. Although the book did not sell well, its entry on 1960s folk artist John Fahey, written by Byron Coley, helped renew interest in Fahey's music. According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, this led to substantial interest in Fahey from record labels and the alternative music scene, helping revive his career.|$|E

Furthermore, Barry Walters <b>of</b> <b>Spin</b> has compared the music to former Eno collaborators U2 and several reviewers have compared the musicality to PaulSimon—especially his 2006 Eno collaboration Surprise. The vocals have been declared similar to NeilYoung; and the arrangement {{has been compared to}} TheBeachBoys. Although the music was informed by gospel and digital music, comparisons have been made with genres as diverse as country due to the vocal delivery and oldschoolhiphop. One weakness addressed by several reviewers is the unoriginality of the music, especially in comparison to the duo's previous collaborations.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{attitude}} instability experience by Explorer 1, many papers {{have been written}} on the effects if internal dissipation on {{the attitude}} stability <b>of</b> <b>spinning</b> satellites. In the engineering literature, stability analysis is restricted to the variational or linearized perturbational equations, {{despite the fact that}} spinning satellites are almost always critical cases in the Liapunov-Poincaré stability theory. This is certainly true in the case <b>of</b> dual <b>spin</b> satellites, which have the further complication that the linearized perturbational equations have periodic coefficients. The purpose of this note is to treat some problems of attitude stability <b>of</b> <b>spinning</b> satellites in a rigorous manner and to show that, with certain restrictions, the linearized stability analysis correctly predicts the attitude stability <b>of</b> <b>spinning</b> satellites...|$|R
40|$|A cluster <b>of</b> <b>spins</b> 1 / 2 of {{a finite}} size can be {{regarded}} as a basic building block <b>of</b> a <b>spin</b> texture in high-temperature cuprate superconductors.

We find that the calculated spectra exhibit a high degree of variability representative of the actual phenomenology of curates, while, at the same time, reproducing a number of important features of the experimentally measured spin response. Among such features are the spin gap, the broad peak around ħω≃ (40 - 70) meV and the sharp peak at zero frequency. The latter feature emerges due to transitions inside the ground-state multiplet of the so-called "uncompensated" clusters with an odd number <b>of</b> <b>spins...</b>|$|R
