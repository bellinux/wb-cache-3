5000|$|The {{history of}} {{structural}} engineering contains many collapses and failures. Sometimes {{this is due}} to <b>obvious</b> <b>negligence,</b> {{as in the case of}} the PÃ©tion-Ville school collapse, in which Rev. Fortin Augustin [...] "constructed the building all by himself, saying he didn't need an engineer as he had good knowledge of construction" [...] following a partial collapse of the three-story schoolhouse that sent neighbors fleeing. The final collapse killed 94 people, mostly children.|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{uncovering}} the most common faults concerning the carrying out of a prepurchase examination by a veterinarian, 189 documents about claims for compensatory after prepurchase examinations of horses between 1978 - 2005 have been analysed. The most important {{results of this study}} are: For the most part the prepurchase examination was done by a non specialised veterinarian (80, 95 %) under the conditions of a field practice (84, 66 %). Even in the case of <b>obvious</b> <b>negligences</b> of duties of care, the veterinarians were often not aware of any faults and were of the opinion, that the claims are not legitimate. Our investigation revealed that the widely-held view that there are more reclamations of horses, if the seller is client of the veterinarian is unfounded. Proportionally legitimate claims for compensatory went back equally to the seller than to the buyer. Predominantly the prepurchase examination included a radiographic examination (75, 66 %). According to the opinion of the veterinarians, only 30, 16 % of the examined horses were shown to have some complaint and/or revealed pathological findings. Considering {{that more than half of}} the claims for compensatory (51, 85 %) were proved as legitimate, the veterinarians often misjudged horses. The most common faults concerned the taking of films or the interpretation of radiographic changes. In almost half of the radiographic examinations (48, 95 %), the veterinarians failed to notice pathological findings. This concerned mainly radiographic changes of the navicular bone (35, 48 %) and the tarsus (17, 20 %). 8, 39 % of the films were of insufficient quality. More rarely clinical findings have been overlooked by the veterinarians. Complaints affecting the locomotory system (33, 33 %) and the eyes (27, 78 %) have been in the fore. In total of 8, 62 % the veterinarians failed their duty of enlightenment. In some cases the veterinarians failed their duty of documentation or did not observe the general valid rules of a prepurchase examination. In almost half of the cases the claims for compensatory were proved as unjustified. In most cases the veterinarians were accused of having overlooked pathological findings. 26, 37 % of the veterinarians were unjustly accused of having failed their duty of informing their clients sufficiently. The results of this investigation reveal the obvious existing unsureness of the veterinarians concerning the carrying out of a prepurchase examination and the interpretation of findings...|$|R
