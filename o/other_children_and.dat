5|$|Princesses and princes of the United Kingdom are {{provided}} with distinctive forms of coronet, which they don during the service. A male heir-apparent's coronet displays four crosses-pattée alternating with four fleurs-de-lis, surmounted by an arch. The same style, without the arch, is used by <b>other</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> siblings of the monarch. The coronets of children of the heir-apparent display four fleurs-de-lis, two crosses-pattée and two strawberry leaves. A fourth style, including four crosses-pattée and four strawberry leaves, {{is used for the}} children of the sons and brothers of sovereigns. The aforementioned coronets are borne in place of those to which they might otherwise be entitled as peers or peeresses.|$|E
5|$|A {{motif of}} father-against-son {{conflict}} was repeated when Cronus {{was confronted by}} his son, Zeus. Because Cronus had betrayed his father, he feared that his offspring would do the same, and so each time Rhea gave birth, he snatched up the child and ate it. Rhea hated this and tricked him by hiding Zeus and wrapping a stone in a baby's blanket, which Cronus ate. When Zeus was full grown, he fed Cronus a drugged drink which caused him to vomit, throwing up Rhea's <b>other</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> the stone, which {{had been sitting in}} Cronus's stomach all along. Zeus then challenged Cronus to war for the kingship of the gods. At last, {{with the help of the}} Cyclopes (whom Zeus freed from Tartarus), Zeus and his siblings were victorious, while Cronus and the Titans were hurled down to imprisonment in Tartarus.|$|E
5|$|Fakih {{was born}} in Gresik, East Java, Dutch East Indies, on 2 March 1904. His father, Usman Iskandar, was a wood merchant, and his mother, a housewife, was the {{daughter}} of an ulama (scholar of Islam). The couple, who were of modest means, had four <b>other</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> the family's lack of a noble background meant the children were ineligible to receive an education at Dutch-run schools. Instead, Fakih studied Islam from a young age, receiving much of his instruction from his father. At the age of ten he began studying at a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Gresik, finishing four years later. In 1919 he continued his studies at several pesantren outside the city, including ones in rural Gresik and in nearby Bungah.|$|E

50|$|In <b>other</b> cases, a <b>child</b> or {{adolescent}} {{may have}} no intent to cause any harm to another <b>child,</b> <b>and</b> he or she acts merely on a passing impulse. However, this act may still result in harm to the <b>other</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> {{is a form of}} child-on-child sexual abuse.|$|R

5|$|Ideally, {{these social}} skills become {{incorporated}} into the internal working model {{to be used with}} <b>other</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner is willing to compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.|$|E

25|$|When EastEnders {{began in}} 1985, Pauline (Wendy Richard) and Pete (Peter Dean) {{were the only}} two of Lou's {{offspring}} to feature on screen. Through character dialogue in July 1985, the audience were told of the existence of three other children: Keith, Paul and Norma — who had moved away to Romford and Eastbourne before the series began.

25|$|The two mummies of {{the younger}} girls have not been opened as yet. In the early 1990s they were {{examined}} by using modern techniques. The portrait of the older girl, probably the middle one among the three daughters of Aline and her husband, resembles that of her mother. Since it is still attached to her mummy, it is less clearly visible at present; additionally, it has been attached somewhat {{too far to the}} right of the window-like opening in the wrapping. As with the <b>other</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> the man, her name is unknown. She wears valuable but simple jewellery and has a ringlet hairstyle.|$|E

25|$|Children with Down {{syndrome}} {{have increased}} difficulty forming friendships. They experience a language delay {{causing them to}} have a harder time playing with other children. Most children with Down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play alongside a friend but not with them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. In preschool years, children with Down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by <b>other</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> less dependent on adult aid. Children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. At school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.|$|E
25|$|In the Superman Adventures comic line {{based on}} the TV series of the same name, Luthor's backstory is {{identical}} {{to that of the}} Modern Age origin with slight changes. Luthor is shown originating in Suicide Slum, but at an early age already aware of how his brilliance outshone <b>other</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> his plans to have all Metropolis look up to him one day. Luthor's baldness is never explained, save for a brief depiction of him with blond hair in childhood, it is assumed the hair loss was natural. Luthor's parents die during his teenage years, however their deaths were indeed accidental and with no foul play by Lex. As in the usual story, Lex uses the insurance payouts to kick-start his future by paying for his tuition to MIT and eventually starting LexCorp. His hatred of Superman is explained as the citizens of Metropolis have had more admiration for the Man of Steel than for Lex.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, {{eligibility}} for maternity allowances {{was extended to}} Aboriginal women who were exempted from State laws relating to the control of Aboriginal natives and who were considered suitable to receive the benefits. From 1943, the income test for maternity allowances was abolished {{and the rate of}} the allowance was increased to 15 pounds where there were no other {{children under the age of}} 14 years, 16 pounds where there were one or two <b>other</b> <b>children,</b> <b>and</b> 17 pounds 10 shillings in cases of three or more children. These amounts included an additional allowance of 25 shillings per week in respect of the period four weeks before and four weeks after the birth, to be paid after the birth of the child. That same year, {{eligibility for}} Child Endowment was extended to children in Government institutions, to Aboriginal children who lived for six months per year on a mission station, and to children who were maintained from a deceased estate.|$|E

500|$|Among the show's main child characters, Cartman is {{distinguished}} as [...] "the fat kid", and his obesity {{is a continuing}} subject of insults and ridicule from other characters throughout the show's run. Cartman is frequently portrayed as an antagonist or villain whose actions set in motion the events serving as the main plot of an episode. <b>Other</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> classmates are alienated by Cartman's insensitive, racist, xenophobic, anti-semitic, lazy, self-righteous behavior, but are occasionally influenced by his obtrusive, manipulative, and propagandist antics.|$|E
500|$|After John Wayles died in 1773, his {{daughter}} Martha {{and her husband}} Thomas Jefferson inherited the Hemings family among a total of 135 slaves from his estate, as well as 11,000 acres of land. The youngest Wayles-Hemings child was Sally, an infant that year and about 25 years younger than Martha. [...] Scholars have noted that as the mixed-race Wayles-Hemings children grew up at Monticello, they were trained and given assignments as skilled artisans and domestic servants, {{at the top of}} the slave hierarchy. Betty Hemings' <b>other</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> their descendants, also mixed race, also had privileged assignments. None worked in the fields.|$|E
500|$|In {{chapters}} seven through fourteen (about half of {{the completed}} manuscript), Maria relates her own life story in a narrative she has written for her daughter.

To escape her unhappy home, Maria visited that of a neighbor {{and fell in love with}} his son, George Venables. Venables presented himself to everyone as a respectable and honorable young man; in actuality, he was a libertine.
