5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck.</b> Saldívar did not comply; she backed up and parked adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the viewer}} {{backlash}} Animal Planet received for allowing meerkats from the Meerkat Manor series to die, the producers of the film debated including the filmed death of a young meerkat who was bitten by a snake. They questioned whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the research area under a strictly enforced agreement not {{to interfere with the}} meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it lay dying were edited out. Other meerkat deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform {{on the side of a}} truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> to hold the camera steady, giving the visual impression of a truck bearing down on a meerkat. To provide bird and snake footage, professional handlers were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.|$|E

25|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{got into}} her pickup truck and {{attempted}} to leave the motel. Rosario Garza, a motel staff member, saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel.

25|$|BDR's {{original}} {{foray into}} the Truck Series, it debuted in 2004 at the Florida Dodge Dealers 250, where Bill Lester drove it to a sixteenth-place run. He posted just one top-ten that year and finished 22nd in points. The next season, he won two poles (back-to-back at Kansas and Kentucky), had a best finish of fifth and moved up to seventeenth in points. Lester failed to finish in the top-ten during the 2006 season and dropped to twentieth in points. Tyler Walker began the season driving the renumbered No. 36 truck full-time in 2007, with sponsorship from 360 OTC. Six races into the season, rookie Ryan Mathews replaced Walker after it was learned that Walker was suspended for violating NASCAR's substance abuse policy, and the team had lost its sponsor, 360 OTC (which wanted No. 36). Mathews, in his short season, posted two top tens, one top five, and one pole at Kentucky Speedway. Mathews then stepped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> for the debut of 1995 Indianapolis 500 winner and 1997 Formula One Champion Jacques Villeneuve. In preparation for this, the truck was renumbered No. 27, which Villeneuve used in his 1995 CART and Indy 500 championship season, {{as a tribute to}} his father Gilles.|$|E
500|$|While {{imprisoned in}} a gulag in Krasnoyarsk, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) learns that Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) {{is a double}} agent working for the Russian taskmasters and that all prisoners have been {{subjected}} to a black oil vaccine. [...] In his dungeon, Mulder is given a sharp object by other prisoner, who had built it to commit suicide. When all the prisoners are taken out and are arranged in a line, Mulder sees Krycek talking to one of the captors and runs toward them, tackling them. Mulder then steals a truck and flees with a unconscious Krycek in the back of it; a pursuit by his captors ensues. As Mulder drives the truck, Krycek awakes and jumps off it. Mulder, having been unable to stop it, runs it off the road and it crashes. Mulder quickly makes his way <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> and hides under the dry leaves, while Krycek is found by a group of men whose left arms have all been amputated and has his arm forcibly severed to prevent his involvements in black oil vaccination tests.|$|E

50|$|The Dana 50 axle {{featured}} on most F-250 Super Dutys differs greatly {{from the early}} models. The Dana 50 {{started out as a}} Twin Traction Beam axle (much like independent suspension) in 1980. This lasted all the way to 1997 models. The Super Duty models then used a solid axle version <b>of</b> this axle. <b>The</b> ring, pinion, carrier and u joints all remained the same however. The Dana 50 was phased <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> in 2004, in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dana 60 and was last used in the Ford Excursion.|$|R
2500|$|The case is {{expected}} {{by some to}} set a legal precedent. [...] "The ruling... may spur lawmakers to codify the behavior highlighted in the case as criminal." [...] The judge had noted that Carter had willed Roy's death, {{that she did not}} order him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> and that her actions [...] "put him in that toxic environment" [...] which [...] "constituted reckless conduct" [...] and [...] "that the conduct caused the death of Mr. Roy."

2500|$|On Thursday, April 30, 1998, around 3:00p.m., Jones {{parked his}} dark gray Toyota pickup truck on the {{transition}} loop from the Harbor Freeway to the Century Freeway in Los Angeles (...) [...] Jones {{sat in the}} front of his truck with his pet dog Gladdis, a seven-year-old Labrador-whippet mixed-breed. Jones began pointing a loaded shotgun at passing cars on the freeway, causing motorists to report him to the police. Jones himself then called 9-1-1, revealing he was emotionally distraught about HMOs (Health Maintenance Organizations) and the circumstances surrounding his HIV. Jones said he was in pain due to mistreatment by the HMO in whose care he had been placed. As was confirmed later, aside from being HIV-positive, Jones also suffered from cancer. During the call, he fired off several rounds from his shotgun, with one of them going through the roof of his truck. Authorities then closed the two freeways, preventing anyone from approaching him. Jones remained in his truck the entire time, as police helicopters monitored his movements. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Special Weapons Team began to assemble and got into position around him. Jones then reached into a backpack he owned and took out clothing and a videotape. He then began throwing the items over the freeway wall. Afterwards, he got <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>truck</b> and walked across the empty freeway.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{readiness}} level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> QRF {{is based}} on unit SOPs.

During high-intensity conflicts, the QRF {{may be forced to}} maintain that split-second level of readiness, and have all members in their vehicles with the motors running. However, during low-intensity conflict, when deployment is less likely and may be more readily predicted, the command establishes how fast the QRF must be able to react, which can range from trucks and personnel in a central location with <b>the</b> troops rotating <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trucks</b> to <b>the</b> vehicles simply staged close to a unit area, with all personnel staying close enough for rapid recall. The speed at which a QRF is expected to react is defined by its readiness condition, or REDCON, level.|$|R
