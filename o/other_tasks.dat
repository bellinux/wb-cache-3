In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of nymphs into adults can take months; {{the time period}} depends on food availability, temperature, and {{the general population of}} the colony. Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves, workers must feed them, but workers also take part in the social life of the colony and have certain <b>other</b> <b>tasks</b> to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen. Pheromones regulate the caste system in termite colonies, preventing all but a very few of the termites from becoming fertile queens.|$|E
5|$|The game takes {{advantage}} of the Nintendo DS's stylus in several different ways. The player can draw shapes to open certain doors and plot out the path of ships on the ocean, among <b>other</b> <b>tasks.</b> The device's touchscreen {{can also be used to}} direct Link's boomerang. Phantom Hourglass features cel-shaded graphics, similar to that of The Wind Waker, with some influence from Four Swords Adventures.

5|$|A {{large portion}} of {{gameplay}} in Murder on the Orient Express has the player questioning characters and listening to lengthy periods of dialogue in order to acquire clues which {{may lead to the}} murderer. <b>Other</b> <b>tasks</b> the player must complete include collecting passports and other paraphernalia left by the passengers in an effort to acquire clues to lead to the solution of the murder, and retrieving certain objects for various characters. Combining items in the inventory forms {{a major part of the}} puzzles in the game. There are no puzzles with time limits in the game, although some puzzles require correct timing. There are also several single screen puzzles, such as a safe-cracking puzzle.|$|E

5|$|As {{production}} of the B-47 came to an end, the Wichita factory was phased in for B-52D production, with Seattle responsible for 101 D-models and Wichita 69. Both plants continued to build the B-52E, with 42 built at Seattle and 58 at Wichita, and the B-52F (44 from Seattle and 45 from Wichita). For the B-52G, it was decided in 1957 to transfer all production to Wichita, which freed up Seattle for <b>other</b> <b>tasks</b> (in particular the {{production of}} airliners). Production ended in 1962 with the B-52H, with 742 aircraft built, plus the original two prototypes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{the student}} {{population}} was over 10,000, placing it as the fourth largest California state institution and larger than 96% of the U.S.’s colleges and universities at the time. In 1957, entering freshmen scores on examinations were ranked in the top 10% of all universities in the U.S. In the following years, the college’s scores also surpassed most of the other California state colleges. In 1957 the college became the first to use an identification number for each student, which was necessary to simplify handling of records, grades, and <b>other</b> <b>tasks</b> of the large number of students. To keep up with student expansion, the square footage of the buildings and classrooms was increased from 255,434 to 1,243,737.|$|E
5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations had been turned over to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 remedial welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among <b>other</b> <b>tasks.</b> Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E

5|$|Hardware {{benchmarking}} {{conducted using}} Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and {{mentioned at the}} unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 {{times higher than the}} iPhone 4S. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than the iPhone 4S. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than the iPhone 4S. Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing <b>other</b> <b>tasks</b> the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4S.|$|E
5|$|In July 2005 {{the statues}} adorning the {{monument}} underwent a restoration. DeKalb County appropriated US$15,000 {{for the project}} which, among <b>other</b> <b>tasks,</b> repaired a split seam {{in one of the}} soldier statues and a crack in the other sculpture's base. The project took approximately six months; the statues were removed {{for the duration of the}} restoration work and reinstalled in March 2006. During the restoration it was revealed that the statues, thought to be bronze, were actually copper. The work, the first in the 110-year history of the memorial, was completed at a cost of $16,500. Three months after the work was completed one of the statues was removed for a second time because the metal began to oxidize.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Juniper {{released}} the EX9200 switch, which isn't {{part of the}} MX Series, but uses the same software and Trio chipset. A virtualized MX series 3D router, the vMX 3D, was introduced in November 2014. A suite of updates were announced in late 2015. New MPC line cards were introduced, which have a throughput of up to 1.6 Tbit/s. Simultaneously the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) was announced. JET is a programming interface for integrating third-party applications that automate provisioning, maintenance and <b>other</b> <b>tasks.</b> The Junos Telemetry Interface was also announced at the same time. It reports data to applications and other equipment to automate changes to the network in response to faults or in order optimize performance.|$|E

The Second and Third Battalions were assigned to defend communications. In 1948, seven members received the Bronze Star for their service in World War II. On 13 December 1944, the 65th Infantry, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Juan César Cordero Dávila, relieved the 2nd Battalion of the 442nd Infantry Regiment, a regiment which was made up of Japanese Americans under the command of Col. Virgil R. Miller, a native of San Germán, Puerto Rico and former member of the 65th Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Medieval: Total War {{is based}} upon the {{building}} of an empire across medieval Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It focuses on the warfare, religion and politics of the time to ultimately lead the player in conquest of the known world. As with the preceding Total War game, Shogun: Total War, the game consists of two broad areas of gameplay: a turn-based campaign map that allows the user to move armies across provinces, control agents, diplomacy, religion, and <b>other</b> <b>tasks</b> needed to run their faction, and a real-time battlefield, where the player directs the land battles and sieges that occur.|$|E
5|$|On 8 February 1942, Albert Speer {{became the}} Reichsminister for Armaments and Munitions and gained {{influence}} over the Navy's construction programs. Speer reassigned {{some members of the}} H class design staff to work on new U-boats and <b>other</b> <b>tasks</b> deemed critical to the war effort. The Schiffsneubaukommission (New Ships Construction Commission), intended to liaise with Speer and the OKM, was created and placed under the direction of Admiral Karl Topp. This group was responsible for the design work that resulted in the H-42 type, as well as the subsequent designs. The Construction Office of the OKM formally concluded their work on new battleships with the H-41 type and played no further role in battleship development.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{offering}} a fixed wage maximizes the principal's welfare when the agent needs {{to engage in}} multitask and that the effort needed to achieve one task can be induced by suppressing the effort needed for the <b>other</b> <b>task,</b> {{in the absence of}} externalities. In the existing literature, it is argued that these results are obtained because externalities exist between the costs of tasks or production of tasks. The former is typically represented by a perfect substitute in the cost function.
