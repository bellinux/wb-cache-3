25|$|NBA 2K16, {{like last}} past {{games in the}} series, is marketed as being 'better' than the predecessor, as many {{features}} are added and improved. One such improvement, is the tattoos; when creating a player, there are over 1500 different designs available, whereas past games only had a few dozen individual tattoos. <b>Other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> touted as being improved are the visuals, the player customization (haircuts, accessories, etc.), several of the game modes (particularly MyCareer, which is marketed as a central feature), and the overall gameplay. Many aesthetical improvements are made as well, such as new animations, and redesigned menus. New animations include mouth guards, and photobombs.|$|E
25|$|Many items {{have been}} used as {{commodity}} money such as naturally scarce precious metals, conch shells, barley, beads etc., as well as many <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> thought of as having value. Commodity money value comes from the commodity out of which it is made. The commodity itself constitutes the money, and the money is the commodity. Examples of commodities that {{have been used}} as mediums of exchange include gold, silver, copper, rice, Wampum, salt, peppercorns, large stones, decorated belts, shells, alcohol, cigarettes, cannabis, candy, etc. These items were sometimes used in a metric of perceived value in conjunction to one another, in various commodity valuation or price system economies. Use of commodity money is similar to barter, but a commodity money provides a simple and automatic unit of account for the commodity which is being used as money. Although some gold coins such as the Krugerrand are considered legal tender, there is no record of their face value {{on either side of the}} coin. The rationale for this is that emphasis is laid on their direct link to the prevailing value of their fine gold content.|$|E
500|$|An 11-segment {{series of}} reports in March 2012 from ABC News brought {{widespread}} public attention to and raised consumer concerns about the product. The product was described as [...] "essentially scrap meat pieces compressed together and treated with an antibacterial agent". Lean finely textured beef (LFTB) {{was referred to as}} [...] "an unappetizing example of industrialized food production". The product has been characterized as [...] "unappetizing, but perhaps not more so than <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> routinely part of hamburger" [...] by Sarah Klein, an attorney for the food safety program at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Nutritionist Andy Bellatti has referred to the product as [...] "one of many symptoms of a broken food system". Food policy writer Tom Laskawy noted that ammonium hydroxide is only one of several chemicals routinely added to industrially produced meat in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Schmidt criticises Cochrane's liberty {{thesis on}} the grounds that nonhuman animals may have a {{non-specific}} instrumental interest in freedom, meaning that although freedom is not intrinsically valuable for these animals, it may be that they can achieve <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> intrinsically valuable only through possessing freedom. Thus, Cochrane's thesis underestimates the value that freedom could have for nonhuman animals. Hadley criticises Cochrane's non-pragmatic approach, arguing that Cochrane, as an animal advocate, is wrong to deny that nonhuman animals possess an [...] "intrinsic" [...] interest in freedom. Hadley links freedom to the value of nonhuman animals, arguing that the latter can be undermined by arguing against the former. Garner criticises Cochrane's thesis {{on the grounds}} that Cochrane has, Garner claims, underestimated the weight of the argument from marginal cases. To the extent that Cochrane's argument works for nonhuman animals, Garner suggests, it will also work for many humans, leading to counter-intuitive consequences. Garner ties autonomy not merely to liberty, but also life, which means that Cochrane's argument would imply that some humans have less of an interest in life than others. Nonetheless, Garner argues that Cochrane's liberty thesis is not destructive of animal rights, and that animal rights positions can still make claims of significance without endorsing the claim that nonhuman animal use is, in itself, problematic. Indeed, merely a right against suffering, Garner suggests, could go a long way towards achieving the abolitionist goal of the end of animal industry. All three authors praise Cochrane for drawing attention to the previously under-examined issue.|$|E

Adam had more scenes in the original cut. A scene that showed Jigsaw regretting his actions was also cut. Bell said, [...] "I'm glad they cut that scene. This guy knows exactly what he's doing.

2500|$|Drews's {{theory has}} not been unopposed. An {{argument}} against it {{may be found in}} the very treatise [...] "De Sacramentis" [...] from which he gathers some of his arguments. For this treatise says: [...] "In all <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> said praise is given to God, prayers are said for the people, for kings, for others, but when he comes to consecrate the holy Sacrament the priest no longer uses his own words, but takes those of Christ" [...] (IV, iv). According to this author, then, the Intercession comes before the Consecration. On the other hand, it will be noticed that the treatise is late. That it is not by St. Ambrose himself has long been admitted by every one. It is apparently an imitation of his work [...] "De Mysteriis", and may have been composed in the 5th or 6th century (Bardenhewer, Patrologie, 407). German Morin thinks that Nicetas, Bishop of Romatiana in Dacia, wrote it (Rev. Ben√©d., 1890, 151-59). In any case it may be urged that whatever reasons there are for ascribing it to an early date, they show equally conclusively that, in spite of its claim to describe [...] "the form of the Roman Church" [...] (III, 1) it is Milanese. The very assurance is a proof that it was not composed at Rome, since in that case such a declaration would have been superfluous. An allusion occurring in a Milanese work is but a very doubtful guide for the Roman use. And its late date makes it worthless as a witness for our point. When it was written probably the change had already been made at Rome; so we are not much concerned by the question of how far it describes Roman or Milanese offices. So far the theory proposed by Drews, which seems in any case to deserve attention.|$|E
