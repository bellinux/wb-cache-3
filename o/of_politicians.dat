5|$|The {{balance of}} Privy Counsellors is largely made up <b>of</b> <b>politicians.</b> The Prime Minister, Cabinet ministers and the Leader of HM Opposition are {{traditionally}} sworn of the Privy Council upon appointment.

5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience <b>of</b> <b>politicians</b> and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, Harrison {{traveled}} the Middle East performing medical duties such as treating prostitutes afflicted with venereal disease in Constantinople and operating an X-ray facility in Lod, Israel. Although still not legally divorced {{from his first}} two wives, Harrison married Filomena Abela, a Maltese woman at Alexandria in 1920. However, the newlyweds could not find escape from the adventure that had followed Harrison all his life. Harrison and his new wife's train was ambushed by a band of Syrians disillusioned with a group <b>of</b> <b>politicians.</b> The quick thinking of the recently thrice-married physician prevented his new wife's broken leg from developing into gangrene.|$|E

5|$|As {{the wars}} in Gaul come to an end, Julius Caesar (Ciarán Hinds) is faced with both triumph and tribulation. On {{the heels of his}} victory comes news of his daughter's death. Awarded with the {{adulation}} of the people, he also garners the enmity <b>of</b> <b>politicians</b> in Rome, including Pompey the Great (Kenneth Cranham). In Rome, Pompey must balance honor and politics as he is urged to betray his former friend. Meanwhile, Caesar's niece Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker) tries to steer her family on the dangerous path between the growing divisions of power. In the Gallic countryside, two unlikely allies (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson) journey to reclaim the stolen standard of the Roman legion.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{following}} 1857, none of the cabinets survived long. They quickly collapsed {{due to the lack}} of a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative Party had split down the middle: on one side were the ultraconservatives, and on the other, the moderate conservatives. In the wake of Carneiro Leão's cabinet, a new generation <b>of</b> <b>politicians</b> had emerged, eager to acquire more power inside the Conservative Party. Paranhos belonged to this younger age group. These men saw their path to the top ranks as being blocked by the Conservative elders, who would not easily relinquish control.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, Adams lost {{re-election}} to Thomas Jefferson {{and retired}} to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed {{his friendship with}} Jefferson upon the latter's own retirement by initiating a correspondence which lasted fourteen years. He and his wife established a family <b>of</b> <b>politicians,</b> diplomats, and historians now {{referred to as the}} Adams political family. Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States. He died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, and the same day as Jefferson. Modern historians in the aggregate have favorably ranked his administration.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, the ATC made {{progress}} toward protecting the trail from development, thanks to efforts <b>of</b> <b>politicians</b> and officials. The National Trails System Act of 1968 designated the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail {{as the first}} national scenic trails and {{paved the way for}} a series of National Scenic Trails within the National Park and National Forest systems. Trail volunteers worked with the National Park Service to map a permanent route for the trail, and by 1971 a permanent route had been marked (though minor changes continue to this day). By the close of the 20th century, the Park Service had completed the purchase of all but a few miles of the trail's span.|$|E
5|$|The Comitato Organizzatore dei XVI Giochi del Mediterraneo– Pescara 2009 (English: Organizing Committee of the XVI Mediterranean Games– Pescara 2009; {{abbreviated}} as COJM) {{was created}} in 2006 to oversee the staging of the Games. The committee {{was in charge of}} implementing and staging the Games, and to maintain the infrastructure and provide other services. The committee's board of directors consisted <b>of</b> <b>politicians,</b> IOC members from Italy, and presidents of the various Italian sports governing bodies. Mario Pescante was appointed as the Commissioner Extraordinary of the Games in 2008 by the Italian Government. He had held the same office during the 2006 Winter Olympic, held in Turin.|$|E
5|$|The award ceremony, held {{as planned}} in Oslo City Hall on the {{afternoon}} of 10 December, was attended by about 1,000 VIPs, diplomats and guests.

5|$|To command {{individual}} units, regional ZNG commands {{were established}} in eastern Slavonia, the Banovina–Kordun area, Lika, central and northern Dalmatia, southern Dalmatia and Zagreb in late July and August. Crisis headquarters, which also had command authority of ZNG units, were established down to the municipal level. The command structure was particularly poor, preventing effective coordination between units. Although the many crisis headquarters were entrusted {{with a high level}} of authority, they consisted <b>of</b> <b>politicians</b> with little (if any) military training other than JNA service. Multiple units deployed to a single area often had no authority coordinating their activities. TO command systems were reactivated in some places (such as Zagreb), somewhat improving the situation.|$|E
5|$|After their {{experience}} of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely {{been replaced by a}} newer generation <b>of</b> <b>politicians</b> who had no experience of the early years of PedroII's reign. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity and saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them PedroII was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it. PedroII's achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Chris Lu {{was born}} on June 12, 1966 in New Jersey. In 1974, {{his family moved to}} the Fallsmead {{neighborhood}} of Rockville, Maryland, where he graduated from Thomas S.

Lu's grandfather, Wang Ren-Yuan, was the Minister of Justice of Taiwan from 1970 to 1976 and was elected to the first Legislative Yuan in 1948 to represent Tianjin. Lu said he was heavily influenced by his father, who worked as an electrical engineer but loved literature and history; the two would read biographies <b>of</b> <b>politicians</b> and watch the evening news together.|$|E

5|$|Following Buckingham’s {{death in}} 1628, {{when it was}} safer to do so, a {{translation}} of a history by Pierre Matthieu was published under the title, The Powerful Favourite, the life of Aelius Sejanus. This was followed in 1634 by another translation, Sir Thomas Hawkins' Politicall Observations upon the Fall of Sejanus, which had originally been titled Della peripetia di fortuna (Of Changes of Fortune) by its author, Giovanni Battista Manzini. Later in the century Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, {{was the target of}} the four-page political pamphlet Sejanus, or The popular favourite, now in his solitude, and sufferings, signed with the pseudonym Timothy Tory (1681). The story of Sejanus, with reference to the Earl's imprisonment in the Tower on a charge of treason, is interpreted as an argument for absolute monarchy, direct rule without the intermediary <b>of</b> <b>politicians.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{delivered}} the inaugural Oscar Mendelsohn lecture in 1971 at Monash University and advocated policies for Australia such as population control, prevention of war, long-term {{plans for the}} management of the environment and natural resources, Aboriginal land rights, socialism, recycling, advertising bans on socially harmful products, and more regulation of the environment. He angrily denounced French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and after consistently voting for the ruling Liberal Party coalition as it ruled for the past few decades, signed an open letter backing the opposition Labor Party of Gough Whitlam, which took power in 1972. However, he soon spoke out against Whitlam's lack of action against tobacco advertising and French nuclear tests. Burnet often found himself frustrated with the refusal <b>of</b> <b>politicians</b> to base policy on long-term objectives, such as the sustainability of human life.|$|E
5|$|Later {{chapters}} tell {{of events}} since Metamorphosis. In British Columbia, Suzuki spends {{time on the}} Queen Charlotte Islands and in Stein Valley advocating against logging. He describes his travels in Brazil while shooting an episode of The Nature of Things in 1988 and the relationship he developed with the Kayapo people. One of their leaders returned to Canada with him to advocate the protection of his homeland in the Amazon. His tour of Papua New Guinea and how Australia became his second home are explained. He describes the founding and {{early years of the}} David Suzuki Foundation, a non-profit organization based on environmental protection and developing sustainability. In the final four chapters Suzuki elaborates on his thoughts about climate change, celebrity status, technology, and death. He laments the lack of global action on climate change, scientific illiteracy on the part <b>of</b> <b>politicians,</b> and the lack of media attention to science. In the final chapter he accepts death as an inevitability and expects his works to be forgotten quickly, leaving his grandchildren as his only true legacy.|$|E
