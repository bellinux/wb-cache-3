40|$|Japanese {{taxation}} on Interest Income heavily {{relies on}} withholding {{system in the}} hands of payer. This operates only when that payment is done within Japan. Along with globalization people are heading for financial institutions which exist outside Japan. Here withholding will not work both for the current provision of Japanese Tax Act and for the principle of taxing jurisdiction. Instead self assessment is needed here. Main problem is how to characterize certain payments in connection with such foreign institutions. As one area of international taxation we will struggle with this issue. In other words the question is how to interpret Japanese Income Tax Act in connection with “foreign”situation, especially “interest on deposits and savings” and “banks and other financial institutions”, both of which really locate in Japanese Income Tax Act and relevant <b>order</b> <b>for</b> <b>enforcement.</b> By an introductory inquiry below legal approach cannot solve problem because of complexity of current financial transaction. Conversely certain mixture of legal and economical is appropriate. First step is to interpret Japanese Tax Law within Japanese legal system. Second is to understand relevant contracts in accordance with conflict of law. On economic one there should be some limitation in connection with Interest Income. That may be whether or not solicitation was in public, relevant transactions continued recurrently and whole pictures were drawn in accordance with formalized covenants. Concrete degree of each element should be considered by next jurisprudences...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was the {{examination}} of communication issues in the field of law enforcement in order determine what effect if any, an officers’ organizational maturity has on their decision to utilize verbal and or non-verbal communications when performing their job, especially when interacting with citizens. The scope of this study is limited, as the research is only concerned with the opinions of patrol officers regarding their ability to effectively communicate verbally and non-verbally. In order to obtain patrol officer perspectives regarding this issue, and for convenience sake, a non-probability sample was established in which field training officers were selected to represent the larger population of patrol officers. As a result, field training officers were asked to complete a self directed survey regarding the importance verbal and non-verbal communications plays in doing the job of a patrol officer. The survey was designed to elicit unique insight into various aspects of verbal and non-verbal communication in order to determine if as a field training officer, they feel it would be beneficial to their profession as a whole, to receive training regarding the communicative arts. In <b>order</b> <b>for</b> law <b>enforcement</b> to continue to professionalize itself, enhanced communicative skill-sets are no longer an option, but rather a must. Thus, the present research attempts to shed light on this issue by surveying field training officers in order to gather information that can perhaps be utilized in designing a larger more specific study at a later time...|$|R
40|$|Since the FBI 2 ̆ 7 s post- 9 / 11 {{establishment}} of a preventative stance toward terrorism has increased the need for intelligence, the agency has turned to {{the increased use of}} immigration law to recruit additional confidential informants. Using the threat of immigration consequences-particularly deportation-to produce terrorism intelligence presents novel problems for both the intelligence gathering process and the informants. Informants recruited in this manner who also lack established ties to foreign terrorist organizations have an enormous incentive to fabricate information to fulfill their end of the agreement and avoid deportation. Recruiting informants via immigration law also affords less protection than recruiting them by offering monetary rewards or reductions in sentencing. Furthermore, the FBI 2 ̆ 7 s recruitment tactics encourage ethnic and religious profiling, alienating Muslim and Middle Eastern communities. Although Congress created the S- 6 visa classification specifically to induce cooperation from informants in terrorism investigations, the visa is rarely used due to its stringent eligibility requirements <b>for</b> informants. In <b>order</b> <b>for</b> law <b>enforcement</b> to successfully use the S- 6 visa program and to encourage the trust of and cooperation from informants, legislative overhaul is needed. An S- 6 visa program that emphasizes pre-existing ties to terrorist organizations, increases the availability of S- 6 visas, and lowers the barriers to the visas 2 ̆ 7 use will produce counterterrorism intelligence that is more reliable and actionable and provide greater protection for civil liberties and to informants themselves...|$|R
