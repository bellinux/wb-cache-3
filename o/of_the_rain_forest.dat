500|$|Operation Auca was {{an attempt}} by five Evangelical Christian missionaries from the United States to bring Christianity to the Huaorani people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> of Ecuador. The Huaorani, also known by the pejorative Aucas (a {{modification}} of awqa, the Quechua word for [...] "savages"), were an isolated tribe known for their violence, against both their own people and outsiders who entered their territory. With the intention {{of being the first}} Christians to evangelize the previously uncontacted Huaorani, the missionaries began making regular flights over Huaorani settlements in September 1955, dropping gifts, which were reciprocated. After several months of exchanging gifts, on January 3, 1956, the missionaries established a camp at [...] "Palm Beach", a sandbar along the Curaray River, a few kilometers from Huaorani settlements. Their efforts came to an end on January 8, 1956, when all five—Jim Elliot, Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Peter Fleming, and Roger Youderian—were attacked and speared by a group of Huaorani warriors. The news of their deaths was broadcast around the world, and Life magazine covered the event with a photo essay.|$|E

In Southwest Africa they inhabit the semi-desert or true desert. Farmed common ostriches in Australia have established [...] populations. The Arabian ostriches in the Near and Middle East were hunted to extinction {{by the middle of the}} 20th century. Attempts to reintroduce the common ostrich into Israel have failed. Common ostriches have occasionally been seen inhabiting islands on the Dahlak Archipelago, in the Red Sea near Eritrea.|$|E
