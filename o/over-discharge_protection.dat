30|$|Previously {{designed}} systems powered more energy-intensive Cartesian-based RepRap 3 -D printers (King et al. 2014). The Cartesian RepRap {{power systems}} use only two operational amplifier comparator circuits named as over-charge and <b>over-discharge</b> <b>protection</b> to control two MOSFET devices. The over-charge protection circuit allows the battery {{to be charged}} up to a specific voltage where the <b>over-discharge</b> <b>protection</b> cuts off the batteries when the state of charge of the battery is too low. Moreover, the only current limiter used in this schematic is a resistance placed in series with the batteries. The previous designs had efficiency losses {{from the use of}} a resistive element to limit the charging and discharging current of the battery from PV module. Secondly, this circuit is charging a pack of lithium ion batteries, which requires a specific CC and CV charging method or they suffer from capacity fading, swelling and even explosion, creating a potentially hazardous situation. An improved electrical design is simulated here for a MOST delta RepRap. The MOST Delta RepRap printer (Irwin et al. 2014; Anzalone et al. 2015) is a conglomeration of 4 stepper motor controlled by a motor drive controller based on the Arduino architecture and a resistively heated hot end with temperature feedback and position feedback from end stop mechanical switches.|$|E

When the lithium battery voltage {{is lower than the}} protection (the value can be adjusted by two resistors), U 12 (ST 2301) is disconnected, which cuts off the lithium battery power output to protect the battery from overdischarge.|$|R
40|$|To study an {{emergency}} power based on solar battery charging. Based on the electric-generation principle of solar panel, solar energy is changed into electrical energy. Through voltage conversion circuit and filter circuit, electrical energy {{is stored in}} the energy storage battery. The emergency power realizes the conversion from solar energy to electrical energy. The battery control unit has the function of PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) charging, overcharging <b>protection,</b> <b>over-discharging</b> <b>protection</b> and over-current protection. It also realizes the fast and safe charging of energy storage battery. The emergency power could provide both 12 V AC power for emergency equipment such as miniature PSA oxygen concentrator and 5 V USB for electronic equipment (mobile phone, GPS device, rechargeable light, etc.) ...|$|R
