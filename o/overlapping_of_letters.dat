In 2004, Italian professor Bruno Fabbiani claimed that examination of the 42-line Bible revealed an <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>letters,</b> suggesting that Gutenberg did not in fact use movable type (individual cast characters) but rather used whole plates made from a system somewhat like a modern typewriter, whereby the letters were stamped successively into the plate and then printed. However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of type as caused by paper movement over pieces of type of slightly unequal height.|$|E

We found the same increase in sensitivity to ERP priming effects in an orthographic priming experiment manipulating the position <b>of</b> <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> <b>letters</b> shared by primes and targets. Targets were 6 -letter words and primes were formed of the 1 st, 3 rd, 4 th, and 6 th <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> targets in the related condition. Primes could be concatenated or hyphenated and could be centered on fixation or displaced by two letter spaces to the left or right.

40|$|Viewing the world, we {{are confronted}} with {{multiple}} visual objects, each of which might be composed of multiple parts. How exactly our brain is able to recognize and identify these objects very quickly and easily, and how it constructs a representation of these objects is not yet clear. In this doctoral thesis, we focused on two aspects of visual object representations: (1) how do we learn to recognize objects and (2) what kind of relationship exists between the neural representations of complex visual stimuli and their constituent parts? For the first question, we studied characteristics of perceptual learning of complex objects, {{using a combination of}} behavioral and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) experiments. One studied aspect was how general the learning effect is when participants are trained to recognize objects. We found that both general and specific learning processes are involved: while the learning effect is specific for the trained stimulus set, partial transfer of learning was found over different paradigms and changes in appearance of the stimuli (different exemplars and orientation). Additionally, we found that object learning benefits from sleep between training sessions and that mere exposure to the objects while performing another task is not sufficient to train object recognition. Finally, the involvement of the lateral occipital complex in object learning was directly tested using tDCS. Stimulation of lateral occipital cortex with tDCS during training resulted in a larger training effect. In the second part, we looked at what kind of relationship exists between the representations of ‘wholes’ and their constituent parts. In an fMRI study, we studied the relationship between neural responses to single objects and object pairs and the modulation of this relationship based on co-location for action and a task effect. Response patterns of object pairs were best predicted by a weighted average of the response patterns of the constituent single objects, with the maximum response weighted more than the minimum response. The max and min response were weighted differently for different types of object pairs when participants attended to the configuration. In a high-field fMRI study we investigated the effect of changing one or more parts (<b>letters)</b> <b>of</b> a word by means of a parametric manipulation of orthographic similarity in real and pseudowords. We found that the visual word form area is responsive to lexical status, but both real words and pseudowords were further processed in terms of orthographic similarity. Similarity of the underlying neural response patterns is thus related to <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> parts (<b>letters)</b> between different words and word-like stimuli. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Objective　To {{study the}} <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> {{involved}} organs in functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) {{occurring in the}} Chinese naval servicemen, {{and to provide a}} sound basis for its diagnosis and treatment. Methods　From November 2006 to April 2007, a questionnaire survey was conducted in 8600 officers and soldiers of Chinese naval force in three regions using randomized, stratified, multistage sampling method. All respondents completed the Rome Ⅲ Modular Questionnaire. The collected data were double input by EpiData 3. 02 software and analyzed by SPSS 13. 0 software. Results　 7454 valid questionnaires were retrieved. The incidence <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> was 46. 7 % involving two to five sites. In two-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs, the incidence <b>of</b> <b>overlap</b> functional gastroduodenal disorder (FGD) and functional bowel disorder (FBD) was shown to be highest (51. 2 %, 339 / 662), followed by the <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> functional esophageal disorder (FED) and FBD (15. 4 %, 102 / 662). In three-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs, the <b>overlapping</b> rate <b>of</b> FED, FGD and FBD was the highest (44. 4 %, 151 / 340), followed by that of FGD, FBD and functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS) (20. 3 %, 69 / 340). The commonest four-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs included FED, FGD, FBD and FAPS (57. 7 %, 94 / 163). The five-site <b>overlap</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs was the combination of FED, FGD, FBD, FAPS and functional anorectal disorder (FAD). The incidence of FGIDs in southern military region was 49. 8 % (987 / 1983), which was higher than that of northern (31. 8 %, 1064 / 3351) and eastern (23. 8 %, 533 / 2240) regions. The incidence of FGIDs of single organ was 44. 9 % in southern military region, which was lower than 59. 0 % in eastern and 58. 4 % in northern region. The incidence of the illness involving two to five sites were higher in southern military region as compared with that of eastern and northern regions. Conclusions　The rate <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> <b>of</b> FGIDs at different sites is common in the Chinese naval servicemen. There is a difference in rate <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> between different military areas. More attention should be paid to the prevention and treatment <b>of</b> <b>overlapping</b> organs in FGIDs in the Chinese naval servicemen...|$|R
