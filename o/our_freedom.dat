Polish revolutionaries participated in uprisings in Prussia, the Austrian Empire and Imperial Russia. Polish legions fought alongside Napoleon and, under the slogan of For <b>our</b> <b>freedom</b> and yours, participated widely in the Spring of Nations (particularly the Hungarian Revolution of 1848).|$|E

25|$|Modern {{social theory}} {{contains}} {{a tension between}} the realization of human freedom {{and the necessity of}} social rules. Liberal political theorists of the seventeenth century, such as Hobbes and Locke, saw the issue as one of sacrificing some individual freedoms in order to gain others. They understood social rules as enabling constraints—necessary impositions that limited activity in some spheres in order to expand it in others. (For example, traffic laws compel us to drive {{on one side of the}} road but allow us to travel more freely than if we were constantly assailed by oncoming traffic.) In the socio-political realm, these early liberal thinkers argued that we agree to surrender <b>our</b> <b>freedom</b> for political authority in order to gain greater freedom from a state of nature. The sovereign authority is a constraint, but it allows freedom from the constraints that other individuals might impose upon us. In this way, rules are always seen as a means of increasing freedom rather than rescinding it.|$|E
25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job.

500|$|Justice Scalia {{also criticized}} the majority's {{conclusion}} that the tip provided reasonable suspicion that Lorenzo and Jose Prado Navarette were driving while drunk, because [...] "the truck might have swerved to avoid an animal, a pothole, or a jaywalking pedestrian .... Or, indeed, he might have intentionally forced the tipster off the road because of some personal animus, or hostility to her 'Make Love, Not War' bumper sticker." [...] Furthermore, Justice Scalia argued that one discrete instance of irregular driving does not give rise to the reasonable suspicion of an ongoing threat of an intoxicated driver on the road. Justice Scalia also argued that the anonymous tip's claims of reckless driving were ultimately discredited {{by the fact that}} officers followed Lorenzo and Jose for five minutes, but observed nothing suspicious. He wrote, [...] "I take it as a fundamental premise of our intoxicated-driving laws that a driver soused enough to swerve once can be expected to swerve again — and soon. If he does not, and if the only evidence of his first episode of irregular driving is a mere inference from an uncorroborated, vague, and nameless tip, then the Fourth Amendment requires that he be left alone." [...] In his concluding remarks, Justice Scalia wrote [...] "runken driving is a serious matter, but so is the loss of <b>our</b> <b>freedom</b> to come and go as we please without police interference .... After today’s opinion all of us on the road, and not just drug dealers, are at risk of having <b>our</b> <b>freedom</b> of movement curtailed on suspicion of drunkenness, based upon a phone tip, true or false, of a single instance of careless driving." ...|$|E

While {{most of the}} gigs were booked in North America, two dates—July 4 and 5—were in London's Roundhouse venue and Dingwalls, respectively. Linda Stein pushed to make these events happen, setting up the band performances in the UK during the United States Bicentennial. Fields relates: [...] "On the two-hundredth anniversary of <b>our</b> <b>freedom,</b> we were bringing Great Britain a gift that was forever going to disrupt their sensibilities." [...] The band sold out for their first London performance, with an audience of roughly 3,000. Leigh described the Dingwalls gig as very similar to performances at CBGB.

[...] The future world in Minority Report of retinal scans, robotic human inspectors, and intrusive, individualized, public advertising arrived in American theaters as the country was debating how much governmental intrusion into personal matters was necessary to ensure safety of its citizens. Spielberg said he would be against a PreCrime system if it were ever possible, as he believes that if it did exist, those in control of it would undoubtedly abuse its powers. Kowalski questions what the benevolent precogs in the film could become in the hands of those who trained their skills for political intrigue. Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl asserts that in a political context, PreCrime may be seen [...] "a metaphor for racial profiling, and one could view the liberation of the precogs as the end of a form of slavery." ...|$|E

500|$|Some of British punk rock's leading figures {{made a show}} of rejecting {{not only}} {{contemporary}} mainstream rock and the broader culture it was associated with, but their own most celebrated music predecessors: [...] "No Elvis, Beatles or the Rolling Stones in 1977", declared the Clash song [...] "1977". The previous year, when the punk rock revolution began in Great Britain, was to be both a musical and a cultural [...] "Year Zero". Even as nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a nihilistic attitude summed up by the Sex Pistols slogan [...] "No Future"; in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, [...] "punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England." [...] While [...] "self-imposed alienation" [...] was common among [...] "drunk punks" [...] and [...] "gutter punks", there was always a tension between their nihilistic outlook and the [...] "radical leftist utopianism" [...] of bands such as Crass, who found positive, liberating meaning in the movement.

His goal was to have his act be witnessed by nearly 100,000 spectators, including numerous journalists and the national leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party. He set himself ablaze {{during one of the}} festival dances using a flammable solvent. This method of protest was likely inspired by recent series of similar protests by Buddhist monks in Vietnam, most notably that of Thích Quảng Đức. He had a banner with the words [...] "For <b>our</b> <b>freedom</b> and yours" [...] and [...] "Honour, Fatherland" [...] as well as some leaflets, which he is said to have thrown around right before the incident, though neither attracted much attention, and both items are primarily mentioned only in the documents of the investigating secret police. He refused immediate help and shouted [...] "I protest". He retained consciousness after the flames had been extinguished, giving brief statements, as well as later when he was transferred to a hospital (Szpital Praski), where he was able to communicate with the medical personnel, and where he received a brief visit from his wife. In the hospital, he was put under police surveillance, dying four days later on 12 September.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but if we lose <b>our</b> <b>freedom,</b> we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E
