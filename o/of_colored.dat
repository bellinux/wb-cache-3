40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} what {{a philosophical}} and a logical investigation <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> amounts to {{in contrast to}} other kinds <b>of</b> <b>color</b> analysis such as physical, physiological, chemical, psychological or cultural analysis <b>of</b> <b>colors.</b> Neither a philosophical nor a logical analysis <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> is concerned with specific aspects <b>of</b> <b>colors.</b> Rather, these kinds <b>of</b> <b>color</b> analysis are concerned with {{what one might call}} “logical foundations <b>of</b> <b>color</b> theory”. I will illustrate this first by considering philosophical and then logical analysis <b>of</b> <b>colors...</b>|$|R

The Encyclopedia also delves into color as it applies to other domains such as art and design – ie – color design, color harmony, color palettes, color and accessibility, researching color deficiency, and color and data visualization. There is also information on color in art conservation, color and architecture, color and educations, color and culture, and an overview of the history <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and comments on the future <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> This unique work will extend the influence <b>of</b> <b>color</b> to a much wider audience than has been possible to date...|$|R
5|$|In 1896, the National Association <b>of</b> <b>Colored</b> Women {{was formed}} to promote the needs of black women.

She was threatened by members of the resurgent Ku Klux Klan in those years.

50|$|Retaining {{teachers}} <b>of</b> <b>color</b> is {{an important}} element of teacher retention.

50|$|One of {{the topics}} in the {{philosophy}} <b>of</b> <b>color</b> {{is the problem of}} the ontology <b>of</b> <b>color.</b> The questions comprising this field of research are, for example, what kind <b>of</b> properties <b>colors</b> are (i.e. are they physical properties of objects? Or are they properties of their own kind?), but also problems about the representation <b>of</b> <b>colors,</b> and the relationship between the representation <b>of</b> <b>colors</b> and their ontological constitution.|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the challenges of}} intra-race legal representation for lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> law students <b>of</b> <b>color,</b> and those teaching law students <b>of</b> <b>color</b> by analyzing how {{the dynamics of the}} lawyer’s and client’s racial sameness impact legal representation. This Article brings together three strands of lawyering theory – the role of race in lawyering, critical race theory, {{and the role of the}} lawyer in intra-race legal representation. In doing so, this Article explores a number of provocative questions: Does being the same race as their clients make lawyers better legal representatives? Should lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> embrace or resist race’s influence on intra-race legal representation? How do lawyers balance their desire to remain representative of their race with their responsibility to their clients? This Article also scrutinizes the role of the lawyer <b>of</b> <b>color</b> in intra-race legal representation by examining questions that are under-reviewed, such as: Do lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> engage in the same explicit and implicit biases against their clients <b>of</b> <b>color</b> that lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> similarly suffer? Do racial stereotypes tempt the lawyer to be more sympathetic towards, and understanding of, their same-race clients, or does it cause the lawyer to view the same-race client as an ‘other’? For lawyers <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and clients <b>of</b> <b>color</b> who seek same-race legal representation, this Article explores a difficult question— Is the lawyer <b>of</b> <b>color</b> representative enough <b>of</b> the race to be a representative for the client, particularly when the lawyer <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and the client <b>of</b> <b>color</b> live in different socio-economic environments? Given the resurgent examination of the role of race in interactions between persons <b>of</b> <b>color</b> and persons <b>of</b> power, this Article presents a timely opportunity to examine and question the role of race and the impact of divergent socio-economic status in intra-race legal representation...|$|R
