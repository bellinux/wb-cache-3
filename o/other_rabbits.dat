5|$|Blackberry: A clever buck rabbit with black-tipped ears. He {{is often}} capable of {{understanding}} concepts that the <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> find incomprehensible. He realises, for instance, that wood floats, and the rabbits use this tactic twice {{to travel on}} water. He also works out how to dismantle the snare that almost kills Bigwig, saving him. He is one of Hazel's most trusted advisors, given the task to plan a way to rescue does from Efrafa.|$|E
5|$|In the Sandleford warren, Fiver, a young runt rabbit {{who is a}} seer, {{receives}} a frightening vision of his warren's imminent destruction. When {{he and his brother}} Hazel fail to convince their chief rabbit of the need to evacuate, they set out on their own, accompanied by nine <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> who choose to go with them. The first challenge in the small band's search for a new home comes immediately, as they are forced to elude the Owsla, the warren's military caste.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Hazel and Pipkin, the {{smallest}} {{member of the}} group, scout the nearby Nuthanger Farm, where they find two pairs of hutch rabbits. Despite their uncertainty about living wild, the hutch rabbits are willing to come to Watership. Hazel leads a raid on the farm the next day, during which he rescues both does but {{only one of the}} bucks. When the emissary returns soon after, Hazel and his rabbits learn that Efrafa is a police state led by the despotic General Woundwort. Holly and the <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> dispatched there have managed to return with little more than their lives intact.|$|E

50|$|Edaphodon {{is similar}} to <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> fishes in appearance. Like other chimaeriforms, it fed using six tooth plates (one pair on the lower jaw and two pairs on the upper). Probably, it laid eggs in a {{leathery}} pouch like <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> fish, but no occurrences of this have been recorded. Edaphodon had a sloping head and a mouth on its underside, allowing it to graze {{along the bottom of}} the ocean like a land-dwelling herbivore, but actually it was feeding on small benthic animals.|$|R
60|$|Harry (Continuing). Well, {{it looked}} as tho' {{he would do it}} too. So I went. (Moody.) It seems to me {{sometimes}} I was born to them by a mistake... in that <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> hutch of a house.|$|R
25|$|On {{the night}} of the Ball, Periwinkle takes centre stage with his moves, unaware of Madga's plan: the whole of Beechwood is {{supposed}} to laugh at him in embarrassment. However, a white owl in the audience exposes the magpie's trick. Recognising his steps, she asks Periwinkle to dance them again, much to the joy of his family and the <b>other</b> <b>rabbits.</b> He continues until dawn, when the Bellflowers return home.|$|E
500|$|Strawberry: Buck from Cowslip's warren {{who leaves}} with the Watership Down rabbits after his doe is {{killed by a}} snare. Strawberry is strong and sleek but not as hardy as the <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> given his warren {{upbringing}} but learns quickly and gets along well with the group. It {{is for this reason}} that he is selected to represent the rabbits on an expedition to Efrafa.|$|E
2500|$|A {{young rabbit}} named Periwinkle Bellflower ("Agaric Passiflore" [...] in the French version) learns of the summertime Full Moon Ball {{that will soon}} {{take place in the}} {{community}} of Beechwood Grove. Unlike the <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> in his family, he cannot dance, and this makes him sad. But, {{with the help of a}} conniving magpie, Magda, and a wood pigeon and a frog as his teachers, he soon learns how to do so in a couple of days.|$|E
5000|$|At a {{juvenile}} age, Netherland Dwarfs (as with most <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> breeds) should be fed unlimited quantities of alfalfa pellets and hay. As they age, the alfalfa should be gradually replaced with other hays and pellets. The pellets should {{be reduced to}} proportion {{with the weight of}} the rabbit.|$|R
50|$|The Shrew - His {{territory}} {{possesses a}} bountiful field of dandelions, which he guards against Peter <b>Rabbit,</b> or any <b>other</b> <b>rabbit.</b> He once tracked down Peter to his burrow {{to demand the}} return of dandelions picked by Peter and his friends. He {{is the object of}} Cotton-tail's affection, much to his dismay.|$|R
50|$|Funnel {{web spider}} {{antivenom}} is prepared from the plasma of rabbits immunized with the venom {{of the male}} funnel web spider (Atrax robustus). Each vial of the product contains 125 units of antivenom which has been standardized to neutralize 1.25 mg of funnel web spider venom. The product also contains glycine and <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> plasma proteins.|$|R

"We got {{separated}} in the woods--they going off for some rabbits {{in one direction}} and we going off after some <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> in another direction," [...] explained the oldest Rover boy. [...] "I don't know where those other cadets are now. Probably they went back to the school." ...|$|E
60|$|If {{the history}} of these Porto Santo rabbits had not been known, most naturalists, on observing their much reduced size, their colour, reddish above and grey beneath, their tails and ears not tipped with black, would have ranked them as a {{distinct}} species. They would have been strongly confirmed in this view by seeing them alive in the Zoological Gardens, and hearing that they refused to couple with <b>other</b> <b>rabbits.</b> Yet this rabbit, which {{there can be little}} doubt would thus have been ranked as a distinct species, as certainly originated since the year 1420. Finally, from the three cases of the rabbits which have run wild in Porto Santo, Jamaica, and the Falkland Islands, we see that these animals do not, under new conditions of life, revert to or retain their aboriginal character, as is so generally asserted to be the case by most authors.|$|E
50|$|During the Pickax Now celebrations, Qwilleran {{attends the}} Ogilvie-Fugtree reunion. Two cousins go out rabbit hunting, {{and only one}} returns. Both were set to receive a large sum of money from a rich uncle. The <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> hunter is indeed found dead, so the first is arrested. However, he is later {{released}} {{because of a lack}} of evidence.|$|R
5000|$|The cottontail rabbit, Sylvilagus, is {{expanding}} into the volcano rabbit’s niche, {{but there is}} “no evidence that rabbits' habitat selection {{is a response to}} competitive exclusion." [...] The volcano rabbit has been severely pressured by human intrusion into its habitat. Anthropogenic disturbance enables <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> species to flourish in grasslands, increasing competition with the volcano rabbit.|$|R
40|$|Progesterone {{receptor}} from rabbit uterine cytosol was purified to {{a specific}} activity of approximately 2 nmol of bound hormone per mg of protein. A goat was immunized with this preparation and, after two injections of 0. 7 - 0. 8 nmol, yielded antireceptor antibodies. The antiserum reacted with both cytosolic and nuclear rabbit progesterone receptor and also with progesterone receptor from <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> tissues (vagina and pituitary). A crossreaction was observed with progesterone receptors from other mammalian, especially human, tissues (cytosolic receptor from rat and guinea pig uterus, cytosolic receptor from human breast cancer, and nuclear receptor from human endometrium). On the contrary, there was no interaction with a nonmammalian receptor (chicken oviduct progesterone receptor). The antibodies did not crossreact with <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> steroid receptors (uterine estradiol receptor and liver glucocorticoid receptor) or with nonreceptor progesterone-binding proteins (transcortin from plasma and uteroglobin from uterine fluid) ...|$|R
60|$|Once {{there was}} a curious {{performance}} over across the clearing. I could not see it very plainly, but it looked {{very much like a}} boxing match. A queer sound, put-a-put-a-put-a-put, first drew my attention to it. Two rabbits were {{at the edge of the}} ferns, standing up on their hind legs, face to face, and apparently cuffing each other soundly, while they hopped slowly around and around in a circle. I could not see the blows but only the boxing attitude, and hear the sounds as they landed on each other's ribs. The <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> did not seem to mind it, as they would have done had it been a fight, but stopped occasionally to watch the two, and then went on with their fun-making. Since then I have read of tame hares that did the same thing, but I have never seen it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It IS fun--when you're {{the genuine}} article," [...] agreed his Majesty. [...] "But {{look at me}} now! I live in a marble palace instead of {{a hole in the}} ground. I have all I want to eat, without the joy of hunting for it. Every day I must dress in fine clothes and wear that horrible crown till it makes my head ache. Rabbits come to me with all sorts of {{troubles}}, when my own troubles are the only ones I care about. When I walk out I can't hop and run; I must strut on my rear legs and wear an ermine robe! And the soldiers salute me and the band plays and the <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> laugh and clap their paws and cry out: 'Hail to the King!' Now let me ask you, as a friend and a young lady of good judgment: isn't all this pomp and foolishness enough to make a decent rabbit miserable?" ...|$|E
60|$|Foolish Peter Rabbit! There he was boasting and bragging {{to himself}} {{of what he}} would do to some one whom he hadn't even seen, all because he had found a sign that told him the Old Pasture, in which he had made up his mind to make his new home, was already the home of some one else. Peter was like a lot of other people; he wasn't fair. No, Sir, he wasn't fair. He let his own desires destroy his sense of fair play. It was all right for him to put up signs in the dear Old Briar-patch and the Green Forest, warning <b>other</b> <b>Rabbits</b> that they must keep away, but it was all wrong for another Rabbit {{to do the same thing}} in the Old Pasture. Oh, my, yes! That was quite a {{different}} matter! The very thought of it made Peter very, very angry. When he thought of this other Rabbit, it was always as the stranger. That shows just how unfair Peter was, because, you see, Peter himself was really the stranger. It was his first visit to the Old Pasture, while it was very plain that the other had lived there for some time.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand White rabbits have {{a genetic}} {{deviation}} called albinism. Albinism {{is caused by}} a lack of melanin, which is a pigment that gives all creatures, including humans, their skin/fur/hair/eye color. The snowy coat of a New Zealand white rabbit is a normal length like <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> breeds. Most New Zealand rabbits also have a white/pink/light brownish tint to their noses.|$|R
60|$|Peter hopped {{up close}} to it. Then he sat up very {{straight}} and stretched himself as tall as he could, but he wisely took care not to rub against the tree. You see, he didn't want to leave his own mark there. So he stretched and stretched, but stretch as he would, he couldn't make his wobbly little nose reach the mark made by the <b>other</b> <b>Rabbit.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The more {{he chewed}} his temper, the angrier he grew. He {{was big and}} stout and strong and gray. He had lived so long in the Old Pasture that he felt that it belonged to him and that no <b>other</b> <b>Rabbit</b> had any right there unless he said so. Yet here was a strange Rabbit who had had the impudence to come up from the Green Meadows and refused to be driven away. Such impudence! ...|$|R
6000|$|The hare-coloured, or, {{as it is}} {{sometimes}} called, the Belgian rabbit, differs in nothing except colour from the other large breeds; but Mr. J. Young, of Southampton, a great breeder of this kind, informs me that the females, in all the specimens examined by him, had only six mammae; and this certainly {{was the case with}} two females which came into my possession. Mr. B.P. Brent, however, assures me that the number is variable with other domestic rabbits. The common wild rabbit always has ten mammae. The Angora rabbit is remarkable from the length and fineness of its fur, which even on the soles of the feet is of considerable length. This breed is the only one which differs in its mental qualities, for it is said to be much more sociable than <b>other</b> <b>rabbits,</b> and the male shows no wish to destroy its young. (4/9. 'Journal of Horticulture' 1861 page 380.) Two live rabbits were brought to me from Moscow, of {{about the size of the}} wild species, but with long soft fur, different from that of the Angora. These Moscow rabbits had pink eyes and were snow-white, excepting the ears, two spots near the nose, the upper and under surface of the tail, and the hinder tarsi, which were blackish-brown. In short, they were coloured nearly like the so-called Himalayan rabbits, presently to be described, and differed from them only in the character of their fur. There are two other breeds which come true to colour, but differ in no other respect, namely silver-greys and chinchillas. Lastly, the Nicard or Dutch rabbit may be mentioned, which varies in colour, and is remarkable from its small size, some specimens weighing only 1 1/4 pounds; rabbits of this breed make excellent nurses for other and more delicate kinds. (4/10. 'Journal of Horticulture' May 28, 1861 page 169.) ...|$|E
50|$|The fairy {{takes the}} rabbit to the forest, where she meets the <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> {{and gives the}} {{velveteen}} rabbit a kiss. The velveteen rabbit changes into a real rabbit and joins the <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> in the forest. The next spring, the rabbit returns {{to look at the}} boy, and the boy sees a resemblance to his old velveteen rabbit.|$|E
50|$|Flemish Giants can be fed like <b>other</b> <b>rabbits,</b> {{with the}} amount of food {{increased}} to match their larger size. ARBA recommendations include hay and occasional treats.|$|E
6000|$|As the sun {{was going}} down, we saw the first {{specimen}} of an animal known familiarly over two thousand miles of mountain and desert--from Kansas clear to the Pacific Ocean--as the [...] "jackass rabbit." [...] He is well named. He is just like any <b>other</b> <b>rabbit,</b> except that he is from one third to twice as large, has longer legs in proportion to his size, and has the most preposterous ears that ever were mounted on any creature but a jackass.|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{presented}} that rabbit homocytotropic antibody prepared against ovalbumin bears allotypic markers of both group a (heavy chain) and group b (light chain). This was shown by specific removal of activity in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis assays by anti-allotype immunoadsorbents. The homocytotropic antibody has properties which indicate that it belongs to {{a new class of}} rabbit immunoglobulin. These results demonstrate that this newly described class possesses the allotypes of both groups a and b, as has been previously shown for <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> immunoglobulin classes...|$|R
2500|$|Hares {{and rabbits}} have {{appeared}} as a representation or manifestation of various deities in many cultures, including: Hittavainen, Finnish god of Hares; Kaltes-Ekwa, Siberian goddess of the moon; Jade Rabbit, maker of medicine on the moon for the Chinese gods, depicted often with a mortar and pestle; Ometotchtli (Two Rabbits,) Aztec god of fertility, etc., who led 400 <b>other</b> <b>Rabbit</b> gods known as the Centzon Totochtin; Kalulu, Tumbuka mythology (Central African) Trickster god; and Nanabozho (Great Rabbit,) Ojibway deity, a shape-shifter and a cocreator of the world. [...] See generally, Rabbits in the arts.|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to their}} {{difference}} from other breeds of domestic rabbit, the Belgian Hare may require different dietary and housing requirements to <b>other</b> <b>rabbits,</b> {{and as a}} result, they may demand more attention and care.|$|E
50|$|As with <b>other</b> <b>rabbits,</b> {{they may}} carry STDs and also this breed {{does not do}} well in high or low temperatures. Sore or abscessed feet are common when housed only on wire with no solid surface to rest on.|$|E
50|$|The Riverine rabbit is polygamous, {{the male}} mating {{with more than}} one female. Like <b>other</b> <b>rabbits,</b> it bears its young {{underground}} for protection. The single offspring that the rabbit produces is born altricial, or bald, blind, and helpless, and weighs from 40 to 50 grams. The Riverine rabbit is the only African rabbit that bears its young underground. The helpless offspring stays with the mother until it is capable of living on its own and fending for itself. The low breeding rate of only one offspring per year is unlike most <b>other</b> <b>rabbits</b> and has led to attempts to increase numbers of this endangered species. A breeding colony has been established at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre near Pretoria.|$|E
40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of the N-terminal 48 residues of the heavy chain derived from a homogeneous rabbit antibody to type III pneumococci is described. This chain of allotype a 2 is compared with <b>other</b> <b>rabbit</b> heavy chains of allotypes a 1, a 2 and a 3. Within the N-terminal 25 positions, two chains which carry the same allotype a 2 possess identical {{amino acid sequence}}s, but differ markedly from heavy chains of allotypes a 1 and a 3. Sequence variability is observed in residues 26 – 27 and 30 – 34, but not in residues 35 – 48...|$|R
60|$|But Peter couldn't or wouldn't see that. He {{had counted}} {{so much on}} having the Old Pasture to himself and doing as he pleased, {{that he was too}} upset and {{disappointed}} to be fair. If the <b>other</b> <b>Rabbit</b> had been smaller than he--well, that might have made a difference. The truth is, Peter was just a wee bit afraid. And perhaps it was that wee bit of fear that made him unfair and unjust. Anyway, the longer he sat and thought about it, the angrier he grew, and the more he bragged and boasted to himself about what he would do.|$|R
50|$|Rabbits re-infected {{with the}} virus exhibit some or {{complete}} immunity, and can transmit the virus to <b>other</b> wild <b>rabbits,</b> and from wild to domestic rabbits. A domestic strain cannot transmit to another domestic rabbit, however.|$|R
