5|$|King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> (1993) was a {{professional}} wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). This {{was the first of}} ten King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> events that was produced as a pay-per-view. The event resulted from the WWF's decision to make its annual King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> tournament into a televised event. It took place on June 13, 1993, at the Nutter Center in Dayton, Ohio. The card featured ten matches, which resulted from scripted storylines and had results predetermined by the WWF.|$|E
5|$|The {{attendance}} for {{the event}} was 6,500 fans, who paid a total of $80,000 in admission. This is the lowest attendance figure for a King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> event. The attendance the following year was almost twice as large, as 12,000 fans attended King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> 1994. The PPV buyrate was 1.1, which was the highest buyrate in King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> history until the 1999 event.|$|E
5|$|Control {{went back}} and forth at the {{beginning}} of the match between Hulk Hogan and Earthquake. When Earthquake rolled out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring,</b> both wrestlers' corner-men got involved, as Hogan and the Big Boss Man fought against Earthquake and Dino Bravo. Bravo and Earthquake powerslammed Hogan while the referee was distracted, which allowed Earthquake to lock Hogan in a Boston crab hold. After being powerslammed outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> by Earthquake, Hogan tried to lift his opponent but was unsuccessful. Earthquake powerslammed Hogan and performed two Earthquake splashes but was unable to get the pinfall. Hogan recovered and bodyslammed Earthquake. He performed a legdrop on Earthquake before Earthquake's manager, Jimmy Hart interfered. Hogan threw him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> and then bodyslammed Earthquake onto a table at ringside. Hogan got back into the ring and won the match via countout. Earthquake attacked Hogan after the match, but the Big Boss Man saved Hogan by hitting Earthquake with a chair.|$|E

5|$|Crush faced WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels {{several times}} in early 1993 {{but was unable to}} win the title belt. The pair also faced each other in a {{qualifying}} match for the King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> tournament on the May 23 episode of WWF Superstars. The match ended in a double countout, however, and both wrestlers were eliminated from the tournament. It was later announced that they would wrestle each other at King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> 1993, with Michaels's championship on the line.|$|E
5|$|Crush {{would become}} a hired gun for his manager Mr. Fuji, helping his new client Jeff Jarrett win a King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> {{qualifying}} match against Lex Luger on the May 21 episode of Superstars by attacking Luger outside the ring, causing him to lose by count-out. In retaliation, Luger cost Crush, a King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> qualifying lumberjack match against Tatanka on the June 6 episode of Raw. As a result, the pair began a short program. During the rivalry, Crush formed a tag team with Fuji's client Yokozuna, challenging The Headshrinkers for the Tag Team Championship at King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring.</b> They lost the match after Luger distracted Crush. Their rivalry culminated in a match on the August 21 episode of Sunday Night Slam, which Luger won after Ted DiBiase distracted Crush. After the loss, Crush left WWF.|$|E

5|$|In {{visible and}} {{near-infrared}} light, the rings have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is neutral or blue in color. The {{size of the}} dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is probably {{in the range of}} 1011to 1016kg.

5|$|Reviews of {{the event}} have been mainly positive. Several reviewers have called Bret Hart's matches the {{highlight}} of the PPV. The match for the Intercontinental Championship has received positive reviews, but the ending to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, which featured Hulk Hogan in his final PPV appearance in the WWF until 2002, has been criticized. The event was attended by 6,500 fans — the lowest attendance of any King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> event. The PPV buyrate, however, was the highest of any King <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ring</b> event until 1999.

5|$|A {{powerful}} way {{of studying}} rings is through their modules. A module {{consists of a}} choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an element <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> and {{an element of the}} module and returns an element of the module. The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an algebra. (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.|$|E
