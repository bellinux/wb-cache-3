40|$|As large {{utility-scale}} {{solar photovoltaic}} (PV) and {{concentrating solar power}} (CSP) facilities are currently being built and planned for locations in the U. S. with the greatest solar resource potential, an understanding of water use for construction and operations is needed as siting tends to target locations with low natural rainfall and where most existing freshwater is already appropriated. Using methods outlined by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to determine water used in designated solar energy zones (SEZs) for construction and operations&maintenance, an estimate of water used over the lifetime at the solar power plant is determined and applied to each watershed in six Southwestern states. Results indicate that that PV systems overall use little water, though construction usage is high compared to O&M water use over the lifetime of the facility. Also noted is a transition being made from wet cooled to dry cooled CSP facilities that will significantly reduce <b>operational</b> <b>water</b> <b>use</b> at these facilities. Using these water use factors, estimates of future water demand for current and planned solar development was made. In efforts to determine where water could be a limiting factor in solar energy development, water availability, cost, and projected future competing demands were mapped for the six Southwestern states.

40|$|Urbanization, climate, and {{ecosystem}} change represent major challenges for managing water resources. Although water systems are complex, a need exists for a generalized representation {{of these systems}} to identify important components and linkages to guide scientific inquiry and aid water management. We developed an integrated Structure-Actor-Water framework (iSAW) to facilitate the understanding of and transitions to sustainable water systems. Our goal was to produce an interdisciplinary framework for water resources research that could address management challenges across scales (e. g., plot to region) and domains (e. g., water supply and quality, transitioning, and urban landscapes). The framework {{was designed to be}} generalizable across all human–environment systems, yet with sufficient detail and flexibility to be customized to specific cases. iSAW includes three major components: structure (natural, built, and social), actors (individual and organizational), and water (quality and quantity). Key linkages among these components include: (1) ecological/hydrologic processes, (2) ecosystem/geomorphic feedbacks, (3) planning, design, and policy, (4) perceptions, information, and experience, (5) resource access and risk, and (6) <b>operational</b> <b>water</b> <b>use</b> and management. We illustrate the flexibility and utility of the iSAW framework by applying it to two research and management problems: understanding urban water supply and demand in a changing climate and expanding use of green storm water infrastructure in a semi-arid environment. The applications demonstrate that a generalized conceptual model can identify important components and linkages in complex and diverse water systems and facilitate communication about those systems among researchers from diverse disciplines...|$|E

40|$|Most {{studies on}} the {{environmental}} performance of buildings focus on energy demand and associated greenhouse gas emissions. They often neglect to consider the range of other resource demands and environmental impacts associated with buildings, including water. Studies that assess <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in buildings typically consider only <b>operational</b> <b>water,</b> which excludes the embodied water in building materials or the water associated with the mobility of building occupants. A new framework is presented that quantifies water requirements at the building scale (i. e. the embodied and <b>operational</b> <b>water</b> of the building {{as well as its}} maintenance and refurbishment) and at the city scale (i. e. the embodied water of nearby infrastructures such as roads, gas distribution and others) and the transport-related indirect <b>water</b> <b>use</b> of building occupants. A case study house located in Melbourne, Australia, is analysed using the new framework. The results show that each of the embodied, operational and transport requirements is nearly equally important. By integrating these three water requirements, the developed framework provides architects, building designers, planners and decision-makers with a powerful means to understand and effectively reduce the overall <b>water</b> <b>use</b> and associated environmental impacts of residential buildings.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, the {{neighbourhood}} scale has gained {{importance in the}} field of sustainable construction. To support designers and building stakeholders in the design of sustainable buildings and neighbourhoods, several sustainability assessment tools have been developed. Among these tools, a distinction can be made between scoring tools and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools. Scoring tools assign scores to a number of criteria covering a wide range of sustainability issues, such as energy use, material use, water use, user transport and comfort. LCA tools are based on a systematic study of the environmental impacts caused during the entire life span of the building or neighbourhood. Although LCA tools are preferred because of their transparency and scientific base, current tools are mostly limited to the assessment of individual buildings and only cover the environmental dimension of sustainability. In this PhD research a sustainability assessment method for neighbourhoods is developed using an integrated life cycle approach. This integrated approach combines an assessment of the economic, environmental and social performance of neighbourhoods, together with an assessment of the neighbourhood qualities. The assessment method is based on an existing assessment method for buildings, SuFiQuaD (i. e. Sustainability, Financial and Quality evaluation of Dwelling types), which is extended to the neighbourhood scale level and refined to include additional evaluation aspects related to operational energy use, <b>operational</b> <b>water</b> <b>use,</b> neighbourhood land use, user transport and neighbourhood qualities. To deal with the complexity of the neighbourhood, a hierarchic assessment structure in line with the principles of the “element method for cost control” and a subdivision in various scale levels, is implemented. The approach, which is translated in a modular spreadsheet tool, is applicable during the various design stages, from rough estimations in the master planning to detailed impact calculations in later design stages. The assessment method is applied to analyse the impact of neighbourhood elements (i. e. neighbourhood infrastructure and open spaces) and to compare four neighbourhood models with various layouts and built densities. First, the analysis reveals that neighbourhood elements have a non-negligible contribution to the neighbourhood impact, especially in low built density neighbourhoods, where these contribute to about 20 % and 30 % of the environmental and financial impact of material use respectively. Second, the comparison between neighbourhoods built according to former building practice (before the 1970 s energy crisis) and current building practice (year 2017) shows the high influence of the construction standards. The environmental and financial impact of the neighbourhoods in line with the current practice is about 60 % and 30 % lower respectively, which is mainly a consequence of the stricter energy performance requirements. Third, the comparison between the neighbourhood models reveals the high influence of the urban form and built density. When considering the current building practice, environmental and financial impact reductions up to 10 % and 20 % respectively are obtained for the neighbourhood model with the highest built density, compared to the model with the lowest built density. Appropriate urban planning and denser neighbourhood layouts are therefore recommended to reduce the impact of the built environment. Finally, the assessment method is compared with a number of well-known scoring tools for neighbourhoods. The analysis of various sustainability measures reveals many discrepancies between the life cycle impact results and the scores awarded in scoring tools, confirming that the use of scoring tools is not a guarantee for a reduction of the environmental and financial impact of neighbourhoods. Based on this analysis, recommendations are formulated to better capture environmental and financial issues in scoring tools. nrpages: 338 status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|With {{the continual}} {{expansion}} of {{populations in the}} arid Southwest, energy demands will continue to rise. On the other hand, depleting water levels in reservoirs of the Colorado River Basin {{is expected to continue}} as more intense and frequent drought events persist in addition to the rapid development in the region. Currently, the three largest water-use categories in the United States are thermoelectric energy, irrigation, and municipal water, which cumulatively account for 90 percent of the national water use. In the Southwest, most of the total electricity generated is still through thermoelectric means. That is, massive amounts of water are used to boil into steam to move the turbine to generate electricity. With such high dependency on water, higher energy demand in the future will lead to further rise in water demand. Therefore, more energy-specific water usage {{research is needed to determine}} the success of water resource management for future sustainability. The objective of this study seeks to estimate and compare the water usage in thermoelectricity generation (i. e. natural gas, coal), and solar energy, in five southwest Colorado River Basin states. The term “water use” includes both water withdrawal and consumption from a water body. While solar energy in general includes both thermal solar (Concentrated Solar Power; CSP) and non-thermal solar (Photovoltaic; PV), CSP is also considered a type of thermoelectricity since it utilizes water intensive steam turbines. Thus CSP was not emphasized as the main focus of this study for the comparison of renewable energy alternative to fossil fuels. Results from the first stage of the study, which was based just on the state of Nevada, showed that with PV solar generating 2. 84 % electricity of the state total in 2014, Nevada saved approximately 56 million gallons of water. To further investigate other southwest areas and their potentials in solar energy, this study expanded the scope from the first stage study to examine four additional Colorado Basin states that have experienced the most droughts in recent years: Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. This study was conducted in two main parts: 1) estimation of the amount of water consumption and withdrawal for utility scale thermoelectricity generation and PV Solar energy for the past ten years, and 2) projection and comparison of future water demand in the basin states, based on each state’s renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS). To accomplish the research objectives, estimations of operational and pre-operational water usage was determined as a function of the thermal fuel sources, cooling systems, and generator types used by power plants combined with established water coefficients per unit of electricity generated. <b>Operational</b> <b>water</b> <b>use</b> refers to the water withdrawal and consumption throughout the process of generating electricity. Preoperational water use refers to the water used to acquire and prepare the fuel sources. The same calculation was applied to calculate the water use for PV solar electricity generation. This study utilizes the system dynamics (SD) model developed from the first stage study to evaluate the interrelationship of thermoelectricity responses from PV Solar energy on water use and their potential for water savings. A model that runs different simulations based on each state’s optimal Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). Three case scenarios were simulated to examine the projected energy outlooks by 2032. The first scenario examined projections with the present state of conditions on electricity generation by fuel distributions. The second scenario explored the projections based on the optimized expectation of each state’s current RPS while the third scenario explored the projections on a modified hypothetical RPS expectation. A sub-scenario was created as a reference case to examine how much water were saved from the current trend of electricity production by renewable sources. Results from the past water usage estimation show that although electricity demand has been a slow and steady decline for the past decade, energy demand for the future will continue to increase, but at a less intense rate than population growth. Although each state had set RPS goals to advocate for more future electricity production from renewable energy, and corresponding actions have been taken to build more renewable energy based power plants, statistics showed that they are currently still, and will be in the near future, highly dependent on burning fossil fuels. For example, while California holds the lowest percentage of coal-fueled electricity production (0. 4 %), it shows an increasingly higher dependency on natural gas over the past decade (from 49 % in 2005 to 61 % in 2014). Results from the model simulation indicate that with each state’s current RPS goals, approximately 600 million to 1. 3 billion gallons of water can be saved annually. Three out of five study states showed significant water savings with projections on a modified hypothetical RPS that will increase the PV solar energy production amounts while decreasing coal. Improvement on RPS goals would be beneficial for Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, while continual compliance to the current RPS goals would be sufficient for California and New Mexico. This study is reproducible so that it can be replicated using other renewable energy sources to test the potential for water efficient energy fuel replacement. Findings from this study will shed light on water resource management involving the utility scale energy sector. Millions of gallons of water are used every day to produce energy. It is important to better explore energy alternatives in the hope of preventing further water shortage in the Southwest. Policy makers may reconsider whether to develop a more aggressive approach that depends on water conservation from the general public or to redesign current water conservation strategies that target the electric sector...|$|E

The method applied was used in a study of removal efficiency of these compounds at a full scale <b>operational</b> <b>water</b> reclamation plant <b>using</b> microfiltration-reverse osmosis (MF-RO) (Kwinana, Western Australia). The analytical procedure involves off-line solid-phase extraction (SPE) followed by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode. Method validation included determination of linearity, accuracy, precision, method limits of quantitation (MLQs), reproducibility and matrix effect. SPE recoveries were generally higher than 89 % for both pre- and post- RO water, except for erythromycin which yielded approximately 50 % recovery. The overall precision of the method was better than 16 % RSD (relative standard deviation), for all compounds and matrices. MLQ ranged between 23 - 53 ng/L and 2. 5 - 31 ng/L for pre- and post- RO water, respectively. In-house reproducibility expressed as RSD was generally better than 10 %. Inter-laboratory tests revealed a generally good agreement between concentrations of antibiotics reported by all participants. Results demonstrate that MF/RO treatment is capable of removing antibiotics present at relevant environmental concentration in secondary effluent (from the low to-mid ng/L range) to below MLQs (2. 5 - 31 ng/L), and more importantly, three to six orders of magnitude below the health guideline values developed for this project.

40|$|In this thesis, {{the concept}} of water {{budgeting}} is discussed. This concept {{is based on a}} comparison between water resources and financial resources. It aims to approach water resources management problems more like a treasurer would. Water resources can be distributed {{in such a way as}} to optimise the chance of achieving a desired goal. Depending on what the most important goal of the water manager is, different ‘water budgets’ are possible. The concept of water budgeting is: to distribute the available water resources in such a way as to optimally achieve a certain objective. Model Predictive Control is considered a potential tool for water budgeting. This tool can translate the desired objectives into <b>operational</b> <b>water</b> management. The objective for the water system, in the form of penalties and constraints, are used as input for the Model Predictive Controller. The controller then determines the <b>operational</b> <b>water</b> management, which is most successful at achieving the desired goals. The concept of water budgeting is applied to the South-Western Delta in order to test its usefulness. Different goals are set for the area, and these different goals result in different <b>operational</b> <b>water</b> management strategies. During the application of the water budgeting concept several shortcomings became apparent. These shortcomings follow from the fact that: the comparison between water resources and financial resources is complicated by the physical properties of water. Two very important properties of water in this respect are: water is bulky and water is fugitive. These properties result in: water being difficult to store and transport, in comparison to financial resources. Because water is difficult to handle, it is not straightforward to budget water. The water budgets become very variable in time and space. Due to this variability in time and space the sum of the water distribution does not tell the whole story. The moment at which the <b>water</b> resources are <b>used</b> is equally, or might be even more, important. The application of Model Predictive Control, as a tool for water budgeting, has also proven to be limited. The most important limitation of using Model Predictive Control is: the reduced transparency of the decision making process. It is difficult to trace back why the controller ‘chooses’ certain control actions. This reduces the predictability of the <b>operational</b> <b>water</b> management. Reduced predictability of the <b>operational</b> <b>water</b> management, results in a less predictable water system. This will make it harder for stakeholders to be dependant on the water system. The application of Model Predictive Control to a water system of this size and without a very clear (single) objective is relatively new. During the research it became clear that: it is very important to be able to control all the (large) in and outflow structures, and that it is important to included the parameter that needs to be controlled in the internal model. In the case used, it was not possible to control the Maeslantkering. This resulted in limited control over the water bodies connected to the Nieuwe Waterweg. In the internal model water salinity was not included. This made it very hard to control salinity. Penalties for the controller were developed that were assumed to influence salinity. These penalties were however not sufficient to prevent salinities to become too high in certain areas. This shows that the controller needs to be able to directly predict what the salinities will be.

Results reveal large internal differentiation of sectorial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> among the cities in this region, with industrial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensity varying from - 80 to + 95 % and domestic <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensity by +/- 30 % compared to the PRD average. In general, per capita <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is highest in the cities that industrialised first. Yet, all cities except Guangzhou are expected to approach a saturation value of per capita <b>water</b> <b>use</b> much below what is suggested in recent global studies. Therefore, existing global assessments probably have overestimated future domestic <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in developing countries. Although scarce and uncertain input data and model limitations lead to a high level of uncertainty, the presented conceptualization of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is useful in exploring the underlying driving forces of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> trends...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The propose of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} <b>water</b> <b>use</b> of the first ratoon cane. First ratoon cane was produced at Cane and Sugar Industry Promotion Center Region 1 from June 2010 to April 2011. To evaluate crop <b>water</b> <b>use</b> Eddy Covariance technique was used. From the results, <b>water</b> <b>use</b> of first ratoon cane was gradually increased from predawn and reach the maximum during 12 : 00 - 14 : 00 and then <b>water</b> <b>use</b> was decreased. Moreover, <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in each growing stage were found. Minimum of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> average about 1. 6 mmd- 1 was found in germination stage, while maximum <b>water</b> <b>use</b> is 2. 4 mmd- 1 was found in stalk elongation stage. In addition, total <b>water</b> <b>use</b> germination stage, tillerling stage, stalk elongation stage and maturity stage was 57. 3, 151. 3, 330. 6 and 142. 7 mm, respectively. However, total <b>water</b> <b>use</b> of first ratoon cane was 682. 1 mm. <b>Water</b> <b>Use</b> Efficiency of 1 st ratoon cane was 0. 012 tyield/tH 2 O. For this study we can concluded that <b>water</b> <b>use</b> of first ratoon cane depend on daily time and growing stage and total <b>water</b> <b>use</b> was 682. 1 mm.

30|$|So far the {{analysis}} has considered only the direct <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Now, we will introduce the indirect <b>water</b> <b>use</b> of each sector. This type of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> constitutes the hidden {{part of the}} equation that we will try to discover by analysing the total and the indirect <b>water</b> <b>use</b> coefficients. The third and the last columns of Table  2 give the vectors of the total <b>water</b> <b>use</b> coefficients (TWUC) and the indirect <b>water</b> <b>use</b> coefficients (IWUC), respectively.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has examined the}} relationship between natural resources and economic growth. Considered vitally important, not only for humanity’s well-being but also for ecosystem integrity, the relationship between <b>water</b> <b>use</b> and economic growth has traditionally garnered little attention by analysts. This paper studies <b>water</b> <b>use</b> trends from 1900 to 2000 throughout the world, and their main determinants. To do this, we first analyse historical <b>water</b> <b>use</b> trajectories. Second, to proceed with the determinants of <b>water</b> <b>use,</b> we reformulate the IPAT equation (Ehrlich and Holdren, 1971; Commoner et al. 1971), decomposing <b>water</b> <b>use</b> trends into changes in economic demands and in <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensity. Finally, a simple scenario analysis is conducted, to project future <b>water</b> <b>use</b> trends under different economic, demographic and technological assumptions. The empirical evidence shows that economic and population growth have been crucial for explaining the increase in <b>water</b> <b>use</b> over the past 100 years, with significant regional differences. Nevertheless, the decline in <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensity has been responsible for a significant reduction in the growth of total <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>use,</b> environmental impacts, economic growth, IPAT model, scenario analysis...|$|R
