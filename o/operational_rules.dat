The project starts with the will of the airdrome owner to start a Flight School during the next years, so a project was needed to evaluate if the equipment follows the <b>Operational</b> Security <b>rules</b> of the National and European Authorities. The study is based at the airdrome air zone, where after detailing the dimensions, the currently installed equipment and signals, some operational security discrepancies were found that must be projected and solved. The planned actuations are the relocation of the wind markers, the correct signing of the non-paved runway, the runway side strip marking, and the fire extinguishers acquisition. Otherwise, as a project to asphalt the runway, the taxiway and the apron that already exists, the projection of the marking of these paved surfaces has been also included in this document. All the projections that are quoted and planned will be available for the owner, so he can decide whether to perform part of the actuations for the non-paved airdrome or otherwise, to perform the full actuations on the airdrome surface to pave them and comply with the <b>Operational</b> Security <b>rules...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} an innovative streamflow process model {{for use in}} reservoir <b>operational</b> <b>rule</b> design in stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). Model features, which can be applied independently, are (1) a multiplicative process model for the forward phase and its linearized version for the backward phase; and (2) a nonuniform time-step length that is inversely proportional to seasonal variability. The advantages are (1) guaranteeing positive streamflow values still maintaining problem linearity, and (2) making system adaptation faster during high variable periods. Model identification is straightforward, as with the additive periodic autoregressive model generally used in SDDP. The proposed model is applied on the Senegal River system for the optimal operation of Manantali Reservoir and evaluated against the streamflow process model currently used in the water management literature...|$|R
