5|$|Incorporating dubstep and UK garage styles, Jamie xx applied {{electronic}} music techniques in his production to remix Scott-Heron's vocals {{from the original}} album <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> instrumentals. Although it is structured similarly, We're New Here eschews the original album's stark style and lo-fi production for bass-driven, musically varied production and sonical illumination of Scott-Heron's vocals. It has been noted by music writers for recontextualizing Scott-Heron's narratives in Jamie xx's own musical influences and tastes.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to distributing {{the letter to}} the media, Albizu wrote his own, charging that Rhoads was part of a US plot to exterminate Puerto Ricans. He linked the letter to other complaints about American imperialism, saying that the US governors in Puerto Rico encouraged labor emigration rather than improving employment, and promoted birth control, which was offensive to the majority Catholic residents. Later that year Governor Beverley struggled with a greater political crisis than the Rhoads letter <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> remarks encouraging birth control use on the island. Residents were outraged and he was removed from office.|$|E
5|$|Ramza joins a {{mercenary}} group, led by Gafgarion, who protects Princess Ovelia {{from being}} hunted by both sides. Delita joins Prince Goltana's forces {{to rise up}} through the ranks and gain control <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> destiny. Ramza and Delita are reunited when Gafgarion attempts to take Ovelia to Prince Larg, though this proves futile. Agrias suggests visiting Cardinal Draclau of the Glabados Church to protect Ovelia, while Delita continues to work in the shadows, working with multiple sides to realize his ambitions. Along the way to Lionel Castle, Ramza meets Mustadio, a machinist in possession of a holy relic called the Zodiac Stone. Hunted by a trading company for the power it contains, Mustadio also seeks Draclau's intervention.|$|E

5|$|Regarded by {{many critics}} as Charles's best studio album, Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music has been {{considered}} by several music writers to be a landmark album in American music. The album's integration of soul and country music bent racial barriers in popular music, amid {{the height of the}} Civil Rights Movement. In the process of recording the album, Charles {{became one of the first}} African-American musicians to exercise complete artistic control <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> recording career. The album has been called one of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time.|$|E
5|$|The Committee {{hoped to}} avoid the Germans {{becoming}} involved in the day-to-day administration of the territory as they had during World War I, while also allowing Belgium to maintain a degree of national autonomy and independence. The Committee also hoped {{to be able to}} prevent the implementation of more radical German policies, like forced labor and deportation. The legal basis of the Committee was a law of 7 September 1939, through which in times of crisis, a Secretary-General could exert full control <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> department, but without having the full status of being a minister.|$|E

They swept the Washington Bullets and soundly beat the Atlanta Hawks in five games, but bowed out in seven matches against the archrival Boston Celtics {{in what was}} {{called one of the}} {{physically}} and mentally toughest series ever. Rodman feuded with Celtics guard Dennis Johnson and taunted Johnson in the closing seconds when he waved his right hand <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> head.

5|$|A {{council of}} the army convened in Babylon {{immediately}} after Alexander's death, naming PhilipIII as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas {{in a civil war}} initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent (since PhilipIII was considered mentally unstable), in effect bypassing the {{council of the}} army as well.|$|E

Without explanation, {{one of the officers}} walks backwards to the parking ramp and jumps to his death. Another officer shoots her two remaining co-workers, then herself. The kidnappers' crime spree continues on the road. One of them, Hickey (John Tench), demands that a convenience store clerk hand over all his cash. Another customer tries to intervene, but then takes a pot of hot coffee, pours the coffee <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> head, and beats himself with the pot.

5|$|In {{preparation}} for League One football, Adams signed winger Kaid Mohamed {{to replace the}} departing Ashley Vincent. He also signed defenders Chris Robertson and Carl Dickinson, midfielders Chris Lines and Anthony Griffith, and forward Gavin Tomlin. On 22 September, Rob Page was put in temporary charge of first team affairs at Vale Park after Adams took the decision {{to take time off}} work to have hip replacement surgery. The club overstretched itself financially, meaning that as they lay outside the play-offs in January Adams could only sign largely untried youngsters on loan whilst releasing higher paid players either on free transfers or on loan. Their promotion push fell away but they ended the season in ninth place – far exceeding their original aim of avoiding relegation. During this time he had to deal with issues such as sacking defender Daniel Jones for physically attacking captain Doug Loft during training, and had to deal with months of speculation <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> future after chairman Norman Smurthwaite took until May before offering him a new one-year rolling contract.

5|$|Meanwhile, Sulan kills Durst and grafts {{his face}} <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> to appear more {{appealing}} to the Klingon Torres. Klingon Torres escapes from Sulan's laboratory, and rescues her human version. After arguing about their respective weaknesses, and past expulsion from Starfleet Academy, the two halves formulate a plan. Human Torres suggests shutting down the shields for the complex so that Voyager can transport them to the ship, while the Klingon Torres deals with guards. Chakotay, disguised as a Vidiian guard {{with the help of}} , breaks into the facility at the same time Torres deactivates the shields. Klingon Torres sacrifices herself to protect {{the rest of the crew}} members from Sulan. Transported back to Voyager, Klingon Torres refuses medical help to die an honorable death. The Doctor explains that Human Torres would not survive without her Klingon half and restores her to her original self by reintegrating the Klingon DNA. Human Torres admits to feeling incomplete without her Klingon half. After being restored, she realizes that she will spend the rest of her life dealing with her inner conflict.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{coronation}} {{took place}} on 2 December 1804. Two separate crowns were brought for the ceremony: a golden laurel wreath recalling the Roman Empire and a replica of Charlemagne's crown. Napoleon entered the ceremony wearing the laurel wreath and kept it on his head throughout the proceedings. For the official coronation, he raised the Charlemagne crown <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> head in a symbolic gesture, but never placed it on top because he was already wearing the golden wreath. Instead he placed the crown on Josephine's head, the event commemorated in the officially sanctioned painting by Jacques-Louis David. Napoleon was also crowned King of Italy, with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, at the Cathedral of Milan on 26 May 1805. He created eighteen Marshals of the Empire from amongst his top generals to secure the allegiance of the army.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{after the}} {{translation}} of the relics of Oswald of Northumbria to Bardney Abbey by Osthryth between 675 and 679, Wilfrid, along with Hexham Abbey, began to encourage and promote {{the cult of the}} dead king. Barbara Yorke sees this advocacy as {{a major factor in the}} prominence given to Oswald in Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. Historian D. P. Kirby regards Wilfrid's championing of Oswald as being a contributing factor in Wilfrid's expulsion from York in 678. Kirby believes that Ecgfrith felt Wilfrid was promoting Oswald's branch of the Northumbrian royal family <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> One of Wilfrid's protégés, Willibrord, became a missionary to the Frisians in 695, perhaps inspired by Wilfrid's example. Willibrord may have felt it expedient to leave Northumbria, where he was known as one of Wilfrid's followers.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no records}} of {{diseases}} experienced by Belgrano during his youth or adolescence. His first illness {{dates from the}} time of his return to Buenos Aires, when he worked in the Consulate; he experienced symptoms of syphilis caught during his stay in Spain. He was treated by the most prestigious physicians of the city: Miguel Gorman from the Protomedicato of Buenos Aires, Miguel García de Rojas, and José Ignacio de Arocha. This disease forced him to take long leaves from his work at the Consulate and take repose stays at Maldonado and San Isidro. He was treated with salts and iodines, and his condition eventually improved. It is also suspected that he may have had rheumatism. By the year 1800 he had a growing lacrimal fistula in one of his eyes and was invited by the King to move to Spain for a cure. He was offered a one-year leave with paid wages, but he rejected it, giving priority to his work for the nation <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal health. The fistula would later stabilise at a safe and unnoticeable size.|$|E

However, Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy, concerned about Perdiccas' increasing signs of self-aggrandizement, formed a coalition against him in open civil war that began with Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. When Perdiccas invaded Egypt {{in the summer of}} 321 BC to assault Ptolemy, he marched along the Nile River where 2,000 of his men drowned, leading the officers under his command to conspire against him and assassinate him. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had no grand effect on the course of events now that the victorious coalition convened in Syria to settle the issue of a new regency and territorial rights in the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus.

At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot {{to the head}} and identifiable by his missing ear, {{as well as the}} Yellow Man, who bears a gruesome head wound, leaving him barely conscious and unresponsive but still standing. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, knocking over the dead Yellow Man, who had still been standing up, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey fatally shoots him in the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town.

5|$|Lauren Fenmore Baldwin (Tracey E. Bregman) {{gave birth}} to Fenmore prematurely, and {{he was forced to}} remain in the {{hospital}} for a short time. Shortly after his birth, he was kidnapped, along with Phyllis Summers Newman (Michelle Stafford) and her daughter, Summer Newman, by Sheila Carter, who had had cosmetic surgery to look like Phyllis. All are rescued when Lauren tracked down Sheila and shot her. In 2012, Fenmore was sent to stay with his half-brother, Scotty Grainger, in Canada due to Lauren's fear that Daisy Carter (Yvonne Zima), Sheila's daughter, would end up harming him. Months later, Fenmore returns a moody teenager, kindling a friendship with a teenaged Summer. They became close and later began a relationship. When Summer began harassing a boy named Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo) online, Fenmore was against the idea, but when his father, Michael Baldwin (Christian LeBlanc), began looking out for Jamie, he became jealous and took over the bullying by sending him harassing text messages from a disposable cell phone. Fenmore's jealously continued when Michael and Lauren had Jamie move in with them temporarily. He attempted to frame Jamie for stealing his mother's expensive decoration, and attempted to take pictures of him with the decoration on a rooftop. The boys struggled and Jamie was found face down in the snow below. He accused Fenmore of pushing him, Michael believed Jamie <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> son and he was arrested. However, Jamie later confessed that Fenmore did not push him and he was exonerated. Michael and Lauren's marriage suffered due to the bullying ordeal.|$|E
