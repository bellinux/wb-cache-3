The redemption of these bonds was {{at the discretion of}} the UK government, but because of their age, they all had low coupons, and so for a long time there was little incentive for the government to redeem them. Because the <b>outstanding</b> <b>amounts</b> were relatively very small, there was a very limited market in most of these gilts. In late 2014 and early 2015 the government gave notice that four of these gilts, including War Loan, would be redeemed in early 2015.

On October 15, 1997, total <b>outstanding</b> <b>amount</b> on Commercial paper transaction in Indian money market was Rs. 3377 crore. This <b>outstanding</b> <b>amount</b> increased substantially to Rs. 1,28,347 crore on July 15, 2011. This growth of Commercial paper market {{may be attributed}} to the rapid expansion of corporate manufacturing and financial companies in liberalized and Globalized Indian economy during the last decade of 20th century and the first decade of 21st century. The growth of Commercial Paper market in India was more conspicuous after the financial year 2007-08. On 15 July 2007, total <b>outstanding</b> <b>amount</b> on Commercial paper transaction was Rs. 28,129 crore. This amount increased to Rs. 48,342 crore on 15 July 2008. [...] Since then, there was substantial increase in the <b>outstanding</b> <b>amount</b> on Commercial paper transactions to the highest level of Rs. 1,28,347 crore until 15 July 2011. This period was largely dominated by the Late-2000s financial crisis. In this period, RBI reduced Repo rate drastically from 9% to 4%. However, Prime rate of commercial banks in India remained rigid at 12%. [...] The discounting rate on Commercial papers was in the range of 6.5% to 10% in October 2010. [...] It is explicit from these statistics that the cost of borrowing working capital through Commercial paper transaction became relatively lower for the corporate companies in India in comparison to the cost of borrowing the same working capital through cash credit facility from the commercial banks. The obvious result was an absolute growth of the Commercial paper market in India, particularly, after 2007-08 onward.|$|R
5000|$|The Amnesty Law, {{organized}} into five chapters (which was considered highly satisfactory by {{the victims of}} political persecution) guarantees the following amnesty rights: the declaration {{of the status of}} political amnesty recipient; financial reparations; assurance, for all official purposes, that the period of time in which they were forced to stop their professional activities due to punishment or threat of punishment will count as valid; the conclusion of courses interrupted due to punishment or the validation of diplomas obtained by those who completed courses at teaching institutes outside the country; and the right to reinstatement for punished civil servants and public employees. In the sole paragraph of article 1, the law guarantees those who were removed from their jobs by administrative cases, based on emergency legislation, without the right to contest the case or defend themselves, and prevented from knowing the motives and grounds for the decision, reinstatement to their positions (due to the age of the claimants, this reinstatement has occurred, in practice, in retirement). The law also lists in detail all the punishments that entitle victims to the status of recipients of political amnesty, and it states that financial reparations, provided for in chapter III, may be paid in two different ways: in a single installment, consisting of the payment of 30 times the minimum monthly wage per year of punishment for those who cannot prove an employment relationship, and whose value may not, under any circumstances, exceed 100,000 reais or in permanent and continuous monthly installments, guaranteed to those who can prove an employment relationship.

Slowly evolving means are related to the ratio of government securities to the total outstanding securities. At higher frequencies, yield differentials appear to be explained by common (credit-) risk related international factors, such as the US asset swap spreads and US and Euro-zone policy rates.

In general, the <b>outstanding</b> <b>amounts</b> reported in the Financial Accounts are significally larger than those arising from the Survey. Reconciling the data in terms of classification criteria and of valuation methods reduces the differences only to a small extent. Once the variability due to sampling and measurement errors is taken into account, the discrepancies are mainly caused by under-reporting on the survey results; the bias from non-response is less important. As a by-product of the analysis, suggestions for some methodological improvements to both the Survey and the Financial Accounts do also arise, possilby from the joint use of the two sources.
