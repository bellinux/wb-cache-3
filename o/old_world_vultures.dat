5|$|New World {{vultures}} are not {{closely related}} to <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures,</b> but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures,</b> they are scavengers. Unlike <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures,</b> which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have {{a good sense of}} smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing {{at the edge of the}} lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites.|$|E

5|$|The taxonomic {{placement}} of the turkey vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures has been in flux.

Some earlier authorities suggested that the New World vultures were more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintained their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes.|$|E

5|$|Like all New World vultures, {{it is not}} {{closely related}} to the <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> of Europe, Africa, and Asia.

5|$|Like {{the turkey}} vulture, this vulture {{is often seen}} {{standing}} in a spread-winged stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and baking off bacteria. This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures,</b> and storks.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{systematic}} {{placement of}} the king vulture and the remaining six species of New World vultures remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar ecological roles, the New World and <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> evolved from different ancestors {{in different parts of}} the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to storks. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order Falconiformes along with the <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vultures</b> or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The South American Classification Committee has removed the New World vultures from Ciconiiformes and instead placed them in Incertae sedis, but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. Like other New World vultures, the king vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.|$|E
50|$|Yolyn Am (Ёлын Ам, Lammergeier Valley) is a {{deep and}} narrow gorge in the Gurvan Saikhan Mountains of {{southern}} Mongolia. The valley is named after the Lammergeier, which is called Yol in Mongolian. The Lammergeier is an <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture,</b> hence the name is often translated to Valley of the Vultures or Valley of the Eagles.|$|R
50|$|The Cape griffon or Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres), {{also known}} as Kolbe's <b>vulture,</b> is an <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture</b> in the family Accipitridae.

50|$|The white-backed vulture (Gyps africanus) is an <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>vulture</b> in {{the family}} Accipitridae, which also {{includes}} eagles, kites, buzzards and hawks. It {{is closely related to}} the European griffon vulture, G. fulvus. Sometimes it is called African white-backed vulture to distinguish it from the Oriental white-backed vulture — nowadays usually called white-rumped vulture — to which it was formerly believed to be closely related.|$|R
