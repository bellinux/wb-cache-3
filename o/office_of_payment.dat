40|$|Financial Aid {{is awarded}} to {{students}} based on federal formulas {{for determining the}} need for taxpayerfunded student aid programs. Federal and state regulations require that all financial aid awards have taken into account any and all resources that students have available to meet {{the cost of their}} education. All colleges and universities are required to have a mandatory Coordination of Resources policy in place to ensure compliance with these regulations.

Those that pay the tax receive an official stamp on their documents, making them legal documents. The taxes raised under a stamp act are called stamp duty. This system of taxation was first devised in the Netherlands in 1624 after a public competition to find a new form of tax.
