5|$|The Fritz Pollard Alliance, a {{non-profit}} organization closely allied with the NFL on civil rights issues, announced its support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> change in 2015 after repeated attempts {{to discuss the issue}} with the team owner and representatives. An attorney for the Alliance, N. Jeremi Duru, an American University law professor, made a study of the controversy in which he concluded that Native Americans are justified in finding the name offensive.|$|E
5|$|This {{hurricane}} was {{the only}} usage of the name Fico. The name Fico was removed after this storm and replaced with Fabio in the 1982 season. It is unknown whether it was retired due to its damage or for another reason. Other possible reasons listed for the removal <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> are pronunciation ambiguity, a socially unacceptable meaning in another language, or because the storm name represented a significant human disaster.|$|E
5|$|A book by {{the same}} name was written by Ray and Valerie Vallese and {{released}} by Wizards of the Coast in 1999. The book's plot follows the game's only loosely; for example, in the game, the main character's lack <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> {{is a sign of}} his incomplete state and a source of protection in being anonymous. In the book, the protagonist chooses a proper name. For the game's re-release on GOG.com a second, more accurate, novelization produced by Rhyss Hess was bundled with the game, based on the game script by Chris Avellone and Colin McComb.|$|E

5|$|Hun is {{familiar}} in 8th and 9th century England, for instance as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> with two elements. During the 9th century there were East Anglian bishops of Helmham named Ælfhun, Hunferthus and Hunbeorht and a bishop of Worcester called Æthelhun. Hun also occurred {{as part of}} a moneyer's name. There are several placenames in England that contain the term as a personal name element, such as Hunsdon, Hertfordshire and Hunston, West Sussex (but not Hunston, Suffolk). It is possible that Hun was a historical figure, whose name was run together with Beonna's by a scribe.|$|E
5|$|The Redskins {{controversy}} began receiving {{more attention}} in 2013, {{starting with a}} symposium in February on the topic at the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. Subsequently, the Oneida Indian Nation of New York sponsored a series of radio ads in each city to coincide with games of the 2013 season, each featuring a targeted message. A broader range of persons spoke in favor of change or open discussion, including local government leaders, members of Congress, and President Barack Obama. Statements in support <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> change by civil rights and religious organizations were added to those that Native American groups have been making for decades.|$|E
5|$|The deaths {{caused by}} World War I were {{difficult}} for post-war societies to cope with: their unprecedented scale challenged existing methods of grieving. Furthermore, an expectation had arisen {{during the war}} that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated, {{even if they were}} low ranking members of the military. One method used to address this was the inclusion of lists of names. In part, this was a response to the practical problem of commemorating such large numbers of dead, but it carried additional symbolic importance; in some ways, the physical presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> acted to compensate for an absent body. The lists could vary in size from the 21 names listed in a small English village like East Ilsley, to the 54,896 names inscribed on the Menin Gate and the 73,357 on the Thiepval Memorial.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. In {{the background of the}} classroom, there are several portraits of past United States presidents. These were added for the scene where Bart tries to think <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> for his fictional letter writer, and sees a portrait of Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image for free. Howe, their second choice, was suggested by Al Jean, who had been a Detroit Red Wings fan growing up. At the end of the episode, Howe's NHL and WHA statistics are shown because the writers decided to try something different in filling a slight time under-run.|$|E

25|$|The name Dubrovnik of the Adriatic city {{is first}} {{recorded}} in the Charter of Ban Kulin (1189).

25|$|In {{the decades}} {{preceding}} independence, independence parties were in search <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>name</b> {{for the new}} country to be born, which would be made up not only of Burmese speaking people, but also of many minorities. In the 1920s, some favoured the name Myanma, which had been the name applied to the old Burmese kingdom destroyed by the British in the 19th century. In the 1930s, the left-wing independence parties favoured the name Bama, as they thought this name was more inclusive of minorities than Myanma.|$|E
25|$|The {{name that}} appears in the {{machine-readable}} zone {{at the bottom of}} the visa represents the holder’s Cyrillic name mapped into the Roman alphabet.
