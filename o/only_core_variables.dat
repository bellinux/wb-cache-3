40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the bi-objective multi-dimensional {{knapsack}} problem. We propose the adaptation of the core concept that is effectively used in single-objective multi-dimensional knapsack problems. The main idea of the core concept {{is based on the}} ""divide and conquer"" principle. Namely, instead of solving one problem with n variables we solve several sub-problems with a fraction of n <b>variables</b> (<b>core</b> <b>variables).</b> The quality of the obtained solution can be adjusted according {{to the size of the}} core and there is always a trade off between the solution time and the quality of solution. In the specific study we define the core problem for the multi-objective multi-dimensional knapsack problem. After defining the core we solve the bi-objective integer programming that comprises <b>only</b> the <b>core</b> <b>variables</b> using the Multicriteria Branch and Bound algorithm that can generate the complete Pareto set in small and medium size multi-objective integer programming problems. A small example is used to illustrate the method while computational and economy issues are also discussed. Computational experiments are also presented using available or appropriately modified benchmarks in order to examine the quality of Pareto set approximation with respect to the solution time. Extensions to the general multi-objective case as well as to the computation of the exact solution are also mentioned. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{prognostic}} indicators, namely histological {{grade and}} immunostaining for estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PgR), MIB 1, bc 1 - 2, and p 53, were retrospectively determined on preoperative core biopsies from 75 patients with pT 1 breast carcinoma. The {{association of the}} preoperatively evaluated factors with those on the corresponding resected tumors (i. e. nodal status, histological grade, {{presence or absence of}} vascular invasion and necrosis) was assessed. In univariate analysis, histological grade on resected tumors was significantly associated with histological grade on core biopsy, p 53 expression, MIB 1 immunostaining. An inverse association was found between postoperative histologic grade and ER, PgR, and bc 1 - 2. Necrosis was significantly associated with grade, p 53, MIB 1, and inversely with ER, PgR, and bc 1 - 2. Nodal involvement and vascular invasion were significantly associated with MIB 1. In multivariate analysis, histological grade and ER were the <b>only</b> independent <b>core</b> biopsy <b>variables</b> associated with postoperative histological grade and necrosis, respectively.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether more comprehensive risk-adjustment models {{have a significant impact}} on hospital risk-adjusted mortality rates after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) in Ontario, Canada. Background. The Working Group Panel on the Collaborative CABG Database Project has categorized 44 clinical <b>variables</b> into 7 <b>core,</b> 13 level 1 and 24 level 2 variables, to reflect their relative importance in determining short-term mortality after CABG. Methods. Using clinical data for all 5, 517 patients undergoing isolated CABG in Ontario in 1993, we developed 12 increasingly comprehensive risk-adjustment models using logistic regression analysis of 6 of the Panel’s <b>core</b> <b>variables</b> and 6 of the Panel’s level 1 variables. We studied how the risk-adjusted mortality rates of the nine cardiac surgery hospitals in Ontario changed as more variables were included in these models. Results. Incorporating six of the <b>core</b> <b>variables</b> in a risk-adjustment model led to a model with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0. 77. The ROC curve area slightly improved to 0. 79 with the inclusion of six additional level 1 variables (p = 0. 063). Hospital risk-adjusted mortality rates and relative rankings stabilized after adjusting for six <b>core</b> <b>variables.</b> Adding an additional six level 1 variables to a risk-adjustment model had minimal impact on overall results. Conclusions. A small number of <b>core</b> <b>variables</b> appear to be sufficient for fairly comparing risk-adjusted mortality rates after CABG across hospitals in Ontario. For efficient interprovider comparisons, risk-adjustment models for CABG could be simplified so that only essential variables are included in these models...|$|R

40|$|Two “hallmarks” {{explain why}} and how Glaser’s GT method {{is one of a}} kind and {{meaningless}} for research that is conventionally pre-framed: (I) The finding of the <b>core</b> <b>variable</b> is the first stage of the research and it is accomplished by the systematic treatment of the data.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this {{consensus}} effort was of define and prioritize {{the importance of a}} set of clinical variables useful for monitoring and improving the short-term mortality of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Background. Despite widespread use of data bases to monitor the outcome of patients undergoing CABG, no consistent set of clinical variables has been defined for risk adjustment of observed outcomes for baseline differences in disease severity among patients. Methods. Experts with a background in epidemiology, biostatics and clinical care with an interest in assessing outcomes of CABG derived from previous work with professional societies, government or academic institutions volunteered to participate in this unsponsored consensus process. Two meetings of this and hoc working group were required to define and prioritize clinical <b>variables</b> into <b>core,</b> level 1 or level 2 groupings to reflect their importance for relating to short-term mortality after CABG. Definitions of these 44 variables were simple and specific to enhance objectivity of the 7 core, 13 level 1 and 24 level 2 <b>variables.</b> <b>Core</b> and level 1 variables were evaluated using data from five existing data bases, and <b>core</b> <b>variables</b> <b>only</b> were examined in an additional two data bases to confirm the consensus opinion of the relative prognostic power of each variable. Results. Multivariable logistic regression models of the seven <b>core</b> <b>variables</b> showed all to be predictive of bypass surgery mortality in some of the seven existing data sets. Variables relating to acuteness, age and previous operation proved {{to be the most important}} in all data sets tested. Variables describing coronary anatomy appeared to be least significant. Models including both the 7 core and 13 level 1 variables in five of the seven data sets showed the <b>core</b> <b>variables</b> to reflect 45 % to 83 % of the predictive information. However, some level 1 variables were stronger than some <b>core</b> <b>variables</b> in some data sets. Conclusions.

Even for small systems the task of finding the solutions is daunting. We develop an algebraic framework and procedure for linear elimination of variables. The procedure reduces the variables in the system to a set of “core ” variables by eliminating variables corresponding to a set of non-interacting species. The steady states are parameterized algebraically by the <b>core</b> <b>variables,</b> and a graphical condition is given for when a steady state with positive <b>core</b> <b>variables</b> necessarily have all variables positive. Further, we characterize graphically the sets of eliminated variables that are constrained by a conservation law and show that this conservation law takes a specific form...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} a constrained portfolio selection problem with cardinality constraint, minimum size and position constraints, and non-convex transaction cost. A hybrid method named Local Search Branch-and-Bound (LS-B&B) which integrates local search with B&B is proposed {{based on the}} property of the problem, i. e. cardinality constraint. To eliminate the computational burden which is mainly due to the cardinality constraint, the corresponding set of binary variables is identified as <b>core</b> <b>variables.</b> Variable fixing (Bixby, Fenelon et al. 2000) is applied on the <b>core</b> <b>variables,</b> together with a local search, to generate a sequence of simplified sub-problems. The default B&B search then solves these restricted and simplified subproblems optimally due to their reduced size comparing to the original one. Due to the inherent similar structures in the sub-problems, the solution information is reused to evoke the repairing heuristics and thus accelerate the solving procedure of the subproblems in B&B. The tight upper bound identified at early stage of the search can discard more subproblems to speed up the LS-B&B search to the optimal solution to the original problem. Our study is performed on a set of portfolio selection problems with non-convex transaction costs and a number of trading constraints based on the extended mean-variance model. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by using less computational time...|$|R

Also, they now selectively sample new data with the core in mind, which is called theoretical sampling - a deductive part of GT.Selective coding delimits the study, which makes it move fast. This is indeed encouraged while doing GT (Glaser, 1998) since GT is not concerned with data accuracy as in descriptive research but is about generating concepts that are abstract of time, place and people.Selective coding could be done by going over old field notes or memos which are already coded once at an earlier stage or by coding newly gathered data.|$|R

30|$|Data {{analysis}} {{started in}} Aug 2015. The techniques of open coding, axial coding and selective coding {{were used to}} systematically analyze the data (Corbin and Strauss, 1990). Open coding was used to identify major elements from the data, e.g., designing tasks assigning tasks, task self-selection, competition among members, preferring knowledge sharing, culture as an incentive, social norms to avoid free-riding and so on. Axial coding consists of identifying relationships among elements from open coding. For example, for preferring knowledge sharing, culture as an incentive and social norms to avoid free-riding, these open codes reflect the cultural attributes of a DEE so we summarized them as “entrepreneurial culture as a toolkit”. Selective coding {{was based on the}} <b>core</b> <b>variable</b> we had previously identified --how does a DEE organize? Through our theoretical lens, we clustered the above codes into 8 key categories. This phase was conducted together with axial coding, and also involved intensive literature review so that findings could be supported by prior studies.
