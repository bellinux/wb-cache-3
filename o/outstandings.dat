She is also the first one to be able to cast non-verbal spells. Hermione is a competent duellist - Rowling has stated that while during the first three books Hermione would have beaten Harry in a magical duel, by the fourth book Harry had become so good at Defence Against the Dark Arts that he would have defeated Hermione. Hermione did not tend to do as well in subjects that were not learned through books or formal training, as broom flying did not come as naturally to her in her first year as it did to Harry, and she showed no affinity for Divination, which she dropped from her third year studies. She was also not good at Wizard's Chess, as {{it was the only thing}} at which she ever lost.|$|E
