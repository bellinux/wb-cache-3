25|$|The Indian spin quartet is the {{collective}} name {{given to the}} Indian spin bowlers of the 1960s and 1970s: Erapalli Prasanna and Srinivas Venkataraghavan (both off spinners), Bhagwat Chandrasekhar (a leg spinner), and Bishen Singh Bedi (a left-arm spinner). Between them, they played 231 Test matches, taking 853 wickets. They {{were one of the}} most deadly combinations in world cricket, especially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> subcontinental pitches.|$|E
25|$|Playing as a batsman, Symonds {{encountered}} difficulty against Muttiah Muralitharan <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusty,</b> spinning Sri Lankan tracks, {{failing to}} pass 25 {{in any of}} his four innings, and was dropped after two Test matches in favour of Katich. Australia then continued to pursue their policy of selecting six specialist batsmen in the longer form of the game, and Symonds was not recalled in that time.|$|E
500|$|Kripke instead {{favored the}} [...] "unique and {{structurally}} interesting" [...] self-enclosed episodes, which sometimes {{arose from the}} writers' unused ideas. From the series' beginning, Kripke desired to feature an evil clown because he felt that [...] "clowns in a context where they're {{not supposed to be}} are friggin' terrifying". To fit with the series, the clown became a shapeshifting Rakshasa of Hindu mythology. This decision made the clown [...] "less satisfying", to Kripke's chagrin, because it limited the clown-related scenes. Another element of folklore favored by Kripke was the story of Robert Johnson, which he focused on in his first screenplay as a writer. He found the legend similar to Supernatural, noting, [...] "It's a piece of real life American history and folklore, it's an American horror story, it takes place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> back roads of rural America, and it's got great music." [...] However, the lore takes place in the early 20th century, and prevented the inclusion of Sam and Dean. To circumvent this, writer Sera Gamble suggested Johnson's story be made into a subplot detailed in flashbacks, with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more deals. Although Gamble envisioned the demon's hellhound as being similar in appearance to a Rottweiler, Kripke felt it would [...] "look stupid". The creature was instead made invisible, which Gamble believes gave it a more terrifying presence.|$|E

2500|$|The Monthly {{was never}} resurrected, and the Harvard Advocate became Harvard's only {{literary}} publication, possibly subsuming {{the sort of}} material which had differentiated it from its sister-journal, {{which may have been}} due to a tradition of being different. Monthly alumnus Malcolm Cowley offered the following insight in his biography of E.E. Cummings: [...] "There were two such magazines at Harvard in those days , The Monthly and The Advocate, and they looked down on each other—-or, to be accurate, they nodded to each other coldly from the facing doors of their respective sanctums <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> third floor of the Harvard Union. The Monthlies thought that the board of The Advocate, which then appeared fortnightly, was composed of journalists, clubmen, athletes, and disciples of Teddy Roosevelt, a former editor, with not a man of letters among them. The Advocates suspected that the Monthlies were aesthetes (as indeed most of them came to be called), scruffy poets, socialists, pacifists, or worse. It was for The Monthly that Cummings chose to write." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{practice}} sessions—both on Saturday morning—were held {{before the}} late afternoon race. The first session ran for 45 minutes and the second lasted half an hour. Both practice sessions took place in dry and warm weather conditions. Di Grassi used the full [...] available to him and recorded the first practice session's fastest lap at one minute and 22.451 seconds, almost 1.2 seconds faster than Bird in second and Vergne third. Buemi was fourth-fastest, ahead of Nico Prost and Rosenqvist. Sarrazin, Mitch Evans, Daniel Abt and Nelson Piquet Jr. rounded out the session's top ten drivers. The track's surface caught several drivers off guard after locking their tyres, causing them to slide into the run-off areas, while multiple cars were affected by oversteer. Abt broke the left-front rim on his car following an collision the barriers lining the track. In the second practice session, Prost was the quickest driver {{with a time of}} one minute and 22.180 seconds; Vergne was second and Rosenqvist placed third. Sarrazin was fourth-fastest; Heidfeld was fifth and Bird took sixth. Loïc Duval was seventh-fastest, Robin Frijns eighth and the two NextEV cars of Oliver Turvey and Piquet completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. During the session where di Grassi and Adam Carroll skidded under braking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dusty</b> surface and slid into the track's run-off areas, Sarrazin stopped at the pit lane exit but restarted his car without external aid. Buemi glanced the Bus Stop chicane inside barrier, and speared straight into the exit wall at high speed. Buemi was unhurt and exited his car without external assistance. Because his vehicle was significantly damaged, he was forced to use his second car for qualifying. The crash prompted the session to prematurely end five minutes before it was due to conclude as there was damage to the barrier and debris was strewn across the circuit. e.Dams-Renault mechanics worked for the next five hours to build a new car around a spare monocoque.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} "Bridget Crack" written by Rachel Leary, {{published}} by Allen & Unwin. There’s {{a long tradition}} in Tasmanian literature of the gothic convict saga.

We have a wealth of mythology, trope and imagery on which to draw and an outsized sense of our own past, a past that’s visible in the architecture wherever you go <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island. Our best known book, Marcus Clarke’s For the Term of His Natural Life, provided the template and writers have iterated <b>on</b> it down <b>the</b> generations. Think particularly of Richard Butler, Bryce Courtenay, Christopher Koch and Richard Flanagan. Now Rachel Leary has provided us with a contemporary, skilful update <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dustier</b> of these traditions in her new novel Bridget Crack [...] ...|$|R
