5|$|The Sicilian apothecaries' <b>ounce</b> {{was divided}} in 10drachms. Since the scruple was divided in only 20grains, {{like in the}} {{northern}} countries, an <b>ounce</b> consisted of 600grains. This was not too different from the situation {{in most of the}} other mediterranean countries, where an <b>ounce</b> consisted of 576grains.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} English apothecaries' {{system of}} weights is {{as shown in}} the table, the pound, <b>ounce</b> and grain being identical to the troy pound, <b>ounce</b> and grain.|$|E
5|$|Centuries later, {{the region}} around Salerno {{was the only}} {{exception}} to the rule that (except for skipping units that had regionally fallen out of use) the apothecaries' <b>ounce</b> was subdivided down to the scruple {{in exactly the same way}} as in the Roman system: It divided the <b>ounce</b> into 10drachms.|$|E
50|$|Colorado gold {{production}} was 270,000 <b>ounces</b> in 1892, 660,000 <b>ounces</b> in 1895, peaked in 1900 at 1,400,000 <b>ounces,</b> and reached {{over one million}} <b>ounces</b> in 1916 for the last time. Gold production in 1922 was 300,000 <b>ounces,</b> and 200,000 <b>ounces</b> in 1928. The Gold Reserve Act helped increase production to 370,000 <b>ounces</b> in 1936. Production was 380,000 <b>ounces,</b> before the War Production Board limitation order L-208 stopped gold mining in 1942. Production restarted after World War II with 168,000 <b>ounces</b> in 1947.

5|$|In France, at some {{stage the}} apothecaries' pound of 12ounces was {{replaced}} by the larger civil pound of 16ounces. The subdivisions of the apothecaries' <b>ounce</b> were the same as in the other Romance countries, however, and were different from the subdivisions of the otherwise identical civil <b>ounce.</b>|$|E
5|$|The English-speaking {{countries}} {{also used}} {{a system of}} units of fluid measure, or in modern terminology volume units, based on the apothecaries' system. A volume of liquid that was approximately that of an apothecaries' <b>ounce</b> of water was called a fluid <b>ounce,</b> and was divided into fluid drachms and sometimes also fluid scruples. The analogue of the grain was called a minim.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1934, {{the price}} of silver in the United States was {{effectively}} set by the government as it would support that price through purchases and sales of the metal; in 1934 it was $.45 per troy <b>ounce.</b> In 1958, {{with the return of}} lend-lease bullion, the Treasury's stock of silver reached 2.1 billion troy ounces; it began to vend the metal at $.91 per <b>ounce</b> to the public, despite the warnings of the Conference of Western Governors that there was not enough silver to make these sales and maintain coinage operations.|$|E
50|$|Tom Powers and Phil Silams staked {{what became}} the Northern Empire Mine (1925-1988) near Beardmore, which {{produced}} a total of 149,493 <b>ounces</b> of gold. The Little Long Lac Mine (1934-1953) produced 605,449 <b>ounces</b> of gold, besides producing scheelite. J.M. Wood and W.T. Brown developed the Sturgeon River Gold Mine (1936-1942), which produced 73,438 <b>ounces</b> of gold. James and Russell Cryderman found and Karl Springer incorporated {{what became known as}} the Leitch Gold Mine (1936-1968), which produced 861,982 <b>ounces</b> of gold from 0.92 grade ore.

5|$|The {{measure and}} weight {{systems for the}} large {{mainland}} part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies were unified in 1840. The area consisted of the southern half of the Italian Peninsula and included Naples and Salerno. The subdivision of apothecaries' weight in the unified system was {{essentially the same as}} that for gold, silver, coins and silk. It was the most excentric variant in that the <b>ounce</b> was divided in 10drachms, rather than the usual8. The scruple, like in Venice but unlike {{in the rest of the}} Romance region, was divided into 20grains. The existence of a unit called aureo, the equivalent of 1½ dramme, is interesting because 6 aurei were 9 dramme. In the original Salerno weight system an <b>ounce</b> was divided into 9 drachms, and so an aureo would have been ⅙ of an <b>ounce.</b>|$|E
5|$|The wine gallon was {{abolished}} in Britain in 1826, {{and this}} system {{was replaced by}} a new one based on the newly introduced imperial gallon. Since the imperial gallon is 20% more than the liquid gallon, {{the same is true for}} the imperial pint in relation to the liquid pint. This explains why the number of fluid ounces per gallon had to be adjusted in the new system so that the fluid <b>ounce</b> was not changed too much by the reform. Even so, the modern UK fluid <b>ounce</b> is 4% less than the US fluid <b>ounce,</b> and the same is true for the smaller units. For some years both systems were used concurrently in the UK.|$|E

5|$|A typical female {{vampire bat}} weighs 40grams and can consume over 20grams (1 fluid <b>ounce)</b> {{of blood in}} a 20-minute feed.

5|$|In January 1976, California's {{study of}} the {{economic}} impact of its law repealing prohibitions of use went into effect. The law reduced the penalty for personal possession of an <b>ounce</b> or less of marijuana from a felony to a citable misdemeanor with a maximum fine of $100. Possession of more than an <b>ounce</b> was made a misdemeanor, making the maximum fine $500 and/or six months in jail.

5|$|It is most {{convenient}} {{to compare the}} various local weight standards by the metric weights of their ounces. The actual mass of an <b>ounce</b> varied by ±17% (5g) around the typical value of 30g. The table only shows approximate values for the most important standards; even the same nominal standard could vary slightly between one city and its neighbour. The range from 25g to 31g is filled with numerous variants, especially the Italian range up to 28g. But there is a relatively large gap between the troy ounces of 31g and the Habsburg <b>ounce</b> of 35g. The latter {{is the product of}} an 18th-century weight reform.|$|E
