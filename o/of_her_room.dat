5|$|Anna is {{the younger}} {{child in the}} royal family of Arendelle, whose older sister, Elsa is born {{with the power to}} create and control ice and snow. As children, they enjoy the life of princesses using Elsa's {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland for their enjoyment. After they create a snowman named Olaf in the throne room, Elsa accidentally strikes Anna unconscious with her magic. The king and queen hurriedly take Anna to the mountain trolls for help. The troll king, Pabbie, erases Anna's memory of her sister's magic, nulling Elsa's power, only leaving memory of the fun the sisters shared. Pabbie warns Elsa to control her powers—a strike to Anna's heart would have been fatal. In an effort to protect Anna, the king and queen lock the castle gates and generally restrict Elsa to her new separate bedroom. Confused by the sudden loss of contact by Elsa, Anna makes repeated failed attempts to draw her out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b> Elsa cares too much for her sister, traumatized by the near-death experience and she resists reconnecting with Anna. Eventually, the younger sister ceases trying to rekindle their bond. The sisters become even more isolated from each other after their parents, the King and Queen of Arendelle, die in a shipwreck. Devastated by the news, Anna tries to reunite with her sister, looking for love and comfort in the tragedy. Elsa remains in her room, not attending her parents' funeral.|$|E
5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most of the time, she is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b> When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E
25|$|Alexa Vega as Shilo Wallace, a 17-year-old girl {{confined}} {{to her room}} due to the alleged blood disorder she inherited from her mother. She is the film's primary protagonist, who dreams of exploring the world outside of her bedroom, which she considers her prison. While she initially strives to obey her father's rules, later in the story, she {{becomes more and more}} assertive, attempting to earn her independence. Prior to the story she has often snuck out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> at night to collect bugs, and shots <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> shows she has an impressive collection.|$|E

60|$|Paul {{found no}} one in the hall of the house where Adrea lived to take him to her, so after waiting a few minutes for her maid, whom the porter had twice fruitlessly summoned, he ascended the stairs alone, and knocked at the door <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
60|$|Tavernake {{found his}} courage almost leaving {{him as he}} knocked at the door <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>Her</b> French maid ushered him into the little sitting-room, where, to his dismay, he found three men, one sitting on the table, the other two in easy-chairs. Elizabeth, in a dress of pale blue satin, was {{standing}} before the mirror. She turned round as Tavernake entered.|$|R
25|$|Wargrave then {{suggests}} searching all the rooms, and any {{potentially dangerous}} items they {{can think of}} are locked up. Lombard's gun is missing from his room. When Vera goes upstairs to take a bath, she is shocked by the touch and smell of seaweed left {{hanging from the ceiling}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> and screams; the remaining guests rush upstairs to her room. Wargrave, however, is still downstairs. The others find him seated, immobile and crudely dressed up in the attire of a judge. Wargrave is examined briefly by Dr Armstrong and pronounced dead from a gunshot to the forehead.|$|E
25|$|He {{responded to}} these criticisms by attacking his detractors {{in the pages}} of Murray's Magazine, {{supporting}} vigilante activity, which the police on the streets knew was a bad idea, and publicly complaining about his lack of control of CID, which brought an official Home Office reprimand for discussing his office publicly without permission. Warren finally had enough and resigned – coincidentally right before the murder of Mary Jane Kelly on 9 November 1888. Every superintendent on the force visited him at home to express their regret. Warren's resignation hindered the investigation. He had given an order that if another murder occurred, nobody was to enter the scene – a strange turn of phrase as the four previous victims had all been found in the open street – until he arrived to direct the investigation. Consequently, when the murder of Kelly was discovered by a rent collector who looked in through the window <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> in a Spitalfields lodging house, the police did not enter the room for some three hours because, unaware of his resignation, they were waiting for Warren to arrive. He returned to military duties.|$|E
500|$|Eva is hospitalized and {{learns that}} she has cancer. She declines the {{position}} of Vice President due to her failing health, and makes one final broadcast {{to the people of}} Argentina. She understands that her life was short because she shone like the [...] "brightest fire", and helps Perón prepare to go on without her. A large crowd surrounds the Casa Rosada in a candlelight vigil praying for her recovery when the light <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> goes out, signifying her death. At Eva's funeral, Ché is seen at her coffin, marveling at the influence of her brief life. He walks up to her glass coffin, kisses it, and joins the crowd of passing mourners.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1959, while on a holiday trip to Edinburgh, Brown noticed an old etching press in the {{backyard}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>rooming</b> house. The landlady offered the press to Brown, saying it had been there since World War II. With the etching press in tow, Brown booked passage on a freighter going to San Francisco from Glasgow via the Panama Canal.|$|R

500|$|The final {{illustration}} of the Hachisuka scroll has no corresponding text section in the extant emaki fragments. However its content can be matched to {{a scene from the}} diary in which Murasaki Shikibu expresses her sorrows as a widow worrying about the future. She relates how she is gazing dreamily at the moon when she is [...] "hopelessly sad" [...] and lonely. Playing the koto (a kind of horizontal harp) on a cool evening makes her even more miserable. This section of the diary also contains a short description <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> containing two bookcases, one with books that her husband had placed there and that no one has touched since, the other with [...] "old poems and romances", likely referring to her own works. This scene is set on an unknown date in Kankō 6 (1009). The illustration present in the emaki shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a tatami room playing the koto with a court lady walking outside her room on the balcony (engawa).|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie Leonidas as Helena Campbell, a young circus {{performer}} and aspiring artist who is {{drawn into a}} mysterious world of masked people and monsters shortly after her mother is hospitalized. It is eventually revealed that the world she entered was created through her own drawings that she hung up on the walls <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b> Leonidas stated that she expected that filming would be difficult {{because most of the}} scenes were done with one or two other actors just with a bluescreen in the background, but also said that [...] "it all came alive" [...] for them when they started working.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} shot during {{the span of}} five weeks after {{intensive}} location-scouting by Pawlikowski. The script only contained 35 pages and was incomplete. Many scenes were improvised while shooting. [...] The scene in which Mona draws a portrait of Tamsin on the wall <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> was entirely improvised—during Pawlikowski's travelling together with Press, he discovered {{that she used to}} do a lot of drawing while she was thinking, so he decided to integrate it into the movie and made a scene out of it. [...] The whole shoot was done on location in Todmorden during the hottest summer Yorkshire had seen in 50 years.|$|E

50|$|Xinjie (Sheila Sim) is {{a mysterious}} girl {{who lives on}} her own in a big {{bungalow}} house. No one knows much about the girl except that she is leasing out rooms to strangers at an incredibly cheap rate turning away many prospective renters {{who believe that the}} house is haunted. Xinjie rented out 3 <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>rooms</b> at $200 per month each, and the only condition is that she wants <b>her</b> <b>room</b> mates to have breakfast with her every morning and dinner for at least 3 times a week.|$|R
2500|$|Dann {{continued}} to make numerous hang-up phone calls to her former in-laws, friends, and babysitting clients. Eventually, the calls escalated to death threats. An ex-boyfriend and his wife also received dozens of threatening calls. In May 1988, a letter, later confirmed to have been sent by Laurie Dann, {{was sent to the}} hospital administration where her ex-boyfriend then worked, again accusing him of sexual assault. Since the phone calls were across state lines, the FBI became involved, and a federal indictment against Dann was prepared. However, the ex-boyfriend, fearful of publicity, and concerned about Dann getting bail and then attempting to fulfill her threats against him, decided to wait until other charges were filed in Illinois. [...] In May 1988, a janitor found her lying in the fetal position inside a garbage bag in a trash room. [...] This precipitated a search <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> and her departure back to Glencoe.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{aspects of}} Kiki's {{behavior}} and appearance {{have been the}} focus of commentary. One major theme is Kiki's transition into adulthood. While being raised by loving parents who support her independence, [...] Kiki is faced with problems common in adolescence such as finding a job, seeking acceptance, and taking care of herself. The concept of vulnerability is also examined closely in the film. Critic Mark Schilling noted a scene during Kiki's first night away from home, staying with the bakers: [...] Early in the morning, she quickly steps out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> into the outhouses and peers out to see the husband, Fukuo, stretching his muscles. After he leaves the scene, Kiki rushes back to her room and slams the door behind her while gasping for air. [...] "The scene does absolutely nothing to advance the plot and the humor in it is low...but...it wordlessly — and eloquently — expresses Kiki's youth, vulnerability, and isolation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Helena and Valentine {{attempt to}} stay ahead of the shadows as they follow clues to the charm, {{learning}} that it is called the [...] "MirrorMask". Helena discovers that by looking through the windows of the buildings, she can see into her bedroom in the real world, through the drawings of windows that she created and hung on the wall <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b> She discovers that a doppelgänger of herself is living there and behaving radically different from her. The doppelganger soon becomes aware of her presence in the drawings and begins to destroy them, causing parts of the fantasy world to collapse. Valentine betrays Helena to the Queen of Shadows in exchange for a large reward of jewels. The Queen's servants warp Helena's mind so she will believe she is the Princess of Shadows. Valentine has a change of heart and returns to the Queen's palace, and helps Helena to break the spell on her. They search the Princess' room, and Helena discovers the MirrorMask hidden in the Princess' mirror. They flee the castle with the charm.|$|E

2500|$|Elements of Sir Launfal that {{borrow from}} Marie de France's Lanval {{can be found}} in other Breton lais as well, {{particularly}} the land of [...] "Fayerye". Marie de France's Yonec, for example, describes a woman following a trail of blood left by her lover; a man who was accustomed to arriving at the window <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> {{in the form of a}} hawk. She follows the trail of blood into the side of a hill and out into an Otherworld where all the buildings are made of solid silver, into a town where ships are moored. Marie's lai Guigemar, sees the wounded hero set sail in a mysterious boat with candelabra at its prow and with only a bed on deck, upon which he lies, the only living soul on board. He arrives safely at the mysterious castle of a lady who heals him of his wound, and becomes her lover. Sir Orfeo follows a company of ladies into the side of a cliff and through the rock until he emerges into an Otherworld, in a Middle English Breton lai, where he rescues his wife who had been abducted, from amongst those who have been beheaded and burnt and suffocated. Many ancient Irish tales involve a hero entering a hill of the Sidhe, or crossing a sea to a Land of Youth, or passing down through the waters of a lake into an Otherworld.|$|E
2500|$|A younger {{version of}} Jean, {{alongside}} teenage versions of Scott and Ororo, appears in [...] Now blue-eyed with long, loosely curled orange hair, this new variation of Jean had been located and enrolled sometime {{prior to the}} movie, as she, now in her mid-teens, is introduced as already being a student at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. When Alex Summers brings his younger brother to the school after his own optic laser blasts powers had manifested, Scott bumped into Jean, as he couldn't see due to being blindfolded. [...] Jean drops the many books, binders, and papers she held, but instantly we watch as this new incarnation of Jean telekinetically pulls them back into her hands, exhibiting seemingly little effort, which seems {{to imply that the}} Professor has left her mind unbarred. She gets mad at this, but apologizes as Scott explains he can't exactly look where he's going. Later, Jean is studying by a tree when Scott attempts to talk to her. Seeing the other students show fear, Jean explains that they're afraid of her because they are aware of her full powers, and therefore is treated as an outcast. Jean is affected by the energy wave released by an ancient, god-like mutant who had awakened that day. This causes Jean to have a nightmare of the world ending during which the entire school shakes, most of the students are awoken from sleep, and the Professor hurries to her room to find [...] that her telekinetic powers, already immensely strong, are quite literally burning the walls <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b> Telepathically reaching into Jean's mind to awaken her - an act that causes Charles a sizeable amount of pain - the wooden walls cease to burn and to emit smoke, and the Professor slumps back, substantially exhausted now. The powerful young psychic is reassured by Xavier that she is not losing control of her powers, despite her doubts. When the mansion is destroyed, she comforts Scott over the loss of his own brother and conceals herself, Scott, and Nightcrawler from Stryker's men. While in Stryker's base, she connects with Weapon X (Wolverine), and releases him from his cell. Before he, fearfully, leaves the complex Jean restores the few remaining memories of his that she can. She then joins the fight in Cairo. She telekinetically protects the group from Angel's metal wings. After Xavier is saved, he mentally links with her and reveals to Apocalypse that he is not the most powerful psychic, and convinces Jean to unleash the full extent of her powers. Her eyes glowing with an orangey-golden light, the powerful young Mutant's walks through midair and within a matter of seconds, a massive burst of telekinetic energy explodes outward from within Jean's body, almost instantaneously taking the shape of a great, fiery bird. With a single powerful scream that is as much verbal as it is mental, Jean Grey incinerates Apocalypse and helps to psychically restore and revive Professor Xavier. She is last seen helping to re-build the mansion, alongside Erik Lensherr, before joining Cyclops, Storm, Nightcrawler, Quicksilver, under the leadership of Hank and Raven, to become the new official team of X-Men and preparing to test her powers in her very first Danger Room session against a group of Mark I Sentinels.|$|E
