50|$|These bees {{have been}} {{observed}} to indicate the presence or lack thereof of food through visual or <b>olfactory</b> <b>marks.</b> Certain forager species choose <b>olfactory</b> <b>marks</b> to indicate specifically rich food sources. Depending on the resources shape and color there are different responses and communication behaviors exhibited by the bee. Additionally, this behavior decreases the competition between nest mates because the bees are able to exploit and find new food sources using their olfactory and visual senses. Individuals tend to leave a scent of food in order to advertise when there is food whether it is far or close to the colony, which helps to indicate to other species the level of competition for such a small or large amount of food.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Olfaction {{is often}} {{affected}} in parkinsonian patients, but dopaminergic {{cells in the}} olfactory bulb are not affected by some Parkinson-inducing drugs. We investigated whether the drug MPTP produces the olfactory deficits typical of Parkinson and affects the olfactory bulb in mice. Findings Lesioned and control mice were tested for olfactory search, for motor and exploratory behavior. Brains and olfactory mucosa were investigated via immunohistochemistry for thyrosine hydroxylase, <b>Olfactory</b> <b>Marker</b> Protein and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase as an intracellular pathway involved in dopaminergic neurotransmission. MPTP induced motor impairment, but no deficit in olfactory search. Thyrosine hydroxylase {{did not differ in}} olfactory bulb, while a strong decrease was detected in substantia nigra and tegmentum of MPTP mice. <b>Olfactory</b> <b>Marker</b> Protein decreased in the olfactory bulb of MPTP mice, while a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase increased in the inner granular layer of MPTP mice. Conclusions MPTP mice do not present behavioural deficits in olfactory search, yet immunoreactivity reveals modifications in the olfactory bulb, and suggests changes in intracellular signal processing, possibly linked to neuron survival after MPTP...|$|R

40|$|Asthma needs {{continuous}} treatment {{often for}} years. In humans, some drugs are administered via aerosol, therefore {{they come in}} contact with both respiratory and olfactory mucosa. We explored the possibility that antiasthma corticosteroid treatment could influence the olfactory function by passage through the nose. A group of mice was exposed twice daily for 42 days to fluticasone propionate aerosol and was compared with a control group. Olfactory behavior, respiratory mechanics, histology, and immunoreactivity in the olfactory system were assessed. Fluticasone-treated mice were slower in retrieving a piece of hidden food, but both groups were similarly fast when the food was visible. When a clearly detectable odor was present in the environment, all mice behaved in a similar way. Respiratory mechanics indices were similar in all mice except for the viscose resistance, which was reduced in fluticasone-treated mice. Olfactory mucosa of fluticasone-treated mice was thicker than that of controls. Slight but consistent differences in staining were present for <b>Olfactory</b> <b>Marker</b> Protein but not for other proteins. A mild impairment of olfactory function is present in mice chronically treated with fluticasone aerosol, apparently accompanied by slight modifications of the olfactory receptor cells, and suggests monitoring of olfactory function modifications in long-term steroid users...|$|R

It focuses on both branches of the trade mark case law of the European Union, namely actions filed with the General Court against decisions of OHIM (and subsequent decisions of the Court of Justice on appeals) based on Council Regulation (EC) No. 207 / 2009 on the Community trade mark of 26 February 2009 and questions referred for a preliminary ruling by national courts of the EU Member States based on Directive 2008 / 95 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 to approximate {{the laws of the}} Member States relating to trade marks.

40|$|Finding the {{dynamics}} of an entire macromolecule is a complex problem as the model-free parameter values are intricately linked to the Brownian rotational diffusion of the molecule, mathematically through the autocorrelation function of the motion and statistically through model selection. The {{solution to this problem}} was formulated using set theory as an element of the universal set U—the union of all model-free spaces (d’Auvergne EJ and Gooley PR (2007) Mol BioSyst 3 (7), 483 – 494). The current procedure commonly used to find the universal solution is to initially estimate the diffusion tensor parameters, to optimise the model-free parameters of numerous models, and then to choose the best model via model selection. The global model is then optimised and the procedure repeated until convergence. In this paper a new methodology is presented which takes a different approach to this diffusion seeded model-free paradigm. Rather than starting with the diffusion tensor this iterative protocol begins by optimising the model-free parameters {{in the absence of any}} global model parameters, selecting between all the model-free models, and finally optimising the diffusion tensor. The new model-free optimisation protocol will be validated using synthetic data from Schurr JM et al. (1994) J Magn Reson B 105 (3), 211 – 224 and the relaxation data of the bacteriorhodopsin (1 – 36) BR fragment from Orekhov VY (1999) J Biomol NMR 14 (4), 345 – 356.

40|$|Damages to the {{olfactory}} system may cause behavioural modulation {{not limited to}} the sensory sphere. Ablation of olfactory bulbs in rodents induces a behavioural pattern with striking modifications in different behavioural domains, that may be rescued by antidepressant agents. A similar pattern was described also after peripheral destruction of the olfactory epithelium (OE, see Mucignat-Caretta et al. Neurobiol. Dis., 2004, 16, 386). In the present series of experiments, the intraperitoneal injection of 2, 6 -Dichlorobenzonitrile induced a selective lesion in the OE of male Swiss mice restricted to the dorsomedial zone (zone I of OE), as revealed by a thinner histological appearance. The lesion was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of the OE and olfactory bulbs, showing modifications in a variety of markers, including cAMP-dependent protein kinases, <b>Olfactory</b> <b>Marker</b> Protein and Tyrosine-hydroxylase in the OE zone I or in its projections to dorsomedial glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Modifications were also present in the subventricular zone and rostral migratory stream. A week after the injection, mice were tested for a variety of behavioural domains modulated by {{olfactory system}}, including exploratory, aggressive and anxious behaviours. Mice were anosmic, as shown by their inability to find a hidden piece of food. However, a reduction in the exploratory behaviour was also demonstrated in the open field test. Concerning social interactions, the olfactory lesioned mice attacked a male adult intruder mouse, similarly to control mice, but also increased the interspecific predatory aggression, similarly to olfactory bulb-lesioned mice. In conclusion, selective damages limited to zone I of OE are sufficient to induce some changes in the olfactory bulb circuitry that ultimately result in behavioural changes, similar to complete OE lesions. These data suggest a selective action of deafferentation on olfactory bulb output to limbic areas involved in behavioural modulation...|$|R
5000|$|Some {{animals have}} {{prominent}} [...] "badges" [...] or visual displays to advertise their territory, often {{in combination with}} scent marking or auditory signals. Male European robins are noted for their highly aggressive territorial behaviour. They attack other males that stray into their territories, and have been observed attacking other small birds without apparent provocation. Such attacks sometimes lead to fatalities, accounting for up to 10% of adult robin deaths in some areas. [...] The red breast of the bird (i.e. badge) is highly visible when it sings (vocal marking) at the boundary of its territory. The ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) advertises its territory with urine scent marks. When it is urinating for marking purposes, it holds its extremely distinctive tail {{high in the air}} adding a visual component to the advertisement; when it is urinating for eliminative purposes, its tail is only slightly raised. Rhinoceros have poor vision but may use visual marking. Dominant white rhino bulls mark their territory with faeces and urine (<b>olfactory</b> <b>marking).</b> The dung is laid in well defined piles. There may be 20 to 30 of these piles to alert passing rhinoceroses that it is occupied territory. Other males may deposit dung over the piles of another and subsequently the sign-post grows larger and larger. Such a dung heap can become up to five metres wide and one metre high. [...] After defecating, greater one-horned rhinos scratch their hind feet in the dung. By continuing to walk, they “transport” their own smell around the paths, thus establishing a scent-marked trail. Another method of visually marking their territory is wiping their horns on bushes or the ground and scraping with the feet, although this is likely combined with the smell of the marking animal. The territorial male scrape-marks every 30 m or so around its territory boundary.|$|R
40|$|Many rodents, birds, marsupials, and humans, are altricial animals. Born closed-eyed, immobile, and helpless, many altricial species depend {{critically}} {{on their}} olfactory system for survival. Interestingly, the olfactory system is immature at birth, and undergoes a maturation process while the animal matures to become self reliant. In behavioral studies, newborn rats are responsive to olfactory cues with low sensitivity, but improve their detection thresholds for natural and synthetic odors {{within the first}} two weeks of birth. At birth, olfactory discrimination is also poor, as rat pups fail to prefer conspecifics to huddle with until two weeks of age. At the cellular level, extracellular recordings of unlabeled embryonic olfactory sensory neurons show a gradual shift from broad tuning to narrow tuning in odor preference. ^ My dissertation is directed at investigating how the function of the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the olfactory epithelium of mice matures in the first month of life. <b>Olfactory</b> <b>Marker</b> Protein (OMP), an abundant protein unique to OSNs, has a developmentally regulated expression pattern that coincides with major events in the development of the olfactory system. I have investigated whether OMP is required for functional maturation, and if its deletion results in functionally immature OSNs. Using patch clamp technique in transgenic mouse lines where one olfactory receptor population is identifiable by fluorescent labeling, I have found that individual OSNs undergo a functional maturation process in the first month of a mouse 2 ̆ 7 s life, in terms of odor response kinetics, sensitivity, and selectivity. OMP seems critical for this maturation process, as OSNs lacking OMP expression are arrested in an immature functional state. In ongoing biochemical and electrophysiological studies, altered adenylate cyclase regulation may be an important factor underlying the immature OMP-KO phenotype. It is interesting to consider these findings in the context of the maturation of the olfactory system necessary for survival in the altricial mouse. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{cephalopod}} olfactory organ {{was described}} {{for the first}} time in 1844 by Kollinker who was attracted from the pair of pits, one on each side of the head, in both octopuses and squids. In 1974 Woodhams and Messenger wrote “A note on the ultrastructure of the Octopus olfactory organ” in which they used the electron microscopy techniques to describe the structure of the Olfactory Epithelium (OE). More information about the OE has been gained in Octopus joubini in which Emery (1976) characterized six types of Olfactory Receptor Neurons (ORNs), but to date not much is known about its functions. Recently, in squid two pathways of signal transduction have been found mediate the odor responsiveness. Just like O. jubini the O. vulgaris olfactory organ is localized on each side of the head anteriorly to the dorsal junction of the mantel with the body, it appear to be a tiny white hole hard to be recognized. At light microscope the OE result to be organized in bagged bulge whose surface layer is made of ORNs and sustentacular cells, underneath a group of ring shape cells give turgor to the entire structure. The <b>Olfactory</b> <b>Marker</b> Protein (OMP) is an abundant, phylogenetically conserved, cytoplasmic protein of unknown function expressed in vertebrate mature olfactory sensory neurons, we found a strong OMP immunoreactivity in almost all the octopus ORNs.

Moreover, by means Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry, we observed a diffuse proliferative activity within the superficial layers of ORNs with a slightly more intense immunoreactivity along the marginal side of the bag.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the behaviour in captivity of the dasyurid marsupial Phascogale tapoatafa. Each behaviour was initially described and defined in terms of its observed effect, whether on the animal itself, on a conspecific, on a prey species or on an object or structure. Locomotor, exploratory and grooming behaviour of solitary animals is described. Movements involved in prey catching are defined, and their sequential relationships in encounters with various prey are examined. Movements do not occur randomly, but are ordered on the basis of facilitation of one movement by another, and of feedback to the animal from the situation and the behaviour of the prey. Prey are not divisible into classes on the basis of the predator's responses to them. Data available for other dasyurids is compared. The adaptive value of prey-catching behaviour is discussed in terms of the ability of the prey to resist predation. The reproductive strategy is examined with both field and laboratory studies. P. tapoatafa exhibits a life-history strategy similar to that of Antechinus stuartii, in which all males die after first breeding. The adaptive value of this strategy is discussed in terms of reproductive effort and the predictability of the environment. Nest-building and copulatory behaviour are briefly described. The development of behaviour is described in terms of the acquisition by the young of sensory modalities and locomotor skills, and of the changing relationships amongst the litter-mates and between the mother and her offspring. The daily pattern of activity is described. On short nights, the animal may be active for most of the night. During winter, the night is divided into periods of activity and periods of inactivity. The survival value of this strategy is discussed in terms of feeding and energetics. Communication is described in terms of the sensory modalities used, the signals observed and the observed effect on other animals. P. tapoatafa shows a small range of auditory signals which may form a graded communication system. <b>Olfactory</b> <b>marking</b> by males is pronounced during the breeding season.

40|$|The {{influence}} of proximal olfactory cues on place learning and memory was tested {{in two different}} spatial tasks. Rats were trained to find a hole leading to their home cage or a single food source {{in an array of}} petri dishes. The two apparatuses differed both by the type of reinforcement (return to the home cage or food reward) and the local characteristics of the goal (masked holes or salient dishes). In both cases, the goal was in a fixed location relative to distant visual landmarks and could be marked by a local olfactory cue. Thus, the position of the goal was defined by two sets of redundant cues, each of which was sufficient to allow the discrimination of the goal location. These experiments were conducted with two strains of hooded rats (Long-Evans and PVG), which show different speeds of acquisition in place learning tasks. They revealed that the presence of an <b>olfactory</b> cue <b>marking</b> the goal facilitated learning of its location and that the facilitation persisted after the removal of the cue. Thus, the proximal olfactory cue appeared to potentiate learning and memory of the goal location relative to distant environmental cues. This facilitating effect was only detected when the expression of spatial memory was not already optimal, i. e., during the early phase of acquisition. It was not limited to a particular strain...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Parkinson’s disease (PD) often first {{presents}} with asymmetric motor symptoms. A {{number of}} studies have now established that sensory deficits can also be similarly asymmetric. It is well established that PD is associated with <b>marked</b> <b>olfactory</b> dysfunction, but whether this too present asymmetrically is a currently contentious question. Methods: To address this, we recruited 12 early stage Parkinson patients with right-sided motor symptoms and compared them to 12 healthy age-matched controls on tests of olfactory identification and recognition, administered separately to each nostril. Results: Data analyses indicated that Parkinson patients performed worse with the left nostril on both tasks, while no nostril-related differences were observed for the healthy age-matched control group on the same comparisons. Conclusion: These findings support the idea that asymmetric deficits do extend into olfactory performance in PD—as they do into other sensory domains—and we examine the possibility that they might be a particular feature of right-sided motor symptom presentation. 4 page(s...|$|R
40|$|After total laryngectomy, the {{patients}} often report immediate and <b>marked</b> <b>olfactory</b> deficit. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether hyposmia in laryngectomees reflects olfactory epithelial damage. Ten laryngectomized patients and ten rhinologically normal subjects were subjected to olfactory testing, after which histological examination of biopsied olfactory mucosa was performed. Olfactory testing in laryngectomees revealed a marked reduction in odor perception. Histological examination of olfactory mucosa specimens showed that in laryngectomees some neuroepithelial structural features were comparable with those found in normal subjects. However, additional signs of damage were also observed, consisting mainly of various degrees of epithelial degeneration, above and beyond those that are characteristic of physiological epithelium turnover. These different degenerative features consisted of severe damage to the neuroepithelium, culminating in complete topical loss. Bowman's glands were also observed to be involved in the degenerative process. Laryngectomy-induced hyposmia seems to be correlated with the almost complete loss of nasal airflow due to the disconnection between the upper and lower airways, which prevents odor molecules from reaching the olfactory area, together with degenerative phenomena, which affect the neuroepithelium, and consequent failure in neurosensorial performance...|$|R
40|$|Mate choice by females can {{introduce}} difficulties to captive breeding programs because {{there may be}} a conflict between the conservation manager's choice of mate (based on random allocation or maximizing heterogeneity) and the females' own preferences, often resulting in incompatibility and aggression. Similar effects are caused by inappropriate social contexts at the time of pairing. We manipulated the social experience of male and female harvest mice (Micromys minutus) to investigate whether we could enhance compatibility between randomly allocated mates by altering female preferences. In one experiment, we used a choice test to identify female preferences between two males and then varied the competitive context of unpreferred males by transferring competitor's scent marks into their cages. The manipulation caused them to increase their investment in a form of <b>olfactory</b> signaling (scent <b>marking),</b> which female rodents use as an indicator of male quality when choosing mates. The manipulation increased their attractiveness relative to the initially preferred male when the choice test was repeated. In a second experiment, we tested the effect of females' familiarity with the odor of males by transfer of male scent marks to female cages. Females preferred familiar males in choice tests and were less aggressive toward them when pairs were introduced than females paired with unfamiliar males. This kind of approach can influence mate choice, and transferring scent marks between cages or collections is an effective and practical behavioral means of improving success in conservation breeding programs...|$|R

A <b>marked</b> feature of the bulb is its massive innervation by cholinergic inputs from the basal forebrain. In this study, we addressed the functional interaction between cholinergic inputs and intrinsic bulbar circuitry. Determining the roles of acetylcholine (ACh) requires the characterization of cholinergic effects on both neural excitability and synaptic transmission. For this purpose, we used electrophysiological techniques to localize and characterize the diverse roles of ACh in mouse {{olfactory bulb}} slices. We found that cholinergic inputs have {{a surprising number of}} target receptor populations that are expressed on three different neuronal types in the bulb. Specifically, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors excite both the output neurons of the bulb, i. e., the mitral cells, as well as interneurons located in the periglomerular regions. These nicotine-induced responses in interneurons are short lasting, whereas responses in mitral cells are long lasting. In contrast, muscarinic receptors have an inhibitory effect on the firing rate of interneurons from a deeper layer, granule cells, {{while at the same time}} they increase the degree of activity-independent transmitter release from these cells onto mitral cells. Cholinergic signaling thus was found to have multiple and opposing roles in the olfactory bulb. These dual cholinergic effects on mitral cells and interneurons may be important in modulating olfactory bulb output to central structures required for driven behaviors and may be relevant to understanding mechanisms underlying the perturbations of cholinergic inputs to cortex that occur in Alzheimer's disease...|$|R

Fewer than a dozen species of amphibians are commonly maintained in laboratory colo-nies, and the husbandry requirements {{for the vast majority}} of amphibians are poorly known. For these species, a review of basic characteristics of amphibian biology supplemented by inferences drawn from the morphological and physi-ological characteristics of the species in question provides a basis for decisions about housing and feeding. Amphibians are ectotherms, and their skin is permeable to water, ions, and respiratory gases. Most species are secretive and, in many cases, nocturnal. The essential characteristics of their environment include appropriate levels of humidity, tem-perature, and lighting as well as retreat sites. Terrestrial and arboreal species require moist substrates, water dishes, and high relative humidity. Because temperature requirements for most species are poorly known, it is advisable to use a temperature mosaic that will allow an animal to find an appropriate temperature within its cage. Photoperiod may affect physiology and behavior (especially reproduction and hibernation), and although the importance of ultraviolet light for calcium metabolism by amphibians is not yet known, ecological observations suggest that it might be im-portant for some species of frogs. Some amphibians are territorial, and some use <b>olfactory</b> cues to <b>mark</b> their terri-tory and to recognize other individuals of their species.
