5|$|Also, third eyelid. A {{transparent}} or translucent third eyelid that {{is drawn}} across the eye for protection, to moisten it while maintaining vision. The nictitating membrane also covers {{the eye and}} acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> eye is threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E

5|$|An {{observer}} was {{vulnerable to}} an enemy sniper firing a bullet through his loophole, but Hesketh-Prichard devised a metal-armoured double loophole {{that would protect}} him. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. <b>Only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition of the Sun and Moon, but <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E

5|$|Bughouse {{is usually}} played using clock move, which allows {{touching}} of pieces. A move is completed <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> clock is pressed. Touch move is practiced {{to a lesser}} extent. When used, it applies to pieces in reserve as well; they are considered dropped after contact has been made with an empty square.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|Edward Epstein {{recognized}} in 1969 that the atmosphere {{could not be}} completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed using an ensemble of stochastic Monte Carlo simulations to produce means and variances {{for the state of}} the atmosphere. Although this early example of an ensemble showed skill, in 1974 Cecil Leith showed that they produced adequate forecasts <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> ensemble probability distribution was a representative sample of the probability distribution in the atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Genes are {{regulated}} {{so that they}} are expressed <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be regulated at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E
5|$|It is safe {{to observe}} the total phase of a solar eclipse {{directly}} <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Sun's photosphere is completely covered by the Moon, and not before or after totality. During this period, the Sun is too dim to be seen through filters. The Sun's faint corona will be visible, and the chromosphere, solar prominences, and possibly even a solar flare may be seen. At the end of totality, the same effects will occur in reverse order, and {{on the opposite side}} of the Moon.|$|E

Goldstone has criticised the United Nations Human Rights Council's selective endorsement of the report his commission compiled, since the resolution adopted chastises Israel <b>only,</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> report itself is critical of both parties.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} month, Frail {{observed}} that the luminosity of the radio source fluctuated significantly {{from day to day}} but increased on average. The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> source has an apparent diameter of less than 3microarcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Starburst {{galaxies are}} {{characterized}} by dusty concentrations of gas {{and the appearance of}} newly formed stars, including massive stars that ionize the surrounding clouds to create H II regions. These massive stars produce supernova explosions, resulting in expanding remnants that interact powerfully with the surrounding gas. These outbursts trigger a chain reaction of star building that spreads throughout the gaseous region. <b>Only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> available gas is nearly consumed or dispersed does the starburst activity end.|$|E

Alongside the National Flag, the flag of the country visited should also be flown; however, when the aircraft lands in countries en route, the national flags of the respective countries would be flown instead. When carrying the president within India, aircraft display the flag on the side the president embarks or disembarks; the flag is similarly flown on trains, but <b>only</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> train is stationary or approaching a railway station.|$|E
