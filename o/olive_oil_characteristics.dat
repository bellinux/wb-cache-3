40|$|Abstract Extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> is an {{important}} constituent of the Mediterranean diet and {{is considered one of}} the contributing factors in counteracting cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Epidemiological evidences indicate that the well-known benefits of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> intake on human health should be ascribed not only to the elevated oleic acid content, but also, to its minor components, in particular polyphenols. The protective effects of phenolic compounds can be attributed to their strong antioxidant activity, besides their antihemorragic, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. 	 Nevertheless, several studies have shown that polyphenols, in certain conditions, can act as pro-oxidants thereby exerting cytotoxic and mutagenic effects. The present study was aimed at investigating the biochemical and biological properties of phenols, extracted from samples of traditionally manufactured extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> differing in cultivars, locations, sources and year of harvest and production. The concentration and the relative proportion of phytochemical compounds of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> depend on several factors, including the cultivar, the soil, the climate and the production methods and storage conditions.

40|$|The {{maximization}} of both extraction {{yield and}} {{extra virgin olive}} oil quality during olive processing are the main objectives of the olive oil industry. As regards extraction yield, it can be improved by both acting on time/temperature of malaxation and using physical coadjuvants. It is well known that, generally, increasing temperature of malaxation gives an increase in oil extraction yield due to a reduction in oily phase viscosity; however, high malaxation temperature can compromise the nutritional and health values of {{extra virgin olive oil}}, leading to undesirable effects such as accelerated oxidative process and loss of volatile compounds responsible for oil flavor and fragrance. The addition of physical coadjuvants in olive oil processing during the malaxation phase, not excluded by EC regulations owing to its exclusively physical action, is well known to promote the breakdown of oil/water emulsions and consequently make oil extraction easier, thus increasing the yield. Among physical coadjuvants, micronized natural talc is used for olive oil processing above all for Spanish and Italian olive cultivars. The quality of extra virgin olive oil depends on numerous variables such as olive cultivar, ripeness degree and quality, machines utilized for processing, oil storage conditions, etc. However, the coadjuvants utilized in olive processing can also influence virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The literature highlights an increase in oil yield by micronized natural talc addition during olive processing, whereas no clear trend was observed as regards the chemical, nutritional and sensory characteristics of extra virgin olive oil. Although an increase in oil stability was reported, no effect of talc was found on the evolution of virgin olive oil quality indices during storage. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the {{territory}} of Sassari province analyzing the pedo-climatic conditions and chemical and sensory characteristics of cv Bosana monovarietal olive oil, {{one of the most}} widespread cultivar of Sardinia. As a first step a morpho-pedological land characterization was performed with the support of GIS (Geographical Information System, ArcView 3. 2 - ESRI). Iso-elevation curves map was obtained from the Geo-portal of the Region of Sardinia and elaborated to produce a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from which morphometric maps of altitude, slope and orientation of territory (field aspect) were processed with the spatial analysis tool. Furthermore a soil characterization was made using the Sardinia Region’s maps. As a result, the province of Sassari has been divided in three macro areas (Alghero, Sassari and Ittiri) and in each of them three olive groves has been selected in which to perform the fruits harvest. Olive fruits were manually harvested at three different stages of ripeness in each area (Alghero, Ittiri and Sassari). The olive oil production was carried out using a low scale mill in order to standardize all the technological parameters during the oil extraction. As a second step, chemical characterization was performed, considering indices of quality based on the EU Regulation, fatty acids profile, pigments profile, total phenols content, phenolic profile. A sensory characterization was also performed by the “ASSAM panel”. The data obtained were analyzed using one and two way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tuckey test to investigate the effect of the geographical origin and the influence of ripeness on the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The different content in some fatty acids, in antheraxanthin, in α and β+γ tochopherols and in vanillic acid observed in the oil samples is attributable to the production area, while the total phenol content, the other phenolic compounds and organoleptic profiles are not able to discriminate the production area. Significant differences between the three areas under study were not found for the trend of maturation; thus it was possible to conclude that the mesoclimatic differences of the three macro area were not strong enough to influence the ripening trend...|$|E

Diseño/metodología/enfoque : Aplicación del marco teórico de la intangibilidad al Aceite de Oliva y conceptualización de los activos intangibles y desarrollo de un estudio estadístico cuantitativo de valoración de los conceptos planteados. Aportaciones y resultados: Se propone una conceptualización de los activos intangibles que conforman el significado del Aceite de Oliva, más allá de lo meramente alimenticio. El desarrollo de la conceptualización de la intangibilidad del Aceite de Oliva responde a una estrategia de reposicionamiento del producto ante la competencia en un escenario de globalización de los mercados. Limitaciones: El estudio parte de la limitación del uso de un método estadístico con un margen de confiabilidad exigente, pero difuso en la realidad, teniendo en cuenta que el impacto del consumo del Aceite de Oliva en el mundo es de tan sólo el 5 % en el mercado de grasas vegetales. Implicaciones prácticas: El trabajo expone las características intangibles que tiene el Aceite de Oliva, más allá de lo meramente alimenticio. Esta caracterización no es algo nuevo, es simplemente una conceptualización de aspectos tan cotidianos que no se le da la importancia que verdaderamente tienen, sobre todo, como elementos de diferenciación ante la competencia en un mercado tan feroz como el que vivimos. El posicionamiento comercial de un producto necesita de nuevas estrategias de diferenciación y el Aceite de Oliva puede utilizar los intangibles que conforman su significado para, cuando menos, justificar que el precio sea mayor que otras grasas vegetales. Implicaciones sociales: El sector oleícola está en una situación de debilidad ante la depresión comercial importante que estamos viviendo, y ello arrastra a los olivicultores que dedican su trabajo a la producción de Aceite de Oliva, la mayoría implantados en el medio rural, lo que le infiere un impacto social importante por la gran pérdida de rentas que están sufriendo en los últimos años. Originalidad / Valor añadido: El Aceite de Oliva es un producto característico de la cultura mediterránea, y el trabajo conceptualiza todos aquellos aspectos que lo conforman desde que se comenzó a producir hace varios milenios y, cuyos significados, han ido perdiendo impacto en el conocimiento del consumidor actual. El reposicionamiento de un producto característico de nuestra forma de vida a partir de los valores intrínsecos de nuestra cotidianeidad añade una característica más a este trabajo y a los valores que caracterizan a nuestra cultura y nuestra sociedad.

Substitute test conditions for migration into <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> according to European Union Directive EC/ 97 / 48 were applied using 95 % ethanol and isooctane. Results showed that 95 % ethanol overestimated while isooctane underestimated the respective migration into <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Water was the best <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> substitute, as {{migration of}} laurolactam into water and <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> using the same temperature gave similar results. Additionally, diffusion kinetics of laurolactam were investigated by migration kinetic studies using isooctane and <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Diffusion coefficients determined with isooctane {{were significantly higher than}} those found using <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> It was proved that isooctane had an interaction and <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> was inert to the polymer. The diffusion conductance parameter, A p, for nylon 12 determined using <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 6...|$|R
50|$|Free acidity is an {{important}} parameter that defines the quality of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and {{is defined as a}} percentage as grams of free fatty acids (expressed as oleic acid, the main fatty acid present in <b>olive</b> <b>oil)</b> in 100 grams of oil. As defined by the European Commission regulation No. 2568/91 and subsequent amendments, the highest quality <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (Extra-Virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil)</b> must feature a free acidity lower than 0.8%. Virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> is characterized by acidity between 0.8% and 2%, while lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (a low quality oil that is not edible) features a free acidity higher than 2%. The increase of free acidity in <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> is due to free fatty acids that are released from triglycerides.|$|R

30|$|EEC Regulation 2568 / 91 [1] and International Olive Council (IOC) [2] have {{established}} both analytical and organoleptic criteria {{to define the}} quality grade of an <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> According {{to the results of}} chemical and sensory analyses, an <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> can be classified as extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (EVOO), virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Each category has a completely different commercial and nutritional value. Extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (EVOO) is a natural fruit juice with peculiar nutritional, healthy [3] and sensory [4] qualities as well as it represents a fundamental component of Mediterranean diet which is very rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids [5] and polyphenols [6]. On the contrary, lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> have a distinctly unpleasant smell, are not edible and are used for the production of refined <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> It is well known that selling virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> or lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> as EVOOs is a fraud. However, another important aspect to consider is that the downgrading of an EVOO to a lower category implies a big economic loss for the producers. So, it is fundamental that both the chemical analyses and the organoleptic evaluations used to define quality grade are “sufficiently” objective and reproducible.|$|R
40|$|Traditional <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> {{production}} {{is limited by}} its high cost, mainly due to labour expenses for harvesting and pruning. New olive cultivars (e. g. Arbequina, Arbosana, Koroneiki) with greater adaptability to modern irrigated high-density orchards and producing good quality <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> are highly demanded by an <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> industry in continuous change The {{aim of this study}} is the characterization of monovarietal virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> from three cultivars (Arbequina, Arbosana and Koroneiki) recently introduced in east of Morocco, and the comparison with traditional local Picholine Marocaine <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Several analytical parameters were evaluated; including quality index, Triacylglycerol, fatty acids, phenolic and chlorophyll contents and oxidative stability. Significant differences between the analysed <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> were detected. <b>Olive</b> <b>oils</b> from Koroneiki and Arbosana cultivars had higher values of oleic acid (respectively 76. 24 and 75. 68 %); Picholine <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> had the lowest one 67. 49 %. Koroneiki <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> was noteworthy for its higher content of phenolic compounds (459. 48 mg / kg) and a high oxidative stability (93. 16 h).
