40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} intensified international competition on industry profits in six European Union (EU) countries. The paper uses two methods to estimate industry profits. The traditional method uses accounting data to obtain a measure of gross price-average cost margins. The second method directly estimates markups of price over marginal cost using new empirical techniques. Import competition is found to have disciplined market power, regardless of the method used to estimate industry profits. From {{the analysis of the}} markups, there is evidence that this is due mainly to <b>intra-EU</b> <b>import</b> competition. The evidence for export discipline is much weaker. ...|$|R
40|$|Austria's {{accession}} to the European Community {{has created a}} new framework against which to evaluate Austria's foreign trade sector. The EU 15 is the world's largest exporter. In 1994, exports of the EU, including trade within the EU, accounted for two fifths of world trade, twice as much as the trade share of the USA (11. 8 percent) and of Japan (9. 7 percent) taken together. Even excluding <b>intra-EU</b> trade, <b>which</b> in 1994 amounted to one fourth of world trade, the EU is the world's largest exporter with a share of 20 percent. In the 1990 s though, the EU suffered market losses. Foreign trade of the EU is heavily concentrated: the three largest countries (Germany, France, United Kingdom) account {{for more than half of}} total exports; the largest six countries account for more than four fifths (81 percent) of EU exports. About one fourth of EU exports originate in Germany alone. The EU countries conduct the major part of their foreign trade with each other. Intra-EU exports total 63 percent of total exports of the EU; <b>intra-EU</b> <b>imports</b> total 61 percent of total imports of the EU. With a share of 65 percent, Austria's integration into the EU is slightly above average. Even though Austria is one of the smaller EU countries, countries which as a rule are intensively engaged in trade, the relation of exports to GDP was only 22. 7 percent, slightly above the EU average (22. 3 percent). The EU's exports to countries outside the EU (extra-EU exports) amounted to 8. 4 percent of GDP. This figure was lower than that for Japan (8. 6 percent) and slightly higher than that for the USA Thus, foreign trade plays approximately the same role in all the regions of the triad. 75 percent of Austria's <b>intra-EU</b> <b>imports</b> originate in those seven EU countries which are considered likely candidates for the EMU. In both France and Germany, this figure is only 55 percent. These two countries, therefore, have the utmost interest in maintaining strict exchange rate discipline in the envisaged "EMS II". Austria is mainly concerned with Italy's participation in the EMU, because in that case the share of EU trade not jeopardized by exchange rate fluctuations would rise above 90 percent. The importance of the developing countries as a market for EU exports rose substantially during the early 1990 s. Sales to the non-OPEC countries advanced very rapidly, while OPEC's share in exports declined. 17. 7 percent of total extra-EU exports or almost half of the exports to the developing countries go to the Far East; the corresponding figures are 7. 5 percent for the Middle East, 8. 1 percent for Africa, and 5. 7 percent for Latin America. In Austria, 22 percent of extra-EU exports were destined for the developing countries; Austria also had a relatively strong position in the OPEC (6 percent). Manufactured products dominate foreign trade of the EU: this group accounts for 84. 1 percent of total exports, and 78. 8 percent of total imports, with machinery and transport equipment constituting the most important items. The share of semi-manufactures (mostly low-grade goods used in manufacturing) in exports is substantially smaller in the EU (18. 2 percent) than in Austria (28. 9 percent); steel accounted for only 3. 5 percent of total EU exports (Austria 5. 3 percent); the figures for textiles are 3. 1 percent (4. 1 percent). As far as intermediary products are concerned, agricultural products with a share of 10 percent are the most important export items. Außenhandel der EU.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{empirical}} assessment of economic {{interactions between the}} labour markets of the integrating EU over {{the period of time}} 1995 – 2005. Drawing on recently made available industry statistics, we provide a sector level study (13 tradable sectors, including manufacturing and services), analysing the contemporary evolution of domestic and trade partners’ employment levels. Given the intensification of trade relations as a result of ongoing integration process, we build a sector-specific measure of economic interdependency, based on information on labour markets’ performance and weighted by the magnitude of <b>intra-EU</b> trade flows (<b>imports).</b> The estimates of a dynamic empirical model confirm the interactions between employment levels in different Member States. Domestic employment in NMS- 5 is rather positively affected by the expansion of labour markets in other EU’s trade partners (domestic employment levels in NMS- 5 countries improve in parallel to the increase in foreign tradable sectors’ employment). The opposite holds true for EU- 15 domestic labour markets that are rather challenged by the expansion of tradable sectors in their EU trade partners. EU integration, labour markets, trade...|$|R
