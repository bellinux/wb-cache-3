5|$|Parliament {{had been}} limited {{to a maximum of}} seven years under the Septennial Act 1716, but the Parliament Act 1911 amended the Septennial Act to limit Parliament to five years, {{beginning}} the first meeting of Parliament after the election. In practice, no election was absolutely forced by that limitation; until the Septennial Act was repealed by the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, all parliaments were dissolved by the Monarch under the Royal Prerogative on request of the Prime Minister. It should be noted, however, that the five-year maximum duration in the amended Septennial Act referred to the lifetime of the Parliament, and not to the interval between general elections. For example, the 2010 general election was held five years and one day after the 2005 general election, whilst the 1992 general election was held on 9 April 1992 and the next general election was not held until 1 May 1997. The reduction in Parliament length was seen as a counterbalance to the new powers granted to the Commons. The Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, in contrast, calls for general elections every five years (unless called sooner, as in 2017), and provides for dissolution of Parliament only by <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> prior to each election; it abolished dissolution under the Royal Prerogative.|$|E

A constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.|$|E

25|$|The maximum {{duration}} of each Parliament is five years from the date of its first sitting. If Parliament has not been dissolved before that period has elapsed, it is automatically dissolved by <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b> However, in most cases Parliament is dissolved and a general election called {{at the behest of}} the Prime Minister, who is entitled to advise the President to do so by a proclamation published in the Government Gazette. The President is not obliged to proclaim that Parliament is dissolved unless he is satisfied that the Prime Minister commands the confidence of a majority of MPs.

However, if the offender is 17 years old or younger, has a clean record, and such sexual activity was consensual, Youthful Offender status (a pre-trial diversionary program that seals the court record and results in a dismissal of charges) may be granted.

25|$|This {{does not}} mean that an MP retains his or her Parliamentary seat despite being under some {{disqualification}} until Parliament has made a formal decision on the matter. On 10 November 1986, the MP for Anson, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore, lost an appeal against a conviction for making a false statement in a declaration and was sentenced to one month's imprisonment and a fine of $5,000. Further applications and appeals in the criminal proceedings to the High Court, Court of Appeal and the Privy Council (then Singapore's highest court) were dismissed. On 9 December, the Speaker of Parliament made a statement in the House that Jeyaretnam had ceased to be an MP with effect from 10 November by virtue of having been convicted of an offence and sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000. Jeyaretnam did not object to the statement at the time. Under Article 45(2) of the Constitution, he was disqualified to be an MP until five years had elapsed from the date the fine was imposed. Jeyaretnam subsequently applied to court for a declaration that, among other things, he had not ceased to be an MP in 1986 and that the Speaker's statement had been ineffective because Parliament itself had not determined that he had vacated his seat. On 9 July 1990, the High Court ruled that Jeyaretnam had ceased to be an MP by <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> and that no separate determination by Parliament had been necessary.|$|E

Rather, the police are regarded as instruments of a legitimate institution by some population, and the organisation depends upon propaganda and habit to maintain popular deference to their authority. Similarly, economic organisations operate by the use of conditioning, in the form of money; but the strength of an economy arguably depends in large part on the functional <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> enforcement which makes commerce possible, by the regulation of peace and property rights.

500|$|The term {{representative}} democracy {{does not appear}} in the Constitution of Singapore. However, an analogy may be drawn from the approach taken by the High Court of Australia to the Australian Constitution. In Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997), the Court inferred that the Constitution embodies a system of representative and responsible government from various provisions, including those requiring periodic elections to choose the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Similarly, the Singapore Constitution prescribes that Parliament may be dissolved by the Prime Minister under certain conditions, and will be automatically dissolved by <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> five years from its first sitting. A general election must be held within three months after each dissolution of Parliament. The Constitution also states that [...] "he President shall be elected by the citizens of Singapore in accordance with any law made by the Legislature", and requires a poll for the election to be held not more than three months before the incumbent's term of office expires, or, if the office is vacated before the expiry date, within six months of the date when it becomes vacant. In addition, in the Proclamation of Singapore contained in the Independence of Singapore Agreement, which was entered into by the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore to effect Singapore's separation from Malaysia, the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed on behalf of the people and the Government that as from 9 August 1965 [...] "Singapore shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent nation...".|$|E
