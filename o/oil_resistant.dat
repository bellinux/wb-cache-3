5000|$|Coal tar is an {{aromatic}} hydrocarbon and a by-product from the coking {{process of the}} coal industry. It is historically in abundance where coal is used in steel manufacturing. It ages very slowly through volatilization and is an excellent waterproofing and <b>oil</b> <b>resistant</b> product.

It is typically ballasted with gravel to provide a walking surface, however a mineral surface membrane is available. Coal tar provides an extremely long life cycle that is sustainable and renewable. It takes energy to manufacture and to construct a roof with it but its proven longevity with periodic maintenance provides service for many years, with ages from 50 to 70 years not uncommon, with some now performing for over a century. Currently, there are cold process (no kettle is used) coal tar pitch products that almost eliminate all fumes associated with its typical hot process version.|$|E

40|$|Blending of {{polymers}} {{has gained}} much interest {{due to the}} fact that, {{it can be used to}} produce new polymeric materials with specific properties suitable for some special applications. The blends from acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), chloroprene rubber (CR) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has been designed for products working in contact with oils. The characteristics of the designed blends either binary blends (NBR/PVC or PVC/CR) or ternary blends (NBR/ PVC/CR) were investigated by rheological properties, mechanical analysis and swelling in oil and toluene. It was found that the incorporation of PVC in the blend compositions leads to the decrease in degree of swelling, the penetration rate and the average diffusion coefficient. On the other hand the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), the hardness and strain en-ergy were increased. This was attributed to the plastic nature of PVC, beside its additional behavior as filler. The crosslinking density in the blend vulcanizates under investigations was determined by Flory-Rehner and Mooney-Rivlin [Stress/Strain] equations. The higher values of crosslinking density determined by Mooney-Rivlin can be attributed to the additional physical crosslinks (e. g. entanglements etc), beside the chemical crosslinks determined by swelling in toluene.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} has been to prepare and characterise <b>oil</b> <b>resistant</b> {{cellulosic}} materials, ranging from model surfaces to papers and aerogels. The cellulosic materials were made <b>oil</b> <b>resistant</b> by chemical and topographic modifications, based on surface energy, surface roughness and barrier approaches. Detailed wetting studies of the prepared cellulosic materials were made using contact angle measurements and standardised penetration tests with different alkanes and oil mixtures. A significant part of the activities were devoted to the development of model cellulosic surfaces with different degrees of crystalline ordering for the wetting studies. Crystalline cellulose I, II and amorphous cellulose surfaces were prepared by spin-coating of cellulose nanocrystal or microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) dispersions, with Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) films or by a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition technique. The formation of multilayers consisting of polyethyleneimine (PEI) /anionic MFC or cationic MFC/anionic MFC was further studied and optimized in terms of total layer thickness and adsorbed amount by combining Dual Polarization Interferometry (DPI) or Stagnation Point Adsorption Reflectrometry (SPAR) with a Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D). The smooth cellulosic surfaces prepared had different molecular and mesostructure properties and different surface energies as shown by X-ray diffraction, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) imaging, ellipsometry measurements and contact angle measurements. The cellulose model surfaces were found to be ideal for detailed wetting studies, and after the surface has been coated or covalently modified with various amounts of fluorosurfactants, the fluorinated cellulose films were used to follow the spreading mechanisms of different oil mixtures. The viscosity and surface tension of the oil mixtures, as well as the dispersive surface energy of the cellulose surfaces, were found to be essential parameters governing the spreading kinetics. A strong correlation was found between the surface concentration of fluorine, the dispersive surface energy and the measured contact angle of the oil mixtures. Silicon surfaces possessing structural porous characteristics were fabricated by a plasma etching process. The structured silicon surfaces were coated with sulfate-stabilized cellulose I nanocrystals using the LbL technique. These artificial intrinsically oleophilic cellulose surfaces were made highly oleophobic when coated with a thin layer of fluorinated silanes. By comparison with flat cellulose surfaces, which are oleophilic, it is demonstrated that the surface energy and the surface texture are essential factors preventing oil from spreading on the surface and, thus, inducing the observed macroscopic oleophobic properties. The use of the MFC for surface coating on base papers demonstrated very promising characteristics as packaging materials. Environmental-Scanning Electron Microscopy (E-SEM) micrographs indicated that the MFC layer reduced the sheet porosity, i. e. the dense structure formed by the nanofibers resulted in superior oil barrier properties. Attempts were made to link the procedure for preparation of the MFC dispersions to the resulting microstructure of the coatings, and film porosity and the film moisture content to the resulting permeability properties. Finally, MFC aerogels were successfully prepared by freeze-drying. The surface texture of the porous aerogels was carefully controlled by adjusting the concentration of the MFC dispersion used for the freeze-drying. The different scales of roughness of the MFC aerogels were utilised, together with the very low surface energy created by fluorination of the aerogel, to induce highly oleophobic properties.

Routine analyses in accordance with EC regulation no. 2568 / 91, the determination of phenols by HPLC and induction times were carried out. On the whole, the simple phenolic compounds increased as darker olives were used whereas the hydrolysable phenolic compounds decreased. In both the cultivars, total phenols and induction times were significantly higher in the oils obtained from green olives than in oils from totally blackened olives. Hence, it seems advisable to delay olive harvesting for cultivars usually yielding bitter to pungent oils (e. g. Coratina), but to anticipate harvesting for olives producing sweet tasting oils (e. g.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of vulcanizates based on Hydrogenated Nitrile Butadiene Rubber (HNBR) are extremely attractive for many applications {{in comparison with}} other elastomers. In fact such type of materials exhibits good stability towards thermal ageing and better properties at low temperatures compared with other heat and <b>oil</b> <b>resistant</b> elastomers. This combination of properties is opening up {{a broad range of}} applications, mainly in the automotive industry like belts, seals and hoses. With reference to the in-service life of such components, it clearly appears that the obtainement of good fracture properties of HNBR-based systems is of basic importance. The present work is aimed at investigating the fracture behaviour of vulcanized HNBR systems containing different nanofillers, such as silica and multi wall carbon nanotubes (1). The fracture behavior of the different nanocomposites is studied by a fracture mechanics approach based on J-integral methodology to evaluate the material resistance to crack initiation (JIC) and propagation (J-resistance curve) (2). The fracture tests are carried out using SEN(T) specimens. During each test the deformation and fracture processes are recorded by a camera at different short time intervals, allowing the evaluation of the crack tip opening displacement at different extents of crack propagation. The evaluation of the corresponding J-values, determined by proper integration of load-displacement curve, allows the construction of J(CTOD) resistance curve (2). For the systems investigated the results obtained, with varying the type and content of nanofiller, are analysed and discussed. The results point out that multiwall carbon nanotubes are markedly more efficient than silica in promoting fracture resistance with particular reference to fracture initiation. Further, the comparison of the results with those obtained for other filled elastomeric systems confirms the very high toughening efficiency of carbon nanotubes. References 1. 	D. Felhös, J.

40|$|Minimizing {{adhesion}} of ice {{has been}} the subject of extensive studies for applications such aircraft wings, wind turbine blades spacecraft, power transmission wires, while a growing interest concerns coatings for aerospace applications. The work described here describes progress for coatings and ice release test method development over the last few years. Major achievements include: (1) New Rigid Adherent-Resistant Elastomers (RARE), (2) A new Epoxied Cylinder (EC) adhesion test, (3) Validation of an ice release test, and (4) Study of ice adhesion strength on coating thickness for a PDMS elastomer. Rigid Adhesion-Resistance Elastomers (RARE) are comprised of 3 F 1 terminated with triethoxysilane moieties and linear 3 F polyurethane (U- 3 F). Hybrid compositions U- 3 F-x are designated by polyurethane weight percent “x”. Interestingly, RARE coatings spontaneously “self-stratify” during coating deposition and cure. Cured RARE coatings are comprised of (1) a nanoscale surface layer with low work of adhesion, (2) a low modulus mesoscale and (3) a tough U- 3 F bulk, where “Mesoscale” is defined as a near surface region with a depth ~ 1000 nm. An EC adhesion test was developed to evaluate the fouling release characteristics of RARE. EC adhesion testing was devised by using the commercially available instrument, TA RSA- 3. The TA RSA- 3 is well suited for these tests as the 3. 5 kg load cell facilitates accurate measurements. This test gives peak force (Ps) for EC removal. A striking compositional dependence was found for EC adhesion. A U- 3 F- 50 hybrid coating had the lowest adhesion (Ps = 0. 078 MPa) with good toughness (6. 2 MPa). Bulk and surface characterization together with adhesion measurements established U- 3 F-x hybrid coatings, and U- 3 F- 50 in particular, as new fluorous rigid adherent-resistant elastomers (RARE) that are tough, <b>oil</b> <b>resistant,</b> and optically transparent. Inspired by the Epoxied Cylinder (EC) adhesion test, a laboratory method for ice adhesion measurement with a commercially available instrument was established in the Wynne Laboratory. This is the first laboratory ice adhesion test that does not require a custom built apparatus. The temperature controlled chamber on TA RSA- 3 is an enabling feature that is essential for the test. The method involves removal of an ice cylinder from a polymer coating with a probe and the determination of peak removal force (Ps). To validate the test method, the strength of ice adhesion was determined for a prototypical glassy polymer, poly(methyl methacrylate). The distance of the probe from the PMMA surface has been identified as a critical variable for Ps. The new test provides a readily available platform for investigating fundamental surface characteristics affecting ice adhesion. In addition to the ice release test, PMMA coatings were characterized using DSC, DCA and TM-AFM. This new laboratory ice release test was then employed to obtain the thickness dependence of ice adhesion for Sylgard 184, a filled polydimethylsiloxane elastomer. A correlation between ice adhesion and coating thickness (t) was found, that follows a relationship developed by Kendall over 40 years ago for removal of a rigid object from an elastomer. In particular, a nearly linear relationship between peak removal stress (Ps) and 1 /t 1 / 2 was found, with Ps decreasing from 550 kPa to 100 kPa with coating thickness increasing from 12 μm to 800 μm. While work of adhesion, which is related to surface free energy, is recognized as an important factor that can affect ice release, the results reported herein show that coating thickness can override this single parameter for elastomeric substrates. Base on the result, a general model is proposed for the removal of ice from low modulus elastomers (~ 10 MPa) ...|$|E
40|$|The direct {{catalytic}} hydrogenation of acrylonitrile-butadiene-rubber in latex form was studied {{for the development}} of a simple process for the modification of unsaturated diene-based polymers. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-rubber, known as NBR, is a rubber synthesized from acrylonitrile and butadiene (monomers) via copolymerization. It has been widely utilized as <b>oil</b> <b>resistant</b> rubber components in industry. Selective hydrogenation of the residual carbon-carbon double bonds (C=Cs) in the NBR backbone could improve its physical and chemical properties which greatly extend its range of application and lifetime. However, the current hydrogenation procedure involves a number of cumbersome steps which substantially increase the production cost. Hence, it is worthwhile developing new technology which HNBR could be synthesized in a cheaper and environmentally friendly way. Considerable efforts have been undertaken to realize this goal. Among them, hydrogenation of commercial NBR latex becomes especially attractive and promising. Direct hydrogenation of NBR in the latex not only avoids using large amounts of organic solvent which is required in polymer solution hydrogenation but also produces hydrogenated-NBR (HNBR) in the latex form which can be utilized for painting or coating. It has been reported that the commercial NBR latex could successfully be hydrogenated using RhCl(PPh 3) 3 with added triphenylphosphine (PPh 3). High quality HNBR latex was obtained after the reaction. However, the hydrophobicity of RhCl(PPh 3) 3 and PPh 3 greatly restrict their separation and diffusion in the NBR latex, resulting in a very low activity in the heterogeneous NBR latex system. In order to improve the process of NBR latex hydrogenation using the RhCl(PPh 3) 3 /PPh 3 catalytic system, an in-situ hydrogenation process was developed where RhCl(PPh 3) 3 was directly synthesized from the water-soluble catalyst precursor RhCl 3 and PPh 3 in the NBR latex. The catalyst precursor RhCl 3 is soluble in the aqueous phase of the NBR latex and PPh 3 was well dispersed in the aqueous NBR latex after adding small amounts of alcohol. Compared with using pre-made solid catalyst, the in-situ synthesized catalyst in the NBR latex could quickly be transported into the polymer particles and faster hydrogenation reaction was observed. In addition, the influence of various operational conditions on the hydrogenation rate; such as catalyst concentration, latex system composition, reaction temperature and hydrogen pressure have been studied. With the success of NBR latex hydrogenation using RhCl(PPh 3) 3 catalyst, two water-soluble analogs of RhCl(PPh 3) 3, RhCl(TPPMS) 3 (TPPMS = Monosulfonated Triphenylphosphane) and RhCl(TPPTS) 3, (TPPTS = Trisulfonated Triphenylphosphane) were then used for NBR latex hydrogenation. It was found that the difference of their solubility in water greatly affected their activities in NBR latex hydrogenation. Successful hydrogenation was achieved using the RhCl(TPPMS) 3 catalyst while only low conversion was observed when using the RhCl(TPPTS) 3 catalyst. The catalysts retention in the polymer is also in agreement with the reaction results. High conversion could only be achieved when the catalyst diffused into the polymer particles in the latex. Using the RhCl(TPPMS) 3, the reaction could be carried out in a temperature range of 70 °C to 120 °C. And no co-catalyst ligand (i. e. TPPMS) was required for catalyst diffusion or reaction. In addition, the effects of the particle size of the NBR latex and the molecular weight of NBR (gel fraction) on hydrogenation were also investigated using lab made “in-house” NBR latices. It was found that the hydrogenation reaction was much faster with smaller particle size. It was also observed that the gel fraction in the latex particles greatly influenced the mobility of the polymer chains within the particles. In addition to the rhodium based catalysts, ruthenium based catalysts have also been investigated for NBR latex hydrogenation. With the recent findings of the hydrogenation activity of the Grubbs type metathesis catalyst, the hydrogenation of NBR latex was studied first using the second generation of Grubbs catalyst (G 2). It was found using the G 2 catalyst with small addition of organic solvent such as mono-chlorobenzene (MCB) to dissolve the catalyst resulted in a successful hydrogenation in NBR latex. Meanwhile, the metathesis activity of the G 2 catalyst was also measured during the hydrogenation reaction. Comparing with conventional ruthenium catalysts, the multifunctional G 2 catalyst benefited the NBR latex hydrogenation process by controlling its molecular weight change. The increase of molecular weight within hydrogenation reaction was partially offset by a synchronous metathesis reaction between NBR and the added of chain transfer agent (CTA). As a result, no visible gel was observed in the final HNBR product. In addition, the kinetic behavior of the hydrogenation was systematically studied with respect to the catalyst concentration, hydrogen pressure as well as NBR concentration. The apparent activation energy over the temperature range of 80 - 130 °C for the hydrogenation of metathesized NBR was also measured. Further experiments showed that the second generation of Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst (HG 2) could be employed for the NBR latex hydrogenation even without adding any organic co-solvent to dissolve the catalyst. Although HG 2 catalyst is insoluble in water, it could be well dispersed in aqueous system with the addition of certain surfactants. A fast {{catalytic hydrogenation}} (e. g. TOF > 7000 h- 1 at 95 mol. % conversion) was achieved and successful hydrogenation was still observed under very low catalyst concentration. Compared with using G 2 catalyst, the degree of metathesis reaction under HG 2 in this organic solvent free process was very limited. As a result of this research project, different catalysts were successfully developed for hydrogenation of NBR in latex. A significant milestone was achieved in improving polymer hydrogenation technology. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of heating}} on some quality {{characteristics}} of date seed oil from two cultivars (Deglet Nour and Allig) {{has been investigated}} using an accelerated test in a Rancimat system. Fatty acid, viscosity, absorptivity at 232 and 270 nm, colour and total melting enthalpy of Deglet Nour seed oil were less changed {{compared to that of}} Allig seed oil, because the former contained a higher amount of total phenolic compounds (526 lg/g against 215 lg/g) and a lower content of unsaturated fatty acids. Viscosity and absorptivity at 232 nm and at 270 nm increased rapidly after reaching the oxidation induction time. Differential scanning calorimetry melting profiles of date seed oils were also changed after heating in the Rancimat. Melting enthalpies seemed to be constant during the initial stages of Rancimat treatment and then reduced after the induction time was reached. The obtained data shows that date seed <b>oils</b> were <b>resistant</b> to thermal treatment during a long period (30 – 40 h). This may indicate that they could bear thermal treatments that could be applied in refining procedures or in culinary treatments such as frying and cooking conditions. We could also expect that they may have a good shelf life. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{chemical}} compositions and antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of com-mercially available essential oils in Korea were investigated. The essential oils {{were analyzed by}} gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results demonstrated that they exhibit a broad spec-trum of antimicrobial activities against gram positive, gram negative, and multidrug resistant (MDR) strains. The antimicrobial activity of five of the essential oils against 40 organisms was assessed using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The MIC values were in the ranges of 0. 0625 - 0. 5 % (v/w) for lemongrass and manuka, 0. 03125 - 1. 0 % (v/w) for tea tree, 0. 0625 - 1. 0 % (v/w) for thyme, and 1 - 4 % (v/w) for ravensara, depending on the pathogens studied. This study revealed that, among the essen-tial oils tested, lemongrass and thyme oil showed broad antimicrobial activity against infectious bacteria. The antioxidant activities and the reducing power of the essential oils were determined with a 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Thyme oil exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity comparing with ascorbic acid. This is the first report on the chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of commercially available essential oils against infectious bacteria and MDR strains acquired from Korean hospitals.

50|$|Boron nitride aerogel is an aerogel made {{of highly}} porous boron nitride (BN). It {{typically}} {{consists of a}} mixture of deformed boron nitride nanotubes and nanosheets. It can have a density as low as 0.6 mg/cm3 and a specific surface area as high as 1050 m2/g, and therefore has potential applications as an absorbent, catalyst support and gas storage medium. BN aerogels are highly hydrophobic and can absorb up to 160 times their weight in <b>oil.</b> They are <b>resistant</b> to oxidation in air at temperatures up to 1200 °C, and hence can be reused after the absorbed oil is burned out by flame. BN aerogels can be prepared by template-assisted chemical vapor deposition at a temperature ~900 °C using borazine as the feed gas. Alternatively it can be produced by ball milling h-BN powder, ultrasonically dispersing it in water, and freeze-drying the dispersion.|$|R
