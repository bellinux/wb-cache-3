5|$|After Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return, Tennessee's offense {{started from}} its 31-yard line. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech was {{followed}} by a five-yard first-down run by Hardesty. Tennessee attempted to move its offense quickly in order to maximize the chances <b>of</b> <b>closing</b> Virginia Tech's lead by scoring fast. Crompton completed an 18-yard pass, advancing the Volunteers into Tech territory, but he was sacked by the Tech defense and Tennessee committed a five-yard false start penalty, forcing the Volunteers to punt. The kick rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense returned to the field at its 20-yard line.|$|E
5|$|However, {{no further}} tram lines were closed. In 1969, {{the site of}} the turning loop at Sinsen needed to be moved to allow the {{construction}} of the Sinsen Interchange. Instead <b>of</b> <b>closing</b> the line, Oslo Sporveier chose to build a new loop at Muselunden at Sinsen. The Ekeberg Line was scheduled to close in 1972, because a new line needed to be built to allow passage during the construction of Oslo Central Station, which would replace the Østbanen. After heavy protests from Ekeberg residents, Oslo Sporveier chose to build a loop in Vognmannsgata in the city centre.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after his arrival, Hess began exhibiting amnesia, {{which may have}} been feigned in the hope of avoiding the death sentence. Medical personnel who examined Hess reported he was not insane and was fit to stand trial. At least two examiners, the British doctor and the Soviet one, noted their belief that Hess's amnesia might be fake. Efforts were made to trigger his memory, including bringing in his former secretaries and showing old newsreels, but he persisted in showing no response to these stimuli. When Hess was allowed to make a statement to the tribunal on 30 November, he admitted that he had faked memory loss as a tactic.

40|$|Abstract. Let M be {{a compact}} Riemannian manifold. It is very Interesting {{to know how}} many closed {{geodesic}} there are in the manifold M. The manifold M is said to have the density <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics if the set <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics in M is dense. In this survey, we will give some progress in the problem related to the density <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics in two step nilmanifolds. The most results introduced in this paper are in [?], [2], [7], [1],[6] and [?]. 1. Closed Geodesics and Density <b>of</b> <b>Closed</b> Geodesics Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold. A geodesic γ(t) in M is called the closed geodesic if for some ω> 0, γ(t + ω) = γ(t), t ∈ R. A compact Riemannian manifold M is said to have the density <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics if the set <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics is dense in M. For example, consider 2 -sphere S 2. The great circles in S 2 are closed geodesics and the set <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics is equal to S 2. So, 2 -sphere S 2 has the density <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics. Another example is the 2 -torus R 2 /Z 2. Let (R 2,+) be the abelian group with the Euclidean inner product and Z 2 its integral lattice. Then, the 2 -torus R 2 /Z 2 has the density <b>of</b> <b>closed</b> geodesics. Let N be a n-dimensional Lie algebra over the real numbers R.

5|$|By the 16th century, the priory was in decline, but its closure came as {{a result}} of the {{dissolution}} of the monasteries in England and Wales under Henry VIII. To help speed the process <b>of</b> <b>closing</b> the institution, Ralf Hartley was appointed as the prior of Wetheral by Henry's minister, Thomas Cromwell; royal commissioners visited in 1536, and the priory was finally surrendered to the Crown in 1538. The priory's belongings were sold off or taken by Henry, depending on their value, but the lands were given to Carlisle Cathedral. Although the rest of the priory soon fell into disrepair, the gatehouse became the local vicarage; it was still intact and in use by the minister in 1687.|$|E
5|$|By the 1840s, the {{boarding}} school {{had grown to}} 30 students. As the enrollment expanded, the Sibleys added new rooms to the cabin. The continued improvements created a financial strain on the school and Mary Sibley traveled to the East Coast to solicit additional funding. In the early 1850s, the school {{was on the brink}} <b>of</b> <b>closing</b> when the Sibleys offered the property to the Presbyterian Church. In 1853, the school was incorporated by special act of the Missouri Legislature and became known as the Lindenwood College for Women. The newly chartered college was placed under the control of 15 directors appointed by the Presbytery of St. Louis. On July 4, 1856, the cornerstone was laid for a new permanent brick building to replace the original log cabins. The new building, Sibley Hall, was completed in July 1857, and at the time contained the entire school. This event marked {{the beginning of a new}} era of significant growth for Lindenwood.|$|E
