Jackson Pollock, a major force in the abstract expressionist movement, was also influenced by El Greco.

500|$|Almost {{blind and}} unable to {{effectively}} fire her main and secondary armament, South Dakota was illuminated by searchlights and targeted by gunfire and torpedoes {{by most of the}} ships of the Japanese force, including Kirishima, beginning around midnight on 15 November. Although able to score a few hits on Kirishima, South Dakota took 26 hits—some of which did not explode—that completely knocked out her communications and remaining gunfire control operations, set portions of her upper decks on fire, and forced her to try to steer away from the engagement. All of the Japanese torpedoes missed. Admiral Lee later described the cumulative effect of the gunfire damage to South Dakota as to, [...] "render one <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>new</b> battleships deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent." [...] South Dakotas crew casualties were 39killed and 59wounded, and she turned away from the battle at 00:17 without informing Admiral Lee, though observed by Kondo's lookouts.|$|E

2500|$|To {{those who}} are not acquainted with the botanical {{construction}} of plants it may be well to explain that plants possess generative organs, which correspond to those of the male and female in the animal kingdom. In the animal kingdom, progeny is derived from the mating of different animals of the same breed; in the vegetable kingdom the rule is that the seed is produced through the agency of the generative organs growing together on the same plant. Prior to the commencement of the work initiated by us and carried on during the past 20 years, which has led to the production <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>New</b> and Improved Breeds of agricultural plants, it was a recognised belief that many farm plants in the production of their seed were more or less cross-fertilised. The results of our experiments however have proved that such was not the case but that constant in-and-in breeding was the rule.|$|E

2500|$|Hepburn {{was noted}} for her fashion choices and {{distinctive}} look, {{to the extent}} that journalist Mark Tungate has described her as a recognisable brand. When she first rose to stardom in Roman Holiday (1953), she was seen as an alternative feminine ideal that appealed more to women than to men, in comparison to the curvy and more sexual Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor. With her short hair style, thick eyebrows, slim body and [...] "gamine" [...] looks, she presented a look which young women found easier to emulate than those of more sexual film stars. In 1954, fashion photographer Cecil Beaton declared Hepburn the [...] "public embodiment <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>new</b> feminine ideal" [...] in Vogue, and wrote that [...] "Nobody ever looked like her before World War II ... Yet we recognize the rightness of this appearance in relation to our historical needs. The proof is that thousands of imitations have appeared." [...] The magazine and its British version frequently reported on her style throughout the following decade. Alongside model Twiggy, Hepburn has been cited as one of the key public figures who made being very slim fashionable.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{mainline}} Christians {{claim that}} {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity implies that God should be called Father and not called Mother, {{in the same way that}} Jesus was a man and was not a woman. Jesus tells His followers to address God as Father. He tells his disciples to be merciful as their heavenly Father is merciful. He says the Father will give the Holy Spirit to those who ask and that the Spirit of their Father will speak through them in times of persecution. On Easter Sunday, he directs Mary Magdalene to tell the other disciples, [...] "I am going to my Father and your Father...." [...] Mark Brumley points out that behind New Testament language of Divine Adoption and regeneration is the idea that God is our Father because He is the [...] "source" [...] or [...] "origin" [...] <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>new</b> life in Christ. He has saved us through Christ and sanctified us in the Spirit. Brumley claims this is clearly more than a metaphor; the analogy with earthly fatherhood is obvious. God is not merely like a father for Christ’s followers; he is really their Father. Among Christians who hold to this idea, there is a distinct sense that Jesus' treatment of women should imply equality in leadership and marital roles every bit as strongly as the definite male gender of Jesus should imply a name of Father for God. Rather than as antifeminist, they characterize alternative naming as unnecessary and unsupported by the words found in the Bible.|$|E
2500|$|Two triumphal arches {{to welcome}} the new viceroy were commissioned. One was {{designed}} by seventeenth-century savant and professor at the University of Mexico Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora and the other by nun and acclaimed poet, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. Their selection for this high honor was important for both, since they were of somewhat marginal status, Sigüenza as a failed Jesuit, Sor Juana as a woman of illegitimate birth. Sigüenza was a creole patriot, [...] "who sought to endow the imperial city of Mexico with both a distinguished past and a glorious present," [...] He published {{an explanation of the}} themes of his triumphal arch for the new viceroy, [...] "The Political Virtues That Constitute a Ruler, Observed in the Ancient Monarchs of the Mexican Empire, Whose Effigies Adorn the Arch Erected by the Very Noble Imperial City of Mexico". [...] The structure included niches for the Aztec monarchs of Mexico along with the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli to indicate to the viceroy that Mexico had a royal history prior to its becoming New Spain. Sor Juana's arch took the allegorical theme of Neptune. The title of her explanatory publication was [...] "Allegorical Neptune, Ocean of Colors, Political Simulacrum, Erected by the Noble, Holy, and August Metropolitan Church of Mexico City, in the Magnificent Allegorical Concepts of a Triumphal Arch Solicitously Consecrated and Lovingly Dedicated to the Joyful Entrance of the Most Excellent Don Tomás Antonio de la Cerda, Count of Paredes, Marquis de la Laguna, Viceroy, Governor, and Captain General <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>New</b> Spain". [...] Choosing the theme of [...] "allegorical Neptune" [...] might be her allusion to the viceroy's noble title Marquis de la Laguna (marquis of the lake) and [...] "the arch was a model of the virtues of kings and princes such as Neptune and the Viceroy."The viceroy became a patron of Sor Juana, continuing the practice dating from the viceroy, the Marquis of Mancera.|$|E
