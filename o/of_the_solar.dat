5|$|The {{principal}} component <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% {{of the remaining}} mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together comprise less than 0.002% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System's total mass.|$|E

5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the outer planets, the inner planets are not thought to have migrated significantly over the age <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, because their orbits have remained stable following the period of giant impacts.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the major}} bodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane. This is likely due {{to the way in}} which the Solar System formed from a protoplanetary disk. Probably the closest current {{representation}} of the disk is known as the invariable plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System. Earth's orbit, and hence, the ecliptic, is inclined a little more than 1° to the invariable plane, and the other major planets are also within about 6° of it. Because of this, most Solar System bodies appear very close to the ecliptic in the sky. The ecliptic is well defined by the motion of the Sun. The invariable plane is defined by the angular momentum of the entire Solar System, essentially the summation of all of the orbital motions and rotations of all the bodies of the system, a somewhat uncertain value that requires precise knowledge of every object in the system. For these reasons, the ecliptic is used as the reference plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System out of convenience.|$|E

5|$|The Sun is {{the star}} at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with {{internal}} convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.

Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, i.e. 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System: the clustering of {{the orbits of}} extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to the plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System. While other mechanisms have been offered {{for many of these}} peculiarities the gravitational influence of Planet Nine {{is the only one that}} explains all five. The dynamical effects of Planet Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E

This was demonstrated by irradiating polycrystalline and single-crystal (Czochralski) silicon solar cells with 1 MeV electrons to reduce their bulk lifetime. <b>The</b> variation <b>of</b> short-circuit current with minority-carrier diffusion length for <b>the</b> polycrystalline <b>solar</b> cells is identical to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single-crystal <b>solar</b> cells. <b>The</b> {{open-circuit voltage}} versus short-circuit current characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polycrystalline <b>solar</b> cells for reduced diffusion lengths is also identical to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single-crystal <b>solar</b> cells. <b>The</b> open-circuit voltage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polycrystalline <b>solar</b> cells is a strong function of quasi-neutral (bulk) recombination, and is reduced only slightly, if at all, by grain-boundary recombination...|$|R
