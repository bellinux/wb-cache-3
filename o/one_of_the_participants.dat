25|$|Ecological {{facilitation}} or probiosis describes species {{interactions that}} benefit at least <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>participants</b> and cause harm to neither. Facilitations {{can be categorized}} as mutualisms, in which both species benefit, or commensalisms, in which one species benefits {{and the other is}} unaffected. Much of classic ecological theory (e.g., natural selection, niche separation, metapopulation dynamics) has focused on negative interactions such as predation and competition, but positive interactions (facilitation) are receiving increasing focus in ecological research. This article addresses both the mechanisms of facilitation and the increasing information available concerning the impacts of facilitation on community ecology.|$|E
