5|$|All {{the medieval}} {{buildings}} {{that are now}} cathedrals of England were Roman Catholic in origin, as they predate the Reformation. All these buildings now serve the Church of England as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> to the official religion of the country, which occurred in 1534 {{during the reign of}} Henry VIII.|$|E

5|$|In early 2016, the a {{la carte}} menu was stopped and the {{restaurant}} moved to serving only set menus. This was attributed to a desire to reduce the food waste produced by the restaurant, which staff hoped that could drop by half as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b> The children's menu consists of smaller portions of the main menu.|$|E

5000|$|Some could {{interpret}} <b>the</b> portrayal <b>of</b> Martin Luther {{returning to}} Wittenberg, which occurred in early 1522, as his approving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radical <b>changes</b> instigated by Andreas Karlstadt the year before. However, historically, Luther opposed some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> {{as well as}} <b>the</b> rashness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> he did approve <b>of.</b> <b>The</b> movie makes <b>the</b> out-break <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radical <b>changes</b> <b>the</b> instigation <b>of</b> his return thus implying, probably rightly, the need he felt to moderate them. He preached his [...] "Invocavit Sermons" [...] against this radical reform in Wittenberg, and he had some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> rolled back.|$|R

5|$|The {{ability of}} animals {{including}} fish, lizards and frogs {{to change their}} colours quickly is discussed. The changing of the pelage of arctic animals is attributed to the indirect effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in temperature, i.e. a physiological response not a simple physical effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{transfer}} of {{the headquarters of the}} Company's power to Bombay largely eliminated the need for a Deputy Governor.

5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish was too small and the ground station's geographical position was out of range. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E
5|$|As Allied {{intelligence}} {{regarding the}} Japanese was still uncertain, Ramsay, who officially assumed {{command of the}} forces on New Britain on 27 November, adopted a cautious approach. Jacquinot Bay was built up as a base of operations and the Australians began sending out patrols to fight for information and harass the Japanese, with limited advances taking place on both {{the northern and southern}} coasts of the island, pushing east towards the Japanese strong hold around the Gazelle Peninsula. The AIB also continued to operate in the area, passing information to the 5th Division. The Japanese lacked information on the movements of Allied forces in New Britain, and only learned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in command from Australian radio broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in maintenance, NY360 {{became part of}} four {{unsigned}} county routes. On Morton Road, NY360 was co-designated as County Route279 (CR279). The portion on Redman Road was part of CR236, which extends from NY31 west of Brockport to Cook Road near the Lake Ontario State Parkway. The section of NY360 on Church Road overlapped with CR277. Finally, the part of NY360 on Lake Road West Fork was concurrent with CR234, which extends north past NY360 to Moscow Road (CR211). All four overlaps were eliminated when the NY360 designation was officially removed in February 2012, and the NY 360 shields were removed by June of that year.|$|E

5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in medium from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in {{designated}} values {{relative to}} the WHERE clause, from a logic perspective the law of excluded middle is a tautology for CHECK constraints, meaning CHECK (p OR NOT p) always succeeds. Furthermore, assuming Nulls are to be interpreted as existing but unknown values, some pathological CHECKs like the one above allow insertion of Nulls that could never be replaced by any non-null value.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are {{set by the}} sun and they have traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b> Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E

In the lead up to the 2007 federal election, Great Southern made A$40,000 of donations to the Labor opposition, including A$10,000 two days after the release of the party's primary industries policy. After Labor won the election, Great Southern's managing director John Young spoke positively <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in government and of Labor's willingness to review policy toward managed investment schemes.|$|E
5|$|In , the Dodgers {{moved from}} the Los Angeles Coliseum, which had a 250-foot left field line, to pitcher-friendly Dodger Stadium. The new park had a large foul {{territory}} and a comparatively poor hitting background. Koufax was an immediate beneficiary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change,</b> lowering his home ERA from 4.29 to 1.75. On June 30 against the expansion New York Mets, Koufax threw his first no-hitter. In the first inning of that game, Koufax struck out three batters on nine pitches to become the sixth National League pitcher and the 11th pitcher in Major League history to accomplish a nine-pitch/three-strikeout half-inning. With the no-hitter, a 4-2 record, 73 strikeouts, and a 1.23 ERA for June, he was named Major League Baseball Player of the Month Award. It {{would be the only}} time in his career he earned this distinction.|$|E
5|$|NY414 was {{truncated}} on January1, 1949, {{to begin}} in downtown Corning. Its former routing from Caton to Corning was redesignated as NY225 as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b> On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of CR120 east of NY225 in Caton was transferred from Steuben County {{to the state of}} New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. All of CR7 in Chemung County was also transferred to the state sometime after 1978. The Caton–Big Flats roadway, now state-maintained along its entire length, became an eastward extension of NY225 by 1986.|$|E

When he went to seek Kerr's approval of the election, Kerr instead dismissed him as Prime Minister and shortly thereafter installed Fraser in his place. Acting quickly before all ALP parliamentarians became aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> of government, Fraser and his allies were able to secure passage of the appropriation bills, and Kerr dissolved Parliament for a double dissolution election. Fraser and his government were returned with a massive majority in the election held the following month.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} action began, Persano {{decided to leave}} Re d'Italia and {{transfer}} to Affondatore, though none of his subordinates on the other ships were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change.</b> They were thus left to fight as individuals without direction. More dangerously, by stopping Re d'Italia, he allowed a significant gap to open up between Vacca's three ships {{and the rest of}} the fleet. Tegetthoff took his fleet through the gap between Vacca's and Persano's ships, though he failed to ram any Italian vessels on the first pass. The Austrians then turned back toward Persano's ships, and took Re d'Italia, San Martino, and Palestro under heavy fire. The Austrian ships concentrated their fire on Re d'Italia, paying particular attention to her stern. In their attempts to ram her, one of the Austrian ships destroyed Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her unmaneuverable.|$|E

Accordingly, he decided to change the plans for the operation, with all of the bombers now flying to Yagodnik first and mounting the attack from that airfield. Harris ordered the attack force to depart that afternoon, before advising the Air Ministry or Soviets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>change</b> in plans.|$|E
