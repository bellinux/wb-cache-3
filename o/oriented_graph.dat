Most of the work on this subject has been done for unoriented <b>graphs</b> and <b>oriented</b> acyclic <b>graphs</b> (no directed cycles). In this work we discuss <b>oriented</b> <b>graphs</b> D containing directed cycles by using oriented book embeddings and oriented book thickness, obt(D).

Determining M^k for general k is challenging; we narrow {{down the list of}} <b>oriented</b> <b>graphs</b> in M^k for small k.

40|$|AbstractA digraph {{of order}} at least k is termed k-traceable if {{each of its}} subdigraphs of order k is traceable. It turns out that several {{properties}} of tournaments—i. e., the 2 -traceable oriented graphs—extend to k-traceable <b>oriented</b> <b>graphs</b> for small values of k. For instance, the authors together with O.  Oellermann have recently shown that for k= 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, all k-traceable <b>oriented</b> <b>graphs</b> are traceable. Moon [J. W. Moon, On subtournaments of a tournament, Canad.  Math.  Bull.   9 (3) (1966) 297 – 301] observed that every nontrivial strong tournament T is vertex-pancyclic—i. e., through each vertex there is a cycle of every length from 3 up {{to the order of}} T. The present paper reports results pertaining to various cycle properties of strong k-traceable <b>oriented</b> <b>graphs</b> and explores the extent to which pancyclicity is retained by strong k-traceable <b>oriented</b> <b>graphs.</b> For each k≥ 2 there are infinitely many k-traceable oriented graphs—e. g.  tournaments. However, we establish an upper bound (linear in k) on the order of k-traceable <b>oriented</b> <b>graphs</b> having a strong component with girth greater than 3. As an application of our findings, we show that the Path Partition Conjecture holds for 1 -deficient <b>oriented</b> <b>graphs</b> having a strong component with girth at least 6. (A digraph is 1 -deficient if its order is exactly one more than the order of its longest paths. ...|$|R

A complete directed graph can be converted to an <b>oriented</b> <b>graph</b> by removing every 2-cycle, and conversely an <b>oriented</b> <b>graph</b> can be converted to a complete directed graph by adding a 2-cycle between every pair of vertices that are not endpoints of an edge; these correspondences are bijective.

50|$|A valid {{schedule}} for the disjunctive graph may be obtained by finding an acyclic orientation of the undirected edges - that is, deciding for each pair of non-simultaneous tasks {{which is to be}} first, without introducing any circular dependencies - and then ordering the resulting directed acyclic graph. In particular, suppose that all tasks have equal length and the goal is to find a schedule that minimizes the makespan, the total time until all tasks have been completed. In this case, the makespan can be computed from the longest path in the <b>oriented</b> <b>graph,</b> which can be found in polynomial time for directed acyclic graphs. However, the orientation stage of the solution is much more difficult: it is NP-hard to find the acyclic orientation that minimizes the length of the longest path. In particular, by the Gallai-Hasse-Roy-Vitaver theorem, if all edges are initially undirected, then orienting them to minimize the longest path is equivalent to finding an optimal graph coloring of the initial undirected graph.|$|E
