25|$|The {{platform}} of social media is another channel or site that business' and brands must seek {{to influence the}} content of. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled {{all aspects of the}} ad, with social media, users are free to post comments right below an <b>online</b> <b>ad</b> or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social media strategy as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is about finding a balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There is a lot more attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain brand recognition. Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. “That social {{networks}} {{are hard to}} penetrate ” is an often given reason for recent corporate investment decreases in this technology. The cause is the traditional mass market perspective: firms use {{social networks}} to connect with, and eavesdrop on, customers. The result: <b>online</b> <b>ads</b> weakly aligned to customer conversations. One alternative: adopt a Language–Action Perspective; identify the market created by a conversation in a social network. The result: <b>online</b> <b>ads</b> strongly aligned to that conversation. One measure of this alignment is the mental distance between the intent of a social network conversation and {{the intent of the}} <b>online</b> <b>ads</b> that surround it. This paper will: explore the nature of “intention” in social networks, introduce its elements, show how these elements can create data and software architecture, and show how to create better <b>online</b> <b>ads...</b>|$|R

Li Hai Ning (Sonia Sui) is a 32-year-old {{editor-in-chief}} of a publishing company that is struggling to find a bestseller. Fang Cheng Hao (Jerry Huang), Hai Ning’s boyfriend of nine years, is the only author doing well in her company but even his book sales have begun to stagnate.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of ad blocking software provides consumers with a mechanical means to avoid advertisements on the Internet. Growing usage rates of ad blockers {{around the world}} put online marketers under increasing pressure. This master dissertation aims to identify key antecedents of online advertising avoidance and, in particular, of ad blocking. Based on findings of previous research (e. g. Baek and Morimoto, 2012; Cho and Cheon, 2004; Edwards, Li and Lee, 2002; Kelly, 2014; Li, Edwards and Lee, 2002; Seyedghorban, Tahernejad and Matanda, 2016; Walsh, 2010), a conceptualised model of online advertising avoidance is developed. The model is studied with survey data from 140 respondents. Multicollinearity in the multiple regression models and constraints in using a more advanced data analysis method hindered {{an assessment of the}} overall model. Instead, simple regression analyses were used to investigate the independent impact of each variable separately. Results suggest that Internet consumers will use an ad blocker if they feel disrupted or distracted by <b>online</b> <b>ads,</b> were not able to perceive any benefits or incentive when they previously clicked on <b>online</b> <b>ads,</b> are sceptical towards <b>online</b> <b>ad’s</b> claims, perceive <b>online</b> <b>ads</b> as intrusive, have privacy concerns, or a general negative attitude towards <b>online</b> <b>ads.</b> Gender was identified as the most important predictor of ad blocking. In addition, it was found that targeted <b>online</b> <b>ads</b> are less avoided than non-targeted ones and that user mode has an impact on how Internet consumers respond to <b>online</b> <b>ads.</b> <b>Online</b> marketers should refrain from using intrusive ad formats and instead aim to provide Internet consumers with useful information through better targeted ads. In addition, they should seek a dialogue with ad blocker users to make them aware of the negative impact of ad blocking. Further research should replicate the present study and use a more advanced data analysis method such as “Structural Equation Modelling” to test the proposed model as a whole...|$|R

40|$|Approach and {{avoidance}} {{are two major}} types of behavioral responses when consumers encounter interferences caused by online advertising. This paper argues that approach-avoidance {{is not the only}} dimension from which researchers can examine behavioral responses toward online advertising. The inclusion of the active-passive behaviors dimension enriches the understanding of consumers’ coping strategies. Active and passive behaviors differ from each other by the intensity of coping efforts. Active behavioral responses imply that consumers act upon <b>online</b> <b>ads</b> and make efforts to approach or avoid them. Passive behavioral responses indicate that consumers make little efforts to change the current status, and would rather approach or avoid in a passive way. Data was collected through an online survey by asking participants to recall their experiences with <b>online</b> <b>ads</b> and their behavioral responses. We found that the effects of ad design characteristics (content, form, and behavior) on consumers’ behavioral responses differ across two-dimensions: Approach-Avoidance and Active-Passive. In addition, these effects also vary when consumers have different views (negative vs. positive) of the <b>online</b> <b>ads.</b> The contribution of this study lies in suggesting the two-dimensional view of studying consumers’ responses toward <b>online</b> <b>ads</b> and in deepening our understanding of consumer behavior in dealing with digital artefacts in general...|$|R
