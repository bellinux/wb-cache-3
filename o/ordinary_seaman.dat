The ship was part of Convoy PQ-17, carrying matériel from Britain and the US to the USSR. PQ-17 sailed in June–July 1942 and suffered the heaviest losses of any Russia-bound convoy, with 25 vessels out of 36 lost to enemy action. On D-Day, he was a sub-lieutenant commanding an Mk IV Landing Craft Tank 1013 with LCT 1018 of the 43rd LCT flotilla, which carried several hundred tons of ammunition to Sword Beach, Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{midshipman}} originated {{during the}} Tudor and Stuart eras, and originally {{referred to a}} post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the main and mizzen masts and had more responsibility than an <b>ordinary</b> <b>seaman,</b> but was not a military officer or an officer in training. The first published {{use of the term}} midshipman was in 1662. The word derives from an area aboard a ship, amidships, but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship, or the location where midshipmen were berthed.|$|E

25|$|A {{helmsman}} or helm is {{a person}} who steers a ship, sailboat, submarine, other type of maritime vessel, or spacecraft. On small vessels, particularly privately owned noncommercial vessels, the functions of skipper and helmsman may be combined in one person. On larger vessels, there is a separate officer of the watch, who is responsible for the safe navigation of the ship and gives orders to the helmsman. In the merchant marine, the person at the helm is usually an able seaman, particularly during ship arrivals, departures, and while maneuvering in restricted waters or other conditions requiring precise steering. An <b>ordinary</b> <b>seaman</b> is commonly restricted to steering in open waters. Moreover, military ships may have a seaman or quartermaster at the helm.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary seamen {{received}} {{a part of}} the plunder at the captain's discretion but usually a single share. On average, a pirate could expect the equivalent of a year's wages as his share from each ship captured while the crew of the most successful pirates would often each receive a share valued at around £1,000 ($1.17million) at least once in their career. One of the larger amounts taken from a single ship was that by captain Thomas Tew from an Indian merchantman in 1692. Each <b>ordinary</b> <b>seaman</b> on his ship {{received a}} share worth £3,000 ($3.5million) with officers receiving proportionally larger amounts as per the agreed shares with Tew himself receiving 2½ shares. It is known there were actions with multiple ships captured where a single share was worth almost double this.|$|E
25|$|Five {{more bodies}} were {{recovered}} on February 20, and <b>Ordinary</b> <b>Seaman</b> Frank Fisher died that {{day of his}} wounds. Several more bodies were recovered on February 21.

Two more of the wounded died that day as well. Another 12 bodies were recovered from near the engine rooms on February 22, all of them dismembered and badly disfigured. Work to free the bodies below the forward hatch continued on February 22, and was largely successful the following day. All but one was brought to the surface, and that body was too tightly caught in the wreckage to free. Another body rose of its own accord to the surface, and divers reported seeing several bodies trapped in twisted metal or in places where divers could not reach.|$|E

500|$|Details of Joyce's {{early life}} are sketchy.

[...] Joyce's father and grandfather had both been sailors, his father probably within the coastguard service. After the father's early death his widow, with three children to support on her limited earnings as a seamstress, sent the young Ernest to the Lower School of Greenwich Royal Hospital School for Navy Orphans at Greenwich.

In February 1900, Crean was posted to the torpedo vessel Ringarooma, {{which was part of}} the Royal Navy's New Zealand Squadron based in the South Island. On 18 December 1901, he was demoted from petty officer to able seaman for an unspecified misdemeanour. In December 1901, the Ringarooma was ordered to assist Robert Falcon Scott's ship Discovery when it was docked at Lyttelton Harbour awaiting to departure to Antarctica. When an able seaman of Scott's ship deserted after striking a petty officer, a replacement was required; Crean volunteered, and was accepted.|$|E
500|$|Morrell {{was born}} at Rye, in Westchester County, New York, on July 5, 1795. He grew up in Stonington, Connecticut, where his father, also named Benjamin, was {{employed}} as a shipbuilder. Morrell, after minimal schooling, ran away to sea {{at the age of}} 17 [...] "without taking leave of any member of my family, or intimating my purpose to a single soul". During the War of 1812, which broke out while he was at sea, he was twice captured by the British; on his first voyage his ship, carrying a cargo of flour, was intercepted off St John's, Newfoundland, and Morrell was detained for eight months. His second voyage landed him in Dartmoor prison, England, for two years. After his release Morrell continued his seafaring career, sailing before the mast as an <b>ordinary</b> <b>seaman</b> since his lack of education prevented him advancing to officer rank. A sympathetic captain, Josiah Macy, taught him what he needed to know to qualify as an officer, [...] and in 1821 he was appointed chief mate on the sealer Wasp, under Captain Robert Johnson.|$|E

In 1942, during World War II, he took a leave of absence from the UAHC to volunteer for the armed forces as a U.S. Navy chaplain. From 1943 to 1945 he served with the United States Eighth Fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, [...] "the first Jewish chaplain {{in the history of the}} Navy to serve with a combat fleet", and earned a Combat Star for his participation in Operation Shingle.

500|$|Whilst escorting Convoy SC 94 {{in early}} August 1942 {{as part of}} Escort Group C1, Assiniboines Type 286 radar spotted [...] in a heavy fog on 6 August. The {{destroyer}} closed on the contact and briefly spotted the submarine twice before losing her in the fog.

This kept the Germans from manning their [...] deck gun, but the [...] flak gun was already manned and firing. The gun punched holes through the destroyer's plating that set some petrol tanks on the deck afire and disabled 'A' gun. It also claimed the only Canadian casualty during the engagement: <b>Ordinary</b> <b>Seaman</b> Kenneth [...] "Wiley" [...] Watson from Revelestoke, British Columbia. The destroyer was unable to ram U-210 until the rear 4.7-inch gun hit the conning tower, killing the entire bridge crew and the [...]50-caliber machine guns were able to silence the flak gun. This caused Lieutenant Sorber, the senior surviving officer, to order the submarine to dive, but this meant {{that she had to}} hold a straight course while doing so. Assiniboine was {{able to take advantage of}} this and rammed U-210 abaft the conning tower whilst she was diving. This caused the electric motors to fail, damaged her propellers and led to water entering the submarine, as a result of which Sorber ordered the ballast tanks to be blown and the submarine abandoned. The destroyer rammed her again when U-210 resurfaced, dropped a pattern of depth charges set to detonate at shallow depth and hit her one more time with a 4.7-inch shell before the submarine finally sank. A number of survivors were rescued by Assiniboine and the British corvette , before the former ship had to head home for repairs as she was taking on water below the waterline. She required nearly two months of repairs at Halifax and was assigned to Escort Group C3 when they were completed on 20 December.|$|E
