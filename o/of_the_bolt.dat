25|$|The {{second type}} of bolted joint {{transfers}} the applied load in shear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> shank and relies on the shear strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b> Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like lock washers, thread adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the characteristics and structural properties of bolted connections in steel structures with the main focus on the design adequacy and failure mechanisms of high-strength friction-grip (HSFG) bolted connections.  As a case study, <b>the</b> <b>bolted</b> connections on <b>the</b> Mary River Bridge along Arnhem Highway in the Northern Territory have been investigated. The composite highway bridge is composed of reinforced concrete deck over five simply supported spans <b>of</b> structural steelwork. <b>The</b> structural steelwork includes five main UB girders connected to diaphragms and horizontal bracings by HSFG bolted connections. Initial inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge found {{that a number of}} bolts were loosened, missing or had already fractured and most were heavily corroded. Remedial works in which <b>the</b> original <b>bolted</b> connections have been replaced and the new ones ensured to be installed at the correct tension have been recently completed.  The structural and environmental factors that may have contributed to <b>the</b> eventual failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> have been investigated. <b>The</b> design adequacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolted</b> connections compared to the externally applied loads on the bridge superstructure was checked in accordance with current standards: AS 5100 and AS 4100. <b>The</b> failure mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fractured <b>bolts</b> were investigated. <b>The</b> residual loads on <b>the</b> original <b>bolts</b> have been identified through slip testing on both <b>the</b> original <b>bolts</b> and new HSFG bolts in double shear configuration. <b>The</b> fractured <b>bolts</b> were analysed through optical and scanned electron microscopy. The design fatigue life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> were identified through fatigue testing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> M 16 <b>bolts</b> in double shear configuration and <b>the</b> M 22 <b>bolts</b> subjected to cyclic tensile load. <b>The</b> difference <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> corrosion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> with and without the zinc plate corrosion protection was also identified.  It was found that the main factors the contributed to <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolted</b> connections at <b>the</b> Mary River Bridge include overstressing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolts,</b> <b>the</b> fluctuating loads, the eventual abrasion and wear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corrosive protection and the corrosive environment it was subjected to. <b>The</b> failure mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fractured <b>bolts</b> were mainly due to corrosion and fretting fatigue.

25|$|The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated {{mechanism}} normally {{found in}} rifles, {{as opposed to}} the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The slide which acts as the bolt carrier has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder. When the gases reach the cylinder they push the piston rearward. The slide rides rearward on two rails {{on either side of the}} barrel, both with action springs around them, with a large pin inside the camming surface in the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> that causes the bolt to rotate and unlock. A cylindrical mechanism on the left side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt,</b> called the bolt stabilizer assembly, prevents the bolt from rotating freely as the slide moves, enabling it to align correctly with the barrel again as the slide moves it forward. The spring loaded ejector pin is continually being depressed by the case, until the case is free of the chamber and releases tension from the ejector, causing the case to fly out, becoming released from the extractor claw in the process. The slide reaches its rear-most travel, then rides forward again under tension of the springs around the slide rails, the bottom lug <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> pushes a new round into the chamber, then the bolt locks up and the gun can be fired again once the trigger is released.|$|E

25|$|When a {{fastener}} is torqued, a tension preload develops in the bolt and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly {{that has some}} assumed distribution of compressive strain in the clamped joint components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than through the bolt. In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder through the bolt. This reduces the fatigue loading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} to apply pull-and-shear loads to <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> specimen in order to evaluate <b>the</b> anchorage performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebar <b>bolt</b> and <b>the</b> D-Bolt. In the tests, five displacing angles (0 °, 20 °, 40 °, 60 °, and 90 °), two joint gaps (0  mm and 30  mm), and three kinds of host rock materials (weak concrete, strong concrete, and concrete-granite) were considered, and stress–strain measurements were conducted. Results show that <b>the</b> ultimate loads <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> D-Bolt and <b>the</b> rebar <b>bolt</b> remained constant with any displacing angles. <b>The</b> ultimate displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D-Bolt changed from 140  mm at the 0 ° displacing angle (pure pull) to approximately 70  mm at a displacing angle greater than 40 °. <b>The</b> displacement capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D-Bolt is approximately 3. 5 times that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebar <b>bolt</b> under pure pull and 50 % higher than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebar <b>bolt</b> under pure shear. The compressive stress exists at 50  mm from <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> head, and <b>the</b> maximum bending moment value rises with the increasing displacing angle. <b>The</b> rebar <b>bolt</b> mobilises greater applied load than the D-Bolt when subjected to the maximum bending. The yielding length (at 0 °) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D-Bolt is longer than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rebar <b>bolt.</b> <b>The</b> displacement capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolts</b> increased with <b>the</b> joint gap. <b>The</b> <b>bolt</b> subjected to joint gap effect yields more quickly with greater bending moment and smaller applied load. <b>The</b> displacement capacities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> D-Bolt and <b>the</b> rebar <b>bolt</b> are greater in the weak host rock than that in the hard host rock.

25|$|The {{addition}} of a bolt accelerator to the Lahti pistol was to ensure {{the performance of the}} pistol in arctic conditions in Finland. Bolt accelerators are more commonly found in machine guns to increase the rate of fire. The bolt accelerator in the Lahti works by having a crank lever strike the bolt of the pistol as it unlocks from firing. This thrusts the bolt mechanically instead of relying on the momentum of firing alone to move the bolt back. The value of the addition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> accelerator was put into question with a batch of guns made without an accelerator being produced. The immediate recall of the pistols without bolt accelerators is thought to indicate the accelerator is not essential but useful in the operation of the gun.|$|E
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of the}} design was {{that it did not}} use a traditional helical coiled recoil spring, but used a spiral spring, much like a large clock spring, in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The operating rod had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the operating rod forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun recoil spring had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|A {{lockbolt}} is {{a fastener}} {{similar to a}} bolt in appearance and function. However, instead of using screw threads which connect to a nut using a turning motion, a lockbolt has annular grooves around the shaft <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> (pin). After placing the lockbolt in a hole, a threadless collar is forced at high pressures around the annular grooves, deforming the collar and permanently locking it into place around the grooves. Swaging is the generic term for setting a lockbolt and collar assembly. During the installation cycle of a lockbolt, the collar is deformed around the pin with locking grooves using special tooling. The tool engages onto the pintail, which is an extra portion of pin material protruding past the collar that the tool grabs and pulls. This force on the pintail pushes the joint together, and the conically-shaped cavity of the tooling is forced down the collar, which reduces its diameter and progressively swages the collar material into the grooves of the harder pin. As the force required for swaging increases during the process, the installation is finalised when the pintail breaks off.|$|E

25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the nut or bolt head use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt head or nut (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|E
2500|$|Typically, a bolt is {{tensioned}} (preloaded) by {{the application}} of a torque to either the bolt head or the nut. The applied torque causes the bolt to [...] "climb" [...] the thread causing a tensioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to the applied torque and is a function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut. The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.|$|E
2500|$|Bolt preload {{can also}} be {{controlled}} by torquing the bolt {{to the point of}} yielding. Under some circumstances, a skilled operator can feel the drop off of the work required to turn the torque wrench as the material <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> begins to yield. At that point the bolt has a preload determined by the bolt area and the [...] yield strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bolt</b> material. This technique can be more accurately executed by specially built machines. Because this method only works for very high preloads and requires comparatively expensive tooling, it is only commonly used for specific applications, primarily in high performance engines.|$|E
