During the development programme, launch sites in Barbados, Uist and Norfolk were also considered. The launch sites at Uist and Norfolk were rejected because the former was too remote, while there was a risk that a rocket launched from the latter might drop spent stages on an <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> in the North Sea.|$|E

Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains {{to him that the}} satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
5|$|Bond goes to San Francisco {{where he}} learns from CIA agent Chuck Lee that Zorin {{could be the}} product of medical {{experimentation}} with steroids performed by a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin's physician, Dr. Carl Mortner. Bond then investigates a nearby <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> owned by Zorin and while there finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording Zorin's conversation. Ivanova's partner Klolktoff is captured and killed while trying to place limpet mines on the rig, but Ivanova and Bond escape. They go to her place where Bond is able to steal the recording. Bond tracks down the woman that Zorin attempted to pay off, State Geologist Stacey Sutton, and discovers that Zorin is trying to purchase her family's oil business.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, several {{ships were}} {{caught off guard}} by the late arrival of Jeanne. The cyclone entered the Gulf of Mexico, and two barges broke loose from towing vessels via strong winds and high waves. One barge was an <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> tender that {{contained}} 16people; it was carried several hundred miles across the central Gulf of Mexico. All crew members survived, {{and there were no}} maritime deaths related to the hurricane. Jeanne produced a prolonged period of rough surf and heavy swells along the Texas coast. Tides reached 2 to 4feet (1.20m) above normal. The hurricane caused coastal flooding; the worst flooding occurred near Galveston.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began on}} 5 April 1971, with the South African scenes {{actually}} {{shot in the}} desert near Las Vegas, and finished on 13 August 1971. The film was shot primarily in the US, with locations including the Los Angeles International Airport, Universal City Studios and eight hotels of Las Vegas. Besides the Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, other places in England were Dover and Southampton. The climactic <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> sequence was shot off the shore of Oceanside, California. Other filming locations included Cap D'Antibes in France for the opening scenes, Amsterdam and Lufthansa's hangar at Frankfurt Airport, Germany.|$|E
5|$|The treaty only allows {{taxation}} to {{the extent}} that it covers the cost of administrating the archipelago and covering the services provided to the residents. The tax rate is therefore significantly lower than in Metropolitan Norway, including the absence of value added tax. The government summarizes its expenses on Svalbard in the Svalbard Budget. The taxation rules made Svalbard a tax paradise, and in 2009 the <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> operator Seadrill established a subsidiary in Longyearbyen to exploit the lower taxes. In 2011, the tax rate for profits exceeding NOK10 million were raised from 16 to 28 percent—the same as on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Nate caused {{minor damage}} in southeastern Mexico in mid-September2011. The sixteenth named storm and fourth {{hurricane}} of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Nate originated from a frontal trough in the Bay of Campeche on September7. Within a weak steering environment, the storm meandered southwestward while gradually gaining strength. Though {{classified as a}} tropical storm operationally, data during a post-season review indicated that Nate briefly attained Category 1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on September8. As {{a result of its}} slow motion, the storm caused significant upwelling, leading to a marked decrease in convection, and weakening accordingly. On September11, Nate moved ashore Mexico as a tropical storm, producing several inches of rainfall and damaging several hundred structures. Ten <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> workers went missing; seven were rescued, but one died of an unknown cause, and three other bodies were later recovered. In Veracruz, a boy was killed after being struck by lightning.|$|E

5|$|Man of Steel {{filmed in}} the Chicago area, California and Burnaby's Mammoth Studios was {{transformed}} into Superman's home planet of Krypton and myriad extraterrestrial aircraft. Metro lands on Vancouver's North Shore waterfront hosted the shoot for the dramatic <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> rescue that introduces audiences to Superman. Ucluelet and Nanaimo, British Columbia, feature prominently in the film’s first hour—the trademark winter mist and rough seas are passed off as Alaska in the film. Filming {{took place in the}} Chicago Loop from September 7 to 17. Vancouver production took place from September 21, 2011, to January 20, 2012 to celebrate the 60th birthday anniversary of the late Christopher Reeve who was the first actor who played Superman in films. The Chicago shoot was a unit project, meaning that filming could partake numerous establishing shots as well as cutaways and may not necessarily include principal cast members.|$|E
5|$|On September20, {{roughly one}} day prior to Igor's arrival in Atlantic Canada, the Canadian Hurricane Center (CHC) issued {{tropical}} storm watches and warnings for southern Newfoundland and the French territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. The following day the CHC issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} eastern and northern coasts. Although sustained hurricane-force winds were recorded across parts of the island, warnings were not issued due to stronger-than-expected re-intensification of the storm as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Early on September22, all advisories were discontinued as Igor {{moved away from the}} region. In response to the storm's arrival, schools were closed and several flights were delayed or canceled at St. John's International Airport. Offshore, an <b>oil</b> <b>rig</b> with 110 personnel was mostly evacuated near the coast of Newfoundland on September19. In comparison to Hurricane Earl two weeks earlier, there was substantially less media attention given to Igor, attributed to the possibility of it going out to sea.|$|E
