5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>students,</b> she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E

25|$|As is {{customary}} at German universities, {{students are}} generally required {{to arrange for}} their own housing. There are a few low-rate student dorms in the town, however {{a large majority of}} students share private flats with a couple <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>students</b> (German: Wohngemeinschaft, abbreviated WG), or live in single apartments. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult for newly matriculated students to find appropriate flats in Greifswald, which is due to a growing number of students and a stagnating market. As landlords often prefer their prospective tenants to be fluent in German, this may cause disadvantages for international students wishing to rent their own place. However, the university usually arranges dorm rooms for international students.|$|E

The mothers initially had their AKA memberships revoked for supporting their daughters in the litigation process against the sorority, months later a judge reinstated their memberships citing that it was illegal for AKA to revoke their paid memberships for simply filing a lawsuit against their own sorority.

"After {{stating the}} {{constitutional}} reasons against a public establishment of any religious instruction, we suggest the expediency of encouraging the different religious sects to establish, each for itself, a professorship {{of their own}} tenets on {{the confines of the}} university, so near as that their students may attend the lectures there and have the free use of our library and every other accommodation we can give them; preserving, however, their independence of us and of each other.

2500|$|Value-added {{modeling}} (also {{known as}} value-added analysis and value-added assessment) {{is a method}} of teacher evaluation that measures the teacher's contribution {{in a given year}} by comparing the current test scores of their students to the scores of those same students in previous school years, {{as well as to the}} scores <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>students</b> in the same grade. In this manner, value-added modeling seeks to isolate the contribution, or value added, that each teacher provides in a given year, which can be compared to the performance measures of other teachers. VAMs are considered to be fairer than simply comparing student achievement scores or gain scores without considering potentially confounding context variables like past performance or income. [...] It is also possible to use this approach to estimate the value added by the school principal or the school as a whole.|$|E

Foucault did so in 1950, but never became particularly active in its activities, and never adopted an orthodox Marxist viewpoint, refuting core Marxist tenets such as class struggle. He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the party's ranks; he personally faced homophobia and was appalled by the anti-semitism exhibited during the Doctors' plot in the Soviet Union. He left the Communist Party in 1953, but remained Althusser's friend and defender {{for the rest of his}} life. Although failing at the first attempt in 1950, he passed his agrégation in philosophy on the second try, in 1951.
