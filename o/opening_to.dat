5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E

Copulation takes place tail-to-tail and may last from minutes to hours. Simple photoreceptor cells located at the genitals are important for this and other adult behaviours. The male passes a spermatophore to the female; to reduce sperm competition, he may cover her with his scent, or in some species such as the Apollos (Parnassius) plugs her genital <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> prevent her from mating again.|$|E

It ended up debuting to $1.9million (a four-day total of $2.3million), finishing 15th at the box office. Deadline.com attributed the film's low <b>opening</b> <b>to</b> its 161-minute runtime and lack of major award nominations to create buzz.|$|E
