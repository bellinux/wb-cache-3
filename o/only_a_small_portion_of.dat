5|$|Tornadoes vary in {{intensity}} regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes {{tend to be}} stronger. In the case of violent tornadoes, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from subvortices.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{are usually}} {{much larger than}} their substrates. Sizes range from just 62 amino acid {{residues}}, for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> their structure (around 2–4 amino acids) is directly involved in catalysis: the catalytic site. This catalytic site is located next {{to one or more}} binding sites where residues orient the substrates. The catalytic site and binding site together comprise the enzyme's active site. The remaining majority of the enzyme structure serves to maintain the precise orientation and dynamics of the active site.|$|E

5|$|Gandalf reappears to warn all of an {{approaching}} army of goblins and Wargs. The dwarves, men and elves band together, but only with the timely arrival of the eagles and Beorn do they win the climactic Battle of Five Armies. Thorin is fatally wounded and reconciles with Bilbo before he dies.

5|$|Jersey Royal {{potatoes}} are the local {{variety of new}} potato, and the island {{is famous for its}} early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing côtils (steeply sloping fields). Originally grown using vraic as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{contribution}} to the Battle of Normandy involved more than 3,000 military personnel serving under British command. The majority of these personnel {{were members of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), though smaller numbers of Australians serving with the Royal Navy and British Army also participated in the fighting prior to and after the Allied landings on 6 June 1944.

To rebuild the city and clean up the Barren River, the city council of New Phlan has decided to recruit adventurers to drive the monsters from the neighboring ruins. Using bards and publications, they spread tales of the riches waiting to be recovered in Phlan, which draws the player's party to these shores by ship.|$|E
5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the total issue. The sharp {{increase in the number}} of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms dictated by the imperial center.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, {{when the}} Duchess {{was staying at}} Ednam Lodge, {{the home of the}} Earl of Dudley, some of her jewels were stolen. There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the royal family as an attempt to regain jewels taken from the Royal Collection by the Duke, or by the Windsors {{themselves}} as part of an insurance fraud—they made a large deposit of loose stones at Cartier the following year. However, in 1960, career criminal Richard Dunphie confessed to the crime. The stolen pieces were <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the Windsor jewels, which were either bought privately, inherited by the Duke, or given to the Duke when he was Prince of Wales.|$|E

5|$|The least weasel forages undercover, {{to avoid}} being seen by foxes and birds of prey. It is adapted for {{pursuing}} its prey down tunnels, though it may also bolt prey from a burrow and kill it in the open. The least weasel kills small prey, such as voles, with a bite to the occipital region of the skull or the neck, dislocating the cervical vertebrae. Large prey typically dies of blood loss or circulatory shock. When food is abundant, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the prey is eaten, usually the brain. The average daily food intake is , which is equivalent to 30–35% of the animal's body weight.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the game}} was never completed, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the {{intended}} gameplay exists. During the playable segment, Mustafa, through conversations with other detainees, discovers that another detainee is planning an escape but needs a pair of pliers to make the attempt. Mustafa must join a work detail {{to gain access to}} the pliers, hide the pliers in a garbage can to prevent them from being found during a search, recover them at night (which requires Mustafa to find a way to pry open the area that the garbage cans are stored in), and deliver them to the other detainee. The playable section ends when Mustafa delivers the pliers. Other interactions during the playable section include speaking with a detainee who, after complaining that a guard threw her copy of the Quran to the ground, mentions the existence of a partially built tunnel from a previous escape attempt.|$|E
5|$|Essential {{genes are}} {{the set of}} genes thought to be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> an organism's genes are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 genes are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their genes. Half of these genes are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential genes is slightly higher, at 1000 genes (~20% of their genes). Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes (~10% of their genes). The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi-essential genes (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, DSHD {{initiated}} traffic {{surveys and}} studies to inform plans {{to construct a}} four-lane divided highway south from Dover. The studies, completed in 1942, found that US13 from Delmar to Dover carried significantly more traffic than US113 from Selbyville to Dover, so DSHD started planning for the divided highway to the Maryland state line to be along the US13 corridor. However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US113 to a divided highway from Milford to Little Heaven. DSHD completed the final link in the DoverDelmar divided highway in 1957. As in Delaware, Maryland SRC prioritized completing expansion of US13 to a four-lane highway from Virginia to Delaware, which was completed in 1966. By that time, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> US 113 around Berlin had been expanded to a divided highway.|$|E
5|$|Waller was {{involved}} in the process of mining anthracite and owned large tracts of coal-containing land. In 1837, he invested jointly in an area of coal-containing land in Plymouth Township (now Larksville) with his uncle, Oristus Collins. He and Collins divided the land into their own parcels in 1840. He and several of his siblings also bought a piece of coal-mining land from his father for $10,000 in 1857. Waller gradually bought the coal-containing lots of his siblings until he had close to 250 acres of land with coal in 1872. In 1878, he purchased 28 acres of coal-mining land in Plymouth Township from Joseph Jaquish's heirs. Altogether his coal-mining lands outputted 50,000 tons (45,454 tonnes) per year, although this was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the total coal output of the Wyoming Valley. After retiring as a minister he also purchased 2000 acres of coal-mining land near Chattanooga.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{testing has}} shown that Kiger Mustang is a {{descendant}} of the Spanish horse. Many of today's Kiger Mustangs {{can be traced back}} to a single stallion named Mesteño, captured with the original herd in 1977 and released back to the Kiger HMA. Several organizations exist which inspect and register Kiger Mustangs; each has their own standards for entry into the stud book. In 1988, the Kiger Mustang Association (now the Kiger Mesteño Association) was formed as the original registry for the herd. By 2013, the organization had registered around 800 horses, and annually inspects between 75 and 100 new horses. Two other associations are the Steens Mountain Kiger Registry, established in 1993, and the Kiger Horse Association and Registry. The Kiger Mustangs of the Riddle Mountain and Kiger HMAs are the best known herds of mustangs in Oregon, despite making up <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the population. As of 2013, the state had a total estimated BLM-managed feral horse population of almost 2,600, roaming over 17 HMAs and a Wild Horse Territory co-managed with the US Forest Service. A census taken in April 2010 found 60 Kiger Mustangs in the Riddle Mountain HMA and 81 in the Kiger HMA; estimates made in February 2013 list 40 horses in Riddle Mountain and 61 in Kiger.|$|E

5|$|Route 4 {{had several}} former spur routes that existed {{prior to the}} 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. Route 4N was {{designated}} in 1939 from the portion of pre-1927 Route 4 between Brielle and Eatontown; it is now Route 71. Route S4 was defined in 1927 {{to run to the}} Outerbridge Crossing in Perth Amboy from present-day Route 35; it was eventually extended to the Garden State Parkway and this route is now Routes 440 and 184. Route S4A was planned in 1927 to run from Atlantic City across swamps to Tuckerton; <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> this route was built and it is now Route 87. Route S4B was planned in 1929 to run Route 4 near Paterson northwest to the New York border, replacing a portion of what was legislated as Route 3 in 1927. The portion of this route that was built between Fair Lawn and Oakland is now Route 208. Route S4D was a never built spur in Teaneck proposed in 1938; the proposal was renumbered Route 303. Route 4A was created by the 1940s following a realignment of Route 4 (and U.S. Route 9) between Freehold and Cheesequake; it became Route 79 and a portion of Route 34 in 1953. Route 4 Parkway was planned in 1946 as a northsouth parkway running from Cape May north to Route 6 (now U.S. Route 46) in Clifton, bridging the gap that existed along Route 4 between Rahway and Paterson; this proposal became Route 444 (Garden State Parkway). Route S4C was a planned route running from Route 4 in Bennett south to Cape May; the general alignment of this route is now Route 162 and Cape May County Route 626.|$|E
