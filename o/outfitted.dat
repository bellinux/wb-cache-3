Right: Optimized <b>outfits</b> for dress code Casual and Business. We present an automatic optimization approach to <b>outfit</b> synthesis. Given the hair color, eye color, and skin {{color of the}} input body, plus a wardrobe of clothing items, our <b>outfit</b> synthesis system suggests a set of <b>outfits</b> subject to a particular dress code. We introduce a probabilistic framework for modeling and applying dress codes that exploits a Bayesian network trained on example images of real-world <b>outfits.</b> Suitable <b>outfits</b> are then obtained by optimizing a cost function that guides the selection of clothing items to maximize the color compatibility and dress code suitability. We demonstrate our approach on the four most common dress codes: Casual, Sportswear, Business-Casual, and Business. A perceptual study validated on multiple resultant <b>outfits</b> demonstrates the efficacy of our framework...|$|R
