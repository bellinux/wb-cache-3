In the measurement, except for {{the influence of the}} sampling frequency, the signal bandwidth is also affected by the bandwidth <b>of</b> <b>instrument.</b> When the bandwidth <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> is narrower than that of the signal, the signal passing the instrument will be distorted. Especially, the signal bandwidth will increase after the predistortion. The bandwidth of the predistorted signal is wider than that of the original input signal. Thus, if the bandwidth <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> is not sufficiently wide, the desired predistortion will be not achieved.|$|R

40|$|Theories <b>of</b> policy <b>instrument</b> choice {{have gone}} through several "generations" as theorists have moved from the {{analysis}} <b>of</b> individual <b>instruments</b> to comparative studies <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> selection and the development <b>of</b> theories <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> choice within implementation "mixes" or "governance strategies. " Current "next generation" theory on policy instruments centers {{on the question of}} the optimality <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> choices. However, empirically assessing the nature <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> mixes is quite a complex affair, involving considerable methodological difficulties and conceptual ambiguities related to the definition and measurement of policy sector and instruments and their interrelationships. Using materials generated by Canadian governments, this article examines the practical utility and drawbacks of three techniques used in the literature to inventory instruments and identify instrument ecologies and mixes: the conventional "policy domain" approach suggested by Burstein (1991); the "program" approach developed by Rose (1988 a); and the "legislative" approach used by Hosseus and Pal (1997). This article suggests that all three approaches must be used in order to develop even a modest inventory <b>of</b> policy <b>instruments,</b> but that additional problems exist with availability and accessibility of data, both in general and in terms of reconciling materials developed using these different approaches, which makes the analysis <b>of</b> <b>instrument</b> mixes a time-consuming and expensive affair.

Our empirical analysis supports the main predictions of the theoretical model.
