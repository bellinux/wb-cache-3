25|$|According to {{an article}} in the Indianapolis Star, a fire started in a {{simulated}} <b>opium</b> <b>den</b> in the Mystic Cave on the evening of June 26, 1908. The fire spread over virtually the entire White City grounds, sparing only the swimming pool area; the pool was scheduled to have its grand opening the next day, June 27. An investigation revealed that the source of the ignition was a burning joss stick no wider than the head of a pin. The inferno caused damage estimated at $161,000 to the uninsured park; only the Japanese bowling alley had been insured (for $1000). It proved to be a mortal blow to White City.|$|E

When the city of San Francisco began taxing imported opium for smoking, the trade was diverted to Victoria, and, from there, much of the opium was smuggled south into the United States. However, {{a fair amount of}} opium was consumed in the <b>opium</b> <b>dens</b> {{to be found in the}} Chinatowns of Victoria and Vancouver.

At the time, all the city's <b>opium</b> <b>dens</b> were run by Chinese, except for one on 23rd Street that was run by an American woman and her two daughters.

This was followed by an 1891 California law requiring that narcotics carry warning labels and that their sales be recorded in a registry; amendments to the California Pharmacy and Poison Act in 1907 made {{it a crime to}} sell opiates without a prescription, and bans on possession of opium or opium pipes in 1909 were enacted.|$|E

To prevent Passepartout from informing his master about the premature departure of their next vessel, the Carnatic, Fix gets Passepartout drunk and drugs him in an <b>opium</b> <b>den.</b> Passepartout still manages to catch the steamer to Yokohama, but neglects to inform Fogg that the steamer is leaving the evening before its scheduled departure date.|$|E

His abductors reveal themselves as members of a secret society known as the Sons of the Dragon, who are devoted to combating the opium trade.

2500|$|Thomas Burke wrote Limehouse Nights (1916), a {{collection}} of stories centred around life in the poverty-stricken Limehouse district of London. Many of Burke's books feature the Chinese character Quong Lee as narrator. The area also features in the Fu Manchu books of Sax Rohmer, where a Limehouse <b>opium</b> <b>den</b> serves as the hideout of the Chinese supervillain. The notion of East End opium dens seems to have originated with a description by Charles Dickens of a visit he made to an <b>opium</b> <b>den</b> in nearby Bluegate Fields, which inspired certain scenes in his last, unfinished, novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870). More recently, the popular graphic novels of Alan Moore, [...] "From Hell" [...] (1989) and [...] "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" [...] (1999) contain a number of references to the notorious criminality of the area in Victorian London.

French sailors provided another major group of opium smokers, having gotten the habit while in French Indochina, where the drug was promoted and monopolized by the colonial government {{as a source of}} revenue. Among white Europeans, opium was more frequently consumed as laudanum or in patent medicines. Britain's All-India Opium Act of 1878 formalized ethnic restrictions on the use of opium, limiting recreational opium sales to registered Indian opium-eaters and Chinese opium-smokers only and prohibiting its sale to workers from Burma. Likewise, American law sought to contain addiction to immigrants by prohibiting Chinese from smoking opium {{in the presence of a}} white man.|$|E

Some little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat, cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers-by.
