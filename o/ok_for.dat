At first, Quinn considered withdrawing from La Strada, but Fellini convinced him to work on both films simultaneously, shooting La Strada {{in the morning and}} Attila in the afternoon and evening. The plan often required the actor to get up at 3:30a.m. in order to capture the [...] "bleak early light" [...] on which Fellini insisted, and then leave at 10:30 to drive to Rome in his Zampanò outfit in order to be on the set in time to be transformed into Attila the Hun for afternoon shooting. Quinn recalled: [...] "This schedule accounted for the haggard look I had in both films, a look that was perfect for Zampanò but scarcely <b>OK</b> <b>for</b> Attila the Hun." ...|$|E

There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its <b>OK</b> <b>for</b> them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E

The N.F.L. responded by filing a lawsuit suing M.I.A. for [...] millions in damages and demanding a public apology from M.I.A.

In September 2013 Maya released a video statement regarding the lawsuit.

[...] Alex Raymond has stated, [...] "I decided honestly that comic art is an art form in itself. It reflects the life and times more accurately and actually is more artistic than magazine illustration—since it is entirely creative. An illustrator works with camera and models; a comic artist begins with a white sheet of paper and dreams up his own business—he is playwright, director, editor and artist at once." [...] A. E. Mendez has also stated that [...] "Raymond’s achievements are chopped into bite-sized pieces by the comic art cognoscenti. Lost in the worthwhile effort to distinguish comics as an art form, the romance, sweep and beauty of Raymond's draftsmanship, his incomparable line work, is dismissed. To many, it's just pretty pictures. Somehow or another, it's <b>OK</b> <b>for</b> people like Caniff and Eisner to borrow from film. That’s real storytelling.
