40|$|First draft This paper {{analyses}} the willingness-to-pay (WTP) {{of forest}} owners for insurance against natural hazards such as fire. The {{objective is to}} identify the determinants of forest owner’s participation to insurance and insurance demand. In particular, {{we are interested in}} the impact of different types of public compensation: fixed help, contingent fixed help and insurance subsidy. We also analyse the role played by the expected loss of forestry income, the uncertainty characterizing the probability of occurrence of natural risks, and the characteristics of owners and forest property. Some of these determinants explain either participation to insurance (e. g., ambiguity about the probability of occurrence of natural hazards) or insurance demand (e. g., the past perception of a public help in real life), some of them do not allow to explain the owner’s insurance behaviour (e. g., having ever suffered from a fire in the past) while the <b>other</b> <b>explain</b> both the two behaviours (e. g., some types of public compensation) ...|$|E

According to this, laws, like ideas, are no more than reflections on a psychic level of social and economic realities, and have little or no power to shape these. For Keynes, in contrast, ``it is ideas, not vested interests, that are dangerous for good or ill??. There was consequently no place for co-evolution in Schumpeter?s thought. But what made him publish a book which he described as ``a house which is not finished and furnished??, when he did?

40|$|This work {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} on humus forms in a Mediterranean LTER (Long-Term Ecosystem Research) site. The study tests the effectiveness of the recent European humus forms classification (Zanella et al. 2011 b), based on morpho-genetic characteristics of diagnostic organic and organo-mineral horizons. Further- more it reveals how humus forms, at the level of diagnostic horizons, are related to vegetation/soil type and car- bon storage capacity of the soil. The humus forms were surveyed in different substrates, soil types, and vegetation units of a Mediterranean forest ecosystem in Central Italy (Castelporziano Reserve). Thickness, organic carbon (OC) and total nitrogen (Ntot) contents in organic and organo-mineral horizons, pH and texture in the organo-mineral horizon were measured and statistically analysed. The three main humus forms (Mull, Moder and Amphi) covering the soil of the Reserve appeared well separated on the PCA diagram. Thickness, OC and Ntot showed a high correlation with axes of PCA. Kruskal–Wallis tests re- vealed differences between Mull, Moder and Amphi: 1) the thickness of the A horizon was larger in Amphi; 2) OC in the A horizon was less in Moder; 3) Mull had less OC in organic horizons than Moder and Amphi; and 4) Mull and Amphi had twice OC of Moder in bulked organic and organo-mineral horizons.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: This work {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} on humus forms in a Mediterranean area. The study allows to test the effectiveness of the recent European humus forms classification (Zanella et al. 2011 a), based on morpho-genetic characters of diagnostic organic and organo-mineral horizons. Furthemore it reveals how the humus forms data, at the level of diagnostic horizons, are related to vegetation/soil types and Carbon storage capacity of the soil. Methods: The humus forms were investigated in different substrate, soil types, and vegetation units of a Mediterranean forest ecosystem in Central Italy (Castelporziano Reserve). Classical parameters were measured and statistically analysed: thickness, Organic Carbon (OC) and total Nitrogen (Ntot) contents in organic and organo-mineral horizons, whilst pH and texture in the organo-mineral horizon. Results: The three main humus forms (Mull, Moder and Amphi) covering the soil of the Reserve appeared well separated on the PCA diagram. Thickness, OC and Ntot showed a high correlation with the axes of the PCA. Kruskall-Wallis results disclosed differences among Mull, Moder and Amphi: 1) the thickness of A horizon was larger in Amphi; 2) OC in A horizon was lesser in Moder form; 3) Mull had less OC in organic horizons than Moder and Amphi; 4) Mull and Amphi raised twice the OC of Moder in organic and organo-mineral summed horizons. Two main ecological gradients, from neutral/aerated Mull to acid/asphyxiated-water saturated Moder on one side and from fresh Mull to dry Amphi on the <b>other,</b> <b>explain</b> the distribution of humus forms in the Reserve. The first gradient concerns circular belts around periodically filled small basins and is peculiar to the more or less impermeable plain of Castelporziano; on the contrary, the second progressive transition is very common in Mediterranean forests. Conclusion: A clear trend in Carbon storage capacity is visible in humus forms of Mediterranean forest where Mull and Amphi, with a good mixing of organics and minerals particles in the A horizon, show at least twice more OC than Moder. Practice: The European humus forms classification is a very practical tool and allows to survey the humus forms and better understand the functioning of forest ecosystems even in Mediterranean area. The carbon cycle of Mediterranean forests seems to gravitate around a still scarcely investigated and very rich in OC Amphi humus form. Implications: The European humus forms classification seems to be appropriate to a large scale survey of humus forms in forest ecosystems. It allows to better understand the organic matter cycle at the level of soil bio-structures. The crucial role played by the here investigated Amphi forms could increase with the prospect of climate change...|$|E
