25|$|On the {{economic}} front, Mahathir inherited the New Economic Policy from his predecessors, {{which was designed}} to improve {{the economic}} position of the bumiputera (Malaysia's Malays and indigenous peoples) through targets and affirmative action in areas such as corporate ownership and university admission. Mahathir also actively pursued privatisation of government enterprises from the early 1980s, both for the liberal economic reasons it was being pursued by contemporaries such as Margaret Thatcher, and because he felt that combined with affirmative action for the bumiputera it could provide economic opportunities for bumiputera businesses. His government privatised airlines, utilities and telecommunication firms, accelerating to a rate of about 50 privatisations a year by the mid-1990s. While privatisation generally improved the working conditions of Malaysians in privatised industries and raised significant revenue for the government, many privatisations occurred in the absence of <b>open</b> <b>tendering</b> processes and benefited Malays who supported UMNO. One of the most notable infrastructure projects at the time was the construction of the North–South Expressway, a motorway running from the Thai border to Singapore; the contract to construct the expressway was awarded to a business venture of UMNO. Mahathir also oversaw the establishment of the car manufacturer Proton as a joint venture between the Malaysian government and Mitsubishi. By the end of the 1980s, Proton had overcome poor demand and losses to become, with the support of protective tariffs, the largest car maker in Southeast Asia and a profitable enterprise.|$|E

The report also criticized TCHC for bypassing the formal requirement that bidders make deposits—a requirement that protects the TCHC should a bidder fail to meet its contractual obligations—and for its documentation inadequately supporting some cases of single tendering.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Contracting {{authorities}} {{in the public sector}} are obligated to apply the principles provided for in the Polish law for the evaluation and selection of contractors. In order to analyse the methods of contractors selecting applied in practice by public clients, the notices of contract award results for construction works were analysed. The analysis shows that the procedure selected more and more often is open competitive bidding, where the assessment of the competence of contractors is not very precise, as well as non-competitive bidding, i. e. single source procurement. The share of procurement procedures, where the only criterion is price, is increasing. The solution to the problems existing here might be the introduction of one of the forms of pre-selection of contractors. The article also briefly discusses verification systems for companies applying for public contracts used in EU countries.

40|$|Policies {{aimed at}} {{supporting}} {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) are now standard in public procurement. Interest in these policies has yet to be matched by evidence on their implementation. Using an institutional perspective, we examine the extent to which public buyers have complied with SME-friendly policy recommendations. The results, which are based on the self-reported behaviours of 436 respondents, show that public buyers are complying with some but not all policy measures. Compliance is high on measures including <b>open</b> <b>tendering,</b> provision of feedback, and self-declaring financial capacity but low on measures which impose higher transaction costs, such as dividing contracts into lots and encouraging consortium bidding. Further analysis reveals that involvement in procurement, policy familiarity, and perceived importance of SME access act as positive predictors of compliance; being part of a semi-state/utility company, local authority or education institution has the opposite effect. Possibilities to increase compliance and bring about a more SME-friendly tendering system are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} new bidders – bidders from whom there is no {{previous}} registered participation – is an important variable in most bid tender forecasting models, since the unknown competitive profile of the former strongly limits the predictive accuracy of the latter. Analogously, when a bidder considers entering a bid or when an auctioneer is handling a procurement auction, assessing the likely proportion of experienced bidders is considered an important aspect, as some strategic decisions or even the awarding criteria might differ. However, estimating the number of bidders in a future auction that have not submitted a single bid yet is difficult, {{since there is no}} data at all linking their potential participation, an essential requirement for the implementation of any forecasting or estimation method. A practical approach is derived for determining the expected proportion of new bidders to frequent bidders {{as a function of the}} population of potential bidders.

40|$|Traditional {{procurement}} {{system is}} commonly used in Nigerian construction industry. However; despite the wide choice of other procurement system, there are numerous of key challenges that affects cost, time and quality of completed project. This challenge contributes negatively to both parties namely clients and contractor. To date, there are limited works that assess the key challenges of traditional procurement system in Nigeria which hinders the proposition of possible solutions to the problems. Hence, this research aims to identify the key challenges {{that are associated with}} traditional procurement in Nigerian construction industry with a view to identify areas of weakness and propose a solution. It also involves identification of the most frequent use of traditional procurement system. Structured questionnaire was distributed to 136 contractors that actively participated in the construction industry with 78 percent response rate. The use of mean, ranking, correlation and analysis of variance were used to analyses the data. The result shows that all the challenges have a significant relationship with the <b>open</b> <b>tendering</b> method. Further analysis also show that all the key challenges: Cost certainty, Time certainty, Build ability and Fragmentation of organizational interface have a significant relationship with one another.

40|$|Use {{of human}} {{resource}} {{is an important}} issue in the library administration. In the Public Library Statistics 2005 - 2012, we find the members of staff unapproved were more than the quota of staff approved, and they increased year by year. Dispatched workers are one kind of the members of staff unapproved. In resent years, the government has a downsizing policy. As a result, it is more difficult for public libraries to increase the quota of staff approved. They could only increase the members of staff unapproved to meet the work demands. The {{purpose of this study was}} to know the situation of the dispatched workers in the public libraries and their performance. This study used the methods of an analysis of literature and documents and interviews. Interviews were conducted from May 2 to May 27, 2013. Librarians from 12 out of 24 public libraries that have used dispatched workers during 2005 - 2012 were interviewed. Results of the study are listed in 4 aspects. First, in the current situation: 1. 50 % beyond local libraries used dispatched workers, due to lack of human resources. Libraries that did not use dispatched workers was because there were alternative resources. 2. some public libraries changed temporary workers into dispatched workers to meet government’s policy. 3. the Government Procurement Act brought forth dispatched workers as outsource persons. 4. <b>open</b> <b>tendering</b> procedures was the way of employing dispatched workers. 5. the number of dispatched workers increased year by year. Second, among differences between dispatched workers and non-dispatched workers: 1. the dispatched workers could not handle administrated work; 2. the dispatched workers could go to work every day; 3, the dispatched workers had more responsibilities than volunteers; 4. contracted- employment and temporary workers were considered first when using the staff unapproved; 5. dispatched workers included both white-collar and blue-collar workers in the libraries. Third, from the perspective of performance: 1. using dispatched workers was positive; 2. libraries achieved the original target of using them; 3. personnel budgets were saved. Forth, the evaluation of the companies: 1. the company was chosen by <b>open</b> <b>tendering</b> procedures; 2. evaluations included the reputation, the performance and the capital of the company. Base on these results 3 suggestions are made: 1. the number of dispatched workers in the public libraries should be controlled; 2. making appropriate plans before using dispatched workers; 3. workers’ ware fare should be taken care of. 圖書館人力資源之利用是圖書館行政之重要課題。從 2005 - 2012 年公共圖書館統計可看出公立公共圖書館的編制內人力持續低於非編制內人力；非編制內人力的其他項人力逐年升高，而其他項中即包含了勞動派遣人力。近年來由於政府機關推動人力精簡政策，致增加編制內人力很難，各館在權宜之下採用非編制內人力，以應服務讀者之需要。本文研究動機在於了解現階段公立公共圖書館非編制內人力中的勞動派遣人力運用情形及其工作績效。 本研究採文獻分析法及訪談法，訪談期間為 102 年 5 月 2 至 27 日，從全國 24 所縣市級以上公共圖書館中，對 2005 - 2012 年間已運用勞動派遣人力的 12 所圖書館進行訪談。對未採用者則詢問其不採用之原因。蒐集資料方法有實地訪談、電話訪談及回覆訪談大綱之文件。 研究結果分為四個面向：一、就現況而言： 1. 縣市立以上圖書館中有 50 %曾採用勞動派遣人力，採用的主因為人力不足，至於不採用的主因為有其他替代人力。 2. 部分勞動派遣人員由臨時人員轉換而來； 3. 政府採購法施行後促使各館以勞務委任之名行勞動派遣之實； 4. 招募勞動派遣人力的方式為公開招標且多採價格標； 5. 各館勞動派遣人數有逐年成長趨勢；二、就非編制內人力中，勞動派遣人力與非勞動派遣人力之差異而言： 1. 勞動派遣人員與約聘僱人員、臨時人員最大差別為前者不可辦理行政工作； 2. 與工讀生之區別為可連續於平日上班 3. 與志工之區別為領取薪資，工作責任較重； 4. 各館進用非編制內人力時，仍優先考量約聘僱人員、臨時人員； 5. 勞動派遣人員涵蓋白領及藍領；三、就工作績效而言： 1. 勞動派遣人員的工作績效是正面的； 2. 達到各館當初採用勞動派遣人力的預期目標； 3. 確實可節省用人經費；四、就評選派遣機構而言： 1. 透過公開招標方式評選派遣機構； 2. 評選項目包括廠商聲譽、實績及資本額等； 3. 館方透過沿用及轉換為臨時人員等激勵勞動派遣人員。 本研究之建議為： 1. 公立公共圖書館運用勞動派遣人數宜有上限； 2. 為順利運用勞動派遣人力，公立公共圖書館宜有配套措施； 3. 在法令許可範圍內，儘量照顧勞動派遣人員的福利。第一章 緒論	 1 第一節 研究動機	 1 第二節 研究目的	 3 第三節 研究問題	 3 第四節 研究範圍與限制	 4 第五節 研究方法	 4 第六節 名詞解釋	 5 註釋	 6 第二章 文獻探討	 9 第一節 公立公共圖書館的人力	 9 第二節 勞動派遣	 19 第三節 運用勞動派遣人力之規劃與評估	 41 第四節 工作績效與評估	 43 第五節 圖書館及類似機構或行業運用勞動派遣人力概況	 48 註釋	 61 第三章 研究設計與實施	 73 第一節 研究架構	 73 第二節 研究對象	 75 第三節 研究方法	 77 第四節 研究工具	 78 第五節 資料處理與分析	 81 第六節 研究流程	 82 註釋	 84 第四章 研究結果與分析	 85 第一節 受訪者背景分析	 85 第二節 公立公共圖書館勞動派遣人力現況	 86 第三節 公立公共圖書館勞動派遣人力與其他非編制內人力之差異	 96 第四節 公立公共圖書館勞動派遣人力之績效	 109 第五節 評選人力派遣機構	 115 第六節 綜合討論	 126 註釋	 133 第五章 結論與建議	 135 第一節 結論	 135 第二節 建議	 140 第三節 後續研究建議	 141 註釋	 141 參考書目	 143 附錄一 訪談邀請函	 153 附錄二 訪談同意書	 155 附錄三 訪談大綱一：圖書館首長（主管）	 157 附錄四 訪談大綱二：業務單位主管	 159 附錄五 訪談大綱三：圖書館主管（勞動派遣標案承辦人） [...] 勞動派遣人力僅負責清潔工作部分	 161 附錄六　○圖書館（總館） 102 年度清潔工作規範	 163 附錄七 ○圖書館 102 年度事務人力勞務委外採購案規格需求書	 167 附錄八 行政院運用勞動派遣應行注意事項	 17...|$|E

40|$|In general, {{the eighteenth}} century in Holland is {{regarded}} as a period of decline after the great prosperity and affluence of the preceding century. The number of public works in towns in Holland decreased and the urban building companies concentrated on maintenance of existing structures. In the course of this century many towns were faced with increasing financial deficits. The direct connection between public funds and public works, which made up twenty to thirty per cent of the total expenditure, made interventions in the building companies necessary. The high cost and often qualitatively poor execution of public works caused the town administrations to distrust the officials involved. Several towns carried out reorganisations, in which the urban building company was sometimes closed down completely. Besides, new procedures and bureaucratic measures were prescribed in order to get more grip on the building company, and thus on town expenses. <b>Open</b> <b>tendering</b> of maintenance work to private bosses was expected to be very advantageous. The reforms mentioned were not exclusively aimed at saving expenses, but also at improvements in the execution. However, in general the interventions had the opposite effect. This {{had to do with the}} lack of knowledge of the town administrations as regards the building trade in general and their own building company in particular. Public building proved to be very susceptible to fraud. Occasional successes depended more on the individual commitment of competent administrators or officials than on a newly conceived form of organisation. On the basis of some reorganisations of urban building companies and some building projects in Delft, Leiden, Haarlem and Schiedam this article gives a picture of the problems which town administrators were faced with in connection with public works...|$|E
40|$|The actual {{construction}} time {{and cost of}} construction projects may {{be affected by the}} client, project and contractual characteristics and in many cases can be very different from the contract time and cost. In this paper, details of 93 Australian construction projects are used to develop several models for actual {{construction time}} and cost prediction. A forward crossvalidation regression analysis is used {{for the development of the}} model for actual construction time forecast when client sector, contractor selection method, contractual arrangement, project type, contract period and contract sum are known. The standard deviation of the deleted residual indicates the best model for actual construction time prediction to comprise the independent variables log contract time, lump sum procurement and non-standard contractor selection. Regression models are also developed for forecasting the actual construction time and cost when client sector, contractor selection method, contractual arrangement and project type are known while contract period and contract sum are estimated. Different forms of regression analyses, including the standard regression and the crossvalidation regression, are used and the crossvalidation regression model with the smallest deleted residual sum of squares is selected. Since these models for time and cost are dependent on the contract period and contract sum being known, it is necessary to investigate the effects in situations where these have to be estimated. The results of the sensitivity analyses show that the errors in predicted actual construction time become smaller as the contract period increases. In contrast, the errors in predicted actual construction cost are virtually the same for large and small projects. The effects of different project type, contractor selection method and contractual arrangement are also examined. The results indicate that the actual construction time for industrial project is the longest when compared with residential, educational and recreational projects and that significant savings in actual construction time can be achieved when negotiated tender and design and build contract are used instead of the traditional <b>open</b> <b>tendering</b> and lump sum contract approaches. Finally, some practical applications of the models are illustrated for predicting the actual construction time and cost based on the risks and uncertainties of different client sector, contractor selection method, contractual arrangement and project type. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This {{project set}} out to define the refuse {{collection}} problem in Kitwe and to propose ways of improving the same. Through a household survey, interviews with relevant institutions and a physical survey of the town, it was established that the Kitwe City Council {{is not able to}} provide an adequate refuse collection service to its residents. Less than 10 % of generated waste is collected. The rest is either burnt or scattered around the town in illegal pits, piles, road kerbs and even drainage systems. The situation contributes to environmental degradation, poor public health conditions, high risks of epidemics and a generally aesthetically unpleasant environment. The reasons for this situation include among others, inadequate financing mechanisms, inadequate technical capacity, failure to enforce existing legislation, poor participation of stakeholders and a general weakness in existing institutional structures. Some major strong points were identified through the surveys and they included users’ willingness to pay for and private sector willingness to be involved in refuse collection. Building on these the study proposes to improve refuse collection through a participatory approach in which the council ceases to be a service provider and becomes a facilitator and regulator. The Council is expected to facilitate and control the activities of the private sector through contracts and licensing procedures. Collection and management of waste is handled by the private sector through both contract arrangement based on <b>open</b> <b>tendering</b> as well as open competition; and by community based organisations who oversee the collection of waste from source to primary collection points. Secondary collection is to be undertaken as a collaborative effort between the council and the private sector. The council retains a minimal collection role in selected areas only as a way of utilising existing capital outlet. Individual users are expected to pay for collection in order to sustain the proposed system. User fees are billed with other services such as water as a means of achieving compliance. The study goes further and suggests that certain technical, financial and manpower capacities together with organisational capacities will have to be developed if the new system is to succeed. Among the major recommendations are improvement in solid waste data collection and management, improved road networks, development of a sanitary landfill, development of a regulatory and institutional framework for operation of all stakeholders, improved revenue collection systems, development of proper contract management procedures, environmental awareness campaigns, and establishment of appropriate operational standards. Recognising the difficulties of introducing new systems, the study ends by recommending that the council should proceed on an incremental (experimental) basis starting with implementing of those ideas which are more readily acceptable to society...|$|E
