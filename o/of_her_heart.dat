Considering where Meredith was at the beginning and where she is now, I think she went through a remarkable journey and did more than just growing up, she finally became “all whole and healed“." ...|$|E

With their leader gone, {{a majority of the}} demons disappeared, with only a few remaining in seclusion over the next few centuries, eventually launching an attack on the castle to reclaim the incapacitated body of Mother.|$|E

2500|$|The veneration of the Heart of Mary is {{analogous}} to the worship of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. There are, however, differences in this analogy as devotion to the heart of Jesus is especially directed to the [...] "divine heart" [...] as overflowing with love for humanity.

2500|$|The autopsy was {{performed}} {{the next day}} by Golay, who discovered that the weapon, which {{had not yet been}} found, had penetrated [...] into Elisabeth's thorax, fractured the fourth rib, pierced the lung and pericardium, and penetrated the heart from the top before coming out the base of the left ventricle. Because of the sharpness and thinness of the file the wound was very narrow and, due to pressure from Elisabeth's extremely tight corseting, the hemorrhage of blood into the pericardial sac around the heart was slowed to mere drops. Until this sac filled, the beating <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> was not impeded, which is why Elisabeth had been able to walk from the site of the assault and up the boat’s boarding ramp. Had the weapon not been removed, she would have lived a while longer, as it would have acted like a plug to stop the bleeding.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an account}} first {{published}} in 1999 by the widely cited newsletter Taylorology, on October 21, 1964, while still living in Hollywood, Gibson suffered a heart attack. Sensing that she was dying, a highly distraught Gibson—a recently converted Roman Catholic—asked for a priest and then confessed to neighbors the February 1, 1922 murder of Hollywood film director William Desmond Taylor. She may have made statements about a motive but in 1999, the only surviving witness to this incident wrote that at the time, he was young, distracted by the immediate crisis <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> attack, {{had no knowledge of}} who William Desmond Taylor was or what she was talking about. As a result, he could not remember many further details about what Gibson said as she lay dying on the kitchen floor of her small house. The witness did recall Gibson also said she had been [...] "nearly caught" [...] and had [...] "fled the country".|$|E

2500|$|Being a yōkai, Himari {{finds herself}} torn between {{her desire to}} protect Yuto, and her nature as a bloodthirsty demon cat. Through research, Shizuku informs Yuto that Himari's {{ancestors}} were the type of evil yōkai that killed and ate humans, saying that Himari takes pleasure in the hunt and loses herself to the bloodlust. Initially, Himari does not realize when she loses control, describing it as if her heart was swallowed up into a black pool. Himari eventually acknowledges {{that she is a}} beast after a fight with Kuesu, but she is tended to by Yuta. In response Himari kisses him, saying that it is a [...] "gift of mercy" [...] for letting her stay by his side. Towards the end of the series in the fight against Tamamo-no-Mae, Himari bites her, absorbing most of her demonic powers. This results in Himari losing control with her darker demonic half, which eventually becomes visible to those around her. The series ends when Yuto enters into Himari's subconscious, and saves her before her darker half takes full control <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After Gloria Monty first {{left the}} series in 1987, General Hospital {{entered into a}} {{transitional}} phase that lasted until Wendy Riche took the position of executive producer in 1992. Under Riche, the show gained critical acclaim for its sensitive handling of social issues. In 1994, Riche started an annual Nurses' Ball, a fundraiser and AIDS awareness event both {{on the show and}} in real life. Later that year, a heart transplant storyline involves the death of eight-year-old [...] (daughter of Dr. Tony Jones and R.N.
