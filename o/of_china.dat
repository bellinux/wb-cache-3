So, what drives China’s urbanization? Through the regression analysis, Liu (2007) finds out that the employment proportion <b>of</b> <b>China’s</b> service industry is highly correlated with urbanization rate and the fast speed of the development <b>of</b> <b>China’s</b> service industry has promoted the acceleration of urbanization process. Especially in the mid and late industrialization, the promotion of urbanization mainly depends on service development, thus becoming an indispensable propulsion for urbanization growth.|$|R
