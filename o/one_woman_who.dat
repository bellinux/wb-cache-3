25|$|All over France, the maquis {{attempted}} to seize towns in June 1944, expecting the Allies {{to be there}} soon, often with tragic results. For instance, in Saint-Amand-Montrond, the maquis seized the town and took 13 miliciens and their associated women prisoners, including the wife of Francis Bout de l'An, a senior leader of the Milice who intervened to take personal charge of the situation to get his wife back. A joint German-milice force marched on Saint-Amand-Montrond, causing the maquis to retreat and when the Axis forces arrived, eleven people were shot on the spot while a number of hostages were taken. The Milice chief of Orléans and the archbishop of Bourges were able to negotiate an exchange on 23 June 1944, where the Maquis released their female hostages (except for <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> chose to join the maquis) {{in exchange for the}} Milice releasing their hostages, through the Germans refused to free any of their hostages and instead deported them to the concentration camps. As for the miliciens taken hostage, the maquisards knew if they were freed, they would reveal their hideout and their names as both the miliciens and maquisards had grown up in the same town and knew each other well (men on both sides had once been friends) {{while at the same time}} food was in short supply, making their hostages a drain on their food supplies; leading to the maquisards to hang their hostages (shooting them would make too noise) out in the woods. Bout de l'An decided to seek revenge for his wife's captivity by sending a force of miliciens under Lécussan to round up the surviving Jews of Bourges and buried 36 Jews alive out in the woods, as Bout de l'An believed that resistance was all the work of the Jews.|$|E

500|$|On 6May more {{witnesses}} for {{the prosecution}} were called. [...] As Squires and her family watched, several of Wells's neighbours insisted they had, about the beginning of 1753, seen the old gypsy in the area. [...] More witnesses claimed to have seen her in various places around Enfield Wash, including <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> swore she had seen her on Old Christmas Day. [...] Britain's calendar had in September 1752 changed from the old-style Julian calendar, to the Gregorian calendar, and the woman was unable to discern the exact day on which she claimed to have seen Squires. [...] She was not alone; several of the defence's witnesses were also unable to manage the 11-day correction required by the calendar change. [...] Others were illiterate, and struggled similarly. [...] The court also heard from three witnesses present solely to discredit the testimony offered by the Natuses.|$|E
500|$|In January 1908, {{a number}} of {{individuals}} were arrested while attempting to exchange the notes. The New York Times reported that <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> had tried to cash a marked 500-ruble note later tried to swallow evidence of her plans to meet her accomplices after the police were summoned, but the police stopped her from swallowing the paper by grabbing her throat, retrieved the paper, and later arrested her accomplices at the train station. Most prominent among those arrested was Maxim Litvinov, caught while boarding a train with his mistress at Paris's Gare du Nord with twelve of the 500-ruble notes he intended to cash in London. The French Minister of Justice expelled Litvinov and his mistress from French territory, outraging the Russian government, which had requested his extradition. [...] Officially the French government stated that Russia's request for extradition had been submitted too late, but by some accounts, they denied the extradition because French socialists had applied political pressure to secure his release.|$|E

500|$|Bush {{first became}} {{involved}} with The Heart Truth awareness campaign in 2003. It is an organization established by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to raise awareness about heart disease in women, and how to prevent the condition. She serves in the honorary position of ambassador for the program leading the federal government's effort to give women a [...] "wake up call" [...] {{about the risk of}} heart disease. She commented on the disease: [...] "Like many women, I assumed heart disease was a man's disease and cancer was what we would fear the most. Yet heart disease kills more women in our country than all forms of cancer combined. When it comes to heart disease, education, prevention, and even a little red dress can save lives." [...] She has undertaken a signature personal element of traveling around the country and talking to women at hospital and community events featuring the experiences of women who live, or had lived, with the condition. This outreach was credited with saving the life of <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> went to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E
500|$|The feminist {{film critic}} Molly Haskell also wrote an {{approving}} {{review of the}} film in the Village Voice: [...] "In a world, an industry, and particularly a genre which values the new and improved product above all, it {{is nothing short of}} miraculous to see a movie which dares to go backward, a technological artefact which has nobly deteriorated into a human being. I speak of the new and obsolete James Bond, played by a man named George Lazenby, who seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates." [...] Haskell was also affected by the film's emotional ending: [...] "The love between Bond and his Tracy begins as a payment and ends as a sacrament. After ostensibly getting rid of the bad guys, they are married. They drive off to a shocking, stunning ending. Their love, being too real, is killed by the conventions it defied. But they win the final victory by calling, unexpectedly, upon feeling. Some of the audience hissed, I was shattered. If you like your Bonds with happy endings, don't go." ...|$|E
500|$|Smith and Lavington {{consider}} that Lazenby [...] "had chosen to play Bond {{the same way}} as Sean Connery had, with perhaps more humility and humanity"; they {{went on to say that}} [...] "Lazenby's inexperience rarely shows" [...] in the film, and that [...] "he invariably rises to the occasion". Alexander Walker in the London Evening Standard said that, [...] "The truth is that George Lazenby is almost as good a James Bond as the man referred to in his film as 'the other fellow'. Lazenby's voice is more suave than sexy-sinister and he could pass for the other fellow's twin on the shady side of the casino. Bond is now definitely all set for the Seventies". Judith Crist of New York Magazine commented that, [...] "This time around there's less suavity and a no-nonsense muscularity and maleness to the role via the handsome Mr. Lazenby". Feminist film critic Molly Haskell wrote an approving review in the Village Voice: [...] "Lazenby... seems more comfortable in a wet tuxedo than a dry martini, more at ease as a donnish genealogist than reading (or playing) Playboy, and who actually dares to think that <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> is his equal is better than a thousand part-time playmates".|$|E

500|$|In early 1979, [...] "the Family", a {{group of}} BLA members, began to plan Shakur's escape from prison. They financed this by {{stealing}} $105,000 from a Bamberger's store in Paramus, New Jersey. On November 2, 1979 Shakur escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey, when {{three members of the}} Black Liberation Army visiting her drew concealed [...]45-caliber pistols and a stick of dynamite, seized two guards as hostages, commandeered a van and escaped. No one was injured during the prison break, including the guards held as hostages who were left in a parking lot. According to later court testimony, Shakur lived in Pittsburgh until August 1980, when she flew to the Bahamas. Mutulu Shakur, Silvia Baraldini, Sekou Odinga, and Marilyn Buck were charged with assisting in her escape; Ronald Boyd Hill was also held on charges related to the escape. In part {{for his role in the}} event, Mutulu was named on July 23, 1982 as the 380th addition to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, where he remained for the next four years until his capture in 1986. State correction officials disclosed in November 1979 that they had not run identity checks on Shakur's visitors and that the three men and <b>one</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> assisted in her escape had presented false identification to enter the prison's visitor room, before which they were not searched. Mutulu Shakur and Marilyn Buck were convicted in 1988 of several robberies as well as the prison escape.|$|E
500|$|Six months later, she {{is working}} as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced {{into the trunk of}} a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. <b>One</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream at an active worker for help. The worker attempts to bust the door open, but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.|$|E
