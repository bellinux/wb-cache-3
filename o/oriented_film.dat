500|$|Midway Games optioned Jousts movie {{rights to}} CP Productions in 2007. Michael Cerenzie and Christine Peters of CP Productions planned {{to expand on}} a game element for the film's premise. Cerenzie {{described}} the script by Marc Gottlieb as [...] "Gladiator meets Mad Max", set 25 years in the future, and Peters commented that the action <b>oriented</b> <b>film</b> would appeal to a general audience. The movie was planned as a tent-pole movie, with a graphic novel by Steven-Elliot Altman {{as part of the}} media franchise's release. Midway Games also considered a video game adaptation of the film. Jousts expected release date was set in June 2008 and then later pushed back to 2009. The video game company, however, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2009. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment purchased most of Midway's assets, including Joust, with the intent to develop movie adaptations.|$|E

Bulk <b>oriented</b> <b>films</b> were filled with fluorinated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs). The structure of bulk <b>oriented</b> <b>films</b> on UHMWPE, which were manufactured {{at different stages of}} orientation, was investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The addition of FMWCNTs at a concentration of 0. 05 wt % in bulk <b>oriented</b> UHMWPE <b>films</b> led to an increase in the tensile strength by 10 % (up to 1020 ± 23 MPa) compared to unfilled <b>oriented</b> <b>films.</b> However, the addition of FMWCNTs at a concentration of more than 0. 5 wt % led to a decrease in tensile strength due to excessive accumulation of nanotubes and hindering of self-diffusion of UHMWPE macromolecules. The multiple increase in tensile strength, doubling the hardness, the formation of fibrillar structure, and the presence of carbon nanotubes led to a significant increase in tribological properties in bulk <b>oriented</b> <b>films.</b> Bulk <b>oriented</b> UHMWPE/ 1 % FMWCNT films can be operated at a maximum contact pressure that is 18 times higher and exhibit a specific wear rate more than an order of magnitude and less than the traditional UHMWPE of isotropic structure. Bulk oriented UHMWPE/ 1 % FMWCNT films have an extremely low dry coefficient of friction (COF) of 0. 075 at a contact pressure of 31 MPa.

40|$|The {{technique}} of nebulized spray pyrolysis has been explored {{to find out}} whether <b>oriented</b> <b>films</b> of certain important oxides can be produced on single-crystal substrates by this relatively gentle method. Starting with acetylacetonate precursors, <b>oriented</b> <b>films</b> of metallic LaNiO 3 containing nearly spherical grains (30 nm) have been obtained. Films of near-stoichiometric La 4 Ni 3 O 10 and La 3 Ni 2 O 7 showing metallic conductivity have been obtained by this method. This is indeed gratifying since it is difficult to prepare monophasic and stoichiometric bulk samples of these materials. Films of La 2 NiO 4 show the expected semiconducting behavior. In the La-Cu-O system, starting with acetylacetonates, we have obtained films mainly comprising semiconducting La 2 Cu 2 O 5, which is generally difficult to prepare in bulk form. More interestingly, nebulized spray pyrolysis gives excellent stoichiometric films of Pb(Zr 0. 52 Ti 0. 48) O- 3 consisting of nearly spherical grains (30 nm) which show ferroelectric behavior. The present investigation demonstrates that nebulized spray pyrolysis provides a useful and desirable route to deposite <b>oriented</b> <b>films</b> of complex oxide materials on single-crystal substrates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{employed}} pulsed reactive crossed-beam laser ablation (PRCLA) to deposit a (101) <b>oriented</b> ZnO <b>film.</b> In this method, a supersonic {{jet of oxygen}} pulse is made to cross the laser plume from a zinc metal target while being carried to the Si(111) substrate.

When the substrate was held at varying temperatures, from room temperature to 900 °C, the crystallinity of the obtained films increased as expected, but importantly, the crystallographic orientation of the films was varied. High substrate temperatures produced the usual (001) <b>oriented</b> <b>films,</b> while lower substrate temperatures gave rise to increasingly (101) <b>oriented</b> <b>films.</b> The substrate held at room temperature contained only the (101) orientation. The film morphology also varied with the sub-strate temperature, from being nanoparticulate to rod-like deposits for higher deposition temperatures. Sur-prisingly, the (101) orientation showed reactivity with acetone forming carbonaceous nanostructures on the surface...|$|R
