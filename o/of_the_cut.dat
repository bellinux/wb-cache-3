5|$|In 1956 film enthusiasts Jean Gabarit and Jacques Marechal {{founded the}} Societe des Grands Films, a film {{restoration}} company focused on neglected films. The Rules of the Game {{was one of}} the company's first restorations; they persuaded Camille Francois to sell them the rights to the film. With Francois' help they discovered records that led to 224 boxes that had been found at the bombed G.M. Film Lab site. These boxes included negative prints, duplicated prints and sound mixes of the film. With the help and advice of Renoir and Jacques Durand, Gabarit and Marechal restored most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> footage from Renoir's original version and assembled a new 106-minute version of the film.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2007, Judah {{made his}} return to the ring against Ruben Galvan at the Fitzgeralds Casino & Hotel in Tunica, Mississippi. Judah came out {{strongly}} in the first round, landing numerous shots on Galvan. During the round, a bad cut opened near the top of Galvan's head. The referee called for a timeout to allow the doctor {{to take a look at}} the cut. Due to the severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut,</b> the fight was waved off. The cut was ruled to be caused by an accidental foul with an elbow and since the fight did not go past four rounds, the fight was ruled a no contest.|$|E

5|$|Sound Transit {{suspended}} {{planning for}} the Portage Bay tunnel in 2000 after it received construction bids that were $171 million higher than expected and found, through soil testing, that a deeper tunnel would be required. The project's costs overall rose $1 billion over budget and the schedule was delayed by three years, due to unrealistic cost and time estimates made during previous stages of planning. Capitol Hill businesses, while initially supportive of the light rail station's placement, later pulled their support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> and cover option due to the longer period required for construction. Sound Transit, faced with budget issues and further schedule delays, deferred construction of the segment between Downtown Seattle and the University District in 2001 while re-evaluating alignment options.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes only a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive broach, which completely machines the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the broach machines outward from there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, at {{the dawn}} of the freeway era, the state was making plans to convert the Bayshore Highway into a ten-lane Bayshore Freeway between San Francisco and Palo Alto. The first piece built was from Peninsula Avenue at the San Mateo-Burlingame line to South San Francisco. This six-lane freeway, {{completed}} in 1949, followed the existing highway to Broadway in Burlingame, but then took a more inland alignment past the San Francisco International Airport, and crossed the old road at South San Francisco, running just east of it to near the south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> at Sierra Point. Construction began inside San Francisco in 1950 and was completed in 1958; the new causeway across Candlestick Cove, connecting the completed section in South San Francisco with San Francisco, was dedicated in mid-1957. In 1951, the state legislature renamed the portion within San Francisco after James Lick, a California pioneer and philanthropist.|$|E

5|$|Shopham Lock {{was another}} where the lock cut was built across a large meander to the north. The bridge {{at the tail}} of the lock is built from red and grey brick, and has a single, round-headed arch. It dates from the {{construction}} of the navigation, and is virtually unaltered. Nearby, the Petworth Canal headed northwards to Haslingbourne Bridge. Below the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut,</b> the river is joined by the stream from Burton Mill Pond, which supplied an iron forge built in 1789. It is crossed by Shopham Bridge, built in the nineteenth century from red brick with grey headers and a parapet in stone, with three segmental arches. At Lower Fittleworth, there is another mill building, although it is unused and in poor condition. It was built in 1628 and enlarged in 1742. It stands in the grounds of the mill house, which was rebuilt in 1913. The lock cut ran along the south-western edge of the site. Fittleworth Bridge consists of a southern section, originally built in the sixteenth century, which was rebuilt between 1717 and 1739, and modified when the navigation was built, to enable boats to pass through the centre arch. A north section, adjacent to the millpond, dates from 1811-12.|$|E
5|$|Stamford Wharf was {{the upper}} limit of navigation, and was {{situated}} below Town Bridge, which carries the A43 road over the river at Stamford. There were buildings associated with the canal {{on both sides of}} the river, including a large warehouse next to the bridge, parts of which date from 1671, and which is Grade II listed. Barges followed the river down past the ruins of St Leonard's Priory, established in 1090 by the Benedictines, to Hudds Mill, where the cut began, on the north side of the mill. Hudds Mill Lock was almost at the start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut.</b> The canal flowed initially to the east, but turned to the north east to cross the River Gwash at right angles. It then entered Uffington Park, where the remains of the weir that regulated river levels at the crossing can still be seen. The Gwash now has much less flow than it did when the canal was active, since the construction of the reservoir at Rutland Water further upstream. The earthworks of the canal continue through the park.|$|E
5|$|The most {{familiar}} uses of diamonds today are as gemstones used for adornment, a use which dates back into antiquity, and as industrial abrasives for cutting hard materials. The dispersion of white light into spectral colors {{is the primary}} gemological characteristic of gem diamonds. In the 20th century, experts in gemology developed methods of grading diamonds and other gemstones based on the characteristics most important to their value as a gem. Four characteristics, known informally as the four Cs, are now commonly used as the basic descriptors of diamonds: these are carat (its weight), cut (quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> is graded according to proportions, symmetry and polish), color (how close to white or colorless; for fancy diamonds how intense is its hue), and clarity (how free is it from inclusions). A large, flawless diamond {{is known as a}} paragon.|$|E

5|$|The towpath {{continues}} to Rotherham Lock, where the Rotherham cut starts, but {{from here to}} Conisbrough, {{the only way to}} see the navigation is from a boat or from one of the bridges which cross it. To the north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> are the remains of the Greasbrough Canal, now culverted under the embankment of the A633 road. Eastwood lock marks the end of the Rotherham Cut, to be followed by Aldwarke Lock, {{in the shadow of the}} A6123 road bridge, and Kilnhurst flood lock, which marks the start of the Kilnhurst Cut. In Swinton, the stub of the Dearne and Dove Canal turns off to the left, and there are three more locks before the cut ends. Immediately following this, the River Dearne flows into the Don, and the towpath resumes, where the Dearne Way footpath ends.|$|E
5|$|With Audacious and Révolutionnaire lost in {{the dark}} behind them, both British and French fleets {{continued}} westwards towards the convoy rendezvous. At dawn on 29 May the British fleet saw Audacieux retiring to the east but did not follow, concentrating on the main French line {{with the hope of}} provoking a decisive engagement. Howe ordered his ships to pursue the enemy rear, and the British line was placed on a tack that was intended to cut through the French line and isolate and capture the ships east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut.</b> Captain Anthony Molloy in HMS Caesar was chosen to lead the attack as his ship was the fastest in the fleet, but the manoeuvre was a complete failure due to the inexplicable refusal of Molloy to close with the enemy. Instead, Caesar and HMS Queen opened fire on the rearmost French ships from a distance. The vans of the opposing fleets then engaged in a long-range broadside duel from 10:00. This inflicted mild damage on both sides, the worst hit being the French Montagnard.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} deal eliminated some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spending <b>cuts</b> {{required by}} <b>the</b> sequester by $45 billion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> scheduled {{to happen in}} January and $18 billion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> scheduled to happen in 2015. This did not decrease federal spending; instead, by reducing <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> spending <b>cuts</b> <b>the</b> government {{was going to be}} forced to make by the sequester, it actually increased government spending by $45 billion and $18 billion over what would have been spent had the sequester remained in place. Some Republicans wanted Speaker John Boehner to pursue a temporary measure that would cover <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> Fiscal Year 2014 at the level set by the sequester – $967 billion, rather than pass this budget deal, which would have $45 billion in additional spending.|$|R

Federal spending would thus be larger in these two years, but would be less in subsequent years until 2023, due to other provisions such as imposing sequester cuts in 2022 and 2023, raising airline fees and changing the pension contribution requirements of new federal workers. Paul Ryan said that the bill would lower the deficit by $23 billion overall. The increased spending for 2014 and 2015 was spread evenly between defense spending and non-defense discretionary spending, leaving <b>the</b> <b>cuts</b> to mandatory spending unchanged. The bill did not make any changes to entitlement programs.|$|R

25|$|The {{longer the}} cut, {{the greater the}} {{difference}} in river level between start and end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut,</b> so that a very long cut will need additional locks along its length. At this point, the cut is, in effect, a canal.|$|E
25|$|For cutting, {{the setup}} {{is a little}} different. A cutting torch has a 60- or 90-degree angled head with {{orifices}} placed around a central jet. The outer jets are for preheat flames of oxygen and acetylene. The central jet carries only oxygen for cutting. The use of several preheating flames rather than a single flame {{makes it possible to}} change the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut</b> as desired without changing the position of the nozzle or the angle which the torch makes with the direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cut,</b> as well as giving a better preheat balance. Manufacturers have developed custom tips for Mapp, propane, and polypropylene gases to optimize the flames from these alternate fuel gases.|$|E

40|$|The method {{comprises}} producing multiple first cuts {{simultaneously in}} a workpiece along first cutting lines using multiple first separating tools, and producing multiple second cuts simultaneously along second cutting lines using multiple second separating tools.
