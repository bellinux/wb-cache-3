40|$|From 2012 to 2016, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, {{provided}} {{support for}} countries to conduct small-scale demonstration {{projects for the}} introduction of the human papillomavirus vaccine, with the aim of determining which human papillomavirus vaccine delivery strategies might be effective and sustainable upon national scale-up. This study reports on the operational costs and cost determinants of different vaccination delivery strategies within these projects across twelve countries using a standardized micro-costing tool. The World Health Organization Cervical Cancer Prevention and Control Costing Tool was used to collect costing data, which were then aggregated and analyzed to assess the costs and cost determinants of vaccination. Across the one-year demonstration projects, the average economic and financial costs per dose amounted to US$ 19. 98 (standard deviation ± 12. 5) and US$ 8. 74 (standard deviation ± 5. 8), respectively. The greatest activities representing the greatest share of financial costs were social mobilization at approximately 30 % (range, 6 - 67 %) and service delivery at about 25 % (range, 3 - 46 %). Districts implemented varying combinations of school-based, facility-based, or outreach delivery strategies and experienced wide variation in vaccine coverage, drop-out rates, and service delivery costs, including transportation costs and per diems. Size of target population, number of students per school, and average length of time to reach an <b>outreach</b> <b>post</b> influenced cost per dose. Although the operational costs from demonstration projects are much higher than those of other routine vaccine immunization programs, findings from our analysis suggest that HPV vaccination operational costs will decrease substantially for national introduction. Vaccination costs may be decreased further by annual vaccination, high initial investment in social mobilization, or introducing/strengthening school health programs. Our analysis shows that drivers of cost are dependent on country and district characteristics. We therefore recommend that countries carry out detailed planning at the national and district levels to define a sustainable strategy for national HPV vaccine roll-out, in order to achieve the optimal balance between coverage and cost...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Vaccination is {{the most}} {{effective}} intervention strategy, and the provision of vaccination at fixed <b>posts</b> and <b>outreach</b> <b>posts</b> is a backbone of a sustainable vaccination system in developing countries. Access to immunization services is still limited in Cameroon. Several health districts in the west region have recorded new epidemic outbreaks, including the occurrence of a wild polio virus epidemic outbreak in 2013. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess immunization service delivery in one of the largest health districts in the west region of Cameroon; the Dschang Health district. Methods It was a cross sectional study conducted in 2013, in 42 health facilities covering 18 health areas in the Dschang Health District. Data were collected with questionnaires administered to health personnel face to face and an observation grid was used to assess resources and tools. Data were entered and analyzed in Epi Info. Results A total of 42 health facilities were assessed and 77 health personnel were interviewed. Overall, 29 (69. 0  %) health facilities organized one vaccination session monthly, 2 (4. 8  %) organized an outreach within the last 3  months prior to the study, 15 (35. 7  %) did not have a vaccination micro plan, 24 (32. 9  %) health personnel had not been supervised for at least the last 6  months prior to the study, 7 (16. 7  %) health facilities did not have a functional refrigerator, 1 (2. 4  %) did not have a vaccine carrier, 23 (54. 8  %) did not have a means of transport (vehicle or motorcycle) and 12 (28. 6  %) did not have an EPI guideline. The knowledge of health personnel on vaccine and cold chain management, and on diseases of the EPI under epidemiological surveillance was found to be limited. Conclusion The frequency and strategic provision of immunization services in the Dschang Health district is inadequate. Resource availability for an adequate provision of immunization services is insufficient. The knowledge of health personnel on vaccine management, cold chain management and on diseases under surveillance by the EPI is limited...|$|R
40|$|Multipurpose telecentres are {{considered}} as a phenomenon in international development efforts and have been {{an integral part of}} e-governance strategies of most developing countries. Their significance arises from the ascribed multipurpose nature and their potential to act as <b>outreach</b> <b>posts</b> for a range of services to rural households. The notion of multipurpose nature is taken for granted and there is very little evidence of the realisation of the expectations. The research commences by reviewing the underlying governance reforms and e-governance agendas. Further discussions highlight how the vast complexities associated with different services are trivialised {{in the light of the}} powerful arguments of New Public Management, good governance, managerial notion of integrated services delivery and technologically determinitic position on telecentres. The theoretical lens of the study is built by drawing on key concepts from intitutionalism, bureaucracy, and functional simplification and closure. The analytical capabilities and methodological apparatus of actor-network theory are also employed for the study. The research conceptualises services as heterogeneous actor-networks that include institutional actors. The role of institutions is considered, particularly that of bureaucracy by reflecting on its social foundations, organisational configurations and diversity taks. Using the concept of functional simplification and closure, the research highlights the need for human intermediation in providing services and thereby questions the simplistic notion of the multipurpose nature of telecentres. The research also highlights the institutional implications such as trust on intermediation. The arguments are made using an interpretive case study of e-governance services delivered through Akshaya telecentres in Malappuram district, Kerala, India. Case studies on two other specialised e-governance projects (offering specific sets of services) from Kerala were also undertaken to get insights on the phenomenon. The findings recommend the adoption of a multimode approach to service delivery. The research indicates that ICT interventions are more directly helpful to domain intermediaries than to rural households. The study also critically discusses the governance implications associated with outsourcing of goverment services through telecentres...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} a rural health {{district}} in the Dominican Republic found relatively high levels of public and out-of-pocket primary health expenditures and poor quality of care. The inefficient use of public resources and low efficacy were attributed to: (1) underutilization of health services, (2) low productivity of human and physical resources, which in turn were caused by poor managerial practices, shortages of medicines, dispersion {{of the population and}} the compulsory 1 -year rural social service required from all graduating physicians (known as pasantia in some Latin American countries and medicatura rural in others). Out-of-pocket health expenditures responded to unnecessary self-referrals and excessive self-medications. The findings suggest that the quality of care can be improved and the public and out-of-pocket expenditures reduced by: (1) the replacement of the social service (pasantia) by permanent physicians, (2) the organization of communal pharmacies and (3) the establishment of <b>outreach</b> health <b>posts.</b> It is argued that today in the Dominican Republic as in many other Latin American countries unemployed or underemployed physicians are willing to take permanent positions in rural areas. The study suggests that rural physicians need and will be willing {{to accept the fact that}} much of their medical training has no applicability to the rural setting. The retraining or recycling of rural physicians for their new health roles is discussed also. ...|$|R

This study examines the use of Facebook for Zika-related outreach and engagement by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Environmental Agency (NEA) from March 1, 2015 to September 19, 2016. Despite nearly equivalent <b>outreach,</b> MOH’s Facebook <b>posts</b> received more likes (µ= 3. 49) and shares (µ= 30. 11), whereas NEA’s posts received more comments (µ= 4. 55), with NEA posting mostly on prevention (N= 30) and MOH on situational updates (N= 24). Thematic analyses identified prevention-related posts as garnering the most likes (N= 1277), while update-related posts were most shared (N= 1, 059) and commented upon (N= 220). Outreach briefly ceased for two months after Singapore’s first imported case of Zika, but increased following the outbreak of locally-transmitted cases in August 2016. Public engagement was significantly higher during Zika, compared with prior Haze and Dengue outbreak. The results indicate the value of Facebook as a tool for rapid outreach during infectious disease outbreaks, and as a ‘listening’ platform for those managing the situation.

40|$|Rationale for the Study: The Gambia {{is a small}} West African {{state of}} about 10, 680 square {{kilometers}} {{with a population of}} just over 1. 2 million inhabitants. It is a densely populated country with approximately 97 people per square kilometer. The Gambia depends largely on agriculture, trade and tourism for her economy. It is ranked among the poorest countries in the world with a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of US $ 340. The Gambian government considers health as a key pillar to development and spending on the health sector has increased substantially over the years. The health share of the recurrent expenditure rose from 11. 5 % in 1998 to 13. 6 % in 2001 and in the same period public health expenditure as a proportion of GDP also rose from 1. 7 % to 3. 3 %. Access to health facilities is good with over 85 % of the population living within 3 kilometers of a primary health care or <b>outreach</b> health <b>post</b> and 97 % of the population within 5 kilometers. Levels of maternal mortality in the Gambia are unacceptably high estimated at 1, 050 per 100, 000 live births. Medical causes of maternal deaths are well documented. However, little attention is paid on the contributing factors to maternal deaths in the country. In an effort to prevent maternal deaths in the Gambia it is necessary to look at contributing factors, also known as “avoidable factors”. Objectives: To identify and describe the socio-cultural, economic and health service factors contributing to maternal deaths. Materials and Methods: A retrospective population-based study combining both qualitative and quantitative methods was used. Verbal autopsy and confidential inquiry techniques were utilized reviewing all maternal death cases that occurred in Upper and Central River Divisions of the Gambia between January to September 2002. Each case was reviewed following the “road to maternal death” concept. In all the cases the health records were retrieved and reviewed. Verbal autopsy was also performed on the majority of maternal deaths identified. Three reviewers performed independent classification of cause of death and contributing factors to these deaths. A descriptive analysis of the data was made and was presented in two separate papers: quantitative and qualitative. Results: A total of 42 maternal deaths were identified. Of these, 39 died at the referral hospital, one at a major health center, one {{on the road to the}} hospital and another one at home. In the same corresponding period a total of 876 live births were recorded at the hospital. This gives a hospital-based maternal mortality ratio of 4, 452 per 100, 000 live births. Direct obstetrical deaths accounted for 28 (67 %) of the cases. Hemorrhage was the most prominent cause of death accounting for 10 of the cases. Fourteen of the cases were indirect obstetric deaths. Anemia accounted for 12 out of those 14 deaths. All the cases identified contacted or were in contact with the health system when the obstetrical complication developed. Substandard health care for obstetrical referrals, low quality primary health care, obstructions in receiving urgent care and delay in reaching a medical facility were identified as contributing factors to these deaths. Verbal autopsy was performed in 32 cases. Applying the Three Delay Model in the analysis of the qualitative data generated from the key informants indicated a delayed decision to seek medical care in 7 of the cases. Twenty-seven in 32 of the women had delay in reaching an appropriate obstetric care facility once the decision to seek care was made. However, even after reaching an appropriate obstetric care facility, 31 out of the 32 cases had not received the obstetric care services they needed. Looking at the phases of delay cases, 7 of the 32 cases had all three delays; 21 in 32 experienced two phases of delays and 3 experienced only one type of delay. In only one case no delay could be associated with the death. Conclusion: Health service factors were the most frequently identified contributing factors to maternal deaths in this study. It is therefore believed that improving the quality of and accessibility to emergency obstetrical care services will significantly contribute to the reduction of maternal deaths in the area.

40|$|Rationale for the Study: The Gambia, a {{small and}} poor Country in West Africa. Health {{is one of the}} key pillars in the agenda of the Gambia government. Spending has been {{increased}} from 13. 6 % in 2001 to 4. 95 % in 2003. Public health expenditure also increases steadily to 3. 2 % in 2003. Expenditure on health per capita US$ 8 is only spent by the Government. Access to health facilities is good, with over 85 % of the population living within 3 kilometres of a primary health care or <b>outreach</b> health <b>post</b> and 97 % of the population within 5 kilometres. Despite the high Antenatal Care coverage of 96 %, only few deliveries take place in the health facilities. Skilled attendant at deliveries is estimated at 44 %. The majority of the deliveries take place at home attended by TBAs or a relative. Cost of Antenatal services is extremely low and it’s paid once during registration for the entire visit. Women with normal deliveries pay D 12. 50 (US$ 0. 45) and D 25. 00 (US$ 0. 90) respectively. Those with Caesarean Section (CS) pay D 50. 00 (US$ 1. 79). After delivery, they attend infant welfare clinic immediately after the naming ceremony. It is the same distance and they know the facilities well. However, the women do not use the institutions for delivery. Institutional delivery is very low, estimated at 30. 4 %. Objectives of the study: 1. To identify and describe the socio- demographic factors associated with not utilising health facility for delivery. 2. To identify and describe the economic factors associated with the low institutional deliveries. 3. To describe health services related factors contributing to the low utilization of health facility for deliveries. 4. To identify and describe cultural factors (if any) that act as a barrier to health facility deliveries. 5. To put forward recommendation for improved care and increased utilization of health institutions for delivery care and improved maternal health outcomes. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional design was used. Individual in-depth interview using a semi structured interview guide and a focus group discussion were used to collect information on women who have just delivered and have come to the clinic for registration of their infants for infant welfare clinic; immunization and growth monitoring in 2 of the health divisions WD (urban) and NBW (rural) in the Gambia. The women with live births were randomly selected from the MCH clinics, interviewed and followed back in the community for a focus group discussion. Results: A total of 391 women were interviewed in the quantitative study and 36 women participated in the focus group discussions. Four focus groups was performed; 2 in each division. The study revealed that cultural factors, attitude of health care providers, previous experiences with the health system, long waiting time, negligence of health care workers, alternative delivery services, transport and cost of receiving services and expectations are factors that influenced their utilization of health facilities for delivery. The individual in-depth interview revealed that place of delivery for first pregnancy in NBW was health facility 60 % and home 40. 6 % and WD place of delivery for first pregnancy was health facility 88 % and home 13 %. Those who delivered in health facility during their first pregnancy, (N 296) in both divisions, only 24 % delivered at home during their index pregnancy and 40 % delivered in health facility. In NBW 80 % did not receive any information on place of delivery. Of those who received information, 45 % delivered at home and 55 % delivered in HF. In WD, 42 % received information and 60 % did not receive information. Of those who received information, 18 % delivered at home and 82 % delivered in HF. The prominent danger signs that are the major causes of maternal death are not known. Bleeding before and after delivery which are very severe and are major causes of maternal death is only known by 14 (4. 4 %) and 3 (1. 0 %) respectively in both divisions. Conclusions: Cultural factors and health services factors which include staff attitude and lack of maternal education during ANC attendance were the most frequently identified contributing factors to the low Uterlisation of health institutions for delivery in this study...|$|R
