50|$|Less {{well known}} of the <b>oxides</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> is the trioxide, H2O3. Berthelot {{proposed}} {{the existence of this}} oxide in 1880 but his suggestion was soon forgotten as there was no way of testing it using the technology of the time. Hydrogen trioxide was prepared in 1994 by replacing the oxygen used in the industrial process for making hydrogen peroxide, with ozone. The yield is about 40 per cent, at -78 °C; above around -40 °C it decomposes into water and oxygen. Derivatives of hydrogen trioxide, such as F3C-O-O-O-CF3 ("bis(trifluoromethyl) trioxide") are known; these are metastable at room temperature. Mendeleev went a step further, in 1895, and proposed the existence of hydrogen tetroxide HO-O-O-OH as a transient intermediate in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide; this was prepared and characterised in 1974, using a matrix isolation technique. Alkali metal ozonide salts of the unknown hydrogen ozonide (HO3) are also known; these have the formula MO3.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Simultaneous {{measurements}} of the <b>oxides</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> and nitrogen made during the NASA Subsonic Assessment, Ozone and Nitrogen Oxide Experiment (SONEX) afforded an opportunity to study the coupling between these two important families throughout the free troposphere and lowermost stratosphere. Moreover, the suite of measurements made during the campaign was unprecedented in its completeness, thus providing a uniquely de-tailed picture of the radical photochemistry that drives oxidation and ozone production {{in this part of}} the atmosphere. On average, observed hydrogen oxides (HOx = OH + HO 2) agree well with both instantaneous and diel steady-state models; however, there is a persistent deviation of the observations that correlates with the abundance of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO 2) in the sampled air mass. Specifically, the observed HO • tends to exceed the model predictions in the presence of high NO • concentrations, byas much as a factor of 5 (> 500 pptv NOx), and is sometimes as little as half that expected by steady state at lower NOj levels. While many possibilities for these discrepancies are discussed, it is argued that an instrumental rtifact is not probable and that the discrepancy may bespeak a shortcoming of our understanding of HO • chemistry. The consistently elevated HO • in the presence of elevated NOx leads directly to greater ozone production than expected, thereby extending the NOx-limited regime of the upper troposphere. These results could thus have bearing on the predicted impacts of in-creasing NO • emissions into this region of the atmosphere from, for example, the growth of global air traffic...|$|E
40|$|In 1840, C. F. Schonbein {{recognized}} that the smell generated in several different electrical and chemical processes was a single substance. He named this substance "ozein" from the Greek for "to smell". This substance we know today as ozone. Several periods can be distinguished in the continued development of our understanding of ozone. Throughout the late 19 th century, the identity and properties of ozone were established and described. Ozone was recognized to be a constituent of normal air and tests were established to measure its concentration. Its disinfectant properties were recognized. New methods were developed for making ozone in the laboratory. In 1879, ultraviolet spectroscopic techniques were applied to the measurement of the solar spectrum and it was discovered by Comu that the spectrum was cut off at about 300 nm wavelength. Hartley suggested, based on laboratory measurements, that this cutoff was due to ozone in the atmosphere which he correctly asserted was somewhere in the upper atmosphere. This began the period of development of the amount and distribution of ozone throughout the atmosphere. In 1930, Chapman put forward the first theory of the formation and destruction of ozone. By the mid- 1960 s it was becoming obvious that {{the description of the}} chemical loss term was inadequate. By the early 1970 s the chemical destruction of ozone by the <b>oxides</b> <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> nitrogen, chlorine, and bromine was recognized as an essential element in the chemical balance determining the ozone concentration. Today, ozone is a broad research project which crosses the boundaries of traditional disciplines. Stratospheric ozone loss due to chlorofluorocarbons is a newsworthy item. The Antarctic ozone hole opens up every spring. The provisions of the Montreal Protocol were agreed upon by countries around the world and promise to reduce the future levels of ozone-destroying chlorine in the stratosphere. Ozone concentrations in polluted cities are a subject of local and national regulations to limit its potential for causing health problems and corrosive effects on materials. A lot is known about ozone but many new questions are still being developed...|$|E

But without insisting upon the highly probable inference, that when the Earth was in its first state of incandescence there were no chemical combinations at all, it will suffice our purpose to point to the unquestionable fact that the compounds that can exist at the highest temperatures, and which must, therefore, have been the first that were formed as the Earth cooled, are those of the simplest constitutions.

60|$|Before {{going on}} to show how organic {{progress}} also depends on the law that every force produces more than one change, we have to notice the manifestation of this law in yet another species of inorganic progress--namely, chemical. The same general causes that have wrought out the heterogeneity of the Earth, physically considered, have simultaneously wrought out its chemical heterogeneity. There {{is every reason to}} believe that at an extreme heat the elements cannot combine. Even under such heat as can be artificially produced, some very strong affinities yield, as, for instance, that of oxygen for hydrogen; and the great majority of chemical compounds are decomposed at much lower temperatures. But without insisting on the highly probable inference, that when the Earth was in its first state of incandescence there were no chemical combinations at all, it will suffice for our purpose to point to the unquestionable fact that the compounds which can exist at the highest temperatures, and which must, therefore, have been the first that were formed as the Earth cooled, are those of the simplest constitutions. The protoxides--including under that head the alkalies, earths, &c.--are, as a class, the most stable compounds we know: most of them resisting decomposition by any heat we can generate.

More heterogeneous, less stable, and therefore later in the Earth's history, are the deutoxides, tritoxides, peroxides, &c.; in which two, three, four, or more atoms of oxygen are united with one atom of metal or other element.

Without entering into qualifications for which space fails, we believe no chemist will deny it to be a general law of these inorganic combinations that, other things equal, the stability decreases as the complexity increases. When we pass to the compounds of organic chemistry, we find this general law still further exemplified: we find much greater complexity and much less stability. A molecule of albumen, for instance, consists of 482 ultimate atoms of five different kinds. Fibrine, still more intricate in constitution, contains in each molecule, 298 atoms of carbon, 49 of nitrogen, 2 of sulphur, 228 <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen,</b> and 92 <b>of</b> oxygen--in all, 669 atoms; or, more strictly speaking, equivalents. And these two substances are so unstable as to decompose at quite ordinary temperatures; as that to which the outside of a joint of roast meat is exposed. Thus it is manifest that the present chemical heterogeneity of the Earth's surface has arisen by degrees, as the decrease of heat has permitted; and that it has shown itself in three forms--first, in the multiplication of chemical compounds; second, in the greater number of different elements contained in the more modern of these compounds; and third, in the higher and more varied multiples in which these more numerous elements combine.|$|R

The present experiments were designed to determine whether in coronary arteries inhibition of tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis may favor nitric <b>oxide</b> synthase-catalyzed production <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide. METHODS AND RESULTS: Primary branches of canine left anterior descending artery were incubated for 6 hours in minimum essential medium in the presence or in the absence of the tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis inhibitor 2, 4 -diamino- 6 -hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP; 10 (- 2) mol/L). Arterial rings were suspended for isometric tension recording. Production of cGMP was measured by radioimmunoassay. Experiments were performed in the presence of indomethacin (10 (- 5) mol/L). During contractions to the thromboxane A 2 /prostaglandin H 2 receptor agonist U 46619 (10 (- 7) mol/L), calcium ionophore A 23187 (10 (- 9) to 10 (- 6) mol/L) caused endothelium-dependent relaxations. A nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (3 x 10 (- 4) mol/L), significantly inhibited these relaxations. In DAHP-treated arteries, relaxations to A 23187 and its stimulating effect on cGMP production were significantly reduced in the presence of catalase (1200 U/mL). By contrast, catalase did not exert any effect in rings incubated in the absence of DAHP. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of catalase on A 23187 -induced relaxations was abolished when coronary arteries were incubated in the presence of DAHP plus a liposoluble analogue of tetrahydrobiopterin, 6 -methyltetrahydropterin (10 (- 4) mol/L). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that hydrogen peroxide may be a mediator of endothelium-dependent relaxations in coronary arteries depleted of tetrahydrobiopterin. This initially compensatory response, triggered by a dysfunctional nitric oxide synthase, may represent an important mechanism underlying oxidative vascular injury...|$|R

40|$|The {{catalytic}} oxidation of ethane {{was carried out}} at 573 - 773 K over iron phosphate catalyst. The oxidation of ethane by oxygen produced only ethylene and carbon <b>oxides.</b> The co-feed <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> with oxygen remarkably accelerated the conversion of ethane. Ethanol and acetaldehyde were newly formed by co-feeding hydrogen. The partial oxidation of ethane to ethanol and acetaldehyde can also be achieved by using nitrous oxide as an oxidant. The co-feed <b>of</b> <b>hydrogen</b> with nitrous <b>oxide</b> increased the conversion of ethane and the yield to C- 2 oxygenates. The investigation on the reaction paths suggests that ethanol is the primary product in the oxidation of ethane with hydrogen-oxygen gas mixture and with nitrous oxide. Acetaldehyde and ethylene are produced through further oxidation and dehydration of ethanol, respectively. The highest yield obtained for C- 2 oxygenates was 4. 4 % (ethanol, 1. 4 %; acetaldehyde, 3. 0 %) at 673 K. The kinetic and mechanistic {{studies suggest that the}} oxidation of ethane proceeds by a similar reaction mechanism to the one proposed for the oxidation of methane. Oxygen is activated by the electrons and protons derived from hydrogen on the catalyst surface, generating a new oxygen species, probably adsorbed peroxide species, effective for the selective oxidation of ethane to ethanol. The same oxygen species can be generated from nitrous oxide by its reductive activation. Both kinetic results and isotopic effects on the conversion of ethane suggest that the dissociation of the C-H bond of ethane proceeds notably faster than the formation of the active oxygen species. In contrast with ethane, the rate of activation of methane was comparable to that of the generation of the active oxygen species. (C) 1997 Academic Press...|$|R
