The structure of the network can be unknown or known, and the <b>variables</b> can be <b>observable</b> or hidden in {{some or all of the}} data points. Consequently, there are four cases of learning Bayesian networks from data: known structure and <b>observable</b> <b>variables,</b> unknown structure and <b>observable</b> <b>variables,</b> known structure and unobservable variables and unknown structure and unobservable variables.

40|$|AbstractCooperative multiagent {{probabilistic}} inference {{can be applied}} {{in areas such as}} building surveillance and complex system diagnosis to reason about the states of the distributed uncertain domains. In the static cases, multiply sectioned Bayesian networks (MSBNs) have provided a solution when interactions within each agent are structured and those among agents are limited. However, in the dynamic cases, the agents’ inference will not guarantee exact posterior probabilities if each agent evolves separately using a single agent dynamic Bayesian network (DBN). Nevertheless, due to the discount of the past, we may not have to use the whole history of a domain to reason about its current state. In this paper, we propose to reason about the state of a distributed dynamic domain period by period using an MSBN. To reduce the influence of the ignored history on the posterior probabilities to a minimum, we propose to observe as many <b>observable</b> <b>variables</b> as possible in the modeled history. Due to the limitations of the problem domains, it could be very costly to observe all <b>observable</b> <b>variables.</b> We present a distributed algorithm to compute all <b>observable</b> <b>variables</b> that are relevant to our concerns.
