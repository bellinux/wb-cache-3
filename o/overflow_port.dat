50|$|Manzanillo is the state’s primary {{port and}} tourist destination. It's on the Pacific coast, {{less than two}} hour’s drive from the capital. Manzanillo is mostly popular with {{regional}} tourists and sports fishermen, {{but there have been}} efforts to broaden its appeal. The city is one of Mexico’s important Pacific ports, handing regional merchandise and acting as an <b>overflow</b> <b>port</b> for other ports from Mexico to Los Angeles. Most of the state’s recent economic development has been related to this port.|$|E

The gas man may also help pull old tires from the race car after lug nuts are loosened if the car does not need fuel or if the car needs little fuel and the gas man finishes his job before anyone else. Prior to the 2011 season, an additional gas man (the [...] "catch-can" [...] man) was allowed over the wall to hold a special can over the car's fuel system <b>overflow</b> <b>port</b> to collect any spilled fuel. NASCAR disallowed the catch-can man in 2011; now the fuel cans are self-venting to reduce spillage.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} transportation hub {{in the state}} is the port of Manzanillo, handling 91.3% of the shipping {{of the state and}} the immediate region. It also operates as an <b>overflow</b> <b>port</b> for the commercial and industrial zones of western Mexico, the Bajío area and the center of Mexico, but handles overflow from as far as Los Angeles. Most of the merchandise that passes through here is part of the trade between Mexico and Asia. The port infrastructure consists of two types of installations. One is artificial, located in the interior port of San Pedrito and the other located in the bay proper. The artificial structure is a tall dock with a length of 450 meters and 225 meters wide for a surface of 10,125m2. The Manzanillo port has a dock for cruise ships, and an average of 58 ships visit per year. Nearby are two large private marinas, one in Las Hadas and the other at Isla Navidad. The port area is not fully developed, with over 130 hectares reserved for expansion.|$|E

40|$|We present Spectrogram, {{a mixture}} of Markov-chains sensor for anomaly {{detection}} (AD) against web-layer (port 80) code-injection attacks such as PHP file inclusion, SQL-injection, cross-site-scripting, as well as memory layer buffer <b>overflows.</b> <b>Port</b> 80 is the gateway to many application level services and a large array of attacks are channeled through this vector, servers cannot easily firewall this port. Signature-based sensors are effective in filtering known exploits but cannot detect 0 -day vulnerabilities or deal with polymorphism and statistical AD approaches have mostly been limited to network layer, protocol-agnostic modeling, weakening their effectiveness. N -gram based modeling approaches have recently demonstrated success but the ill-posed nature of modeling large grams have thus far prevented exploration of higher order statistical models. In this paper, we provide {{a solution to this}} problem based on a factorization into Markov-chains and aim to model higher order structure as well as content for web requests. Spectrogram is implemented in a protocol-aware, passive, network-situated, but CGI-layered, AD architecture and we show in our evaluation that this model demonstrates significant detection results on an array of real world web-layer attacks, achieving at least 97 % detection rates on all but one dataset and comparing favorably against other AD sensors...|$|R
30|$|From Fig.  5, the {{hydrocyclone}} with {{a diameter}} of d 1  =  55  mm contain more water particles flowing from the <b>overflow</b> <b>port,</b> whereas the hydrocyclone with {{a diameter of}} d 1  =  70  mm present {{a small amount of}} water particles being expelled from the <b>overflow</b> <b>port</b> and water particles staying in underflow pipe for a longer time. This finding indicates that the pipe with a diameter of 70  mm exhibits a better separation effect. Therefore, the straight pipe of hydrocyclone must have an inner diameter of d 1  =  70  mm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Biochar is a {{valuable}} co-product with increasing agronomic and environmental values produced during pyrolysis, which is a thermochemical conversion process of biomass {{in the absence of}} oxygen. Accumulation of biochar in the bed may result in poor fluidization performance and product quality. The efficient removal of the separated biochar from the fluidized bed is therefore crucial for economical reasons. This thesis is structured in three sections. Section 1, provides an introduction and literature review on biomass pyrolysis covering the main types of processes and reactors focusing on fluidized bed technologies. It section addresses the mechanisms associated with mixing and separation processes in fluidized beds are briefly discussed. The significance of biochar recovery is also emphasized and the various current recovery methods are reviewed and discussed. Section 2 describes the methodology, the operating conditions and the variables investigated and measured in this work to generate the experimental data and ensure process reproducibility and accuracy experimental findings. Following this section, the section 3, addresses the experimental results and analysis leading to the conclusions and recommendations for future research directions. The primary objective of this research is to describe, through experimental investigations, the effects of geometrical and operating parameters on the separation efficiency and the yield of the recovered biochar in a cold simulator laboratory scale bubbling fluidized bed. A section of the bed simulates the pyrolysis reactor bed, is fluidized at high gas velocity to provide intense mixing, and a second section operates at a lower gas velocity to promote particle separation. Biochar is continuously fed to the well mixed zone to simulate the production in the reactor bed. An automated pulsating feeding inlet regulated by sleeve valves allowed continuous feeding of biochar while <b>overflow</b> <b>ports</b> in the separation section allowed for the continuous discharge of the biochar. The lab scale bubbling fluidized bed unit, made it feasible for continuous segregation and removal of biochar at an optimized separation efficiency range of 96. 40...|$|R
40|$|In {{distributed}} file systems, {{a well-known}} congestion collapse called TCP incast (Incast briefly) occurs because many servers almost simultaneously send {{data to the}} same client and then many packets <b>overflow</b> the <b>port</b> buffer of the link connecting to the client. Incast leads to throughput degradation in the network. In this paper, we propose three methods to avoid Incast {{based on the fact}} that the bandwidth-delay product is small in current data center networks. The first method is a method which completely serializes connection establishments. By the serialization, the number of packets in the port buffer becomes very small, which leads to Incast avoidance. The second and third methods are methods which overlap the slow start period of the next connection with the current established connection to improve throughput in the first method. Numerical results from extensive simulation runs show the effectiveness of our three proposed methods. ...|$|R
40|$|Switched Ethernet {{arose in}} the last decade as a means to {{increase}} global throughput with parallel switching paths, segment the network and create isolated collision domains, thus reducing the non-determinism of the original shared Ethernet. However, COTS Ethernet switches still suffer from a few drawbacks that affect negatively their real-time communication capabilities. For example, there can be <b>overflows</b> in <b>ports</b> queues with consequences across ports, priority levels and virtual LANs, and the number of priorities is too short for any kind of priority-based scheduling. Moreover, switches present extra latencies and jitter due to the need to interpret frame addresses and also due to different internal architectural solutions. In this paper we propose using the Flexible Time-Triggered communication paradigm to enhance the temporal behavior of Ethernet switches with respect to periodic streams. We explain the system architecture and we present a formulation of the global periodic traffic scheduling problem handled by the FTT master. Simulation and experimental results show the advantages of using such synchronized framework. 1...|$|R
