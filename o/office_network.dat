The Toggenburger Bank was founded in 1863 with an initial share capital of CHF 1.5million, and specialized as a savings and mortgage bank for individual customers, maintaining a branch <b>office</b> <b>network</b> in eastern Switzerland.|$|E

The closure met with local protests. Discount department store chain Boyes took over the property in 2012. Haldanes, a chain of about 20 supermarkets based on Ruston Road, went into administration.

2500|$|After 1948, {{the railway}} post <b>office</b> <b>network</b> began its decline {{although}} it remained the principal intercity mail transportation and distribution function within the Post Office Department (POD). There were 794 RPO lines operating over 161,000 miles of railroad in that year. [...] Only 262 RPO routes were still operating by January 1, 1962. [...] In 1942, the POD began {{experimenting with a}} highway version of the RPO to serve the same purposes along routes where passenger train service was not available. [...] These highway post office (HPO) vehicles were initially intended to supplement RPO service, but in the 1950s and 1960s, HPOs often replaced railway post office cars after passenger train service was discontinued. The last interurban RPO service was operated by Pacific Electric Railway on its route between Los Angeles and San Bernardino, California. When the post office made a controversial policy change to process mail in large regional [...] "sectional centers," [...] mail was now sorted by large machines, not by people, and the remaining railway post office routes, along with all highway post office routes, were phased out of service. In September 1967 the POD cancelled all [...] "mail by rail" [...] contracts, electing to move all First Class mail via air and other classes by road (truck) transport. This announcement had a devastating effect on passenger train revenues; the Santa Fe, for example, lost $35 million (US) in annual business, and led directly to the ending of many passenger rail routes.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} protocol-aware anomaly {{detection}} framework specifically designed for back <b>office</b> <b>networks</b> together with a new automatic method for feature selection that allows to dramatically reduce the false positive rate (FPR) without compromising the detection rate (DR). The system monitors SMB and MS-RPC (the main protocols in back <b>office</b> <b>networks)</b> and takes into consideration specific features of SMB such {{as the presence of}} file paths, which are noisy, yet contain information necessary to detect some attacks. As a part of the framework we introduce a new method to cut the FPR by carefully building and selecting the right set of features to be monitored. In back <b>office</b> <b>networks</b> this is a challenging task where manual selection requires carefully exploring the network traffic to choose from numerous potential features. Also features need to be resilient to irregularities in the traffic caused by human involvement. Our framework automates selection utilizing two new metrics to determine the ‘quality’ of a feature: stability, i. e. its robustness to false alarms and granularity, i. e. the relative amount of information contained. Our experiments show a significant improvement in FPR-DR trade-off when our framework is used to select features in detection of network-based exploits and malicious file accesses...|$|R
