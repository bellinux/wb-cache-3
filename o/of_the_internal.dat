30|$|To {{model the}} {{processor}} for the low-level analysis, an accurate documentation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> processor <b>internals</b> is needed.

Over time, due to reverse engineering and less competition with other processors, more information becomes available. This is probably another reason why WCET analysis is about 10 years behind the processor technology.|$|R

5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur.

The pKa values for dissociation of spermine protonated at one or other of the sites are examples of micro-constants.

5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only about one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> space inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The {{rest of the}} space is lined with the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore.

5|$|Germany and the Netherlands were {{eventually}} {{able to reach}} an agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings based upon their ideas for a battlecruiser, in return for a guarantee that all needed equipment would be ordered from German firms. With their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> layout, which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940. This is the last known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E

5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, they are called affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>internal</b> structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} tetrapods, the gastralia and ribs with uncinate processes, {{together}} with bony {{elements such as}} bony plates in the skin (osteoderms) and clavicles (collar bone), would have formed a sort of exoskeleton around the body, protecting the belly and helping to hold in the guts and inner organs. These anatomical details most likely evolved from structures involved in locomotion even before the vertebrates ventured onto land. The gastralia {{may have been involved}} in the breathing process in early amphibians and reptiles.
