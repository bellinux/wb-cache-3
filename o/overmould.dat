In this paper we discuss two proposed packaging processes for large scale manufacture of microfluidic systems. Design/methodology/approach In the first packaging process, polymer overmoulding of a microfluidic chip is used to form a fluidic manifold integrated with the device in a single step. The anticipated advantages of the proposed method of packaging are ease of assembly and low part count. The second process involves the use of low frequency induction heating (LFIH) for the sealing of polymer microfluidics. The method requires no chamber, and provides fast and selective heating to the interface to be joined. Findings Initial work with glass microfluidics has demonstrated feasibility for overmoulding through two separate sealing principles. One is using the <b>overmould</b> as a physical support structure and providing sealing using a compliant ferrule. The other relies on adhesion between the material of the <b>overmould</b> and the microfluidic device to provide a seal. As regards LFIH work on selection and structuring of susceptor materials is reported, together with analysis of the dimensions of the heat affected zone. Acrylic plates have been joined using a thin (< 10 μm) nickel susceptor providing a fluid seal that withstood a pressure of 590 kPa. Originality/value Microfluidic chips have until now been produced in relatively small numbers. To scale-up from laboratory systems to the production volumes required for mass markets, packaging methods need to be adapted to mass manufacture...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The Substrateless Packaging process was developed at Loughborough University as an alternative method of manufacturing electronics with an improved end-of-life materials recovery profile. The process involves injection moulding to <b>overmould</b> electronic components in thermoplastic polymers. Initial prototype samples manufactured in previous work exhibited undesirable small gaps around the embedded components after solidification and which {{were thought to be}} the result of adhesion problems between the thermoplastic <b>overmould</b> and components. The study reported here had the aims of determining quantitatively what factors affect adhesion, and to identify which thermoplastic polymers are most suitable for the process. Following a literature survey, six engineering thermoplastics, PC, PBT, PS, ABS, PA 6 and PMMA were chosen for study as overmoulding materials, and tin as the solid adherend. The literature survey also identified the mechanisms contributing to adhesion at the metal-thermoplastic interface in insert moulding as material properties, interfacial forces between the materials, wetting at the interface, temperature of the insert (consequently temperature at the interface) and insert moulding parameters. A methodology was designed to allow investigation of all these factors, with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) force-distance measurements being used to measure room temperature interfacial forces, high temperature contact angle for wetting, and pull-out strength tests on overmoulded tin-coated wire for overall system adhesion. Excellent repeatability was seen in the measurements obtained with all three experimental methods. Moldflow finite element simulations of the insert moulding process were also undertaken. For the AFM measurements tin particles were adhered to the probe with the aid of a Focused Ion Beam (FIB) apparatus. PA and PMMA interatomic interactions with tin were found to be noticeably stronger than the other polymers. From consideration of the different possible contributions to the measured forces, it was concluded that the trend of interatomic interactions obtained is due to a combination of electrostatic forces, capillary forces and dispersion forces acting between the materials tested. In the high temperature contact angle measurements it was observed that the contact angles for all the materials producing drops in equilibrium reduce monotonically with rise in temperature at the interface. The work of adhesion was calculated from the contact angles for PMMA using the Young-Dupre equation and values of surface tension from the literature. It was found that it does not increase monotonically with temperature as might be expected from the contact angles. The works of adhesion at 240 °C for all the materials were also calculated and it was found that the materials ranking for expected adhesive strength changed significantly from that expected from consideration of contact angle alone. In the pull out tests, except for PC, the breaking loads for the materials tested rise then fall with rise in temperature of the insert. It was observed that peak breaking load for the amorphous polymers ABS, PS and PMMA occurred for insert temperature just below Tg of the polymer, and for semi-crystalline polymers PA 6 and PBT it was just above Tg. The ranking of materials by maximum pull out strength was found to be consistent with the ranking by mechanical strength (tensile strength at yield) of the thermoplastics. The Moldflow simulations yielded the significant results that the thermoplastic melt comes in contact with the insert at relatively low pressure (less than 0. 6 MPa), and that the temperature of the melt near the insert drops to the temperature of the insert almost instantaneously on contact. Therefore it was concluded that the efficacy of holding pressure on assisting wetting of the insert by the thermoplastic melt may depend on the temperature of the insert interface. The results in terms of material rankings from both the material level tests (AFM force distance experiment and wetting at high temperature) did not correspond to the mechanical strength test results. It was therefore concluded that the choice of material for thermoplastic <b>overmould</b> cannot be made purely based on the material interactions at interface between tin and thermoplastics in solid or melt phase. It was also concluded that the observed variation in the pull-out strengths with temperature of the insert maintained during overmoulding, must be largely due to the thermo-mechanical properties of the material at the interface.

Leakage can be caused among other things by crack initiation within the polymer at sharp edges of the metal insert as a consequence of stress concentration. In order to reduce stress concentration the effect of metal inserts with rounded edges and the forming process to manufacture such inserts is investigated. Since typical sheet thicknesses for electronic components are 1 [*]mm and less the dimensions of the rounded edges are on the scale of micro features. The microforming operation of rounded edges is provided by open coining. The influence of varying part dimensions is investigated using FE-simulation. Furthermore, ideal rectangular insert shapes are compared to parts with sheared edge geometry.

With the increasing use of electronic control systems in automotive applications, the environments in which they are required to operate are becoming evermore demanding. For improved functionality and {{to reduce the number of}} interconnections it is desirable to place the electronic control units (ECUs) as close as possible to the sensors and actuators they interact with, and they can increasingly be found mounted on engine, transmission and chassis components. The electronics are therefore exposed to high/low temperatures, high humidity, vibration and corrosive fluids. In order to protect the electronics and maintain reliability in safety critical areas, great lengths are taken to mount the devices in ways that will prevent the ingress of moisture, cushion shocks and dissipate heat. Potting of electrical devices with thermosetting polymers has been a commonplace method to install a protective layer over the circuit assemblies, which are often mounted in separate boxes within the vehicle. However, with the drive to reduce vehicle weight and increase recyclability, there has been much interest in the use of <b>overmoulding</b> with thermoplastic polymers, not only to provide protection, but to enable the electronics to be mounted into a structural component of the vehicle thereby saving space and weight and eliminating a level of packaging. While this has been shown to be a practical way forward in terms of reliability, the recyclability of the thermoplastic polymer is compromised by the intermixed electronics that are hard to separate economically...|$|R
40|$|Many Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) require encapsulation, {{to prevent}} {{delicate}} sensor structures {{being exposed to}} external perturbations such as dust, humidity, touching, and gas pressure. An upcoming and cost-effective way of encapsulation is zero-level packaging or thin-film encapsulation. With this method, MEMS are already sealed during wafer processing. Thin-film encapsulation poses a number of challenges, in particular to hermeticity, mechanical robustness, and compatibility with the other fabrication steps. In this thesis, we have worked out the following aspects. 1) An analytical model for the strength of pillar-based thin-film encapsulations. The model provides guidelines for design. It is supported by experiments with high pressures and a commercial <b>overmoulding</b> process. 2) A tube-shaped Pirani gauge for measuring vacuum levels with a low detection limit and a very small footprint. It consists of a tube-shaped resistor that is buried in the silicon substrate. It {{can be used to}} monitor the hermeticity of a thin-film encapsulation in situ. Alternatively, it could be employed as a cost-effective stand-alone sensor in vacuum equipment. 3) A new analytical model for micromachined Pirani gauges. This model expresses the pressure range as a closed-form analytical function of the design variables like geometry and biasing. Furthermore it yields simplified expressions for performance parameters such as the sensitivity, output swing and power consumption. The model will be very useful to designers who need to trade off performance against the costs of chip area and biasing power. 4) The integration of the tube-shaped Pirani gauge inside micro-packages to test the hermeticity of the presented thin film approach. Packages containing Pirani tubes have been sealed by PECVD SiN. The vacuum level achieved is about 0. 7 kPa and it slightly changes over time. PECVD SiN showed good sealing property for thin-film packaging. 5) A new sealing technique for MEMS thin-film encapsulation employing the bimorph effect. It allows to perform the encapsulation step under arbitrary pressure conditions without unwanted deposition inside the micro-package. 6) A thin-film encapsulation process, employing LPCVD SiN as the structural layer. Two examples of application of the presented thin-film encapsulation approach were shown.

40|$|The {{world has}} seen an unrivaled spread of {{semiconductor}} technology into virtually {{any part of}} society. The main enablers of this semiconductor rush are the decreasing feature size and the constantly decreasing costs of semiconductors. The decreasing costs of semiconductors in general are caused by the smaller feature size, the higher yield and larger production volumes. This has made products containing semiconductors cheaper in production thus reaching a larger market. The smaller feature size enables more computing power in the same volume creating new markets and growing application areas. The increasing number of appliances using semiconductor components is also driving the fast growth of the market. The trend of miniaturization of electronic components also demands the miniaturization and integration of non-electrical functions to allow for large decreases in size, weight and possibly cost. Soon after the first semiconductors were developed the first Micro Electrical Mechanical Systems (MEMS) were also created. In the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s experiments with MEMS were done in lab environments. MEMS technology {{can be used to}} miniaturize non-electrical components thus enabling further system shrinkage and increased function density. The technologies, experiments and numerical simulations in this thesis provide MEMS designers with a design guideline in the creation process of new Wafer Level Thin Film Package (WLTFP) products as well as an overview of the most likely failure modes and high risk processes in the assembly. WLTFP’s are a miniature batch-process and wafer scale encapsulation method for MEMS that need space to move or hold a certain amount of gas. In the first chapters an overview of the most important processing steps in the production of WLTFP’s and the subsequent assembly steps needed to form a plastic encapsulated package is presented. Most common assembly steps included: wafer thinning, chip singulation, die-attach, wire bonding, <b>overmoulding</b> and saw, trim, mark & form. Wafer thinning is necessary to thin the chip to such a thickness that it will fit into the desired package. Chip singulation or dicing is commonly done by a diamond blade saw and makes separates the wafer into individual chips. Die-attach is the placement of the chip onto the carrier, for example a lead frame, by means of a glue. After dieattach connection the IO of the chip to the carrier can be done by wirebonding. After wire-bonding the package is overflowed by epoxy moulding compound to protect the chip inside from the environment. After finishing the package and marking it one has a complete product. In the creation process of a new MEMS product the design team is faced with a multi-scale, multi-physics and multi-timescale challenge. Nanometer dimensions can impact a millimeter size product and hours of operation can change a MEMS that performs microsecond measurements. To address this challenge an integrated design process is needed that covers the chip and wafer design as well as the package and all of the intermediate processes. An example of the influences from the package on the chip is calculated and shown in chapter three. In chapter four the properties of thin layers are investigated. In this investigation copper thin film are deposited on freestanding micro cantilevers. The samples are analyzed with white light interferometry to obtain the initial geometry properties and cantilever warpage. Using electrostatic pull-in to pull down the cantilever to the substrate the pull-in voltage is obtained. The stiffness of the two layer system can be derived from the pull-in voltage. Copper film thicknesses of 10 and 50 nanometer are measured and a size-dependant stiffness is proven. During the assembly of a WLTFP several failure modes are found. In the wafer thinning process the application of wafer thinning tape to the active side of the wafer can easily break many WLTFP’s. This can happen during the application or for example the removal of the tape. The placement of the wafer on dicing foil is also a potential risk as it leaves the MEMS exposed to the water jet of the dicing machine. Wire-bonding can be hazardous to MEMS sensitive to resonance, this risk can relatively easy be mitigated by calculation of eigenmodes and eigenfrequencies. The <b>overmoulding</b> process and the associated process pressure can be hazardous to for example membranes or large WLTFP’s due to the static pressure on the cavity. The numerical simulations developed in chapter five provide a toolbox to check for weak spots in the design and investigate changes by virtual prototyping instead of physical prototyping. The simulations also include wafer foil application and removal simulation. The use of cohesive zones allows for a detailed investigation of the loads on the WLTFP. In chapter six the interface properties of the wafer thinning foil are investigated by means of a peeling experiment combined with numerical simulations. The characterization method yields interface properties that serve as input for aforementioned numerical simulations. The Design of Experiments presented in chapter seven investigates the influence four major design choices on the likelihood of survival during assembly. The span of the WLTFP, the corner rounding radius, cap thickness and presence of a pillar are investigated. After all 18720 samples were evaluated a design guidelines was derived. The design guideline in combination with the numerical simulations provides the MEMS design community with tools during the chip-design stage. This aids to the integrated approach of designing new MEMS and reduces the time to market and number of design iterations needed. PMEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
