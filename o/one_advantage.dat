5|$|<b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> of this {{camera system}} {{is that it allows}} the game {{designers}} to use the language of film. Indeed, like filmmakers, they have the possibility to create a mood through camerawork and careful selection of shots. Games that use this kind of technique are often praised for their cinematic qualities.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> of {{this design}} {{was that the}} diodes created light around the same {{frequency}} as the laser glass' output, {{as compared to the}} white light flashtubes where most of the energy in the flash was wasted as it was not near the active frequency of the laser glass. This change increased the energy efficiency to about 10%, a dramatic improvement.|$|E
5|$|Virtually all the Turkish Army {{commander}}s, down {{to company}} commander level, were very experienced, being {{veterans of the}} Balkan Wars. But their command structure was weaker at the non-commissioned officer (NCO) level, with only one NCO in each company. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> that the Turkish Army had over the New Zealanders, at the time, was their hand grenades, which were not used by the British forces.|$|E

5|$|In DragonFly, each CPU {{has its own}} thread scheduler. Upon creation, threads are {{assigned}} to processors and are never preemptively switched from one processor to another; they are only migrated by the passing of an inter-processor interrupt (IPI) message between the CPUs involved. Inter-processor thread scheduling is also accomplished by sending asynchronous IPI messages. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> to this clean compartmentalization of the threading subsystem is that the processors' on-board caches in Symmetric Multiprocessor Systems do not contain duplicated data, allowing for higher performance by giving each processor in the system {{the ability to use}} its own cache to store different things to work on.|$|E
5|$|The Firefight game mode was a late {{addition}} to the game. Staffer Tim Williams built a prototype shortly after Halo 3 shipped, placing the player in {{a portion of a}} Halo 3 campaign map and fighting enemies. When development commenced on ODST, William's concept was adopted for the game and refined. Designer Lars Bakken described <b>one</b> <b>advantage</b> of the game mode as providing a more friendly multiplayer environment than hardcore players online. The designers reused the campaign scoring and medal system from Halo 3 to add a competitive edge.|$|E
5|$|Britain {{considered}} {{the selection of}} Rolls-Royce to develop the advanced engine for the MRCA to be essential, and was strongly opposed to adopting an engine from an American manufacturer, {{to the point where}} the UK might have withdrawn over the issue. In September 1969, Rolls-Royce's RB 199 engine was selected to power the MRCA. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> over the US competition was that a technology transfer between the partner nations had been agreed; the engine was to be developed and manufactured by a joint company, Turbo-Union. The programme was delayed by Rolls-Royce's entry into receivership in 1971; the nature of the multinational collaboration process helped avoid major disruption of the Tornado programme. Research from the supersonic airliner Concorde contributed to the development and final design of the RB.199 and of the engine control units.|$|E

5|$|Deliveries of 1972 stock enabled 1938 {{stock to}} be withdrawn, and several cars were {{converted}} {{for use as}} ballast motor cars. The task was more complicated than for earlier stock, as 1938 units had compressors mounted on the trailer cars. The motor cars therefore had to be fitted with compressors, and the couplings were changed from Wedgelock to Ward type. The first four were numbered L140 to L143, and the conversion was carried out at Acton Works in 1972. Another six were converted, two in 1975, two in 1976, and the final two in 1977, which were numbered L144 to L149. L151 and L152 were converted in 1978, and were additionally fitted with weed killing equipment. Another four were added in the same year, numbered L153 to L156. Although the ballast motor cars were normally worked in pairs, some engineering trains had a ballast motor car {{at one end and}} a battery locomotive at the other. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> of the ballast motor cars over battery locomotives was that the interiors could be used by personnel and for storing small tools, although they were less powerful, and could only work when the traction current was switched on. By 2002, all except the weed killing pair had been withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the New Meadowlands Stadium opened, {{replacing}} Giants Stadium. The {{new stadium}} is a 50/50 {{partnership between the}} Giants and Jets, and while the stadium {{is owned by the}} New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority on paper, the two teams jointly built the stadium using private funds, and administer it jointly through New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation. The Giants had previously planned a $300-million renovation to the Meadowlands, before deciding in favor of the new stadium which was originally estimated to cost approximately $600 million, before rising to an estimated cost of $1.2 billion. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> gained by owning the stadium is that the teams saved considerable money in tax payments, leasing the land from the state at a cost of $6.3 million per year. The state paid for all utilities, including the $30 million needed to install them. Both teams received $150 million loans from the NFL to pay for construction of the stadium. Representatives from the league's teams voted 30–2 in favor of the loan.|$|E
5|$|Within 24 hours, British commanders {{were able}} to {{concentrate}} a force of 50,000 men in the Romani area, a three to <b>one</b> <b>advantage.</b> This force included the two infantry divisions – the 52nd and the newly arrived 42nd – four mounted brigades, two {{of which had been}} on active duty since 20 July, and two heavily engaged on the front line the day before, and may have included the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, although it was still at Hill 70, and the Mobile Column at Hod el Bada. At this time, command of the 5th Mounted Brigade passed from the Anzac Mounted Division to the infantry division; the 42nd Division, it being suggested that orders required the Anzac Mounted Division to remain in position, and that the 3rd Light Horse Brigade alone was to make a flank attack.|$|E

5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. <b>One</b> <b>advantage</b> of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E
