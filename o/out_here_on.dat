25|$|The road to Harold's Grange {{continues}} southward from Loreto Abbey, past {{some very}} old houses, {{which have been}} restored in recent years. The first is Snugborough, which has its gable end to the road. The next is Washington Lodge, its attractive 18th century facade hidden by a shrubbery. In recent years new avenues have been laid <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> {{both sides of the}} road. Barton Drive, on the left, occupies the site of a house named Barton Lodge (occupied by William Conlan, a brewer in Dublin, until his death in 1829 - his daughter married into the local Hodgens family, who in the 1870s donated the lands for the Church of the Annunciation). On the other side is Silveracre, once the home of Dr Henthorn Todd, Professor of Hebrew in T.C.D., who was connected by marriage to the Hudson family of the adjoining Hermitage estate. He was a well known Irish scholar and was the editor and translator of a number of Irish documents as well as the author of a life of St Patrick. He died here in 1869. About the middle of the last century the name of the house was changed to Silverton but it was later reverted to the original Silveracre. Most of the land is now built on. It was also the home {{in the early part of}} twentieth century of Surgeon Croly, who founded Baggot St Hospital.|$|E
500|$|RCA Records {{executives}} {{had initially}} chosen [...] "When I Met You" [...] (2016) {{to be the}} album's second single, but Fantasia had disagreed with the label's decision, preferring to release [...] "Sleeping with the One I Love" [...] instead. The singer said that RCA {{did not want to}} promote the song as they felt it was [...] "too churchy", but she had responded: [...] "No, it’s the next single. I’m the one <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> stages and connecting with the people." [...] She proceeded to conduct polls during a series of radio interviews, asking listeners to choose which track they wanted to be released. Ultimately, they voted for [...] "Sleeping with the One I Love", which was released as the second single instead of [...] "When I Met You". [...] "When I Met You" [...] would later be released as the record's third and final single on January 17, 2017.|$|E
500|$|... "Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{praise from}} critics. Entertainment Weekly gave the episode an [...] "A–", noting that [...] "one {{has to wonder}} to what extent this episode is intended as information, {{and to what extent}} sheer entertainment". Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club spoke positively of the episode, saying [...] "I love this ... and watching it now, I still do". He ultimately gave the episode an [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "'Musings' is great because it transforms CSM from a living ghost into the walking dead—still horrifying, still dangerous, but pitiable just the same". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, named the episode [...] "one of The X-Files true masterpieces" [...] and awarded it five stars out of five. The two praised Morgan and Wong's combination of mythological story elements with more dry and dark humor. Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson wrote positively of the ambiguousness of the episode's authenticity, noting that [...] "the answers that the viewers are craving are handed <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> such a large plate, you can only take them as a delicious parody." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a glowing review and awarded it four stars out of four. She praised the way that the viewer is able to see the [...] "barren emotional landscape in which the Cigarette Smoking Man dwells" [...] via the [...] "tone of the script". Furthermore, Vitaris applauded the Forrest Gump-esque rant, calling it [...] "a comic high point of verbal venom".|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{nominated}} for Best Metal Performance at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. When asked for his thoughts on the nomination, King revealed {{that he did not}} [...] "even care", and noted that Slayer fans [...] "don't give a shit and that's {{the most important thing to}} me". The interviewer expressed his surprise at the nomination given Slayer's [...] "inflammatory" [...] lyrics, to which King replied, [...] "That would be the coolest thing, you know? To win with the shit we write about." [...] The ceremony was held on February 11, 2007, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, with Slayer competing against Mastodon, Lamb of God, Ministry and Stone Sour. Slayer won the Best Metal Performance Grammy award, although the band was unable to attend because of a conflicting North American headlining tour. Araya commented about the win from a hotel room in Columbus, Ohio: [...] "Jeff [...] and I put a lot into 'Eyes of the Insane' so we're thrilled that the Grammy voters took the time to listen to it, and then vote for it. We're <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> the road and we're all really, really happy." [...] King disagreed, deeming the song [...] "one of the poorest representations of us [...] on the record [...] ". He further said that, if given the decision, he would have chosen the controversial track [...] "Jihad" [...] to represent Slayer from their ninth album Christ Illusion. Critical of the Recording Academy, King said, [...] "Realistically, I think people on the academy who vote pick the household name ... And that's what we are." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1990 Powell {{received}} his highest career achievement, the Pulitzer Prize in Music, {{for his work}} [...] In a Los Angeles Times interview, Powell expressed complete surprise: [...] "Being <b>out</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> the coast, {{far away from the}} whole Eastern establishment to which the Pulitzer is connected – that made me a remote prospect. I just didn't expect it." [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Powell related the story of how Duplicates came from his service in World War II and an anecdote he heard in Paris about Claude Debussy's search for perfect music. That, Powell, stated was his goal for Duplicates. The work, commissioned in 1987 for the Los Angeles Philharmonic by music patron Betty Freeman, took Powell more than two years to complete. It was made even more difficult as his muscular dystrophy, previously affecting only his legs, began to afflict his arms and thus his ability to play the piano.|$|E
