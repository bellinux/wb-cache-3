5|$|Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a {{condition}} in which dentin does not form properly and is sometimes associated with <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been reports in other genetic conditions, such as <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> type 1, {{autosomal}} dominant polycystic kidney disease and pseudoxanthoma elasticum, α1 antitrypsin deficiency and hereditary hemochromatosis, but evidence for these associations is weaker. Genetic studies in other connective tissue-related genes have mostly yielded negative results. Other abnormalities to the blood vessels, such as fibromuscular dysplasia, {{have been reported in}} a proportion of cases. Atherosclerosis does not appear to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> {{known as}} brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone {{disorder}} {{which can be}} lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in Type-I collagen, which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen's triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new quantum mechanical method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen. Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.|$|E

25|$|Bisphosphonates {{have been}} used to reduce {{fracture}} rates in children with the disease <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> and to treat otosclerosis by minimizing bone loss.|$|E
25|$|Other {{metabolic}} bone {{diseases such}} as Paget's disease, osteomalacia, osteopetrosis and <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta.</b> Stress fractures may occur in the hip region with metabolic bone disease.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the {{incidence}} of <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> {{is estimated to be}} one per 20,000 live births. An estimated 20,000 to 50,000 people are affected by OI in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The uses of bisphosphonates {{include the}} {{prevention}} and treatment of osteoporosis, Paget's disease of bone, bone metastasis (with or without hypercalcaemia), multiple myeloma, primary hyperparathyroidism, <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> fibrous dysplasia, and other conditions that exhibit bone fragility.|$|E
25|$|Several {{inherited}} disorders {{have been}} linked to osteoporosis. These include <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> Marfan syndrome, hemochromatosis, hypophosphatasia (for which it is often misdiagnosed), glycogen storage diseases, homocystinuria, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, porphyria, Menkes' syndrome, epidermolysis bullosa and Gaucher's disease.|$|E
25|$|A {{family with}} {{recessive}} <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> {{has been reported}} to have a mutation in the TMEM38B gene on chromosome 9. This gene encodes TRIC-B, a component of TRIC, a monovalent cation-specific channel involved in calcium release from intracellular stores.|$|E
25|$|PEDF, {{a protein}} with many functions, has been {{suggested}} to play a clinical role in choroidal neovascularization, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, diabetic macular edema, <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> and cancer. As an antiangiogenic protein, PEDF may help suppress unwanted neovascularization of the eye. Molecules that shift the balance towards PEDF and away from VEGF may prove useful tools in both choroidal neovascularization and preventing cancer metastasis formation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> (OI), {{also known}} as brittle bone disease, {{is a group of}} genetic {{disorders}} that mainly affect the bones. It results in bones that break easily. The severity may be mild to severe. Other symptoms may include a blue tinge to the whites of the eye, short height, loose joints, hearing loss, breathing problems, and problems with the teeth. Complications may include cervical artery and aortic dissection.|$|E
25|$|Although oral bisphosphonates {{are more}} {{convenient}} and cheaper, {{they are not}} absorbed as well, and intravenous bisphosphonates are generally more effective, although this is under study. Some studies have found oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as oral alendronate and intravenous pamidronate, equivalent. In a trial of children with mild OI, oral risedronate increased bone mineral densities, and reduced nonvertebral fractures. However, it did not decrease new vertebral fractures. A Cochrane review in 2016 concluded that though bisphosphonates seem to improve bone mineral density, it is uncertain whether {{this leads to a}} reduction in fractures or an improvement in {{the quality of life of}} individuals with <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the cause of aortic insufficiency, is often due to the aortic root {{dilation}} (annuloaortic ectasia), which is idiopathic in over 80% of cases, but otherwise may result from aging, syphilitic aortitis, <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> aortic dissection, Behçet's disease, reactive arthritis and systemic hypertension. Aortic root dilation {{is the most common}} cause of aortic insufficiency in developed countries. Additionally, aortic insufficiency has been linked to the use of some medications, specifically medications containing fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine isomers and dopamine agonists. Other potential causes that affect the valve directly include Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In acute cases of aortic insufficiency, the main causes are infective endocarditis, aortic dissection or trauma.|$|E

500|$|In Philadelphia in 1961, Elijah Price is {{born with}} Type I <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> a rare disease that renders sufferers' bones {{extremely}} fragile {{and prone to}} fracture. As revealed later in flashbacks, Elijah—who grows up to become a comic-book art dealer—develops a theory, based on the comics he has read during his many hospital stays, that if he represents extreme human frailty, there must be someone [...] "unbreakable" [...] at the opposite extreme.|$|E
500|$|The {{structure}} of the disease-linked mutant of antichymotrypsin (L55P) revealed another, inactive [...] "δ-conformation". In the δ-conformation, four residues of the RCL are inserted {{into the top of}} β-sheet A. The bottom half of the sheet is filled as a result of one of the α-helices (the F-helix) partially switching to a β-strand conformation, completing the β-sheet hydrogen bonding. It is unclear whether other serpins can adopt this conformer, and whether this conformation has a functional role, but it is speculated that the δ-conformation may be adopted by Thyroxine-binding globulin during thyroxine release. The non-inhibitory proteins related to serpins can also cause diseases when mutated. For example, mutations in SERPINF1 cause <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> type VI in humans.|$|E
500|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{or unusual}} body features {{are not uncommon}} among Carnivàle actors. Michael J. Anderson (Samson) has <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> a genetic bone disorder that leaves him at a size of 3ft7 (109cm), while Matthew McGrory (Giant) stood at 7ft6 (228cm) because of hyperpituitarism. Bree Walker (Sabina) has ectrodactyly, a rare genetic disorder that results in fused fingers and toes; she approached the producers in the second season to let her play a [...] "lobster gal". Several actors for one-time characters like the lobster gal in [...] "Hot and Bothered" [...] and Percy The Praying Mantis in [...] "The Road to Damascus" [...] were also cast for their respective real-life disabilities. Cameron Clapp (Management) had lost an arm and both legs in a train accident {{at the age of}} 15. Daniel Browning Smith (Rollo the Rubberboy) holds two Guinness World Records for his body-bending abilities. The actors playing the roles of the conjoined twins (Karyne and Sarah Steben, identical twins and real-life trapezists), Lila the Bearded Lady (Debra Christofferson) and Gecko the Lizard Man (John Fleck) are performers without genetic aberrances whose appearances were altered through makeup and prosthetics.|$|E

2500|$|Achondroplasia {{is one of}} 19 {{congenital}} {{conditions with}} similar presentations, such as <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> multiple epiphyseal dysplasia tarda, achondrogenesis, osteopetrosis, and [...] thanatophoric dysplasia. This makes estimates of prevalence difficult, with changing and subjective diagnostic criteria over time. One detailed and long-running study in the Netherlands found that the prevalence determined at birth was only 1.3 per 100,000 live births. Another study {{at the same time}} found a rate of 1 per 10,000.|$|E
2500|$|A bone {{fracture}} [...] (sometimes abbreviated FRX or Fx, Fx, or #) {{is a medical}} condition {{in which there is}} a damage in the continuity of the bone. A {{bone fracture}} may be the result of high force impact or stress, or a minimal trauma injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, bone cancer, or <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture.|$|E
2500|$|Scoliosis {{associated}} with known syndromes is often subclassified as [...] "syndromic scoliosis". Scoliosis can be {{associated with}} amniotic band syndrome, Arnold–Chiari malformation, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, cerebral palsy, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, connective tissue disorders, muscular dystrophy, familial dysautonomia, CHARGE syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hyperflexibility, [...] "floppy baby" [...] syndrome, and other variants of the condition), fragile X syndrome, Friedreich's ataxia, hemihypertrophy, Loeys-Dietz syndrome, Marfan's syndrome, nail–patella syndrome, neurofibromatosis, <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> Prader–Willi syndrome, proteus syndrome, spina bifida, spinal muscular atrophy and syringomyelia.|$|E
2500|$|At age 13, Toulouse-Lautrec {{fractured}} {{his right}} femur. At age 14, he fractured his left. The breaks did not heal properly. Modern physicians attribute this to an unknown genetic disorder, possibly pycnodysostosis (sometimes known as Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome), or a variant disorder {{along the lines}} of osteopetrosis, achondroplasia, or <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta.</b> Rickets aggravated by praecox virilism has also been suggested. Afterwards, his legs ceased to grow, so that as an adult he was extremely short (...) [...] He developed an adult-sized torso, while retaining his child-sized legs. Additionally, he is reported to have had hypertrophied genitals.|$|E
2500|$|The condition, or {{types of}} it, has had various other names {{over the years}} and in {{different}} nations. Among some of the most common alternatives are Ekman-Lobstein syndrome, Vrolik syndrome, and the colloquial glass-bone disease. The name <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> dates to at least 1895 and has been the usual medical term in the 20th century to present. The current four type system began with Sillence in 1979. An older system deemed less severe types [...] "osteogenesis imperfecta tarda" [...] while more severe forms were deemed [...] "osteogenesis imperfecta congenita." [...] As this terminology did not differentiate well between the types, and all forms of osteogenesis are congenital, this naming convention has since fallen out of favour.|$|E
50|$|Lin {{suffers from}} <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> a genetic bone {{disorder}} that hinders normal growth of bone and bodily height. According to the Guinness Book of World Records he is 67.5 cm (2 ft 2.58 in) tall. He {{is the founder}} of the <b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>Imperfecta</b> Association.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> type I: <b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> is {{the most}} common {{disorder}} caused by mutations in this gene. Mutations that inactivate one of the two copies of the COL1A1 gene cause <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> type I. The mutated copy of the gene does not produce any pro-alpha1(I) collagen chains. Because only one copy of the gene is directing the cell to make pro-alpha1(I) chains, cells from people with this disorder make only half of the normal amount of type I collagen, which results in bone fragility and other symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> type II: Many {{different}} types of mutations in the COL1A1 gene can cause <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> type II. These mutations range from missing pieces of the COL1A1 gene to amino acid substitutions, in which the amino acid glycine is replaced by another amino acid in the protein strand. Sometimes {{one end of the}} gene (called the C-terminus) is altered, which interferes with the association of the protein strands. All of these changes prevent the normal production of mature type I collagen, which results in this severe condition, type II <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta,</b> type IV: Several {{different}} types of mutations in the COL1A1 gene cause <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta</b> type IV. These mutations may involve missing pieces of the COL1A1 gene or changes in base pairs (the building blocks of DNA). These gene alterations result in a protein that is missing segments or has amino acid substitutions; specifically, the amino acid glycine is replaced by another amino acid. All of these changes interfere {{with the formation of}} the mature triple-stranded collagen molecule and prevent the production of mature type I collagen, which results in type IV <b>osteogenesis</b> <b>imperfecta.</b>|$|E
