5|$|Galileo had alienated one of {{his biggest}} and most {{powerful}} supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 <b>or</b> <b>ever</b> intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.|$|E
5|$|Although a Liberal {{by family}} {{heritage}} and disposition, Primrose never sought public office, <b>or</b> <b>ever</b> actively participated in politics. On September 10, 1936, {{on the advice}} of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, Primrose was appointed to the office of Lieutenant Governor of Alberta by Governor General John Buchan, succeeding William L. Walsh, his old friend. He was sworn in on October 1, 1936. During his time as Lieutenant-Governor, Primrose and his wife resided in Government House, however, during this time, he was plagued by illness, therefore making him essentially unable to fulfill his duties of office, remaining in medical care from October 19, 1937 until his death. Most of his duties were carried out by his wife, Lily, who hosted the 1937 New Year's Day reception at Government House, and served as an honorary officer of the Royal Alexandra Hospital Women's Auxiliary. Public functions were also attended by others family members, assisting in the absence of Primrose. On February 25, 1937, the Speech from the Throne was read by Horace Harvey, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta, due to Primrose's illness.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} prolific, versatile, and {{universal}} composers of the late Renaissance, Lassus wrote over 2,000 works in all Latin, French, Italian and German vocal genres known in his time. These include 530 motets, 175 Italian madrigals and villanellas, 150 French chansons, and 90 German lieder. No strictly instrumental music by Lassus is known to survive, <b>or</b> <b>ever</b> to have existed: an interesting omission for a composer otherwise so wide-ranging and prolific, during an age when instrumental music was becoming an ever-more prominent means of expression, all over Europe. The German music publisher Adam Berg dedicated 5 volumes of his Patrocinium musicum (published from 1573–1580) to Lassus' music.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} {{important}} was the liberation of the socii from the perpetual intertribal warfare of the pre-hegemonic peninsula. Endemic chaos {{was replaced by the}} pax Romana. Each socius' remaining territory was secure from aggression by neighbours. As warfare between socii was now prohibited, inter-social disputes were settled by negotiation <b>or,</b> <b>ever</b> more frequently, by Roman arbitration. The confederation also acted as the peninsula's defender against external invasion and domination. Gallic invasions from the North were, from 390 BC when the Senones Gauls destroyed Rome, seen as the most serious danger and continued into the 1st century BC. Many were so large that they could only realistically be turned back by a common effort of all Italians, organised by the confederation. The Romans even coined a specific term for such a mobilisation: the tumultus Gallicus, an emergency levy of all able-bodied men, even men over 46 years of age (who were normally exempt from military service). During the 3rd century BC, the confederation successfully repulsed the invasion of Pyrrhus and of Hannibal, which threatened to subject the whole peninsula to Greek and Punic domination respectively. The last such levy was as late as 60 BC, on the eve of Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul itself.|$|E

40|$|Objective. We {{examined}} {{the hypothesis that}} foetal exposure to maternal passive smoking is associated with childhood asthma, allergic rhinitis, and eczema. Methods. The study was a population-based cross-sectional survey of Hong Kong Chinese children aged ≤ 14 years carried out in 2005 to 2006. Results. Foetal exposure to maternal passive smoking {{was significantly associated with}} wheeze <b>ever</b> (<b>OR</b> 2. 05; 95 % CI 1. 58 – 2. 67), current wheeze (OR 2. 06; 95 % CI 1. 48 – 2. 86), allergic rhinitis <b>ever</b> (<b>OR</b> 1. 22; 95 % CI 1. 09 – 1. 37), and eczema <b>ever</b> (<b>OR</b> 1. 61; 95 % CI 1. 38 – 1. 87). Foetal exposure to maternal active smoking was significantly associated with asthma <b>ever</b> (<b>OR</b> 2. 10; 95 % CI 1. 14 – 3. 84), wheeze <b>ever</b> (<b>OR</b> 2. 46; 95 % CI 1. 27 – 4. 78), and current wheeze (OR 2. 74; 95 % CI 1. 24 – 6. 01) but not with allergic rhinitis <b>ever</b> (<b>OR</b> 1. 01; 95 % CI 0. 70 – 1. 46) <b>or</b> eczema <b>ever</b> (<b>OR</b> 1. 38; 95 % CI 0. 87 – 2. 18). The dose response relationship between wheeze ever and current wheeze with increasing exposure, from no exposure to maternal passive smoking and then to maternal active smoking, further supports causality. Conclusion. There is significant association between foetal exposure to maternal passive smoking and maternal active smoking with childhood asthma and related atopic illnesses. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential causal relationship...|$|R
