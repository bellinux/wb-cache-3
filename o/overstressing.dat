5|$|A {{year after}} {{entering}} commercial service, the Comets began suffering problems, {{with three of}} them breaking up during mid-flight in well-publicised accidents. Two of these {{were found to be}} caused by catastrophic failure resulting from metal fatigue in the airframes, not well understood at the time. The other one was due to <b>overstressing</b> of the airframe during flight through severe weather. The Comet was withdrawn from service and extensively tested to discover the causes of the fatigue failures. Design flaws, including dangerous stresses at the corners of the square avionics windows and installation methods, were ultimately identified. As a result, the Comet was extensively redesigned with oval windows, structural reinforcement, and other changes. Rival manufacturers meanwhile heeded the lessons learned from the Comet while developing their own aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of dynamic earthquake rupture require an artificial initiation procedure, {{if they are}} not integrated in long-term earthquake cycle simulations. A widely applied procedure involves an ‘overstressed asperity’, a localized region stressed beyond the static frictional strength. The physical properties of the asperity (size, shape and <b>overstress)</b> may significantly impact rupture propagation. In particular, to induce a sustained rupture the asperity size needs to exceed a critical value. Although criteria for estimating the critical nucleation size under linear slip-weakening friction have been proposed for 2 -D and 3 -D problems based on simplifying assumptions, they do not provide general rules for designing 3 -D numerical simulations. We conduct a parametric study to estimate parameters of the asperity that minimize numerical artefacts (e. g. changes of rupture shape and speed, artificial supershear transition, higher slip-rate amplitudes). We examine the critical size of square, circular and elliptical asperities as a function of asperity <b>overstress</b> and background (off-asperity) stress. For a given <b>overstress,</b> we find that asperity area controls rupture initiation while asperity shape is of lesser importance. The critical area obtained from our numerical results contrasts with published theoretical estimates when background stress is low. Therefore, we derive two new theoretical estimates of the critical size under low background stress while also accounting for <b>overstress.</b> Our numerical results suggest that setting the asperity <b>overstress</b> and area close to their critical values eliminates strong numerical artefacts even when the <b>overstress</b> is large. We also find that properly chosen asperity size or <b>overstress</b> may significantly shorten the duration of the initiation. Overall, our results provide guidelines for determining the size of the asperity and <b>overstress</b> to minimize the effects of the forced initiation on the subsequent spontaneous rupture propagation...|$|R
25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the accident had been caused by the baggage door becoming lodged {{on the leading edge}} of the right tailplane after it had opened and detached. This changed the aircraft's aerodynamic characteristics so that it became uncontrollable. This in turn resulted in <b>overstressing</b> of the wings and tailplane leading to inflight structural failure, with both wings and tailplane detaching from the fuselage. Contributory factors were the mis-rigged state of the door operating mechanism, which allowed the top and bottom pairs of catches to lose synchronisation, and failure of the door warning indicators to give the crew enough time to respond to door safety alerts.|$|E
25|$|BART trains travel between San Francisco and Oakland {{through an}} {{underwater}} tube structure. The tube {{is composed of}} welded plate steel segments. Each oval outer section carries two inner train tubes of circular cross section and a central rectangular access and rescue tunnel, with the void between elements filled with concrete. The segments were sunk into a ditch dredged through bay mud and covered with rock fill, and then pumped free of water upon completion, making the resulting tube somewhat buoyant, but held in place with a rock overfill. Subsequent seismic analysis indicated {{the possibility that the}} overfill could fail due to agitation, allowing the buoyant tube to float upward, misaligning the tracks and possibly <b>overstressing</b> the bolted connections. This potential problem has been addressed by vibratory compaction of the overfill covering the tube. Additional stabilization includes the driving of large pilings and the connection of additional restraints.|$|E
25|$|A tube of {{particular}} structural, seismic, economic, and political {{interest is the}} BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed {{at the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three inner tubes. The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid <b>overstressing</b> the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding slip joint was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building.|$|E

500|$|Critics at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century believed that the poem's use of sound and tone made it great. The French critic Louis Cazamian claimed in 1927 that Gray [...] "discovered rhythms, utilised the power of sounds, and even created evocations. The triumph of this sensibility allied to so much art is to be seen in the famous Elegy, which from a somewhat reasoning and moralizing emotion has educed a grave, full, melodiously monotonous song, in which a century weaned from the music of the soul tasted all the sadness of eventide, of death, and of the tender musing upon self." [...] I. A. Richards, following in 1929, declared that the merits of the poem come from its tone: [...] "poetry, which has no other very remarkable qualities, may sometimes take very high rank simply because the poet's attitude to his listenersin view of what he has to sayis so perfect. Gray and Dryden are notable examples. Gray's Elegy, indeed, might stand as a supreme instance to show how powerful an exquisitely adjusted tone may be. It would be difficult to maintain that the thought in this poem is either striking or original, or that its feeling is exceptional." [...] He continued: [...] "the Elegy may usefully remind us that boldness and originality are not necessities for great poetry. But these thoughts and feelings, in part because of their significance and their nearness to us, are peculiarly difficult to express without faults... Gray, however, without <b>overstressing</b> any point composes a long address, perfectly accommodating his familiar feelings towards the subject and his awareness of the inevitable triteness of the only possible reflections, to the discriminating attention of his audience. And this is the source of his triumph." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the proposed research is to quantify the limits of <b>overstressed</b> and aging circuit breakers in terms of probability of failure and to provide guidelines to determine network reconfigurations, generator commitment, and economic dispatch strategies that account for these limits. The proposed temporary power system operating strategies address circuit breaker adequacy issues and allow <b>overstressed</b> breakers to be operated longer and more reliably until they are replaced with adequate equipment. The expansion of electric networks with new power sources (nuclear plants, distributed generation) results in increased short-circuit or fault currents levels. As fault currents increase, they will eventually exceed circuit breaker ratings. Circuit breakers exposed to fault currents in excess of their ratings {{are said to be}} <b>overstressed,</b> underrated, or inadequate. Insufficient ratings expose <b>overstressed</b> breakers to increased failure probabilities. Extensive common-mode outages caused by circuit breaker failures reduce the reliability of power systems. To durably avoid outages and system unreliability, <b>overstressed</b> breakers must eventually be replaced. Large-scale replacements of <b>overstressed</b> breakers cannot be completed in a short time because of budgetary limits, capital improvement schedules, and manufacturer-imposed constraints. Meanwhile, to preserve the ability of old and <b>overstressed</b> breakers to safely interrupt faults, short-circuit currents must be kept within the limits imposed by the ratings and the age of these breakers by using the substation reconfiguration and generator commitment strategies described in this study. The immediate benefit of the above-mentioned operating strategies is a reduction of the failure probability of <b>overstressed</b> breakers obtained by avoiding the interruption of currents in excess of breaker ratings. Other benefits include (i) increased network reliability, (ii) restored operating margins with respect to existing equipment, and (iii) prioritized equipment upgrades that enhance the long-term planning of power systems.

2500|$|The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) {{became a}} {{significant}} customer of the Sea Fury, {{and many of}} its aircraft were diverted from existing Royal Navy contracts. On 23 June 1948, the first aircraft was accepted at RCAF Rockcliffe. The type was quickly put to use replacing Canada's existing inventory of Seafires, taking on the primary role of fleet air defence operating from the aircraft carrier [...] Two Canadian squadrons operated the Sea Fury, Nos. 803 and 883 Squadrons, which were later renumbered as 870 and 871. Pilot training on the Sea Fury was normally conducted at the RCN's HMCS Shearwater land base. Landing difficulties with the Sea Fury were experienced following the RCN's decision to convert to the US Navy's deck landing procedures, which were prone to <b>overstressing</b> and damaging the airframes as the Sea Fury had been designed for a tail-down landing attitude. The Sea Fury would be operated between 1948 and 1956 by the RCN, at which point they were replaced by the jet-powered McDonnell F2H Banshee. The aircraft themselves were put into storage, and some were subsequently purchased by civilians.|$|E
2500|$|With purely {{mechanical}} {{flight control}} systems, the aerodynamic {{forces on the}} control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, however, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt {{and there is a}} risk of <b>overstressing</b> the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, artificial feel systems can be used. For example, for the controls of the RAF's Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF's Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device. [...] The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's normal acceleration.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1912 {{the future}} of the Type XI was {{threatened}} by the French army placing a ban on the use of all monoplanes. This {{was the result of a}} series of accidents in which Blériot aircraft had suffered wing failure in flight. The first of these incidents had occurred on 4 January 1910, killing Léon Delagrange, and was generally attributed to the fact that Delagrange had fitted an over-powerful engine, so <b>overstressing</b> the airframe. A similar accident had killed Peruvian pilot Jorge Chavez at the end of 1910 at the end of the first flight over the Alps, and in response to this the wing spars of the Blériot had been strengthened. [...] A subsequent accident led to a further strengthening of the spars. [...] Blériot, understandably, took this matter very seriously, and produced a report for the French government which came to the conclusion that the problem was not the strength of the wing spars but a failure to take into account the amount of downward force to which aircraft wings could be subjected, and that the problem could be solved by increasing the strength of the upper bracing wires. [...] This analysis was accepted, and Blériot's prompt and thorough response to the problem enhanced rather than damaged his reputation.|$|E

40|$|Viscoplasticity {{is mostly}} {{modelled}} by the flowstress approach, where the flowstress (Y) {{is a function}} of pressure, temperature, plastic strain and strain rate Y(P,T, εp, ε̇). For dynamic Viscoplasticity the flowstress approach is used in hydrocodes together with the radial return algorithm, to determine deviatoric stress components in each computational cell and for each time step. The flowstress approach assumes that during plastic loading, the flowstress in stress space follows the current stress point (current Y). Unloading of a computational cell is therefore always elastic. The <b>overstress</b> approach to dynamic viscoplasticity was used in various versions in the 1950 s and early 1960 s, before the advent of hydrocodes. By the <b>overstress</b> approach a state point may move out of the quasistatic flow surface upon loading, and hence the term <b>overstress.</b> When this happens, the state point tends to fall back (or relax) onto the quasistatic flow surface through plastic flow, and the rate of this relaxation is an increasing function of the amount of <b>overstress.</b> In the paper we first outline in detail how these two approaches to dynamic viscoplasticity work, and then show an example for which the <b>overstress</b> approach has an advantage over the flowstress approach. The example has to do with elastic precursor decay in planar impact, and with the phenomenon of anomalous thermal strengthening, revealed recently in planar impact tests.

40|$|From time to {{time during}} the past 150 years, discussions have emerged {{about the idea of}} <b>overstress</b> in {{children}} [...] that excessive intellectual activity is harmful to the mind and body and can cause death. Using Philadelphia and Boston as case studies, this dissertation analyzes primary source materials to examine several episodes of intense concern about childhood stress. Drawing on newspaper articles, teachers 2 ̆ 7 journals, board of education reports, and medical literature, it demonstrates that childhood stress has been perceived as a longstanding and recurrent problem. ^ Concern about <b>overstress</b> directed public attention to the needs of children. Journalists brought the issue to public attention and tried to pressure school officials to change aspects of the school environment thought to foster <b>overstress.</b> This discussion led to changes in the schools. In 1868, the Philadelphia Board of Education abolished all homework. In both Boston and Philadelphia, other changes were enacted in the school regimen. Hours of study were shortened and there were attempts to downplay competition. ^ Girls were thought to be more vulnerable to <b>overstress</b> than boys, and public outcry frequently focused on adolescent girls. I highlight early battles in both cities over education and social roles for young women and demonstrate the ways in which <b>overstress</b> has served as a symbolic focus for the conflict over women 2 ̆ 7 s education. In 1865, after the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal recorded the special concern of physicians about the well-being of girls the Boston School Committee appointed a committee to narrow the curriculum. In 1903, after reports of the deaths of students in Philadelphia 2 ̆ 7 s Girls 2 ̆ 7 Normal School and High School, 2, 000 citizens petitioned the Board of Education to lessen the amount of homework. ^ <b>Overstress</b> touched the core tensions about socialization in American society, and debate about <b>overstress</b> involved competition among self-proclaimed 2 ̆ 2 experts 2 ̆ 2 for authority over socialization. An investigation of the controversies about <b>overstress</b> reveals the encroachment of 2 ̆ 2 experts 2 ̆ 2 into the family 2 ̆ 7 s domain of child-rearing.

However, the effect of the magnitude of applied stress in relation to the critical buckling stress, or <b>overstress,</b> on the observed patterns has until this point been neglected experimentally. In this paper, we investigate the effect of <b>overstress</b> using poly(dimethylsiloxane) which has been surface-oxidized with a UV-ozone oxidation technique. Using a swelling-based stress application technique, where the applied swelling stress in the thin film is controlled by changing the concentration of vapor-phase swelling agent (ethanol) in a sealed swelling chamber, we are able to impart swelling stresses below, at, and well above the critical stress. We observe a transition from hexagonally packed dimples at low <b>overstress</b> to ridge-based morphologies (herringbone and labyrinth) at high <b>overstress.</b> The observed dimple structures are remarkably widespread, and the hexagonal arrangement of these dimples is confirmed using Fourier analysis. Although analytical results predict that a square arrangement of dimples is preferred to hexagonal for flat wrinkling surfaces, hexagonal arrays are nonetheless unilaterally observed at low <b>overstress.</b> We attribute this observation to an inherent curvature that develops in the swelling film. The <b>overstress</b> is quantified by measuring the radius of curvature of swelling bilayer beams, both confirming the preferential swelling of the surface oxide layer by ethanol and quantifying the swelling extent. Effects of non-equibiaxial stress are investigated by inducing a compressive prestress prior to swelling, and “trapped” non-equilibrium morphologies are discussed briefly...|$|R
