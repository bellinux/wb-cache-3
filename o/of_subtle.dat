5|$|Subtle {{problems}} with the executive functions of attentiveness, planning, flexibility, and abstract thinking, or impairments in semantic memory (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of {{the early stages of}} AD. Apathy can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the disease. Depressive symptoms, irritability and reduced awareness <b>of</b> <b>subtle</b> memory difficulties are also common.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the qualities}} that make Leonardo's work unique are his {{innovative}} techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use <b>of</b> <b>subtle</b> gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E

5|$|LGBT {{themes in}} comics are a {{relatively}} new concept, as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from the content of comic books and their comic strip predecessors, due to either censorship or the perception that comics were for children. With any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority (CCA) until 1989, earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US took the form <b>of</b> <b>subtle</b> hints or subtext regarding a character's sexual orientation. LGBT themes were tackled earlier in underground comix from the early 1970s onward. Independently published one-off comic books and series, often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines, tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers.|$|E
5|$|While Jainism enjoins {{observance}} of total nonviolence by the ascetics, {{it is often}} argued that the man is constantly obliged to engage in destructive activities of eating, drinking, breathing and surviving {{in order to support}} his body. According to Jainism, life is omnipresent with infinite beings including microorganisms pervading each and every part of the universe. Hence it may still be possible to avoid killing of gross animals, but it is impossible to avoid killing <b>of</b> <b>subtle</b> microorganisms in air and water, plant life and various types of insects that may be crushed by walking.|$|E
5|$|In {{the stories}} he narrates, the Baron is shown as a calm, {{rational}} man, describing what he experiences with simple objectivity; absurd happenings elicit, at most, mild surprise from him, and he shows serious doubt about any unlikely events {{he has not}} witnessed himself. The resulting narrative effect is an ironic tone, encouraging skepticism in the reader and marked by a running undercurrent <b>of</b> <b>subtle</b> social satire. In addition to his fearlessness when hunting and fighting, he is suggested to be a debonair, polite gentleman given to moments of , with a scholarly penchant for knowledge, {{a tendency to be}} pedantically accurate about details in his stories, and a deep appreciation for food and drink of all kinds. The Baron also provides a solid geographical and social context for his narratives, peppering them with topical allusions and satire about recent events; indeed, many of the references in Raspe's original text are to historical incidents in the real-life Münchhausen's military career.|$|E

In Software Testing Techniques, author Boris Bazor writes that every method used to find bugs leaves a residue <b>of</b> <b>subtler</b> bugs against which those methods become ineffectual.

25|$|Carlisle {{has been}} noted by critics for her dynamic soprano vocal range. While Carlisle's discography both with the Go-Go's and in her solo work have been predominately {{characterized}} as pop music, some music scholars such as Greil Marcus have noted a confluence <b>of</b> <b>subtle</b> punk influences as well as pop rock, specifically in the Go-Go's early releases (Marcus suggests that any traces of punk influence were carried over from Carlisle's brief tenure in the Germs).|$|E

An attack on the upper fort failed, with Spearing being killed {{a few feet from}} the French ramparts. When the British withdrew to their boats the French captured them. In all, the British lost seven killed and 30 wounded, all the dead and most of the wounded being from Subtle. The French lost one man wounded.|$|E
25|$|The {{place is}} a good, intact and {{representative}} example {{of the work of}} architect, Dr Karl Langer, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of his work.

As the largest commission of his career, it is a rare illustration of Langer's principles applied on a large scale.|$|E

The editor of the official church gazette Glas Koncila Ivan Miklenić, otherwise known as a vocal critic of President Mesić, did not endorse any candidate and instead expressed disappointment with both candidates, but later made statements that were interpreted to favor Bandić. During the campaign, numerous minor violations related to Church members were observed by GONG, in favor of Bandić.|$|E
