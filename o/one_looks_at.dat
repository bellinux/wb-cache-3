25|$|Culture {{has been}} shown to {{directly}} affect organizational performance. When viewed through the lens of accepted behaviors and ingrained values, culture also profoundly affects motivation. Whether <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the type of culture—strong, strategically appropriate, or adaptive—as Kotter & Heskett do, or at the style of culture—Clan, Adhocracy, Market, or Hierarchy—as Cameron & Quinn do, the connection between culture and motivation becomes clear and provides insights into how to hire, task, and motivate employees.|$|E

25|$|If <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> {{this train}} from the fixed {{non-rotating}} frame {{on top of}} the center of the Earth, at that speed it remains stationary as the Earth spins beneath it. Hence, the only force acting on it is gravity and the reaction from the track. This force is greater (by 0.34%) than the force that the passengers and the train experience when at rest (rotating along with Earth). This difference is what the Coriolis effect accounts for in the rotating frame of reference.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, Muslims from North America {{have used}} two rules to {{determine}} {{the direction of the}} Qiblah. According to spherical calculations, a Muslim praying from Anchorage, Alaska would pray almost due north if determining the Qiblah. However, when <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the world on most Mercator map projections, Mecca appears to be southwest of Anchorage. The shortest rhumb line (line of constant bearing) from most points in North America to Mecca will point toward the southeast, but the distance to Mecca along this route on the actual surface of the earth is longer than the great circle route.|$|E
25|$|Beuys made {{it clear}} that he {{considered}} this song as a work of art, not the “pop” product it appears to be, which is apparent from the moment one views it. Such becomes more obvious when <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the lyrics, which are aimed directly at Reagan, the military complex and whoever is trying to defrost the “Cold War” to make it “hot.” The song has to be understood in the context of intense liberal and progressive frustration in 1982. Beuys warns Reagan et al. that the peace-loving masses are behind him, and that includes the Americans as well.|$|E

25|$|If <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> {{the fields}} around the Deserted Village and {{right up the}} mountain, {{one can see the}} tracks in the fields of 'lazy beds', which is the way crops like {{potatoes}} were grown. In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then have two or three small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{political}} scientist Janet Ajzenstat connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of John Locke. She {{argued that the}} union of the British North American colonies was motivated {{by a desire to}} protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends that the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the Enlightenment of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues that their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada’s legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.|$|E
25|$|The 'Man on the throne' in {{the vision}} of Ezekiel descriptively {{represents}} God, who is controlling everything {{that goes on in}} the world, and how all of the archetypes He set up should interact. The 'Man on the throne', however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed to us by us looking at all four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able to work together and coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that there is really a higher power (God) telling these elements how to act.|$|E

25|$|If <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the {{building}} programs for FY39 and FY40, the US Navy had 194 destroyers (some ordered in June and July 1940), 140 Patrol Craft (PC's 173', 165', 110'), 78 Sub Chasers (SC’s) and 129 YMS’s (which could be utilized for anti-sub role if necessary). Of the Destroyers {{laid down in}} 1940-1 that were not commissioned on December 7, twenty-eight were commissioned between January and June of 1942 with 16 assigned to the US Atlantic Fleet or the European Theater of Operations (ETO) and 12 assigned to the US Pacific Fleet (and of the 12, 1/3 conducted anti-submarine/convoy duty in the Atlantic/Caribbean prior to reporting to the Pacific Fleet) and, of the remaining fifty-two of the classes of 1940-1, 35 were commissioned and assigned to the US Atlantic Fleet and/or the ETO.|$|E
25|$|Cones are {{responsible}} for colour vision. They require brighter light to function than rods require. In humans, there are three types of cones, maximally sensitive to long-wavelength, medium-wavelength, and short-wavelength light (often referred to as red, green, and blue, respectively, though the sensitivity peaks are not actually at these colours). The colour seen is the combined effect of stimuli to, and responses from, these three types of cone cells. Cones are mostly concentrated in and near the fovea. Only a few are present {{at the sides of}} the retina. Objects are seen most sharply in focus when their images fall on the fovea, as when <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> an object directly. Cone cells and rods are connected through intermediate cells in the retina to nerve fibres of the optic nerve. When rods and cones are stimulated by light, they connect through adjoining cells within the retina to send an electrical signal to the optic nerve fibres. The optic nerves send off impulses through these fibres to the brain.|$|E

500|$|Jesus {{emphasized}} the need for pure thoughts as well as actions, and stated, [...] "Everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart" [...] (Matthew 5:28). The Catechism states that, {{with the help of}} God's grace, men and women are required to overcome lust and bodily desires [...] "for sinful relationships with another person's spouse." [...] In Theology of the Body, a series of lectures given by Pope John Paul II, Jesus' statement in Matthew 5:28 is interpreted that one can commit adultery in the heart not only with another's spouse, but also with his/her own spouse if <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> him/her lustfully or treats him/her [...] "only as an object to satisfy instinct".|$|E
500|$|Malgudi evolved {{with the}} {{changing}} political landscape of India. In the 1980s, when the nationalistic fervor in India dictated the changing of British names of towns and localities and removal of British landmarks, Malgudi's mayor and city council removed the long-standing statue of Frederick Lawley, one of Malgudi's early residents. However, when the Historical Societies showed proof that Lawley was strong in his support of the Indian independence movement, the council was forced to undo all their earlier actions. A good comparison to Malgudi, a place that Greene characterised as [...] "more familiar than Battersea or Euston Road", is Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County. Also, like Faulkner's, when <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> Narayan's works, the town gets a better definition through the many different novels and stories.|$|E
500|$|To {{preserve}} {{the secret of}} the proximity fuze, its use was initially permitted only over water, where a dud round could not fall into enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission to use the weapon over land. The proximity fuze proved particularly effective against the V-1 flying bomb over England, and later Antwerp, in 1944. A version was also developed for use with howitzers against ground targets. Bush met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff in October 1944 to press for its use, arguing that the Germans would be unable to copy and produce it before the war was over. Eventually, the Joint Chiefs agreed to allow its employment from December 25. In response to the German Ardennes Offensive on December 16, 1944, the immediate use of the proximity fuze was authorized, and it went into action with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, VT fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40,000 per day. [...] "If <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the proximity fuze program as a whole," [...] historian James Phinney Baxter III wrote, [...] "the magnitude and complexity of the effort rank it among the three or four most extraordinary scientific achievements of the war." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{long ago}} as 1937, Lewis Terman pointed out that error of {{estimation}} in IQ scoring increases as IQ score increases, {{so that there is}} less and less certainty about assigning a test-taker to one band of scores or another as <b>one</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> higher bands. Current IQ tests also have large error bands for high IQ scores. As an underlying reality, such distinctions as those between [...] "exceptionally gifted" [...] and [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] have never been well established. All longitudinal studies of IQ have shown that test-takers can bounce up and down in score, and thus switch up and down in rank order as compared to one another, over the course of childhood. Some test-givers claim that IQ classification categories such as [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] are meaningful, but those are based on the obsolete Stanford–Binet Third Revision (Form L-M) test. The highest reported standard score for most IQ tests is IQ 160, approximately the 99.997th percentile (leaving aside the issue of the considerable error in measurement at that level of IQ on any IQ test). IQ scores above this level are dubious as there are insufficient normative cases upon which to base a statistically justified rank-ordering. Moreover, there has never been any validation of the Stanford–Binet L-M on adult populations, and there is no trace of such terminology in the writings of Lewis Terman. Although two current tests attempt to provide [...] "extended norms" [...] that allow for classification of different levels of giftedness, those norms are not based on well validated data.|$|E
