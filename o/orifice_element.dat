40|$|An <b>orifice</b> <b>element</b> is {{commonly}} used in liquid rocket engine test facilities either as a flow metering device, a damper for acoustic resonance or to provide a large reduction in pressure over a very small distance in the piping system. While the orifice as a device is largely effective in stepping down pressure, it is also susceptible to a wake-vortex type instability that generates pressure fluctuations that propagate downstream and interact with {{other elements of the}} test facility resulting in structural vibrations. Furthermore in piping systems an unstable feedback loop can exist between the vortex shedding and acoustic perturbations from upstream components resulting in an amplification of the modes convecting downstream. Such was the case in several tests conducted at NASA {{as well as in the}} Ariane 5 strap-on P 230 engine in a static firing test where pressure oscillations of 0. 5 % resulted in 5 % thrust oscillations. Exacerbating the situation in cryogenic test facilities, is the possibility of the formation of vapor clouds when the pressure in the wake falls below the vapor pressure leading to a cavitation instability that has a lower frequency than the primary wake-vortex instability. The cavitation instability has the potential for high amplitude fluctuations that can cause catastrophic damage in the facility. In this paper high-fidelity multi-phase numerical simulations of an <b>orifice</b> <b>element</b> are used to characterize the different instabilities, understand the dominant instability mechanisms and identify the tonal content of the instabilities...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPlasma {{diagnostic}} {{studies have}} been carried out on the discharge source of a commercial glow discharge quadrupole mass spectrometer. Plasma parameters were determined using an electrostatic probe with the objective of determining the dependence (if any) of these parameters on the voltage placed on an auxiliary electrode immersed in the plasma. The biased electrode utilized in this study was the sampling <b>orifice</b> <b>element</b> itself. Our results indicate that, for positive orifice voltages with respect to the grounded anode, variations in the plasma potential and ion energy can be correlated directly to the bias placed on the sampling orifice. The dependence of the electron temperature on this parameter is observed to be more complex in nature, and electron number densities show little significant variation with respect to sampling orifice bias. In addition, increased orifice voltages result in an increase in the ion signal intensity measured with the mass spectrometer. Based on the results obtained here, we feel that this increase is due primarily to an increase in ion transmission to the quadrupole arising from the increased ion energy...|$|E
40|$|Constriction devices {{contain an}} element {{inserted}} into the fluid stream, which changes the local streamwise distribution of the flow area. One such element is the orifice-like obstruction with sharp corners, basically a back-to-back abrupt contraction and expansion, which could trigger flow separation. A series of microchannels, 40 μm× 1 μm× 4000 μm in dimensions, with <b>orifice</b> <b>element</b> at the centers of the channels has been fabricated using standard micromachining techniques. The channel width at the orifice section varied from 10 μm to 34 μm, and each channel was integrated {{with a set of}} pressure sensors. Nitrogen gas was passed through the microdevices under inlet pressure up to 50 psi. Mass flow rate was first measured for all the devices {{as a function of the}} pressure drop, showing a monotonic decrease of the flow rate with decreasing orifice width. Then, the pressure distributions along the microchannel with the narrowest orifice were recorded, showing a pressure jump across the 10 μm-wide orifice. The mass flow rate and pressure measurements indicate the existence of flow separation in the microchannels...|$|E
40|$|URL] audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a numerical simulation and an experimental study in order to assess stiffness and damping characteristics of thrust air bearings with multiple <b>orifices.</b> Finite <b>element</b> modeling is used to solve the non-linear Reynolds equation while taking into account the movement equation for the bearing. The numerical results obtained show that performance characteristics are related to bearing design type. An experimental investigation allows us to analyze the behavior of thrust air bearings with several orifices as well as that of groove or porous material bearings. Frequency response measurements have been realized in order to compare the dynamic properties of the different bearings. The frequency responses obtained demonstrate that air bearings with multiple orifices have a damping higher than the other types in certain conditions. Air bearings with multiple orifices offer many advantages from a dynamic point of view. Their performance may be characterized not only by flow conditions but also by the number or diameter of the orifices in the bearing surface...|$|R
40|$|The Project Morpheus {{liquid oxygen}} (LOX) / liquid methane rocket engines {{demonstrated}} acousticcoupled combustion instabilities during sealevel groundbased testing at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) and Stennis Space Center (SSC). Highamplitude, 1 T, 1 R, 1 T 1 R (and higher order) modes {{appear to be}} triggered by injector conditions. The instability occurred during the Morpheusspecific engine ignition/start sequence, and did demonstrate the capability to propagate into mainstage. However, the instability was never observed to initiate during mainstage, even at low power levels. The Morpheus main engine is a JSCdesigned ~ 5, 000 lbfthrust, 4 : 1 throttling, pressurefed cryogenic engine using an impinging element injector design. Two different engine designs, named HD 4 and HD 5, and two different builds of the HD 4 engine all demonstrated similar instability characteristics. Through the analysis of more than 200 hot fire tests on the Morpheus vehicle and SSC test stand, a relationship between ignition stability and injector/chamber pressure was developed. The instability has the distinct characteristic of initiating at high relative injection pressure drop (dP) at low chamber pressure (Pc); i. e., instabilities initiated at high dP/Pc at low Pc during the start sequence. The high dP/Pc during start results during the injector /chamber chillin, and is enhanced by hydraulic flip in the injector <b>orifice</b> <b>elements.</b> Because of the fixed mixture ratio of the existing engine design (the main valves share a common actuator), it is not currently possible to determine if LOX or methane injector dP/Pc were individual contributors (i. e., LOX and methane dP/Pc typically trend {{in the same direction}} within a given test). The instability demonstrated initiation characteristic of starting at or shortly after methane injector chillin. Colder methane (e. g., subcooled) at the injector inlet prior to engine start was much more likely to result in an instability. A secondary effect of LOX subcooling was also possibly observed; greater LOX sub cooling improved stability. Some tests demonstrated a lowamplitude 1 L 1 T instability prior to LOX injector chillin. The Morpheus main engine also demonstrated chug instabilities during some engine shutdown sequences on the flight vehicle and SSC test stand. The chug instability was also infrequently observed during the startup sequence. The chug instabilities predictably initiated at low dP/Pc at low Pc. The chug instabilities were always selflimiting; startup chug instabilities terminated during throttleup and shutdown chug instabilities decayed by shutdown termination...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{and design}} {{impact of a}} requirement for the advanced expander cycle engine to be adaptable to extended low thrust operation of approximately 1 K to 2 K lb is assessed. It is determined that the orbit transfer vehicle point design engine can be reduced in thrust with minor injector modifications from 15 K to 1 K without significantly affecting combustion performance efficiency or injector face/chamber wall thermal compatibility. Likewise, high frequency transverse mode combustion instability {{is not expected to}} be detrimentally affected. Primarily, the operational limitations consist of feed system chugging instabilities and potential coupling of the injector response with the chamber longitudinal mode resonances under certain operating conditions. The recommended injector modification for low thrust operation is a change in the oxidizer injector <b>element</b> <b>orifice</b> size. Analyses also indicate that chamber coolant flow stability may be a concern below 2 K 1 bF operation and oxidizer pump stability could be a problem below a 2 K thrust level although a recirculation flow could alleviate the problem...|$|R
40|$|Application of {{hydrodynamic}} cavitation for disinfection {{of water}} is gaining momentum, as it provides environmentally and economically sound options. In this effort, the effect of cavitating conditions created by differential pump valve opening and that created by flowing through a cavitating <b>element</b> (<b>orifice</b> plates) on the microbes (zooplankton in seawater) is described. The experimental results are compared with modeling of cavitating conditions that includes cavity dynamics, turbulence generated by individual oscillating cavity, cell wall strength and geometrical & operating parameters of cavitation device. Theoretical model for quantifying the cavitationally generated turbulent shear and extent of microbial disinfection has been developed. Experimental results indicated that cavitation and/or turbulent fluid shear dominantly originating from cavitation are effective tools for seawater disinfection as more than 80 % of the Zooplankton present in the seawater were killed. It was also observed that shock waves generated due to cavitation is not the sole cause for zooplankton disruption. A correct physical mechanism accounting fluid turbulence and shear, generated from stable oscillation of cavity, significantly contribute towards the disruption. Further refinement of the model presented {{will serve as a}} basis for higher degree of disinfection and provide a practical tool for sea water disinfection...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation of a jet pipe electropneumatic actuator designed for use in the Utah/MIT Dextrous Hand (UMDH). A survey of dextrous hand systems and their related technologies is also provided. As {{part of an effort to}} characterize the UMDH system as a whole, a nonlinear mathematical model of the actuator is given including detailed representation of the jet pipe <b>element,</b> <b>orifice</b> areas and fluid dynamics. Model parameters are identified and the model formulation is validated through experimentation and simulation. The performance of the actuator under closed-loop control is examined. Experimental results show that feedforward control is useful in eliminating any steady-state offset and that a stable bandwidth of 80 Hz is achievable using a simple proportional feedback controller. A linearized model of the actuator is presented and compared with the nonlinear model. Results show that linearized model adequately describes the actuator dynamics at the specified operating point. The agreement between simulations and experimental data indicates that the mathematical models presented are potentially valuable tools, whether to aid in the analysis and design of actuation systems, or for use in model-based control...|$|R
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} more {{complete}} qualitative and quantitative understanding of the in vivo histology of the human bulbar conjunctiva. Methods: Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) was used to observe and measure morphological characteristics of the bulbar conjunctiva of 11 healthy human volunteer subjects. Results: The superficial epithelial layer of the bulbar conjunctiva is seen as a mass of small cell nuclei. Cell borders are sometimes visible. The light grey borders of basal epithelial cells are clearly visible, but nuclei can not be seen. The conjunctival stroma is comprised of a dense meshwork of white fibres, through which traverse blood vessels containing cellular <b>elements.</b> <b>Orifices</b> at the epithelial surface may represent goblet cells that have opened and expelled their contents. Goblet cells are also observed in the deeper epithelial layers, as well as conjunctival microcysts and mature forms of Langerhans cells. The bulbar conjunctiva has a mean thickness of 32. 9 1. 1 mm, and a superficial and basal epithelial cell density of 2212 782 and 2368 741 cells/ mm 2, respectively. Overall goblet and mature Langerhans cell densities are 111 58 and 23 25 cells/mm 2, respectively. Conclusions: LSCM is a powerful technique for studying the human bulbar conjunctiva in vivo and quantifying key aspects of cell morphology. The observations presented here may serve as a useful marker against which changes in conjunctival morphology due to disease, surgery, drug therapy or contact lens wear can be assessed...|$|R
