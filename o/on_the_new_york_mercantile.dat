5|$|In {{response}} to the storm's projected path into the Gulf of Mexico, prices for crude oil rose <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Mercantile</b> Exchange at branch offices in London. Natural gas prices rose considerably in New York Mercantile Exchange electronic trading on August 2. Anticipation {{of a threat to}} supply by a potential Hurricane Chris coupled with high demand during an ongoing heat wave were cited as factors in the price move. In New Orleans, officials including Mayor Ray Nagin prepared for a possible evacuation of the city if Chris entered the Gulf of Mexico as a hurricane. The evacuation plan included moving all residents out of the city as a worst-case scenario, intended to avoid a re-occurrence of Hurricane Katrina around one year prior. Florida Emergency Management requested ten mobile recovery centers, and placed hospitals in the Florida Keys on standby for evacuation. Officials in Mississippi identified the need for 110 to assist in an evacuation process in case of a possible landfall. Both Louisiana and Texas emergency operation centers monitored the progress of the storm, though did not execute any preparation action.|$|E

500|$|In Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, both {{members of}} OPEC, no {{official}} warnings had been issued due to Gonu. The storm {{was not expected}} to disrupt oil supplies from these two nations. However, oil prices rose early on June 5 because of concerns of disruptions caused by Gonu, {{as well as the}} threat of nationwide strikes in Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producer. Crude oil for July delivery rose $1.13, or 1.7percent, to $66.21 Monday <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Mercantile</b> Exchange, the highest close in 15 days. Futures reached $66.48, the highest intraday price since April 30. The contract was at $65.95 a barrel, down 26cents, in after-hours electronic trading at [...] Tuesday in Singapore. Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service, said he doubted the increase could be attributed to Gonu. [...] "I don't know if you can really attribute any of the gain to the cyclone," [...] he said. [...] "It's an excuse, as opposed to a reason, for the rise in prices." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Joseph P. Kennedy II, by 2012, {{prices on}} the oil {{commodity}} market had become influenced by [...] "hedge funds and bankers" [...] pumping [...] "billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges, chasing {{a limited number of}} barrels and driving up the price". The problem started, according to Kennedy, in 1991, when just a few years after oil futures began trading <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Mercantile</b> Exchange, Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades.|$|E

2500|$|The {{price of}} natural gas varies greatly {{depending}} on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet (about 25 cents per m3) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value {{of natural gas}} is roughly 1,000 British thermal units (BTU) per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU, or around $7 per gigajoule. In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per [...] ($10/MMBTU). The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price. At the end of 2007, this was $12â€“$16 per 1000 cubic feet (about 50 cents per m3). Natural gas in the United States is traded as a futures contract <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Mercantile</b> Exchange. Each contract is for 10,000MMBTU (~10,550 gigajoules), or 10 billion BTU. Thus, {{if the price of}} gas is $10 per million BTUs on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{claims have}} been made implicating {{financial}} speculation as {{a major cause of}} the price increases. In May 2008 the transport chief for Germany's Social Democrats estimated that 25 percent of the rise to $135 a barrel {{had nothing to do with}} underlying supply and demand. Testimony was given to a U.S. Senate committee in May indicating that [...] "demand shock" [...] from [...] "institutional investors" [...] had increased by [...] over the previous five years, almost as much as the increased physical demand from China (...) [...] The influence of institutional investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, was also discussed in June 2008, when Lehman Brothers suggested that price increases were related to increases in exposure to commodities by such investors. It claimed that [...] "for every $100 million in new inflows, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, increased by 1.6%." [...] Also in May 2008, an article in The Economist pointed out that oil futures transactions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Mercantile</b> Exchange (NYMEX), nearly mirrored the price of oil increases for a several-year period; however, the article conceded that the increased investment might be following rising prices, rather than causing them, and that the nickel commodity market had halved in value between May 2007 and May 2008 despite significant speculative interest. It also reminded readers that [...] "Investment can flood into the oil market without driving up prices because speculators are not buying any actual crude... no oil is hoarded or somehow kept off the market," [...] and that prices of some commodities which are not openly traded have actually risen faster than oil prices. In June 2008, OPEC's Secretary General Abdallah Salem el-Badri stated that current world consumption of oil at 87 million bpd was far exceeded by the [...] "paper market" [...] for oil, which equaled about 1.36 billion bpd, or more than 15 times the actual market demand.|$|E
