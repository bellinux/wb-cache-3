5|$|A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in {{residence}} on the Mir space station, reveals to Arroway {{that a second}} machine was secretly made in Japan, and that Arroway {{will be the one}} to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet.</b> She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida, and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E
5|$|New writers for {{the show}} {{included}} Toby Whithouse, creator of the Channel 4 drama No Angels, Tom MacRae, creator of Sky One's Mile High, Matt Jones, also a prolific script editor and producer, and Matthew Graham, co-creator of the BBC science fiction series Life on Mars. Previous writers Mark Gatiss, Steven Moffat and Russell T Davies all contributed to the series, with Davies continuing to act as head writer and executive producer. Stephen Fry was due to write episode 11 but was forced to withdraw as he could not complete the script in time so Russell T. Davies hired Matthew Graham to write Fear Her. Phil Collinson produced all episodes, with Julie Gardner as executive producer. The series was directed by James Hawes, Euros Lyn, James Strong, Dan Zeff and Graeme Harper, who had directed episodes of the programme's original run. The series is primarily set on Earth (though {{not as much as}} the first series was) due to the cost involved in creating another planet, according to Davies. Only two stories are set <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|E

As an example, we will {{address the problem of}} how to study the habitability of an environment when you have no idea what kind of life might be there to exploit it. This will all be related to the upcoming launch of the Mars Science Laboratory to Mars in late November this year...|$|R
40|$|Determining radiometric ages in situ <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet's</b> surface {{has never}} been done, and {{there are good reasons}} to think that it will be {{extremely}} difficult. It is certainly hard to imagine that such ages could be measured as precisely as they could be measured on returned samples in state-of-the-art terrestrial laboratories. However, it may be possible, by using simple noble-gas-based chronology techniques, to determine ages on Mars to a precision that is scientifically useful. This abstract will: (1) describe the techniques we envision; (2) give some examples of how such information might be scientifically useful; and (3) describe the system we are developing, including the requirements in terms of mass, power, volume, and sample selection and preparation...|$|R

5|$|SETI {{researcher}} Carl Sagan {{believed that}} a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war {{to be able to}} avoid self-destruction. Representatives of such a civilization would treat humanity with dignity and respect, and humanity, with its relatively backward technology, would {{have no choice but to}} reciprocate. Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same <b>on</b> <b>another</b> habitable <b>planet</b> as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have the motivation to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|R

25|$|Faced {{with such}} a drastic social experiment, and stunned by its arrest once the President dies, humans are faced with {{complete}} annihilation, as the cold wave progresses down toward the ocean floor. Scientists have to acknowledge yet another threat: that of biological devolution, turning men and women into oversized mollusks. Decision-makers are incapable of finding a global solution, but coalesce into competing factions. Two engineers personify that trend: Whitt suggests moving civilization closer to the inner molten regions; Xavier, inventor of nuclear propulsion, wants spacecraft to resettle humans <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet.</b> While Whitt and his secretary dig into the seafloor, Xavier and his concubine Olivia (collectively dubbed X-O) make a solitary escape into the cosmos.|$|E
25|$|The {{origin of}} life, known as abiogenesis, {{distinct}} from the evolution of life, is another ongoing field of research. Oparin and Haldane postulated that the conditions on the early Earth were conducive {{to the formation of}} organic compounds from inorganic elements and thus to the formation of many of the chemicals common to all forms of life we see today. The study of this process, known as prebiotic chemistry, has made some progress, but it is still unclear whether or not life could have formed in such a manner on Earth. The alternative hypothesis of panspermia is that the first elements of life may have formed <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> with even more favorable conditions (or even in interstellar space, asteroids, etc.) and then have been carried over to Earth—the panspermia hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{experiences}} with Earth, {{the environment of}} a planet can be altered deliberately; however, the feasibility of creating an unconstrained planetary environment that mimics Earth <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> {{has yet to be}} verified. Mars is usually considered to be the most likely candidate for terraforming. Much study has been done concerning the possibility of heating the planet and altering its atmosphere, and NASA has even hosted debates on the subject. Several potential methods of altering the climate of Mars may fall within humanity's technological capabilities, but at present the economic resources required to do so are far beyond that which any government or society is willing to allocate to it. The long timescales and practicality of terraforming are the subject of debate. Other unanswered questions relate to the ethics, logistics, economics, politics, and methodology of altering the environment of an extraterrestrial world.|$|E

His research has focused on theories of pluralism, problems of participatory democracy, the development of the discipline in Germany and East-Central Europe, transition from dictatorship to democracy, and scientists’ compliance during the Nazi regime. Displaying a strong historical interest, Eisfeld has also, rather uncommonly for a political scientist, written about the persisting ideology of the American frontier (“progress through violence”), the projection of earthly hopes and fears <b>on</b> <b>another</b> world (the <b>planet</b> Mars), and teenagers’ dreams in the 1950s.|$|R
40|$|The {{asymmetry}} in {{the time}} delay for light rays propagating {{on opposite sides of}} a spinning body is analyzed. A frequency shift in the perceived signals is found. A practical procedure is proposed for evidencing the asymmetry, allowing for a measurement of the specific angular momentum of the rotating mass. Orders of magnitude are considered and discussed. A well known effect of gravity on the propagation of electromagnetic signals is the time delay: for example an electromagnetic beam emitted from a source <b>on</b> Earth toward <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> of the solar system, and hence reflected back, undergoes a time delay during its trip (with respect to the propagation in flat space-time), due to the influence of the gravitational field of the Sun. This effect was indeed called the ”fourth ” test of General Relativity[1],[2], coming fourth after the three classical ones predicted by Einstein[3]. Though small, the time delay in the propagation of electromagnetic waves was detected by Shapiro et al. [4], timing radar echoes from Mercury and Venus...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} {{on how to}} express this objection. William F. Vallicella holds that organized complexity as such does not need explanation, because when {{in search of an}} ultimate explanation, one must in the end accept an entity whose complexity has no external explanation. Dawkins has stated that we should search for simple beginnings for explanations, like in evolution which moves from simple to complex, and so what we ultimately accept with no external explanation must be simple for it to be a good explanation. And Plantinga writes that when not in search for an ultimate explanation of organized complexity, it is perfectly fine to explain one kind of complexity, that of terrestrial life, in terms of another kind of complexity, namely divine activity. Dawkins addresses this point in his debate with John Lennox over The God Delusion, saying that it would be perfectly reasonable to infer from artifacts <b>on</b> earth or <b>another</b> <b>planet</b> that an intelligence existed, but that you would still need to explain that intelligence, which evolution does, while for God's existence there is no such explanation.|$|R
25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but he never had a hero battling against space creatures or having adventures <b>on</b> <b>another</b> <b>planet.</b> A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E
