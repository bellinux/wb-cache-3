500|$|On April 5, 2011, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted that The Path to Prosperity was [...] "a path {{to poverty}} for America's seniors and children". On April 13, 2011, {{speaking}} of Ryan's budget proposal, Obama said: [...] "I don't think there's anything courageous about asking for sacrifice {{from those who}} can least afford it. There's nothing serious about a plan that claims {{to reduce the deficit}} by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires." [...] The House passed the Ryan plan on April 15, 2011, by a vote of 235–193. Four Republicans joined all House Democrats in voting against it. On an April 27, 2011, conference call with reporters Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that passage of the Ryan plan [...] "would be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> to happen to this country". On May 25, 2011, the Ryan budget plan was defeated in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|Commentators mainly praised Hutton's {{concentration}} and stamina; his slow scoring, particularly {{when compared to}} Bradman's innings of 334, was excused {{on the grounds that}} the Oval match was played without a time limit, and run accumulation was more important than fast scoring. Furthermore, Hammond had instructed Hutton to bat as long as possible. Among views expressed by Test cricketers, Les Ames believed that while Hutton had shown great skill, a combination of a very easy wicket for batting and an unusually weak bowling attack presented an ideal opportunity. Former England captain Bob Wyatt described the innings as one of the greatest feats of {{concentration and}} endurance in the history of the game. Some critics expressed distaste at England's approach, but this opinion was not widely shared. In the aftermath of the innings, Hutton became famous, [...] in constant demand from the public and press who compared him to Bradman. Hutton later described the acclamation he received as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> that happened to him, not least because expectations were unreasonably high every time he subsequently batted. When the season ended, Hutton had scored 1,874 runs in all matches at an average of 60.45.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to Dancer in the Dark was polarized. For example, on The Movie Show, Margaret Pomeranz gave it five stars while David Stratton {{gave it a}} zero, a score shared only by Geoffrey Wright's Romper Stomper (1992). Stratton later {{described}} it as his [...] "favourite horror film". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said it was [...] "{{one of the worst}} films, one of the worst artworks and perhaps <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> {{in the history of the}} world." [...] The response is reflected in the film's official website, which posts both positive and negative reviews on its main page. The diverse reviews result in an overall 68% [...] "Fresh" [...] rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Dancer in Dark can be grim, dull, and difficult to watch, but even so, it has a powerful and moving performance from Björk and is something quite new and visionary." ...|$|E

He would have taken them off and gone barefoot without his mother's knowing it, and many of the boys said that he ought to do it; but then she would have found it out by the look of his feet when he went to bed, and maybe told his father about it.|$|E

60|$|The whole Court {{was a great}} flaunting {{crowd of}} debauched men and shameless women; and Catherine's merry husband insulted and outraged her in every {{possible}} way, until she consented to receive those worthless creatures as her very good friends, and to degrade herself by their companionship. A MRS. PALMER, whom the King made LADY CASTLEMAINE, and afterwards DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND, {{was one of the}} most powerful of the bad women about the Court, and had great influence with the King nearly all through his reign. Another merry lady named MOLL DAVIES, a dancer at the theatre, was afterwards her rival. So was NELL GWYN, first an orange girl and then an actress, who really had good in her, and of whom <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> I know is, that actually she does seem to have been fond of the King. The first DUKE OF ST. ALBANS was this orange girl's child. In like manner the son of a merry waiting-lady, whom the King created DUCHESS OF PORTSMOUTH, became the DUKE OF RICHMOND. Upon the whole it is not so bad a thing to be a commoner.|$|E
60|$|King James was a fond of {{favorites}} as ever Elizabeth had been, {{though not}} of the same persons. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> he ever did was the keeping Sir Walter Raleigh in the Tower for many years, and a last cutting off his head. It was asserted that Sir Walter had tried, when first James came, {{to set up a}} lady named Arabella Stuart to be queen; but if he was to be punished for that, it ought to have been directly, instead of keeping the sentence hanging over his head for years. The truth was that Sir Walter had been a great enemy to the Spaniards, and James wanted to please them, for he wished his son Charles to marry the daughter of the King of Spain. Charles wanted to see her first, and set off for Spain, in disguise, with the Duke of Buckingham, who was his friend, and his father's greatest favorite. But when reached he Madrid, he found that the princesses were not allowed to speak to any gentleman, nor to show their faces; and though he climbed over a wall to speak to her when she was walking in the garden, an attendant begged him to go away, or all her train would be punished. Charles went back disappointed, and, on his way through Paris, saw Henrietta Maria, the bright-eyed sister of the King of France, and set his heart on marrying her.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{all this}} time, the deposed King Henry was {{concealed}} by a Welsh knight, who kept him close in his castle. But, next year, the Lancaster party recovering their spirits, raised {{a large body}} of men, and called him out of his retirement, to put him at their head. They were joined by some powerful noblemen who had sworn fidelity to the new King, but who were ready, as usual, to break their oaths, whenever they thought there was anything to be got by it. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> {{in the history of the}} war of the Red and White Roses, is the ease with which these noblemen, who should have set an example of honour to the people, left either side as they took slight offence, or were disappointed in their greedy expectations, and joined the other. Well! Warwick's brother soon beat the Lancastrians, and the false noblemen, being taken, were beheaded without a moment's loss of time. The deposed King had a narrow escape; three of his servants were taken, and one of them bore his cap of estate, which was set with pearls and embroidered with two golden crowns. However, the head to which the cap belonged, got safely into Lancashire, and lay pretty quietly there (the people in the secret being very true) for more than a year. At length, an old monk gave such intelligence as led to Henry's being taken while he was sitting at dinner in a place called Waddington Hall. He was immediately sent to London, and met at Islington by the Earl of Warwick, by whose directions he was put upon a horse, with his legs tied under it, and paraded three times round the pillory. Then, he was carried off to the Tower, where they treated him well enough.|$|E

60|$|It didn't {{seem like}} we {{was the same}} lot that {{was in such a}} state to find land and git ashore, but it was. But we had got over that--clean over it. We was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more, and didn't want to be anywheres else. Why, it seemed just like home; it 'most seemed as if I had been born and raised in it, and Jim and Tom said the same. And always I had had hateful people around me, a-nagging at me, and pestering of me, and scolding, and finding fault, and fussing and bothering, and {{sticking}} to me, and keeping after me, and making me do this, and making me do that and t'other, and always selecting out the things I didn't want to do, and then giving me Sam Hill because I shirked and done something else, and just aggravating the life out of a body all the time; but up here in the sky it was so still and sunshiny and lovely, and plenty to eat, and plenty of sleep, and strange things to see, and no nagging and no pestering, and no good people, and just holiday all the time. Land, I warn't in no hurry to git out and buck at civilization again. Now, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> about civilization is, that anybody that gits a letter with trouble in it comes and tells you all about it and makes you feel bad, and the newspapers fetches you the troubles of everybody all over the world, and keeps you downhearted and dismal 'most all the time, and it's such a heavy load for a person. I hate them newspapers; and I hate letters; and if I had my way I wouldn't allow nobody to load his troubles on to other folks he ain't acquainted with, on t'other side of the world, that way. Well, up in a balloon there ain't any of that, and it's the darlingest place there is.|$|E
60|$|And yet at {{the time}} we seemed to have {{accomplished}} nothing. Before a day or two he had wiped off the ill results of his discomfiture, and, to all appearance, stood as high as ever. As for my Lord Durrisdeer, he was sunk in parental partiality; it was not so much love, which should be an active quality, as an apathy and torpor of his other powers; and forgiveness (so to misapply a noble word) flowed from him in sheer weakness, like the tears of senility. Mrs. Henry's was a different case; and Heaven alone knows what he found to say to her, or how he persuaded her from her contempt. It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> of sentiment, that the voice grows to be more important than the words, and the speaker than that which is spoken. But some excuse the Master must have found, or perhaps he had even struck upon some art to wrest this exposure to his own advantage; for after a time of coldness, it seemed as if things went worse than ever between him and Mrs. Henry. They were then constantly together. I would not be thought to cast one shadow of blame, beyond what is due to a half-wilful blindness, on that unfortunate lady; but I do think, in these last days, she was playing very near the fire; and whether I be wrong or not in that, one thing is sure and quite sufficient: Mr. Henry thought so. The poor gentleman sat for days in my room, so great a picture of distress that I could never venture to address him; yet it is to be thought he found some comfort even in my presence and the knowledge of my sympathy. There were times, too, when we talked, and a strange manner of talk it was; there was never a person named, nor an individual circumstance referred to; yet we had the same matter in our minds, and we were each aware of it. It is a strange art that can thus be practised; to talk for hours of a thing, and never name nor yet so much as hint at it. And I remember I wondered if it was by some such natural skill that the Master made love to Mrs. Henry all day long (as he manifestly did), yet never startled her into reserve.|$|E

Whitman spares us all allusions to the cochineal; he treats evil and sorrow in a spirit almost as of welcome; as an old sea-dog might have welcomed the sight of the enemy's topsails off the Spanish Main.
