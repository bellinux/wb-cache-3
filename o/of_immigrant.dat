40|$|Self-employment is an {{important}} aspect <b>of</b> the <b>immigrant</b> experience in the labor market. Self-employment rates for immigrants exceed 15 percent for some national groups. This paper addresses three related questions on the self-employment experience <b>of</b> <b>immigrants.</b> First, how do self-employment rates <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> compare to those of native-born men? Second, is there an "assimilation" effect on the self-employment propensity <b>of</b> <b>immigrants?</b> Finally, are the more recent waves <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> facing different self-employment opportunities than the earlier waves? Using the 1970 and 1980 U. S. Censuses, the analysis shows that indeed self-employment rates <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> exceed those <b>of</b> native-born men; {{that there is a}} strong, positive impact of assimilation on self-employment rates; and that more recent waves <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> are opting with increasing frequency for the self-employment option...|$|R

5|$|A {{relatively}} {{small proportion of}} total membership comes from Canada. A growing portion of the Canadian demographic is made up <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> members of the church. This is partly the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and partly due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, Niagara Falls, Vineland, Toronto (several), and Waterloo. Although many congregations of various sizes (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.|$|E

3000|$|Immigrants are not equally {{distributed}} across welfare districts in Germany. For example, in East Germany the number <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> is far {{lower than in}} the West, and even in West Germany strong regional disparities can be observed with a higher concentration <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> in cities and urban regions with industrial production. In contrast, rural areas usually exhibit smaller numbers <b>of</b> <b>immigrants.</b> To consider the local labor market conditions specific to the distribution <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> in the estimation of treatment effects, the analysis sample was drawn in a 1 : 1 ratio <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> and native Germans on regional level. In a first step, the sample <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> was randomly drawn from the total inflow population into welfare in 2006. Then, in a second step, for each randomly drawn immigrant from a welfare agency district, one native German was drawn from the same district. Therefore, immigrant-native German ratios are balanced across districts and should mitigate regional imbalances in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>immigrants.</b> 9 [...]...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1906, most {{leaders from}} Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission. These {{missions}} were largely composed <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> or ethnic groups. The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of growth for the movement, since Seymour's approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate {{that had already been}} taking root in those areas. Other new missions were based on preachers who had charisma and energy. Nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants and the poor.|$|E
5|$|Contact between English and {{immigrant}} languages {{has given rise}} to new accents and dialects. For instance, the variety of English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian. At a local level, the diversity <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in {{the country as a whole}} have strongholds in Northern towns: Pashto is spoken natively by 0.08% of the population of England but 0.7% of the population of Bradford, while Cantonese is the first language of 0.4% of the population of Manchester compared to 0.08% nationally.|$|E

5|$|In many cases, {{large groups}} <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> Han would unite under a common surname {{to form a}} brotherhood.

The brotherhood groups would link their names to a family tree, in essence {{manufacturing}} a genealogy based on names rather than blood, and taking the place of the kinship organizations commonly found in China. The practice was so widespread that today's family books are largely unreliable. Many Plains Aborigines joined the brotherhoods to gain protection of the collective as a type of insurance policy against regional strife, and through these groups they took on a Han identity with a Han lineage.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} student demonstrations took place in 1814, when students gathered on the Green to celebrate Napoleon's defeat in Europe. At {{the height of the}} Vietnam War in the late 1960s, the Green regularly saw antiwar demonstrations, some attracting up to a thousand protesters. A 1969 protest over the presence of the campus Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program culminated in the occupation of Parkhurst Hall, the College's administration building. In 1986, students constructed shanties on the Green to encourage the College to divest from South African companies supporting Apartheid; staffers of the conservative newspaper The Dartmouth Review took sledgehammers to the structures. More recently, the Green was the location of a controversial 2006 May Day rally in favor <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> rights.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Evans argue that, despite {{suffrage}} in Wales {{being introduced}} {{by a new}} generation <b>of</b> <b>immigrant</b> middle-class women, {{there was still a}} definite 'Welshness' to the ideology fostered by the nation, which was at loggerheads with their English counterparts. Wales had shown an independent resistance to the EFF and David Lloyd George was still a national institution, despite his prominent role in the government making him an obvious target for disruption. In 1911, after the Women's Coronation Procession, Edith Mansell Moullin formed the Cymric Suffrage Union, a Welsh society based in London. It attempted to link women's suffrage with Wales and Welshness, and sought to unite both Welsh men and women living in the capital to their cause. They distributed hand-bills written in Welsh to the Welsh chapels in London and translated pamphlets of the Conciliation Bill. The Union also expressed their nationality through dressing in traditional Welsh costume during parades and unlike many unions in Wales actually addressed their membership in Welsh as well as the English language at meetings. In 1912 after Lloyd George scuppered the third Conciliation Bill, Mansell Moullin quit the organisation and formed the Forward Cymric Suffrage Union, which had a more militant policy. Members wore red dragon badges with the motto 'O Iesu, n'ad Gamwaith' ('Oh Jesus do not allow unfairness').|$|E

30|$|An {{additional}} {{advantage of}} using the aggregated data is that it becomes possible to address the potential endogeneity <b>of</b> the <b>immigrant</b> share using an instrumental variable strategy. The instrument is an adaptation of the Card (2001) shift-share instrument. Specifically, I calculate for every three-digit industry the predicted number <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> assuming that the post- 1989 distribution <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> across industries {{was the same as}} the one in 1983. The distribution <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> across industries in 1983 is calculated using the Israeli Census, and immigrants are defined to be those individuals who migrated to Israel after 1971. The rationale for this instrument is that it isolates only the part of the variation in the immigrant share due to the tendency <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> to be employed in sectors where previous cohorts <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> were employed (perhaps because newer cohorts <b>of</b> <b>immigrants</b> are referred to jobs by less recent immigrants in the industries in which they are employed). Thus, the instrument should be uncorrelated with any productivity shocks at the industry level that occurred after 1989.|$|R
