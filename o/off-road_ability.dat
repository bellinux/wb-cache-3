25|$|This period saw Land Rover {{market the}} utility Land Rover {{as a private}} {{recreational}} vehicle. While the basic pick-up, 4x4 and van versions were still working vehicles, the County 4x4s were sold as multi-purpose family vehicles, featuring improved interior trim and more comfortable seats. This change was reflected in Land Rover starting what had long been common practice in the car industry— detail changes and improvements to the County model {{from year to year}} in order to attract new buyers and to encourage existing owners to trade in for a new vehicle. These changes included different exterior styling graphics and colour options, and the introduction of new options, such as radio-cassette players, Rostyle wheels, headlamp wash and wipe systems, as well as accessories such as surfboard carriers and bike racks. The switch from leaf spring to coil spring suspension was {{a key part of the}} new model's success. It offered improved <b>off-road</b> <b>ability,</b> load capacity, handling, and ride comfort.|$|E
25|$|The Series III {{continued}} {{this success}} in the early 1970s, but {{from the middle of}} the decade sales declined. A large coal export deal to Japan relied on the subsequent import of Japanese cars and other goods, a combination of this increasing competition and increasingly poor quality of the components being shipped from Britain meant that Land Rover's dominance slipped. A problem specific to Australia was the always-limited supply of new Land Rovers. Leyland's factory never had the capacity to meet possible demand and the need to import almost the entire vehicle in kit form from Britain restricted the supply and manufacturing process further. This led to a long waiting list developing for the Leyland product whilst commercial operators could receive large fleets of Japanese vehicles very quickly. The other problems faced by Land Rover were the same throughout its export markets- compared to the Japanese competition, the Land Rover was underpowered, unreliable and slow with a poor ride quality, despite their superior <b>off-road</b> <b>ability.</b> Poor rust-proofing and low-quality steel used in comparison to the Japanese vehicles turned the buyers away in large numbers and by 1983, with the introduction of the One Ten, the Toyota Land Cruiser became the best-selling 4×4 in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1960s, Rover was {{becoming}} aware of the embryonic development of the sports utility vehicle in North America. Proto SUVs such as the International Harvester Scout (1961) and the Ford Bronco (1966) began the skew of 4x4s towards speed and comfort while retaining more than adequate <b>off-road</b> <b>ability</b> for most private users. The Jeep Wagoneer proved the concept further in the direction Rover had several times attempted, but with more power. [...] To provide Rover a nudge to step up, {{the president of the}} company's USA operations shipped a Land Rover Series II to Britain 88 fitted with an advanced small block all-aluminum Buick V8 engine.|$|E
5000|$|They {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{industries}} for their maneuverability and <b>off-roading</b> <b>ability.</b> These include: ...|$|R
50|$|In Japan, it was {{exclusive}} to Nissan Bluebird Shop locations, {{where it was}} called the Terrano as a smaller companion to the larger Nissan Safari. While the Pathfinder/Terrano was essentially based on the newly introduced Hardbody truck, the rear five link coil suspension was borrowed from the Safari to enhance its <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities.</b> The two door version was installed with the VG30E Nissan V6, that was shared with the Fairlady ZX.|$|R
50|$|The Tatra 26 is {{a vintage}} 6x4 {{automobile}} {{produced by the}} Czech manufacturer Tatra in the late 1920s and early 1930s. It was developed {{on the basis of}} the T 12. However, tests showed that the engine from T 12 did not have enough power, and it was replaced by the Tatra 30 engine. The car had extreme <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities</b> - reportedly it was even able to climb staircases.|$|R
2500|$|The ERAD {{system could}} propel the LRX to speeds {{of up to}} [...] before the engine was started by an {{integrated}} starter generator {{as part of the}} stop-start system. ERAD was designed to reduce [...] emissions by an average of 20percent under the NEDC test cycle and was expected to offer another 10percent reduction in extra-urban driving situations while also optimising the <b>off-road</b> <b>ability</b> of the vehicle. Land Rover aimed to achieve 120g/km [...] emissions and fuel economy of [...] on the European combined cycle with an efficient 2.2-litre turbodiesel engine. [...] The engine would become the only four-cylinder vehicle in the Range Rover lineup.|$|E
2500|$|Rover {{acknowledged}} the emerging recreational off-road market in 1967 under Charles Spencer King, {{and began the}} [...] "100-inch Station Wagon" [...] program to develop a radical competitor. Rover bought a Bronco, which featured the sort of long-travel coil spring suspension necessary for the required blend of luxury car comfort and Land Rover's proven <b>off-road</b> <b>ability.</b> [...] King {{is said to have}} been convinced of coil springs while driving a Rover P6 across rough scrubland on part of the Solihull factory site that was being redeveloped. [...] He was also convinced that a permanent four-wheel drive transmission was needed both to provide adequate handling and reliably absorb the power required for the vehicle to be competitive. The cost of developing a totally new transmission was spread between the 100-inch SW project and one working on what would become the Land Rover 101 Forward Control. Powerful, light and sturdy, the Buick alloy V8 earned off-road modifications such as carburetors that maintained fuel supply at extreme angles and provision for cranking the engine with a starting handle in emergencies.|$|E
5000|$|Tank evasion / Test: <b>off-road</b> <b>ability.</b> Clarkson {{discovered}} {{whether a}} Challenger 2 tank could lock its main cannon on to a Range Rover Sport. Series Six, Episode One ...|$|E
25|$|The {{design has}} a {{monocoque}} (unibody) construction with four-wheel independent air suspension. Air suspension allowed variable ride height and achieved similar axle articulation {{to the previous}} live axle design. This retained <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities</b> while improving on-road performance. The new Range Rover's introduction in late 2002 as a 2003 model for the North American market resulted in the Range Rover and Ford Expedition (also new for 2003) being the only two SUVs in the full-size sport utility class with four-wheel independent suspension systems at that time.|$|R
50|$|First {{produced}} in 1993, {{the car was}} available with either a petrol 2.8 and 3.2-litre inline six-cylinder Mercedes-Benz M104 engine, a Mercedes-Benz M111 engine 2.3-litre inline four-cylinder petrol engine, or a 2.3-litre four-cylinder and 2.9-litre five-cylinder diesel engines (Mercedes-Benz OM601 and OM602) with natural aspiration or turbo intercooler (from 1997). The car was designed by Briton Ken Greenley and received the Auto Design Award from the Birmingham Auto Show hosted in 1994 and 1996. Also known for its <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities,</b> the vehicle won the Rallye des Pharaons for 4WD vehicles in October 1994. A facelifted version has been available since 1998.|$|R
50|$|The Mitsubishi Outlander is a {{mid-size}} crossover {{manufactured by}} Japanese automaker Mitsubishi. It was originally {{known as the}} Mitsubishi Airtrek when it was introduced in Japan in 2001, and {{was based on the}} Mitsubishi ASX concept vehicle exhibited at the 2001 North American International Auto Show. It was sold at Mitsubishi Japan dealership chain called Car Plaza. The ASX (Active Sports Crossover) represented Mitsubishi's approach to the industry wide SUV trend for retaining the all-season and <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities</b> offered by a high ground clearance and four-wheel drive, while still offering car-like levels of emissions, economy and size.|$|R
50|$|Approach and {{departure}} angles are {{indicators of}} <b>off-road</b> <b>ability</b> of the vehicle: they indicate how steep obstacles, such as rocks or logs, the vehicle can negotiate {{according to its}} body shape alone.|$|E
5000|$|To {{improve its}} <b>off-road</b> <b>ability</b> over a {{standard}} F-150, the Raptor is {{fitted with a}} torque-on-demand transfer case, 13" [...] travel front and 13.9" [...] travel rear Fox Racing suspension, and all-terrain 35" [...] tires and wheels.|$|E
50|$|The {{base model}} version has {{front wheel drive}} (FWD). The Trail Rated version of the Compass has passed the same testing of <b>off-road</b> <b>ability</b> as other Jeep {{vehicles}} in terms of traction, ground clearance, maneuverability, articulation, and water fording.|$|E
50|$|The Land Cruiser 60 {{series was}} {{produced}} from 1980 through 1990 for most markets but the Cumana Plant in Venezuela continued until 1992 for their local market. It is a front engine, four door wagon which can seat {{five to eight}} people. Like all Land Cruiser generations, {{it is well known}} in the off-road world for its <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities</b> but was somewhat limited by its awkward departure angles. The 60 series was available in the following solid exterior colors: Alpine White, Brown, Desert Beige, Freeborn Red, Royal Blue; and in the following metallic exterior colors: Charcoal Gray, Cognac, Gray-Blue, Rootbeer, Sky Blue, Stardust Silver.|$|R
50|$|The Pinzgauer has {{a chassis}} design which {{contributes}} to its high mobility. It has a central tube chassis with a transaxle which distributes the weight more evenly, {{and keeps the}} centre of gravity as low as possible. The differentials are all sealed units and require minimal additional lubrication. The Pinzgauer also has portal axles like the Unimog to provide extra clearance over obstacles. The 710 4×4 was the more popular variant, but the Pinzgauer was designed {{to have a very}} capable 6×6 configuration from the start. The rear suspension {{on the back of the}} 6×6 712 is designed to provide maximum traction in the most demanding circumstances along with increasing its towing, load carrying, and <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Development {{started in}} 1972, {{focusing}} on <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities</b> and maximum safety and comfort; with a cooperative agreement between Daimler-Benz and Steyr-Daimler-Puch in Graz, Austria. Mercedes-Benz engineers in Stuttgart {{were in charge}} of design and testing, while the team in Graz developed the production plans. The first wooden model was presented to Daimler-Benz management in 1973, with the first drivable prototype beginning various testing including German coalfields, the Sahara Desert, and the Arctic Circle in 1974. Construction commenced on a new production facility in Graz, where the new cross-country vehicle would be assembled nearly entirely by hand in 1975, with production of the [...] "G Model" [...] beginning in Graz in 1979. In 1980, the Vatican took delivery of a specially made G-Wagen outfitted with a clear thermoplastic top which served as the Popemobile. The “Papa G” later took up permanent residence at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany.|$|R
50|$|The UAZ-469 and its {{modifications}} {{have gained}} a dedicated following {{because of its}} <b>off-road</b> <b>ability,</b> reliability and simplicity. Off-road enthusiasts welcome it as a lower-cost and better alternative to the American Jeep, British Land Rover and Japanese Land Cruiser.|$|E
50|$|Upon its introduction, the Himalayan {{was praised}} for its good {{suspension}} and <b>off-road</b> <b>ability,</b> while some criticism {{was directed to}} the relatively low power output of the engine. The motorcycle also features longer intervals between servicing and oil changes.|$|E
50|$|The Massif is {{fitted with}} {{parabolic}} suspension all round, {{as opposed to}} the coil springs of its contemporary the Land Rover Defender. The parabolic suspension system is arranged with double bladed springs on the front axle and four bladed springs on the rear axle. The Massif is fitted with hydraulic dampers on the front axle, gas dampers on the rear axle and anti-roll bars at both front and rear to give a compromise of on-road handling and <b>off-road</b> <b>ability.</b> The parabolic suspension system can be regarded as a cost-effective compromise between the simplicity and load carrying ability of leaf springs and the better comfort and axle articulation (and thus <b>off-road</b> <b>ability)</b> of coil springs.|$|E
5000|$|While some survivalists {{recommend}} {{living at}} a rural retreat year-round, most survivalists cannot {{afford to do}} so. Therefore, they rely on keeping a well-stocked retreat, and plan to go there [...] "at the 11th hour", as necessary. They keep a bug-out bag handy, and may have a dedicated bug-out vehicle (BOV). This is a vehicle that the owner keeps prepared {{in the event of}} the need for an emergency evacuation. Typically a BOV is equipped with a variation on the bug-out bag that includes additional automotive supplies, clothing, food and water. Survivalists tend to favor four wheel drive trucks and SUVs due to their greater <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities.</b> In the event of a nuclear catastrophe, survivalists may opt into maintaining an older vehicle since it most likely lacks critical electronic components that would otherwise be damaged by the electromagnetic pulse that accompanies a nuclear explosion.|$|R
50|$|The Honda XRV650 (produced from 1988 to 1989) was {{the second}} twin {{cylinder}} production trail bike by Honda, the first one being the Honda XLV750R produced from 1983 to 1986. It was the first twin cylinder model in the XR series and as such started the XRV series, but it was soon replaced by the Honda XRV750 in 1990. The 650cc model was built in Japan by Honda Racing Corporation and is arguably a better built bike than following versions of XRVs, which were standard production models. It came as both single and double headlight variations, and featured a slightly tuned 650cc engine similar to the Honda Transalp (XL600V and XL650V) and high specification chassis components, leading to its rather brief production run. With an aftermarket larger capacity tank and very few other modifications the bike was entered in the marathon class of the Paris Dakar Rally, revealing its surprisingly good <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities</b> - despite its 200 kg weight, hence it belongs firmly to the XR range. It is the most sought after model of the Africa Twin XRV range and is fast becoming a collector's item, especially in Europe.|$|R
50|$|The {{most popular}} form of {{transport}} in Toorak is the automobile. CityLink runs along north eastern Toorak, {{though there are}} no interchanges within the suburb, although there is access to the freeway via MacRobertson Bridge and interchanges at Burnley. Main arterials running north-south are Williams Road (at the eastern boundary), Grange Road, Orrong Road, St Georges Road and Kooyong Road. The east-west arterials include Alexandra Avenue (at the northern boundary), Toorak Road (which runs midway through the suburb) and Malvern Road (at the southern boundary). Alexandra Avenue becomes St Georges Road and both along with Grange Road feed onto the MacRobertson Bridge, Toorak's main river crossing. Toorak's road planning {{is an example of}} street hierarchy. As a result, there are numerous quiet pedestrian streets. However, traffic congestion is an increasing problem along Toorak Road and Williams Roads. There is limited street parking along the main roads with just a couple of multi-storey car parks and parking lots within proximity of the main Toorak Road shopping strip. There are no level crossings in Toorak. There is a popular culture perception of Sport utility vehicle as status symbol (controversial for their luxury use, rather than for their <b>off-road</b> <b>abilities)</b> and this has been associated with the suburb of Toorak, such that in popular Australian culture, terms such as Toorak tractor, Toorak taxi, Toorak tank, or Toorak truck have become well established in Australian slang as pejoratives. An example of this was an episode of the popular program Top Gear Australia, aired on SBS TV, in which the presenters, tongue-in-cheek, drove a $200,000 tractor along Toorak Road.|$|R
50|$|In a {{first for}} the category, the Africa Twin has the option of an {{evolution}} of Honda's automatic dual-clutch transmission (DCT) technology, which remains unique to Honda in motorcycling. This latest evolution of DCT has been specifically developed and programmed to provide <b>off-road</b> <b>ability.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Massif is also {{fitted with}} manual-locking {{free-wheeling}} hubs {{on the front}} axles which prevent the rotation of front axle components, supposedly to reduce wear. An optional limited slip rear differential was also available to improve <b>off-road</b> <b>ability</b> by reducing the chance of getting cross-axled.|$|E
50|$|Finally in 1988, a 3.0-liter SOHC V6 {{engine was}} made available, {{alongside}} a 2.5-liter turbo diesel engine, {{with the first}} 4x4 intercooler. This translated to better acceleration in mid to high rev ranges. The long-wheelbase models got a coil link suspension system for better ride comfort and <b>off-road</b> <b>ability.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} multipurpose engineering machine on the wheeled chassis was presented in the paper. The machine meets a series of specific requirements such as: <b>off-road</b> prowess, <b>ability</b> of movement with high speed on hard-surface roads, limited weight and dimensions at the maintaining of great hoisting capacity. These requirements were adjusted to the present character of warfare {{and that is why}} the machine construction deviates from classic working machines being used in the civil sector. The meeting of defined requirements required the development of innovative methods. The solution aiming at the increasing the stability of the machine by the application of using a sliding drive unit was described. As a result of that, the increased capacity and efficiency of mined materials were obtained. Additionally, the system of two telescopic arms was applied, so that the efficiency was improved by the shortening of machine working cycles and it is possible to change the length of arms as well as both telescopic arms were placed on the rotating body achieving in such a manner the big workspace for arms. The 3 D model of a multipurpose engineering machine and model with rear mounted drive unit and raised and extended arms are presented in the pape...|$|R
5000|$|In 1979, the U.S. Army drafted final {{specifications}} for a High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), {{which was to}} replace all the tactical vehicles in the 1/4 to 1 1/4-ton range, namely the M151 quarter-ton jeep and M561 Gama Goat, as one [...] "jack-of-all-trades" [...] light tactical vehicle to perform the role of several existing trucks. The specification called for excellent on and <b>off-road</b> performance, the <b>ability</b> to carry a large payload, and improved survivability against indirect fire. Compared to the jeep, it was larger and had a much wider track, with a 16 in ground clearance, double that of most sport-utility vehicles. The new truck was to climb a 60 percent incline and traverse a 40 percent slope. The air intake was to be mounted flush {{on top of the}} right fender (or to be raised on a stovepipe to roof level to ford 5 ft of water and electronics waterproofed to drive through 2.5 ft of water were specified. The radiator was to be mounted high, sloping over the engine on a forward-hinged hood.|$|R
50|$|It {{features}} an updated body and 1.7-litre gasoline engine with fuel injection. Although {{the body and}} the interiors are new, it is still based on the old VAZ 2121 engine, transmission and most mechanicals. Its <b>off-road</b> <b>ability</b> is exemplary compared with many modern budget SUVs, having been designed for tough tundra territory.|$|E
5000|$|... ===2003-2006=== Debuting in 2002, {{the first}} {{generation}} Sorento was a traditional truck-based body-on-frame SUV. It was offered in two trim levels: LX and EX. All American Sorentos also came with dual front airbags and dual side-curtain airbags {{in the front and}} rear. An optional four-wheel drive system with low range received praise for adding to the vehicle's <b>off-road</b> <b>ability.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This street {{version of}} the XR250R had road legal lights and tires, a metal fuel tank, keyed ignition/steering lock, plus other minor changes. Some 40 lb heavier, it had reduced <b>off-road</b> <b>ability.</b> It shared the XR250R's RFVC [...] engine, but with a {{different}} carburetor and 3 mm smaller exhaust headers to meet emissions requirements. It was manufactured from 1991-2007.|$|E
50|$|GM-AvtoVAZ, a {{joint venture}} between AvtoVAZ and General Motors, {{produces}} the Chevrolet Niva. (previously known as VAZ-2123 Niva in domestic market). It features an updated body and 1.7-litre gasoline engine with fuel injection. Although the body and the interiors are new, it is still based on the old VAZ 2121 engine, transmission and most mechanicals.

50|$|ATV-based {{tanks are}} ATVs fitted with turrets and {{protective}} coverings. The level of involvement varies here as well; some are simply quads or similar {{fitted with a}} removable netting cage, others feature scratch-built bodies and turrets and are capable of housing several players and their equipment. All-terrain vehicles, Golf carts and amphibious ATVs {{are the most popular}} bases for ATV tanks, thanks to ready availability, <b>off-road</b> <b>ability</b> and low price. Almost anything can be put onto these vehicles.|$|E
50|$|A {{sport utility}} vehicle or {{suburban}} utility vehicle (SUV) is a vehicle classified as a light truck, but operated as a family vehicle. SUVs are similar to a large station wagon or estate car, though typically featuring tall interior packaging, high H-point seating, high center of gravity, high ground-clearance and especially four- or all-wheel-drive capability for on- or <b>off-road</b> <b>ability.</b> Some SUVs include the towing capacity {{of a pickup truck}} with the passenger-carrying space of a minivan or large sedan.|$|E
