5|$|A {{critical}} edition did {{not appear}} until 1980, when the Edizioni musicali Otos in Florence published a version faithful to the composer's intentions, edited by Angelo Coan. Three new editions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> version were prepared celebrating Rossin's 200th anniversary in 1992: two critical editions by Oxford and Carus-Verlag, and one by Novello, with only one piano part.|$|E
5|$|Usher {{sang the}} song on his 2008 One Night Stand: Ladies Only tour. He began the song {{seated at a}} grand piano, while a female backup dancer removed Usher's shirt and, while wearing the shirt herself, lay on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{immediately}} following the First World War, Henry Cowell composed a number of piano pieces featuring tone clusters and direct manipulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano's</b> strings. One <b>of</b> these, titled <b>The</b> Banshee (1925), features sliding and shrieking sounds suggesting <b>the</b> terrifying cry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> banshee from Irish folklore.|$|R
5|$|In the November/December 1982 {{issue of}} American Film, Chuck Ross {{claimed that he}} retyped the {{screenplay}} to Casablanca, changing the title back to Everybody Comes to Rick's and the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> player to Dooley Wilson, and submitted it to 217 agencies. Eighty-five of them read it; of those, thirty-eight rejected it outright, thirty-three generally recognized it (but only eight specifically as Casablanca), three declared it commercially viable, and one suggested {{turning it into a}} novel.|$|E
5|$|Never {{was there}} such a dame school as ours, so firm and kind and smelling of galoshes, with the sweet and fumbled music <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> lessons {{drifting}} down from upstairs to the lonely schoolroom, where only the sometimes tearful wicked sat over undone sums, or to repent a little crime– the pulling of a girl's hair during geography, the sly shin kick under the table during English literature.|$|E
5|$|The Piano Concerto No. 24 in C minor, K. 491, is a concerto {{composed}} by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart for keyboard (usually a piano or fortepiano) and orchestra. Mozart composed the concerto {{in the winter}} of 1785–1786, finishing it on 24 March 1786, three weeks after the completion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Piano</b> Concerto in A major. As Mozart intended to perform the work himself, the soloist's part was not fully written down. The premiere was in early April 1786 at the Burgtheater in Vienna. Chronologically the work is the twentieth of Mozart's 23 original piano concertos.|$|E

500|$|Sorabji's piano {{writing has}} been praised by some for its variety and {{understanding}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano's</b> sonorities. His approach to <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> was non-percussive, and he emphasised that his music is conceived vocally. He once described Opus clavicembalisticum as [...] "a colossal song", and Geoffrey Douglas Madge {{said that his}} piano playing had {{much in common with}} bel canto singing. Sorabji once said, [...] "If a composer can't sing, a composer can't compose." ...|$|R

5|$|The {{finale of}} the A major Sonata, uses as its main theme, a {{transformation}} of an earlier theme from the second movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Piano</b> Sonata in A minor, D. 537. Schubert introduced some changes to the original melody, which make it conform better with the sonata's basic motifs, {{in accordance with the}} cyclical scheme of the sonata. Another allusion to an earlier piano work appears {{in the middle of the}} sonata's slow movement: after the climax in the middle section of the Andantino, appears a passage (bars 147–158) that closely recalls bars 35–39 from the Impromptu in G-flat major, D. 899.|$|E
5|$|The {{melodic line}} of part B is {{contrasting}} in both its static {{character and the}} vehemence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> accompaniment, and by the double forte dynamics, as much by the double forte dynamics which give a brutal character, as {{by the use of}} sequences (E major to begin with, then B major, G major, E major, etc.). This section ends with a chromatic descent in the accompaniment at quadruple piano dynamic, up to a dominant seventh of G major, to prepare the return of the second section A in the original key.|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams wrote four concertos: for violin (1925), piano (1926), oboe (1944) and tuba (1954); another concertante {{piece is}} his Romance for harmonica, strings and piano (1951). None {{of these works}} has rivalled the {{popularity}} of the symphonies or the short orchestral works mentioned above. Bartók was among the admirers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Piano</b> Concerto, written for and championed by Harriet Cohen, but it has remained, {{in the words of the}} critic Andrew Achenbach, a neglected masterpiece.|$|E

40|$|Piano tones are inharmonic due to <b>the</b> {{stiffness}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strings. Most data-reduced synthesis techniques, such as wavetable synthesis, produce harmonic sounds. This makes matching piano tones problematic {{with these}} methods. This work introduces an automated group synthesis method for matching piano tones using genetic algorithm optimization. The new method allows simulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano's</b> inharmonicity. We have matched various tones from the lowest {{to the highest}} range on <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> and our listening tests indicate the matched tones are indistinguishable from the originals...|$|R
50|$|According to {{longtime}} NYC radio personality Dave Herman (who can {{be heard}} {{at the beginning and}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album), Elton John cut his hand at some point during the performance, and by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show, <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> keys were covered with blood.|$|R
5|$|According to its May 1853 {{advertisement}} in the Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser, {{the institute}} provided instruction {{to the following}} grades during its summer session: fifth grade for $5, fourth grade for $8, third grade for $10, second grade for $12, and first grade (its highest grade) for $15. Boarding, including laundry, meals, and lighting, was $45, and music lessons with use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> were $25. An additional fee of 25 cents was charged if a student was suspended. The fifth grade was taught by the institute's Primary Department, and lessons included spelling, reading and elementary arithmetic. The fourth grade was taught by the institute's Junior Department and included courses in writing and preparatory English grammar and geography. The third grade was instructed by the English Department and offered studies in geography and English; and the second grade was also taught by the English Department with courses in history and natural philosophy. The school's highest grade, first grade, was instructed by the Classical and Mathematical Department and offered studies in Greek, Latin, French, geometry, algebra, trigonometry, surveying, mensuration, navigation, astronomy, and bookkeeping.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1802, Wrexham was visited by a troupe of {{travelling}} comedians. One of the leaders, who had heard Randles play, requested that she performed with them. Before the age of two, she joined the troupe at Wrexham theatre to play Ar hyd y nos and The Downfall of Paris. There, she played her pieces with an apple and slice of cake on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> receiving both when she finished for playing well. Over the next nine months, Randles played at the houses of Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, Lady Dungannon and Lady Cunliffe. Williams-Wynn proposed that Randles play in a Wrexham concert {{during the spring of}} 1803, {{under the direction of the}} Welsh harpist John Parry. The concert was postponed a number of times due to the illness of Randles' mother, who insisted they carry on without her. On the night of the concert, Randles' mother died, after hearing that it was a success.|$|E
5|$|John Stainer was {{the eighth}} of nine {{children}} born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840. At least three of the children died in infancy, and John was much younger than his brother, William, and his three sisters, Ann, Sarah and Mary. The family lived in Southwark, London, where {{his father was a}} cabinet maker and later a vestry clerk and registrar of births. He was also an untaught musician and player <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> violin and flute. He built a small chamber organ at home on which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin. His sister Ann also used it – she was the regular organist at Magdalen Hospital, Streatham. It was a happy family, and young John seems to have been spoiled by his elders. He was precocious and could play Bach's Fugue in E major at the age of seven.|$|E

2500|$|Still in 2011, Hayman's next solo album, <b>The</b> Ship's <b>Piano,</b> was released, {{an album}} {{recorded}} entirely on a 1933 fold-away <b>piano,</b> <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> <b>piano</b> often found [...] "crammed into <b>the</b> corners <b>of</b> seafaring parlours". Hayman told Clash that <b>the</b> <b>piano</b> is <b>the</b> first instrument he owned that {{was older than}} he was and that the title song is about an imagined history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano's</b> former owners. <b>The</b> record was written while Hayman was recovering from a head injury [...] "which rendered him extra sensitive to sound". In December 2011 The Hosting Couple by Rotifer was released, with whom Hayman was the bass player at the time, alongside frontman Robert Rotifer and former Thrashing Dove Ian Button.|$|R

5|$|The Nord Stage is multitimbral – each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Piano,</b> Organ, and Synth {{sections}} {{can sound}} independently. There are two Panels – A and B – {{each of which}} provides a separate configuration of the three sections within a single Program. Panels can be played independently, {{with one of the}} panels being controlled via an external MIDI keyboard controller, or they can be layered together, allowing for a maximum of 6 part multitimbral. Most of the buttons and knobs on the Stage, such as volume, instrument selection, drawbar levels (for organ) or filter controls (for synthesizer) can also be adjusted by the external keyboard.|$|E

5|$|The {{instrument}} {{evolved from}} Rhodes' attempt to manufacture pianos to teach recovering soldiers during World War II under a strict budget, and development continued throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Fender started marketing the Piano Bass, a cut-down version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> but the full-size instrument {{did not appear}} until after the sale to CBS in 1965. CBS oversaw mass production of the Rhodes piano in the 1970s, and it was used extensively through the decade, particularly in jazz, pop, and soul music. It fell out of fashion {{for a while in}} the mid-1980s, principally due to the emergence of polyphonic and later digital synthesizers, especially the Yamaha DX7, and partly through inconsistent quality control in production due to cost-cutting measures. The company was eventually sold to Roland, which manufactured digital versions of the Rhodes without authorization or approval from its inventor.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Gaga, {{dressed in black}} clothing, sunglasses, bloody feet, and {{seemingly}} bionic features, walking through a field in Nebraska; having returned on foot after years of absence. Gaga goes to buy ice cream from an ice cream truck, but she suddenly drops it as a toothless man with a doll in his hand grins at her. She begins to have flashbacks to an earlier time spent in Nebraska as scenes of Gaga having a wedding, being tortured by a man inside a barn, and being inside a water tank appear in quick succession. The song starts playing as the camera zooms slowly towards Gaga, who is standing bent forward as she begins singing. The video continually switches to scenes where Gaga, with little make up, a simple gray-colored hair style, and a white dress, plays a piano {{in the middle of}} a cornfield, while her male alter ego, Jo Calderone, sits on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> smoking and drinking a beer. As Calderone pulls up his sleeves, present day Gaga is still walking through the desert.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piano,</b> {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E
