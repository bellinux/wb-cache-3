5|$|With these exceptions, {{most of the}} {{decoration}} and the fittings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> date from the 19thcentury and are {{in keeping with the}} Gothic Revival promoted by the Oxford Movement and Augustus Welby Pugin. The restored vault <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> is typical of the period, having been designed by Scott and decorated and gilded by Clayton and Bell.|$|E
5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An {{example of this}} is his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of the}} voices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir,</b> recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year's Eve.|$|E

5|$|The aisles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> {{previously}} both extended {{on either}} side of the Lady Chapel. The south aisle was shortened in about 1870 by George Gilbert Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of StErasmus. The eastern end of the north aisle contains the chapel of St Werburgh.|$|E
5|$|The late 20th century saw an {{extensive}} restoration programme, particularly {{of the west}} front. The stained glass is currently under restoration, with a programme underway to conserve the large 14th-century Jesse Tree window at the eastern terminal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir.</b>|$|E
5|$|The vault of {{the nave}} rises steeply {{in a simple}} quadripartite form, {{in harmony with the}} nave arcade. The eastern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> was {{extended}} and the whole upper part elaborated {{in the second quarter of}} the 14th century by William Joy. The vault has a multiplicity of ribs in a net-like form, which is very different from that of the nave, and is perhaps a recreation in stone of a local type of compartmented wooden roof of which examples remain from the 15th century, including those at St Cuthbert's Church, Wells. The vaults of the aisles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> also have a unique pattern.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor thesis titled Current church choirs in Prague {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} and description of ten mixed choirs, aktive at major temples in Prague. <b>The</b> content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapters focuses on <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choirs,</b> their location, organizational structure, repertoire, released CDs, atmosphere and cooperation within <b>the</b> <b>choirs</b> and parishes. Interviews with the choirmasters, a survey with <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choirs</b> and other available materials are <b>the</b> sources <b>of</b> information for my thesis. <b>The</b> outcome <b>of</b> this work is to summarize and compare the obtained information...|$|R
5|$|After {{the fire}} of 1270, a {{programme}} of reconstruction was launched, with repairs and a major enlargement. Outer aisles {{were added to the}} nave, the eastern wing comprising the choir and presbytery was doubled in length and had aisles provided on its north and south sides, and the octagonal chapterhouse was built off the new north choir aisle (Figs. 8 & 9). The new northern and southern aisles ran the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir,</b> past the first bay of the presbytery, and contained recessed and chest tombs. The south aisle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> contained the tomb of bishop John of Winchester, suggesting a completion date for the reconstructed aisle between 1435 and 1460 (Fig. 10). Chapels were added to the new outer aisles of the nave and were partitioned from each other with wooden screens. The first bay at the west end of each of these aisles and adjacent to the western towers did not contain a chapel but instead had an access door for the laity.|$|E
5|$|Egan and the {{trustees}} of St. Mary's established a singing school in 1804, {{with the goal}} of improving the quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> there. The following year was consumed by another yellow fever outbreak, and Egan joined John Rossiter, the pastor of another of Philadelphia's four Catholic churches, St. Joseph's, in ministering to the sick. In 1806, they worked with the parishioners of a third church, Holy Trinity, to found an orphanage, as the problem of orphaned children had been made worse by the yellow fever deaths.|$|E
5|$|The Lady Chapel to {{the eastern}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> dates from between 1265 and 1290. It is of three bays, and {{contains}} the Shrine of StWerburgh, dating from the 14thcentury. The vault of the Lady Chapel {{is the only one}} in the cathedral that is of stone. It is decorated with carved roof bosses representing the Trinity, the Madonna and Child, and the murder of Thomas Becket. The chapel also has a sedilia and a piscina.|$|E

50|$|During <b>the</b> show, each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choirs</b> {{presents}} their Top Tune to the judges, {{and then}} the Surprise Medley occurs, in which all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choirs</b> sing part (45 seconds) <b>of</b> a medley. <b>The</b> judges then deliberate, and send one group to <b>the</b> next stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition, and immediately eliminate another group. After that, <b>the</b> two <b>choirs</b> remaining are left to sing their Battle Tunes, one straight after the other, and the judges decide who gets promoted to <b>the</b> next leg <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition and who gets eliminated.|$|R
5|$|The Reformation {{brought a}} period of decline in the cathedral's music which was revived under Dean Thomas Neville in the early 17th century. Neville {{introduced}} instrumentalists into the cathedral's music who played cornett and sackbut, probably members of the city's band of waits. The cathedral acquired sets of recorders, lutes and viols for the use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> boys and lay-clerks.|$|E
5|$|The misericords {{date from}} 1330 to 1340. They {{may have been}} carved under the {{direction}} of master carpenter John Strode, although his name is not recorded before 1341. He was assisted by Bartholomew Quarter, who is documented from 1343. They originally numbered ninety, of which sixty-five have survived. Sixty-one are installed in the choir, three are displayed in the cathedral and one is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum. New stalls were ordered when the eastern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> was extended in the early 14th century. The canons complained that they had borne the cost of the rebuilding and ordered that the prebendary clerics should pay for their own stalls. When the newly refurbished choir opened in 1339 many misericords were left unfinished, including one-fifth of the surviving 65. Many of the clerics had not paid, and were required to contribute a total sum of £200. The misericords survived better than the other sections of the stalls, which, during the Protestant Reformation, had their canopies chopped off and galleries inserted above them. One of the misericords, depicting a boy pulling a thorn from his foot, dates from the 17th century. In 1848 there was a complete rearrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> furniture, and 61 of the misericords were reused in the restructured stalls.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> is {{the set of}} choir stalls, dating from about 1380, and {{described}} above. The lectern, {{in the form of}} a wooden eagle, symbol of John the Evangelist, dates from the first half of the 17thcentury. The candlesticks also date from the 17thcentury and are by Censore of Bologna who died in 1662.|$|E

50|$|During {{his musical}} career Joseph Noyon was organist and teacher at <b>the</b> Great Organ <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church at Saint-Cloud, teacher at Notre-Dame-d'Auteuil, accompanist to <b>the</b> <b>choirs</b> at Sainte-Chapelle, {{director}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choirs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française and teacher at <b>the</b> church <b>of</b> Saint-Honoré-d'Eylau for 12 years.|$|R
5|$|The organ was {{originally}} built in 1685 by Renatus Harris {{at a cost}} of £500. This has been removed and repaired many times. However, some of the original work, including the case and pipes, is incorporated into the present instrument, which was built by J. W. Walkers & Sons in 1907, to be found above the stalls on the north side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir.</b> It was further restored in 1989.|$|E
5|$|When the seminary’s choir {{director}} died, {{the school}} administration requested that Leontovych take over this position. As the conductor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir,</b> Leontovych added secular {{music to the}} repertoire of traditional church music. This included Ukrainian folk songs arranged by Mykola Lysenko, Profyriy Demutskiy, and himself. Leontovych graduated from the Kamianets-Podilskiy Theological Seminary in 1899 and broke the family tradition by becoming a music teacher instead of a priest.|$|E
5|$|An oak made pulpit {{stands in}} front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>choir</b> facing the nave. It {{originated}} {{in the north of}} France, probably in the mid-1500s. Its French Renaissance style suggests that it was made during the reign of Henry II. The lectern is also oak and dates from the 1600s. It had been used in a church near Avranches, France, for 200 years. A private individual purchased it shortly before the confiscation of church property during the French Revolution. It changed hands several times before Hibben obtained it for the chapel.|$|E
