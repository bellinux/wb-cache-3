5|$|The early 20th {{century was}} {{the era of the}} Great Migration <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> from the Southern United States to the Northeast, Midwest and West.

5|$|The march {{originally}} was conceived as an event to dramatize the desperate condition <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> {{in the southern}} U.S. {{and an opportunity to}} place organizers' concerns and grievances squarely before the seat of power in the nation's capital. Organizers intended to denounce the federal government for its failure to safeguard the civil rights and physical safety of civil rights workers and blacks. However, the group acquiesced to presidential pressure and influence, and the event ultimately took on a far less strident tone.|$|E
5|$|The {{private sector}} {{was not the}} only source of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in {{government}} jobs suffered.

Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{whether the}} National Economic Association and its journal the Review <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> Political Economy, has enhanced the scholarly status <b>of</b> <b>black</b> economists with research {{interests in the}} economics and political economy of race.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to investigate the relationship between black political perceptions toward black political leaders and black political participation.

5|$|A French edition, {{translated}} by M. L. Carion (or by Louise Swanton-Belloc? (1796–1881)), appeared by 1853 published in Cambrai and in Paris. By 1857, the novel had {{been translated into}} 20 languages, including two independent translations into Slovene just one year after its original publication, which started the since-then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and Slovene translators and readers. Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and Amharic (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> in that nation). The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a number of patients with sado-masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom's Cabin.|$|E

They were married on 13 June 1950, for which Boganda was expelled from the priesthood and cut off from the Catholic hierarchy's support. Boganda and Jourdain would later have two daughters and a son. The affair caused a minor scandal in Paris, but it did little to dent his popularity with his people. In the National Assembly he continued to battle, often in vain, against repressive features of the French administration in Oubangui-Chari. Arbitrary arrest, low wages, compulsory cotton cultivation, and the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>blacks</b> from restaurants and cinemas were all targets of his rhetoric.|$|E

Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response.
