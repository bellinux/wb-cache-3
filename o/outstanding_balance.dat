25|$|A credit card's {{grace period}} {{is the time}} the {{cardholder}} has to pay the balance before interest is assessed on the <b>outstanding</b> <b>balance.</b> Grace periods may vary, but usually range from 20 to 55 days {{depending on the type}} of credit card and the issuing bank. Some policies allow for reinstatement after certain conditions are met.|$|E
25|$|Usually, if a {{cardholder}} is late {{paying the}} balance, finance charges will be calculated and the grace period does not apply. Finance charges incurred {{depend on the}} grace period and balance; with most credit cards there is no grace period {{if there is any}} <b>outstanding</b> <b>balance</b> from the previous billing cycle or statement (i.e. interest is applied on both the previous balance and new transactions). However, there are some credit cards that will only apply finance charge on the previous or old balance, excluding new transactions.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese {{invasion}} money, officially {{known as}} Southern Development Bank Notes ( [...] Dai Tō-A Sensō gunpyō, [...] "Greater East Asia War military scrip"), was currency {{issued by the}} Japanese Military Authority, {{as a replacement for}} local currency after the conquest of colonies and other states in World War II. In February 1942 in Japan, laws were passed establishing the Wartime Finance Bank and the Southern Development Bank. Both institutions issued bonds to raise funds. The former loaned money primarily to military industries, but also {{to a wide range of}} other ventures, including hydroelectric generators, electric power companies, shipbuilding and petroleum. The latter provided financial services in areas occupied by the Japanese military, and Southern Development Bank notes were in fact used as de facto military scrip. In December 1942, the <b>outstanding</b> <b>balance</b> of Southern Development Bank notes stood at more than 470 million; in March 1945, more than 13 billion.|$|E

40|$|An {{enterprise}} (seller) {{that owns}} receivables or certificates representing ownership of pools of receivables transfers the receivables, with recourse, in a transaction that purports to be a sale under Statement 77.

Statement 77 permits a transfer of receivables with recourse to be accounted for as a sale if the seller is permitted or required to repurchase the remaining receivables when the <b>outstanding</b> <b>balances</b> are minor to keep the cost of servicing those receivables from becoming unreasonable.
