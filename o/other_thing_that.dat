25|$|LAPD detectives {{investigating}} the case quickly concluded that Rasmussen {{had been killed}} by a burglar. Rasmussen's attire (a bathrobe, nightgown, and panties) suggested she was not expecting visitors. Although a maid in a neighboring unit reported hearing screaming and fighting earlier in the day, she did not recall gunshots. She thought the whole event had been a domestic dispute and did not call police. It appeared that the perpetrator had been in the process of taking electronic equipment when Rasmussen had come upon him or them and, as a result, jewelry had been left behind and the vehicle taken as a getaway. The abandoned BMW was recovered a week later; it yielded no new evidence. The only <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> appeared to have been taken from the home was the couple's marriage license.|$|E

Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, I had written the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it was a strange example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track which I had written almost a year before".|$|E

2500|$|Brian {{identified}} {{the main difference}} between his music approach to the Beatles' is that they simplify songs to their [...] "skeletal form," [...] whereas he would be [...] "impelled to make [...] more complex," [...] and that if he had arranged [...] "Norwegian Wood", he would have [...] "orchestrated it, put in background voices, [...] done a thousand things." [...] On the subject of the Beatles' Revolver (1966), Love responded: [...] "No, I don't think he was influenced by Revolver. Brian was in his own world, believe me. If he were influenced by the Beatles, there'd be more fuzz tone and a few sitars on our records, but there never have been, really." [...] Wilson praised McCartney's bass playing, calling it [...] "technically fantastic, but his harmonies and the psychological thing he brings to the music comes through. Psychologically he is really strong ... The <b>other</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> I could never get was how versatile he was. .... we would spend ages trying to work out where he got all those different types of songs from." [...] In 2014, Brian stated that he thought [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] was [...] "a weird record ... I liked it", although he denied rumors which said that the song had crippled him emotionally. In 2015, he highlighted [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends" [...] as a favorite. He views [...] "Let It Be" [...] as an intensely comforting song, likening it to valium.|$|E

I made a point to hold onto it. And you know the turtle, the {{malicious}} turtle, was pretty easy to fire that fucker right out of the hole. There was no way in hell that I thought that we were ever going make a living doing this or that in fourteen years I would still be having a conversation as Greg from Dillinger Escape Plan. I just thought this was a ball of fire that’s gonna implode or it’s got a shelf life, there’s no way this can continue. So when we would get asked to play something like that in my head I was like ‘well, this is never going to happen again, when am I ever going to play a festival with bands I don’t like. That was kind of the <b>other</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>that</b> {{was the first time we}} ever played with bands we don’t like. Up until then it was like you go on tour with bands you feel a kinship with and we had never been exposed to some like mass thing where you’re playing with a band like Puddle of Mudd or whoever it was at the time who made me feel like [...] "Oh I got to make some kind of a statement." [...] So it was kind of a combo of kind of wanting to cause the biggest ruckus imaginable, since we’re obviously never going to do this again anyway, I might as well make sure that we’re never allowed to do this again anyway. And then just kind of making a statement in a way that I felt would be unavoidable for people to pay attention to.” ...|$|E
