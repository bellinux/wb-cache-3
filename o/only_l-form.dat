40|$|Phage {{breeding}} {{was employed}} to produce a bacteriophage (Listeria monocytogenes phage ATCC 23074 -B 1) which was specific for L-forms of L. monocytogenes. The bred phage was compared to its unbred parent for lytic activity and specificity. It was also tested {{for its ability to}} prevent L-form biofilm formation on stainless steel and compared with an organic acid (lactic) at L-form biofilm inactivation on stainless steel. The bred phage lysed <b>only</b> <b>L-forms</b> of L. monocytogenes in broth culture and <b>only</b> plaqued on <b>L-form</b> lawns. Likewise, the unbred phage performed similarly with classical cell-walled culture and lawns. The bred phage successfully inhibited L-form biofilm formation on stainless steel and was as successful as lactic acid (130 ppm) at inactivating pre-formed L-form biofilms. Both reduced viable cell numbers by 3 - 1 og cycles over a 6 h period. It appears that phage breeding technology may be an attractive alternative to chemical sanitizers which lack specificity and can be toxic...|$|R
40|$|Snake venoms {{are rich}} in enzymes such as {{phospholipase}} A 2, proteolytic enzymes, hyaluronidases and phosphodiesterases, which are well characterized. However, L-amino acid oxidase (LAO EC. 1. 4. 3. 2) from snake venoms has not been extensively studied. A novel L-amino acid oxidase from Bungarus caeruleus venom was purified to homogeneity {{using a combination of}} ion-exchange by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and gel filtration on Sephadex® G- 100 column. The purified monomer of LAO showed a molecular mass of 55 ± 1 kDa estimated by SDS-PAGE. The specific activity of purified LAO was 6, 230 ± 178 U/min/mg, versus 230 ± 3. 0 U/min/mg for the whole desiccated venom, suggesting a 27 -fold purification with a 25 % yield. Optimal pH and temperature for maximum purified enzyme activity were 6. 5 and 37 ºC, respectively. Platelet aggregation studies show that purified LAO inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation dose-dependently at 0. 01 to 0. 1 µM with 50 % inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 0. 04 µM, whereas at a 0. 08 µM concentration it did not induce appreciable aggregation on normal platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The purified protein catalyzed oxidative deamination of L-amino acids while the most specific substrate was L-leucine. The purified LAO oxidizes <b>only</b> <b>L-forms,</b> but not D-forms of amino acids, to produce H 2 O 2. The enzyme is important for the purification and determination of certain amino acids and for the preparation of &# 945;-keto acids...|$|R
40|$|Amino acids are chiral {{biological}} molecules as {{they can}} appear both in an L- and D-form but it is well-known that <b>only</b> <b>L-forms</b> were selected during evolution as the exclusive constituents of proteins. Nonetheless, it is widely recognized that D-amino acids are present both in lower organisms and in eukaryotes, including mammals. In particular, free D-serine and D-aspartate occur in the brain of mammals at considerable levels. In particular, D-aspartate occurs at substantial amounts in the embryo brain to substantially decrease at post-natal phases. Temporal reduction of D-aspartate levels depends on the post-natal onset of D-Aspartate Oxidase, an enzyme able to selectively catabolize this D-amino acid. Pharmacological evidence indicates that D-aspartate binds and activates NMDA receptors. To clarify the physiological function of D-aspartate, in the last years, genetic and pharmacological mouse models with abnormally higher levels of this D-amino acid have been generated. Such animal models have pointed out a neuromodulatory role for D-aspartate in the regulation of NMDA receptor-dependent functions in crucial brain regions like the hippocampus and striatum. Indeed, increased content of D-aspartate are able to modulate hippocampal NMDA receptor-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) and spatial memory of mice. Moreover, administration of D-Asp to old mice can restore the physiological age-related decay of hippocampal LTP occurring at ageing. In line with a neuromodulation of NMDA receptor functionality, increased levels of D-aspartate abolish long-term depression at corticostriatal synapses and minimize the sensorimotor gating deficits induced in mice by treatment with psychotomimetic drugs like amphetamine and MK 801. Considering the agonistic role of D-aspartate at NMDA receptors and the enriched content of this D-amino acid during prenatal and early life, depletion of neuronal D-aspartate at developmental phases may be a future pivotal approach to disclose the specific role of this molecule on modulation of early brain processes...|$|R
40|$|A {{stabilized}} L-form of Streptococcus pyogenes {{continues to}} synthesize glycerol teichoic acid. This polymer {{was obtained from}} S. pyogenes and its L-form, treated in identical fashion, and compared. Highly purified glycerol teichoic acid from <b>only</b> the <b>L-form</b> {{was found to be}} devoid of d-alanine and to have a shorter chain length. Otherwise, the glycerol teichoic acid from these two organisms was found to be a 1, 3 -phosphodiester-linked glycerophosphate polymer substituted with d-glucose. Evidence is presented that most, if not all, of the glycerol teichoic acid in this streptococcus lies between the wall and membrane. A possible need for the continued synthesis of a minute amount of glycerol teichoic acid by this L-form for survival is discussed in terms of the known function of teichoic acids in bacteria...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} amino acid {{sidechain}} length, substituent position and chirality on amino acid/K+ symport {{have been examined}} in rapid filtration experiments on brush-border membrane vesicles prepared from larval Manduca sexta midgut. Cis-inhibition and trans-stimulation protocols were {{used to examine the}} effects of amino acid analogs on the uptake of alanine, phenylalanine, leucine and lysine, which are cotransported with K+ by a zwitterionic symporter at the high pH characteristic of the midgut in vivo. The symporter was found to translocate both L- and D-stereoisomers of alanine, leucine and lysine, but <b>only</b> the <b>L-form</b> of phenylalanine. Alterations to substrate structure that leave the charge distribution unchanged do not affect symport. Thus, moving the methyl group from C- 3 to C- 5 in the sequence isoleucine, leucine and norleucine has no effect on their ability to inhibit leucine symport. Increasing sidechain length among alanine homologs has little effect on their ability to inhibit alanine uptake, but increasing the sidechain length of lysine homologs from 1 to 3 methylene groups enhances cis-inhibition and trans-stimulation of lysine symport. The substantial difference in molecular charge distribution among aminobutanoic acid isomers has a large impact on alanine symport with only a- (or 2 -) aminobutanoic acid functioning as an alanine analog. Only those changes in substrate structure that are coupled to the molecular charge distribution seem to affect symport. The tolerance of the symporter may reflect a balance mandated by the conflicting demands of selectivity and throughput...|$|R
40|$|Polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic {{patterns}} of acidified phenol extracts prepared from whole cells {{can be used}} for the identification of bacterial L-forms and Mycoplasma species of human origin. Ten human Mycoplasma serotypes and eight L-forms belonging to five different genera were studied. The gel patterns were sufficiently distinct and reproducible that it was possible not <b>only</b> to identify <b>L-forms</b> at the genus level (group with streptococci) and different Mycoplasma serotypes but also to differentiate between the two of them. The parentage of L-forms of Streptobacillus moniliformis L 1, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus MG, and Staphylococcus aureus Smith strain was established by relating their gel patterns directly to parent bacteria. It was found that an L-form designated S. moniliformis An (ATCC 14220) was actually an L-form of Proteus. In addition, it was shown electrophoretically that no relationship existed between the Streptococcus MG L-form and M. pneumoniae. The applicability of this method as a diagnostic and taxonomic tool for the differentiation of L-forms and mycoplasmas is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{subcellular}} {{forms of}} cytidylyltransferase (EC 2. 7. 7. 15) in rat lung, rat liver, Hep G 2 cells, A 549 cells and alveolar Type II cells from adult rats {{were separated by}} glycerol density centrifugation. Cytosol prepared from lung, Hep G 2 cells, A 549 cells and alveolar Type II cells contained two forms of the enzyme. These species were identical to the L-Form and H-Form isolated previously from lung cytosol by gel filtration. Liver cytosol contained <b>only</b> the <b>L-Form.</b> Rapid treatment of Hep G 2 cells with digitonin released all of the cytoplasmic cytidylyltransferase activity. The released activity was present in both H-Form and L-Form. The molecular weight of L-Form was determined from sedimentation coefficients and Stokes radius values to be 97 690 +/- 10 175. Thus, the L-Form {{appears to be a}} dimer of the Mr 45 000 catalytic subunit. The [function of (italic small f) ] [function of (italic small f) ] [deg] value of 1. 5 indicated that the protein molecule has an axial ratio of 10, assuming a prolate ellipsoid shape. The estimated molecular weight of the H-Form was 284 000 +/- 25 000. The H-Form was dissociated into L-Form by incubation of cytosol at 37 [deg]C. Triton X- 100 (0. 1 %) and chlorpromazine (1. 0 mM) also dissociated the H-Form into L-Form. Western blot analysis indicated that both forms contained the catalytic subunit. An increase in Mr 45 000 subunit coincided with the increase in cytidylyltransferase activity in L-Form, which resulted from the dissociated of H-Form. The L-Form was dependent on phospholipid for activity. The H-Form was active without lipid. Phosphatidylinositol was present in the H-Form isolated from Hep G 2 cells. The phosphatidylinositol dispersed when the H-Form was dissociated into L-Form. Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol cause L-Form to aggregate into a form similar to H-Form. Phosphatidylcholine/oleic acid (1 : 1 molar ratio) and oleic acid also aggregated the L-Form. Phosphatidylcholine did not produce aggregation. We conclude that the H-Form is the active form of cytidylyltransferase in cytoplasm. The H-Form appears to be a lipoprotein consisting of an apoprotein (L-Form dimer of the Mr 45 000 subunit) complexed with lipids. A change in the relative distribution of H-Form and L-Form in cytosol would alter the cellular activity and thus may be important in the regulation of phosphatidylcholine synthesis...|$|R
