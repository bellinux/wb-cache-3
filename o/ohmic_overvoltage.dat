40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the contact surface structure of porous Si-based membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) on the performance of microfuel cells, because the contact area of the triple-phase boundary among the MEA components {{plays an important role in}} the performance of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). An n-type silicon substrate was first wet-etched with KOH and subsequently anodically etched to fabricate a porous Si substrate. The cross section of the mechanically polished Si wafer showed pores with high aspect ratios. Electrolyte solutions were filled into the pores to prepare a porous Si membrane (PSM), and the MEA was fabricated by hot-pressing the PSM between two conventional catalyst-coated carbon-paper electrodes. The porous Si-based MEA worked well and showed a power density higher than that of the Nafion®- 212 -based membrane. Further, we examined {{the effects of the}} nano/microstructures at the triple-phase boundary and found that the more densely arranged nano/microstructures reduced the magnitudes of the activation overvoltage and <b>ohmic</b> <b>overvoltage,</b> thereby improving the cell performance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{macroscopic}} {{model of}} a short SOFC stack has been developed. The {{first part of this}} paper intends to describe a methodology for determining the transient thermal behaviour of the SOFC. A nodal network is used {{in order to determine the}} final internal temperatures of the structure. The stack is modelled by one average cell. The cell is divided into several isothermal volumes represented by their central node. The energy balances at each node are developed and solved by Matlab routine. The second part describes a fluidic model in order to compute the partial pressures of chemical species and the output flows. The fluidic model uses electrical/fluidic analogy. Pressure drops in channels are modelled through resistances and the fluid accumulation in the volume is modelled by a capacitor. The next part describes the electrochemical model based on the classical Nernst equation and computation of the overpotential (activation, concentration and <b>ohmic</b> <b>overvoltage).</b> The three submodels are then coupled in order to built a complete modelling of the stack. It has been validated and compared with experimental results on an SOFC stack provided by HTceramix...|$|E
40|$|A parametr ic mode l {{predicting}} the per formance {{of a solid}} po lymer electrolyte, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell has been developed using a combinat ion of mechanistic and empirical mode l ing techniques. This paper details the mechanist ic mode l development. Mass transport properties are considered in the mechanist ic deve lopment via Stefan-Maxwel l equations. Thermodynamic equil ibrium potentials are defined using the Nernst equation. Activation overvoltages are defined via a Tafel equation, and internal resistances are defined via the Nernst-P lanck equation, leading to a definition of <b>ohmic</b> <b>overvoltage</b> via an Ohm's law equation. The mechanist ic mode l cannot adequately mode l fuel cell performance, since several simplifying approximat ions {{have been used in}} order to facilitate mode l development. Additionally, certain properties likely to be observed in operational fuel cells, such as thermal gradients, have not been considered. Nonetheless, the insights gained f rom the mechanist ic assessment of fuel cell processes were found to give the resulting empirical mode l a firmer theoretical basis than many of the mode ls presently available in the literature. Correlation of the empirical mode l to actual exper imental data was very good. A model mapping overvoltage in a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell as a function of val~ious con-tributing variables would be of great utility to researcher...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a macroscopic model of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) {{with the aim}} to perform a simulation of the whole generator. Three sub-models {{have been developed to}} take into fluidic, thermal and electrical phenomena. The fluidic sub-model is based on an equivalent circuit based on electrical analogy. Pressure drops in channels are modelled by resistances and the fluid accumulation in the volume is modelled by capacitor. Each electrode compartment (channel+electrode) is represented by two resistances and one capacitor. We have used this model to calculate the pressure at the catalytic sites and gas flows at fuel cell input and output. The electrical response is based on the classical Nernst potential equation, activation, <b>ohmic</b> and concentration <b>overvoltages.</b> The thermal modelling is based on a (2 D) nodal network. Two aspects are studied in this article (conduction and the convection heat transfer). Results have been validated on a 5 cell stack...|$|R
40|$|Although micro-patterned {{membranes}} {{improve the}} performances of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, their intrinsic effect has not been clarified. This paper aims to clarify {{the effect of the}} patterned surfaces in terms of the overvoltage by fabricating well-defined micro-pillar structures on the cathode side of the membrane via thermal imprint lithography. Cell performance data and numerical simulation revealed that the pillar structures reduce the proton transport resistance and mass transport loss in the cathode catalyst layers. The reduced proton transport resistance expands the catalyst layers contributing the power generation toward the interface between the catalyst and gas diffusion layers. This decreases the average permeation distance of oxygen to react at the catalyst, which would explain the observed reduction of the concentration overvoltage. The pillar structures reduce the <b>ohmic</b> <b>overvoltage</b> predominantly at a relative humidity of < 25 % and a current density of < 500 mA/cm 2. The concentration overvoltage suppression becomes more significant at higher humidity and current densities where the oxygen diffusion to the catalyst is blocked by water. Our findings are useful to design optimum pillar structures that maximize the fuel cell cathode performances. © 2013 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10. 1149 / 2. 085304 jes] All rights reserved.

40|$|A parametr ic mode l {{predicting}} the per formance {{of a solid}} po lymer electrolyte, proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell has been developed using a combinat ion of mechanist ic and empirical model ing techniques. This paper details the empirical analysis wh ich yielded the parametr ic coefficients employed in the model. A 28 run exper iment covering a range of operating currents (50 to 300 ASF), temperatures (328 to 358 K), oxygen partial pressures (0. 6 to 3. 1 a tm abs.) and hydrogen partial pressures (2. 0 to 3. 1 a im abs.) was conducted. Parametr ic equations for the activation overvoltage and the internal resistance of the fuel cell were obtained f rom linear regression. The factors to be employed in the linear regression had been previously determined through a mechanist ic analysis of fuel cell processes. Activation overvoltage was mode led {{as a function of}} the operating temperature, the product of operating temperature, and the logarithm of the operating current, and the product of operating temperature and the logarithm of the oxygen concentration at the catalyst reaction sites. The internal resistance of the fuel cell was mode led {{as a function of the}} operating temperature and the current. Correlation of the empirical mode l to exper imental data was very good. It is anticipated that the mechanist ic validity yielded by the coupling of mechanist ic and empirical mode l ing techniques will also al low for accurate predictive capabil-ities outside of the experimental range. A mechanist ic mode l defining the factors most likely to influence fuel cell per fo rmance has been described previ-ously.
