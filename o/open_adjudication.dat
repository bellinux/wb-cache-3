50|$|In the breitensport section, a pre-qualification round takes place, {{where each}} {{participating}} couple is classified into the amateur, professional ("profi"), master or the optional champion class, {{so that each}} couple will dance the subsequent actual tournament in a class that matches their levels. These tournaments follow the rules of official dancing tournaments. During the finals, <b>open</b> <b>adjudication</b> is sometimes performed, with each adjudicator showing their ranking of the couples on the floor immediately after each dance. However, closed adjudication is often chosen {{in order to save}} time. There are winner's certificates and medals for all participants in the finals as well as trophies (instead of medals) for the podium finishers.|$|E
30|$|Two trained masked graders (A.A. and K.A.; ophthalmologists with {{subspecialty}} {{training in}} retina and uveitis) performed all the image analyses {{in the study}} independently. Any disagreements between the graders were resolved with <b>open</b> <b>adjudication.</b> En face OCTA and structural en face images were analyzed to assess alterations in the retinochoroidal vasculature. These findings were compared to other imaging techniques to confirm changes such as decrease or absence of blood flow and anatomical changes in the microvasculature.|$|E
40|$|This article explores two questions. First, in adjudicating claims {{under the}} Human Rights Act 1998, should the court {{defer to the}} {{executive}} or legislature {{on the ground that}} the latter two institutions possess superior expertise or information-gathering powers, when such expertise or powers fail to generate persuasive first-order reasons for the court? This article argues that rationality requires courts to defer on these second-order grounds of institutional capacity in situations of judicial uncertainty. Secondly, this article examines an underexplored question in the current literature: when is it justified for courts to consider the government as possessing second-order grounds of institutional capacity that warrant deference? It is argued that rational, impartial and <b>open</b> <b>adjudication</b> in the post-HRA era requires the government to prove its claims of superior institutional capacity, and courts to openly scrutinise such claims by considering a number of factors, including, crucially, the government institution’s track record of expertise and credibility. postprin...|$|E

40|$|Erwin Chemerinsky {{maintains}} that President George W. Bush took a historic opportunity to fill Supreme Court justice vacancies with ideologically right-of-center nominees. He explains that these justices will force {{the court to}} write opinions that break new ground in judicial activism. The areas that will be <b>open</b> to new <b>adjudication</b> include abortion rights, access to the courts, affirmative action, and presidential war powers. He describes the critical cases {{in each of these}} fields and the key points of contention. Professor Chemerinsky concludes that the incoming president may be able to offset the appointments of Justices Alito and Roberts with more centrist or center-left appointments if seats become open. John Yoo argues that presidents have historically resisted Supreme Court decisions especially strong presidents such as Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Reagan changed this calculus by politicizing the courts further through the appointment of ideological allies. He {{maintains that}} the second Bush administration has not transcended constitutional limits in its actions. He supports his case by arguing that previous presidents have taken exceptional actions in times of war and that the “war on terror” has given the administration a mandate for its policies. He concludes that Bush administration is in much more conflict with the Congress than with the Court. The accompanying audio files provide the complete recording of the two talks...|$|R
