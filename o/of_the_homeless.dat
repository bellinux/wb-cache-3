5|$|On June 30, 2004, then-Mayor Newsom {{pledged to}} fix San Francisco’s {{homeless}} problem within 10 years and clear downtown streets of its widespread homeless population. He stated {{that people who}} were homeless and seriously ill would be given shelter. After 10 years and $1.5 billion, the city relocated 19,500 people off the streets, with 11,363 single adults being housed, and 8,086 people {{being sent to the}} home of a willing family member or friend though the Homeward Bound program. Before the program in 2002, there was a 8,640 generally homeless and 4,535 street homeless population in San Francisco. After the program was initiated, the homeless population dropped 28% by 2005, with a generally homeless population of 6,248 and a 2,655 street homeless population. However, after 2005, the homeless population has stayed approximately the same. In fact, the San Francisco population of homeless rose 3 percent between 2005 and 2013. The percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> population in jail was cut in half between 2005 and 2013, which is an indicator that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> population who would have ended up in jail were now being housed and treated.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they could to help rescue those trapped in the flood waters and take care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless.</b> According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents {{in the wake of}} the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E

5|$|Often {{armed with}} no more than shovels and spades, {{soldiers}} and civilians dug for bodies in the rubble. Other than this, rescue workers were faced with a number of obstacles, including the temperatures of the villages damaged. They were warm during the day, although the villages grew colder at night, making rescue work harder and threatening the health <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> and anyone alive and trapped under the debris. Many civilians were discouraged from helping due to fear of aftershocks. According to Gary Oshea of International Rescue, the volunteers did not have enough technical equipment, and the religious leaders seemed unwilling to contribute much. Official rescue work ended on June 24, 2002, when rescue workers said there were no more survivors.|$|E
5|$|Order in {{the streets}} broke down as rumours arose of {{suspicious}} foreigners setting fires. The fears <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>homeless</b> focused on the French and Dutch, England's enemies in the ongoing Second Anglo-Dutch War; these substantial immigrant groups became victims of lynchings and street violence. On Tuesday, the fire spread {{over most of the}} City, destroying St Paul's Cathedral and leaping the River Fleet to threaten Charles II's court at Whitehall, while coordinated firefighting efforts were simultaneously mobilising. The battle to quench the fire is considered to have been won by two factors: the strong east winds died down, and the Tower of London garrison used gunpowder to create effective firebreaks to halt further spread eastward.|$|E

We find a substantial rate <b>of</b> non-take-up among <b>the</b> <b>homeless,</b> although it is significantly less than the general population rate: approximately 17 % of eligible homeless persons do not claim benefits compared to 35 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> general population.

We suggest also that an important effect of desocialization is that it increases non-take-up among <b>the</b> poorest <b>homeless...</b>|$|R
