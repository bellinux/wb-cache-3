Similar methods are used to compute usual growth polynomials and conjugacy growth polynomials for finite symmetric groups and alternating groups, with respect to various generating sets of transpositions. Computations suggest a class of finite graphs, that we call partition-complete, which generalizes the class of semi-hamiltonian graphs, and which is of independent interest.

40|$|In {{the last}} years {{computational}} logic, and particularly non-monotonic reasoning, was introduced as a theory suitable for specification and implementation of multi-agent systems. In this context, fast algorithms for reasoning in computational logics are vitally important to support an industrial applications of such systems. In this paper we investigate the properties of sets of default assumptions with re-spect to the stable model semantics of normal logic programs. At first, we introduce the notion of generating set, a set of default assumptions {{we have to accept}} in order to infer particular atom of the program. Subsequently we introduce a construction of canonical program of a given normal logic program, which is syntactically much simpler, but preserves all the informa-tion of the original program w. r. t. stable model semantics. Based on the semantical relation between the original normal logic program and its canonical counterpart, we introduce an alternative definition of strong semantical equivalence, which we believe, is equivalent to standard definition. Finally we show how a relation of blocking between generating sets can be ex-ploited in order to convert the problem of search for stable models of normal logic program to the problem of graph coloring, what finally leads to a new algorithm of stable model search. The idea of our algorithm is based on the observation that ac-cepting a generating set of default assumptions into the partial interpretation forces <b>other</b> <b>generating</b> <b>sets</b> to excluded from it. The brief descriptions of the prototype implementation, and first results of experiments with it, are also included in this paper.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 37) An {{attempt was}} made to find a method for generating a useful analytic expression for the Laplace or inverse Laplace transform of a given set of data. The method attempted involved first fitting the data to Laguerre functions. In the process, computer algorithms for doing a Laguerre transform were found. However, the analytic expression for the Laplace transform that results from this method is not directly useful because it is usually hundreds of terms long. The Laguerre transform routines are comprehensive, including methods for estimating the number of Laguerre functions needed for the transform to be representative of the original data. The transform is considered representative of the original data if the inverse transform returns the original data within a small x 2 - Fourier transform methods are used in this estimate.

40|$|For {{each of the}} 14 {{classes of}} edge-transitive maps {{described}} by Graver and Watkins, necessary and sufficient conditions are given for a group to be the automorphism group of a map, or of an orientable map without boundary, in that class. Extending earlier results of Siran, Tucker and Watkins, these are used to determine which symmetric groups $S_n$ can arise in this way for each class. Similar results are obtained for all finite simple groups, building on work of Leemans and Liebeck, Nuzhin and <b>others</b> on <b>generating</b> <b>sets</b> for such groups. It is also shown that each edge-transitive class realises finite groups of every sufficiently large nilpotence class or derived length, and also realises uncountably many non-isomorphic infinite groups.

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} {{represent}} subgroups of finitely presented groups by their image in a quotient. It gives algorithms for basic operations in this representation and investigates how iteration {{of this approach}} {{can be used to}} extend known quotients groups with a solvable normal subgroup. Traditionally, algorithms in group theory have represented a subgroup U of a finitely presented group G either by a set of generators (as words in the generators of the full group) or via a coset table. Both representations have distinctive disadvantages: A coset table for U has [G:U] rows, thus the space requirement for storage can be substantial. Practically this restricts this representation to index a few million at most. On the other hand, the representation via a <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> is not particularly suited to calculations and many algorithms compute a coset table as a first step and then effectively work with the coset table, discarding the <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> Furthermore, for subgroups which are obtained as output of <b>other</b> algorithms, <b>generating</b> <b>sets</b> often are not what a user wants: The standard way to obtain generators is as Schreier generators. As this is a process which "lives" in a free group the number of generators produced grows linearly with the index, and any reduction of this number (if possible at all) would require further work. The first aim of this note is to introduce a different representation, namely as a subgroup of a quotient: Given a group G and a homomorphism j, we represent a subgroup U which is a full preimage under j by the pair (j,Uj). We call U a quotient subgroup and the pair (j,Uj) the quotient representation of U. Such representation comes naturally to systems such as Magnus[The New York Group Theory Cooperative], quotpic[Holt and Rees 1993] or XGAP[ [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Three methods, {{based on}} Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), {{to support and}} {{automate}} the design of dispatching rules for complex and dynamic scheduling problems are proposed in this thesis. The first method employs an EA to search for problem instances on which a given dispatching rule performs badly. These instances can then be analysed to reveal weaknesses of the tested rule, thereby providing guidelines {{for the design of}} a better rule. The other two methods are hyper-heuristics, which employ an EA directly to generate effective dispatching rules. In particular, one hyper-heuristic is based on a specific type of EA, called Genetic Programming (GP), and generates a single rule from basic job and machine attributes, while the <b>other</b> <b>generates</b> a <b>set</b> of work centre-specific rules by selecting a (potentially) different rule for each work centre from a number of existing rules. Each of the three methods is applied to some complex and dynamic scheduling problem(s), and the resulting dispatching rules are tested against benchmark rules from the literature. In each case, the benchmark rules are shown to be outperformed by a rule (set) that results from the application of the respective method, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which the exchange relation holds in finite groups G. We define a new equivalence relation ≡_m, where two elements are equivalent if each can be substituted for the <b>other</b> in any <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> for G. We then refine this to a new sequence ≡_m^(r) of equivalence relations by saying that x ≡_m^(r) y if each can be substituted for the other in any r-element <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> The relations ≡_m^(r) become finer as r increases, and we define a new group invariant ψ(G) to be the value of r at which they stabilise to ≡_m. Remarkably, we are able to prove that if G is soluble then ψ(G) ∈{d(G), d(G) + 1 }, where d(G) is the minimum number of generators of G, and to classify the finite soluble groups G for which ψ(G) = d(G). For insoluble G, we show that d(G) ≤ψ(G) ≤ d(G) + 5. However, we know of no examples of groups G for which ψ(G) > d(G) + 1. As an application, we look at the generating graph of G, whose vertices are the elements of G, the edges being the 2 -element <b>generating</b> <b>sets.</b> Our relation ≡_m^(2) enables us to calculate Aut(Γ(G)) for all soluble groups G of nonzero spread, and give detailed structural information about Aut(Γ(G)) in the insoluble case.

We propose two methods to deal with this property, both aimed at decomposing the system into strongly monotone subsystems, but with different structural characteristics: one method tends to produce a single large strongly monotone component, while the <b>other</b> typically <b>generates</b> a <b>set</b> of smaller disjoint strongly monotone subsystems.

40|$|Abstract. A module M over a ring R is said {{to satisfy}} (P) if every gen-erating set of M {{contains}} an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> The following results are proved; (1) Let τ = (Tτ,Fτ) be a hereditary torsion theory such that Tτ 6 = Mod-R. Then every τ-torsionfree R-module satisfies (P) {{if and only if}} S = R/τ(R) is a division ring. (2) Let K be a hereditary pre-torsion class of modules. Then every module in K satisfies (P) if and only if either K = { 0 } or S = R/SocK(R) is a division ring, where SocK(R) = ∩{I ≤ RR: R/I ∈ K}. For a right R-moduleM, a subset X ofM {{is said to}} be a <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> ofM if M = Σx∈XxR; and a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of M is any <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> Y of M such that no proper subset of Y can generate M. A <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> X of M is called an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> if Σx∈XxR = ⊕x∈XxR. Clearly, every independent <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of M is a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set,</b> but the converse is not true in general. For example, the set { 2, 3 } is a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of ZZ but not an independent <b>generating</b> <b>set.</b> It is well-known that every <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of a right vector space over a division ring contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> (or a basis). This motivated various interests in characterizing the rings R such that every module in a certain class of right R-modules contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set,</b> or every <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> of each module in a certain class of right R-modules contains a minimal <b>generating</b> <b>set</b> (see, for example, [2], [8], [9], [11]). In [2, Theorem 2. 3], the authors proved that R is a division ring if and only if every R-module has a basis if and only if every irredundant subset of an R-module is independent. This result can be considered in a more general context of a torsion theory. For anR-moduleM,M is said to satisfy (P) if ever...|$|R
