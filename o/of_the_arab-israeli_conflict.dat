Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end, Sadat focused on taking decisive military action. A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make the solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.|$|E

In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their colonial empires, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to decolonisation.|$|E
5|$|Jennings was {{determined}} to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with the intricacies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict,</b> including {{the rise of the}} Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> ( [...] ; [...] ) is the {{political}} tension, military conflicts and disputes between a number of Arab countries and Israel. <b>The</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> are bound in <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> Zionism and Arab nationalism towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century.

25|$|In {{the context}} of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, FAIR believe the media in the United States downplay {{violence}} against Palestinians and stated that National Public Radio reported more Israeli casualties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> than Palestinian casualties by percentage.

25|$|Scholars {{point to}} European influence, {{including}} that of the Nazis (see below), {{and the establishment of}} Israel as the root causes for antisemitism. Norman Stillman explains that increased European commercial, missionary and imperialist activities during the 19th and 20th centuries brought antisemitic ideas to the Muslim world. Initially these prejudices only found a reception among Arab Christians and were too foreign for any widespread acceptance among Muslims. However, with the rise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict,</b> European antisemitism began to gain acceptance in modern literature.|$|E
25|$|Gandhi {{remained}} a staunch supporter <b>of</b> Palestinians in <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> and was critical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle East diplomacy {{sponsored by the}} United States.

Nevertheless, Gandhi authorized <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a secret channel of contact and security assistance with Israel in the late 1960s. Her lieutenant, P. V. Narasimha Rao, later became Prime Minister and approved full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992.|$|R
25|$|Popular {{music in}} Israel has also a been medium for Jewish secular musical expression.

2500|$|Pipes is a {{supporter}} <b>of</b> Israel in <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> and {{an opponent of}} a Palestinian state.

25|$|While {{there were}} antisemitic {{incidents}} before the twentieth century, antisemitism increased dramatically {{as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Palestinian exodus, {{the creation of the}} state of Israel, and Israeli victories during the wars of 1956 and 1967 were a severe humiliation to Israel's opponents—primarily Egypt, Syria and Iraq. However, by the mid 1970s the vast majority of Jews had left Arab and Muslim countries, moving primarily to Israel, France and the United States. The reasons for the exodus are varied and disputed.|$|E
25|$|In {{light of}} the dual claims of both Judaism and Islam, {{it is one of}} the most contested {{religious}} sites in the world. Since the Crusades, the Muslim community of Jerusalem has managed the site as a Waqf, without interruption. As the site is part of the Old City, controlled by Israel since 1967, both Israel and the Palestinian Authority claim sovereignty over it, and it remains a major focal point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> In an attempt to keep the status quo, the Israeli government enforces a controversial ban on prayer by non-Muslims.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, Saudi Arabia {{has changed}} its {{viewpoint}} concerning {{the validity of}} negotiating with Israel.

At that time, Israel {{did not respond to}} the offer. In 2007 Saudi Arabia again officially supported a resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> which supported a full right of Palestinian refugees to move to Israel, which generated more official negative reactions from Israeli authorities.|$|E
25|$|Since 2001, Palestinian militants have {{launched}} thousands of rocket and mortar attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> continuing <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> From 2004 to 2014, these attacks have killed 27 Israeli civilians, 5 foreign nationals, 5 IDF soldiers, {{and at least}} 11 Palestinians and injured more than 1900 people, but their main effect is their creation of widespread psychological trauma and disruption of daily life among the Israeli populace. Medical studies in Sderot, the Israeli city closest to the Gaza Strip, have documented a post-traumatic stress disorder incidence among young children of almost 50%, as well as high rates of depression and miscarriage. A public opinion poll conducted in March 2013 found that most Palestinians do not support firing rockets at Israel from the Gaza Strip. Another poll conducted in September 2014 found that 80% of Palestinians support firing rockets against Israel {{if it does not}} allow unfettered access to Gaza. These rocket attacks have caused flight cancellations at Ben Gurion airport.|$|R
50|$|Boycotts of Israel are {{economic}} and political cultural campaigns or actions that seek a selective or total cutting <b>of</b> ties with <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> Israel. Such campaigns are employed by those who challenge <b>the</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> Israel, Israel's policies or actions towards the Palestinians over <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> and Israeli-Palestinian <b>conflict,</b> oppose Israeli territorial claims in the West Bank or Jerusalem or even oppose Israel's right to exist. Arab boycotts of Zionist institutions and Jewish businesses began before Israel's founding as a state.

2500|$|<b>The</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> modern <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> lie in <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> Zionism and <b>the</b> reactionary Arab {{nationalism}} {{that arose}} {{in response to}} Zionism towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. Territory regarded by the Jewish people as their historical homeland is also regarded by the Pan-Arab movement as historically and presently belonging to the Palestinian Arabs. Before World War I, the Middle East, including Palestine (later Mandatory Palestine), had been under <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Empire for nearly 400 years. During <b>the</b> closing years <b>of</b> their empire, <b>the</b> Ottomans began to espouse their Turkish ethnic identity, asserting <b>the</b> primacy <b>of</b> Turks within <b>the</b> empire, leading to discrimination against the Arabs. <b>The</b> promise <b>of</b> liberation from <b>the</b> Ottomans led many Jews and Arabs to support the allied powers during World War I, leading to <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> widespread Arab nationalism. Both Arab nationalism and Zionism had their formulative beginning in Europe. The Zionist Congress was established in Basel in 1897, while the [...] "Arab Club" [...] was established in Paris in 1906.|$|R
25|$|The {{tensions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> {{were also}} {{a factor in the}} rise of animosity to Jews all over the Middle East, as hundreds of thousands of Jews fled as refugees, the main waves being soon after the 1948 and 1956 wars. In reaction to the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Egyptian government expelled almost 25,000 Egyptian Jews and confiscated their property, and sent approximately 1,000 more Jews to prisons and detention camps. The population of Jewish communities of Muslim Middle East and North Africa was reduced from about 900,000 in 1948 to less than 8,000 today.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} is the formula {{proposed by the}} Security Council for the successful resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflict,</b> in particular, ending the state of belligerency then existing between the 'States concerned', Israel and Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The resolution deals with five principles; withdrawal of Israeli forces, 'peace within secure and recognized boundaries', freedom of navigation, a just settlement of the refugee problem and security measures including demilitarized zones. It also provided for {{the appointment of a}} Special Representative to proceed to the Middle East in order to promote agreement on a peaceful and accepted settlement in accordance with the principles outlined in the resolution.|$|E
25|$|Under Tito, Yugoslavia {{adopted a}} policy of nonalignment in the Cold War. It {{developed}} close relations with developing countries (see Non-Aligned Movement) as well as maintaining cordial relations with the United States and Western European countries. Stalin considered Tito a traitor and openly offered condemnation towards him. On 1 January 1967, Yugoslavia was the first communist country to open its borders to all foreign visitors and abolish visa requirements. In the same year Tito became active in promoting a peaceful resolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> His plan called for Arab countries to recognize the State of Israel in exchange for Israel returning territories it had gained. The Arab countries rejected his land for peace concept. However, that same year, Yugoslavia no longer recognized Israel.|$|E
2500|$|On October 6, 1973, Syria and Egypt, {{with support}} from other Arab nations, {{launched}} a surprise attack on Israel, on Yom Kippur. This renewal <b>of</b> hostilities in <b>the</b> <b>Arab–Israeli</b> <b>conflict</b> released <b>the</b> underlying economic pressure on oil prices. At the time, Iran was the world's second-largest oil exporter and a close US ally. Weeks later, <b>the</b> Shah <b>of</b> Iran said in an interview: [...] "Of course [...] is going to rise... Certainly! And how!... You've [...] increased <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheat you sell us by 300 percent, and the same for sugar and cement... You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us, refined as petrochemicals, at a hundred times the price you've paid us... It's only fair that, from now on, you should pay more for oil. Let's say ten times more." ...|$|R
50|$|Bernard Avishai {{was born}} in Montreal, Quebec in 1949. <b>The</b> son <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late Ben Shaicovitch, {{president}} of Canada's Zionist Men's Association during the 1950s, he volunteered for farm work on an Israeli collective during the Six-Day War, an experience that affected many of his generation. He and his first wife, the artist Susan Avishai, moved to Israel in 1972 {{while he was still}} working on a doctorate in political economy for <b>the</b> University <b>of</b> Toronto, and began writing about Israel, <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> Zionism, and <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> After <b>the</b> October War <b>of</b> 1973, he published a series of searching political essays in The New York Review of Books, to which he contributed regularly until the mid-1980s.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} both {{continuity}} and change in Egyptian foreign policy between 1970 and 1981. <b>The</b> overarching question <b>of</b> this work is: Why and how did President Sadat affect changes in foreign policy? More specifically, the thesis examines <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> Egyptian foreign policy in three concentric circles: the Superpowers, the Arab world, and Israel. <b>The</b> broader aim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis {{is to provide a}} detailed study of Egyptian foreign policy in this period, which witnessed a multitude <b>of</b> watershed events. <b>The</b> topic is important because Egypt is a leading state in the Arab world, a core actor in <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflict,</b> and a strategic ally <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superpowers during the Cold War. The thesis offers a detailed chronological account of Egyptian foreign policy during the 1970 s. It advances a revisionist interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Sadat years, arguing that there was much greater continuity with <b>the</b> foreign policy <b>of</b> Gamal Abdel-Nasser than is commonly believed. The account ends in 1981, with <b>the</b> assassination <b>of</b> Anwar Sadat and <b>the</b> succession <b>of</b> Hosni Mubarak. It is argued that Sadat not only managed to reverse Nasser’s radical path in foreign policy, but that he also succeeded in institutionalising his most significant policy changes: peace with Israel and <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> Egypt from <b>the</b> <b>Arab-Israeli</b> <b>conflict.</b> <b>The</b> methodology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis is principally empirical and qualitative in nature. The thesis is based on extensive archival research, recently declassified official documents, memoirs of policymakers in English and Arabic, and oral histories in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> interviews and transcripts of discussions with former Egyptian policymakers.
