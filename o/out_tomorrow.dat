5000|$|TIM (voice of Philip Gilbert) is a {{biological}} computer, programmed with an artificially created intelligence, whose tubes {{are filled with}} bio-fluid. He was partially built by John, {{the leader of the}} Tomorrow People, and was given to them by the Galactic Council. TIM is housed in The Lab, situated in a disused station in the London Underground. TIM often helps <b>out</b> the <b>Tomorrow</b> People by providing vital information, which the telepaths can use in their current adventure. TIM's voice is identical to that of diplomat Timus Irnok Mosta from the Galactic Federation, because Timus' clone-brother Tykno is the premier AI scientist of the Federation and all Federation AI's have their voice.|$|R
