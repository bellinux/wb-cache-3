The island is reached by plane from Sydney Airport or Brisbane Airport in less than two hours. The Permanent Park Preserve declared in 1981 has similar management guidelines to a National Park.|$|E

5|$|Arcidiacono {{was born}} on March 26, 1994 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He has three older siblings, Sabrina, Nicole, Michael; and younger twin siblings, Christopher and Courtney. His parents, Joe and Patti Arcidiacono, met at Villanova University, where Joe was an {{offensive}} lineman on the football team. When he was young, his father installed a 6-foot plastic hoop in the family living room. Arcidiacono would often practice shooting jump shots and hitting layups <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> hoop before progressing to an actual basketball court. At one AAU game, Arcidiacono scored 50 points. At another, he hit eight three-pointers in a row. When he was in 7th grade at a basketball camp, Villanova coach Jay Wright said he would one day play for the Wildcats. Growing up, his favorite athletes were the 76ers' Allen Iverson and the Eagles' Brian Dawkins. In eighth grade, Arcidiacono trained with former Penn State player Ben Luber.|$|E
5|$|During the project's {{development}} phase, the siting {{and size}} of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was simply too expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Small</b> City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system.|$|E

5|$|In 1709, {{the main}} fort at Viborg {{consisted}} of five frontal bastions named Holtz, Neuport, Klein-Platform, Wasserport and Eleonora, connected by the Viborg town wall, {{in the eastern}} section of the town. The {{western part of the}} town, connected to the main section, had three bastions named Valport, Pansarlax, and Europa. To the west of the wall between Pansarlax and Europa, there was a ravelin and two caponiers, and {{to the west of the}} wall between Evrop and Eleonora was another ravelin. Both ravelins were, apparently, earthen, but inside the main eastern fort, all structures were stone. Most of the structures in the western part of the fort were wooden, with the exception of the stone guard tower, named the Petersburg tower. Separate from these fortifications, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> central island east of the town (now the Zamochnyy Island), was Schloss (Castle) Viborg, which stands to this day. The fort had 151 guns at its defense.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Hepburn {{ventured into}} {{television}} {{for the first}} time, starring in a production of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie.

Hepburn received an Emmy Award nomination for playing wistful Southern mother Amanda Wingfield, which opened her mind to future work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> screen. Her next project was the television movie Love Among the Ruins (1975), a London-based Edwardian drama with her friend Laurence Olivier. It received positive reviews and high ratings, and earned Hepburn her only Emmy Award.|$|E
5|$|On December30, just a {{day before}} Waka passed through Tonga, {{warnings}} were issued for numerous islands, including parts of Fiji and Samoa. Forecasts showed the storm passing directly over the low-lying Tongan capital of Nuku'alofa as a Category3 cyclone. Owing to warnings from local media, all New Year's Eve celebrations were canceled as residents and tourists boarded up their homes. All airports in the region were shut down and ferry service was suspended. Many residents <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> island of Niuafo'ou, about 35km2 (13.5mi2) in size, evacuated to other islands prior to Waka's arrival.|$|E

5|$|The Baltimore Sun writer Tamara Ikenberg equated {{the episode}} {{as both a}} parody of genetic {{engineering}} and a statement against its potential evils, particularly through in its portrayal of the giant mutant Stan wreaking havoc through South Park. This episode marked the first appearances of the characters Shelley and Sharon Marsh, Stan's sister and mother respectively, {{as well as that}} of Dr. Mephesto. Dr. Mephesto is based on Marlon Brando's character Dr. Moreau in the 1996 film, The Island of Dr. Moreau, which is based on the 1896 H. G. Wells novel of the same name. Mephesto is named after Mephistopheles, the demon in the Faust legend.

While it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip, intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19 June and the airstrip was not opened until 28 June.

The whole island of Bernera is also a SSSI, its limestone maritime cliffs being a key feature along with the presence of the nationally scarce rock whitebeam. Creag Island and Pladda are other islets in the Lynn of Lorn. Eilean nan Caorach, Inn Island, Eilean Droineach and Eilean Ramsay are amongst another cluster of small islands off the north coast, and Eilean Loch Oscair is to the NW.

5|$|The puffins are {{energetic}} burrow-engineers and repairers and {{the grassy}} slopes may be undermined by {{a network of}} tunnels. This causes the turf to dry out in summer, vegetation to die and dry soil be whirled away by the wind. Burrows sometimes collapse, and humans may cause this to happen by walking incautiously across nesting slopes. A colony on Grassholm was lost through erosion when there was so little soil left that burrows could not be made. New colonies are very unlikely to start up spontaneously because this gregarious bird will only nest where others are already present. Nevertheless, the Audubon Society had success on Eastern Egg Rock Island in Maine, where, after a gap of ninety years, puffins were reintroduced and started breeding again. By 2011 there were over 120 pairs nesting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>small</b> islet. On the Isle of May {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic, only five pairs of puffins were breeding in 1958 while twenty years later there were 10,000 pairs.|$|E
