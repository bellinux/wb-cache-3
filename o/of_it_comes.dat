However, while resting on the beach, Princess Toadstool disappears. When Mario and Luigi wake up, they try to find her and, after hours of searching, come across a giant egg in the forest. It suddenly hatches and out <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> a young dinosaur named Yoshi, who then tells them that his dinosaur friends have also been imprisoned in eggs by evil Koopas. Mario and Luigi soon realise {{that it must be}} the evil King Bowser and his Koopalings.|$|E

Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500milligrams per day. Sodium chloride (also known as common salt) is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from processed foods. The Dietary Reference Intake for sodium is 1.5grams per day, but {{most people in the}} United States consume more than 2.3grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.|$|E

Despite its location on the relatively dryer east side of Vancouver Island, the resulting weak rain shadow is not enough to keep the city dry.|$|E

25|$|Every year humans add 25 {{billion tons}} of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, and over half <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from their {{domestic}} activity. Attenborough introduces the Carbons, a fictional family occupying an average Western suburban house near a city. Their electrical requirements are supplied via fossil fuels. As Attenborough points out, the Carbons are not bad people, but as Westerners, they {{have one of the}} most energy-hungry lifestyles on the planet. They are a two-car household, and each vehicle emits 10 tons of CO2 {{over the course of a}} year. The power used to run the Carbons' home and all its comforts translates into a similar amount. Much of the family's plentiful food supply will have crossed continents by the time it reaches their kitchen, and will have added a tenth to their annual emissions. Yet more are produced by their refuse: buried in a landfill, it heats up as it decomposes and releases greenhouse gases. Mr Carbon's business trips by air contribute to the fastest growing source of CO2. The combined total of the Carbons' yearly air pollution is 45 tons.|$|E

M instructs Bond {{to get in touch}} with a CIA informant, Kristatos, who in turn tells Bond that a man named Enrico Colombo is behind the racket. When Bond sets out to find more information on Colombo, he is captured and brought aboard Colombo's ship, the Colombina. Colombo informs Bond that Kristatos is actually the one in charge of the drug smuggling operation, and that Kristatos is backed by the Russians. Colombo agrees to help Bond by providing information about things [...] "as long as none <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> back to Italy"; Bond agrees to help Colombo eliminate Kristatos. Bond, Colombo, and his men sail the Colombina to Santa Maria where they find Kristatos's ship at dock and his men unloading a cargo of drugs into a warehouse. [...] They attack Kristatos's operation and Bond discovers Kristatos lurking behind the warehouse, preparing to detonate a bomb to kill Colombo. Kristatos tries to escape, but Bond kills him.|$|E
500|$|Reaction to Lords of Shadow {{was highly}} positive. 1UP's review praised how the game took {{elements}} from other series and executed them well. GamesRadar drew favorable comparisons to other action games {{it has given}} a perfect score, including God of War III, Bayonetta and Dante's Inferno, while praising it for being [...] "huge in scope, length, and depth, and it's polished with obvious love and passion". [...] Official Xbox Magazine lauded {{the size of the}} game's content, writing [...] "... is big. Actually, big's too little a word. It's monolithic... From the Resi 4 mood of the scarecrow puzzle to the unexpected oddity of the music box level, this is a game that seemingly hasn't heard of DLC – and decides to offer you immense value for money instead." [...] The publication concluded it was otherwise a success. Other reviews noted that it was derivative of other games and that it was unlike the classic Castlevania series. GameSpot's review calls the game [...] "a good start for a series in need of some new blood – so to speak – it's just unfortunate so much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> from other games and not an original source." [...] IGN found the combat repetitive but felt the puzzles and platforming provided good pacing. Game Informers Tim Turi praised its boss battles, its magic-based combat system, and its story. GameZone ranked it as the sixth best Castlevania title. The staff praised the developers' success at bringing Castlevania to 3D.|$|E

500|$|London has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfb), though {{due to its}} downwind location relative to Lake Huron and elevation changes across the city, it is virtually on the Dfa/Dfb (hot summer) boundary favouring the former climate zone to the southwest of {{the confluence of the}} South and North Thames Rivers, and the latter zone to the northeast (including the airport). Because of its location in the continent, London experiences large seasonal contrast, tempered to a point by the surrounding Great Lakes.

The equitable maxim [...] "equity abhors a vacuum" [...] is followed: it is against principle {{for a piece of}} property to have no owner. As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a resulting trust to avoid this becoming an issue. They occur in one of four situations: where there is no declaration of trust, where an express trust fails, where there is surplus property, or upon the dissolution of an unincorporated association. Rules differ depending on the situation and the type of original trust under dispute; failed charitable trusts, for example, have the property reapplied in a different way from other forms of trust.|$|E

They reasoned that immigrants came only to take things away from Sodom and thus resolved to forget the traditional ways of hospitality.
