An analytical treatment is developed for a semi-cylindrical bearing with 9 orifices {{and for a}} cylindrical journal bearing with 192 radial and 24 axial orifices.

40|$|In {{externally}} pressurized bearings, {{forces can}} be transmitted {{by means of a}} fluid film interposed between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces by an external source. In the conventional types, the equilibrium of external forces and fluid film forces becomes stable by making the fluid flow through external restrictions before entering the clearance space. In the new types, external restrictions are superfluous. Stability and load capacity are ensured by directing the flow in the clearance space, by means of recurrent grooves <b>on</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces, towards a zone where both surfaces are plain...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} main types of lubrication: full-film condition, {{boundary}} condition, and dry condition. Full-film conditions are when the bearing's load is carried solely by {{a film of}} fluid lubricant {{and there is no}} contact between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces. In mix or boundary conditions, load is carried partly by direct surface contact and partly by a film forming between <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> In a dry condition, the full load is carried by surface-to-surface contact.|$|R

50|$|When {{an enemy}} surface craft was detected, {{bearings}} to it were measured {{from a pair}} of towers, using instruments like azimuth scopes or depression position finders. Since the distances along the line between the towers (called a baseline) had already been precisely measured by surveyors, the length of this baseline, plus <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>bearing</b> angles from <b>two</b> stations at <b>the</b> ends of the line (also called base end stations) to the target, could be used to plot the position of the target by a mathematical process called triangulation.|$|R
50|$|The {{thread angle}} is the {{included}} angle, measured at a section {{parallel to the}} axis, between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>bearing</b> faces of <b>the</b> thread. The angle between the axial load force and the normal to the bearing surface is approximately equal to half the thread angle, so the thread angle has a great effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> friction and efficiency of a screw, {{as well as the}} wear rate and the strength. The greater the thread angle, the greater the angle between the load vector and the surface normal, so the larger the normal force between the threads required to support a given load. Therefore, increasing the thread angle increases the friction and wear of a screw.|$|R

5000|$|Many current {{designs are}} now using an {{integrated}} bottom bracket with outboard bearings. This {{is an attempt to}} address several issues associated with weight and stiffness. Because of the relatively small 1.37" [...] (36 mm for shells threaded to the Italian standard) diameter shell, designs that place the bearings inside the shell can either have large bearings and a thinner spindle, which lacks stiffness, or smaller bearings and a thicker spindle (such as the original Shimano Octalink), which lacks durability. External bearings allow for a large diameter (hence stiff) and hollow (hence light) spindle. They also offer more distance between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces, which contributes to stiffness while allowing lighter components. A different approach would be to standardise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> larger BMX shell for all bicycles, or the BB30 standard originally introduced by Cannondale.|$|R

For this reason, the makers introduced a self-oiling system in which the oil was introduced into the fuel tank when the fuel tank was filled. This method brought the lubricant into the cylinders with the fuel and thoroughly lubricated the interior of the engine.
