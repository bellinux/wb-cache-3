500|$|In {{many respects}} (to Kennan's consternation) the {{priorities}} of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them. In his memoirs, Kennan recalled, [...] "So far as I could see, we were expecting {{to be able to}} gain <b>our</b> <b>objectives...</b> without making any concessions though, only 'if we were really all-powerful, and could hope to get away with it.' I very much doubted that this was the case." ...|$|E

"There is {{relatively}} little {{that is incompatible}} between <b>our</b> <b>objectives</b> and {{the objectives of the}} advertisers....Before sponsorship of a program series commences there is often a meeting between production personnel and representatives of the advertiser at which time the general areas of the advertiser's interest and general attitudes are discussed. A breakfast food advertiser may, for example, wish to make sure the programs do not contain elements that make breakfast distasteful. A cigarette manufacturer would not wish to have cigarette smoking depicted in an unattractive manner. Normally, as long as these considerations do not limit creativity, they will be adhered to." ...|$|E

500|$|In May, Benfica had {{two games}} in which to {{overcome}} a four-point deficit. On the fourth, they played Estrela da Amadora away. Benfica never beat Estrela's goalkeeper, Pedro Alves, drawing 0–0 and losing crucial points. Chalana said, [...] "We started the first half somewhat nervous. Not playing our best. However, the second half was different, we did everything to win, created opportunities but the ball just would not go in." [...] The draw left Benfica dependent on others to reach second place; even if they won, Sporting had to lose and Guimarães had to lose or draw. On 11 May, the club hosted Vitória de Setúbal. The match, attracting over 54,000 fans for Rui Costa's last game, was a 3–0 Benfica win. Sporting and Guimarães also won and Benfica finished fourth, missing a Champions League berth. It was their fifth finish outside the top three after fourth-place finishes in 1939–40, 1940–41 and 2001–02 and a sixth-place finish in 2000–01. Chalana said, [...] "Benfica is very big. We failed to reach <b>our</b> <b>objectives,</b> but nearly sold out the stadium today." [...] The club's season ended with an African tour in which they defeated a team with players from Sal and São Vicente on 17 May and the Angolan national team two days later.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his studies}} in the USSR, Elbegdorj learned about Glasnost, the {{concepts}} such as {{freedom of speech and}} economic liberties. After returning to Mongolia, he met other like-minded people and tried to present those ideas to a wider audience, despite attempts of repression from the Politburo-authority of the government, and threats by his employer to lose his job. At the end of a speech at the Young Artists' Second National Congress on 28 November 1989, Elbegdorj said that Mongolia needed democracy and appealed to youth to collaborate to create democracy in Mongolia. He told the audience [...] "We consider that Perestroika is a timely and brave step. Youth's contribution to this revolutionary matter is not by supportive talks but by certain work. Our contribution is <b>our</b> <b>objectives</b> to be fulfilled. <b>Our</b> <b>objectives</b> are:... following democracy and transparency and contributing to glasnost,... and supporting fair progressive power... These are the objectives of an initiatives' group-an organization that shall work. After the congress I hope we will gather and discuss with you about it in this (newly forming group).

2500|$|The rebel defeat {{has been}} {{attributed}} by {{one side to}} a misjudgement of Déby's strength, which brought to an attack with too few troops and heavy weapons, and by the other side due to divisions among the rebel commanders. While stating that the troops were well coordinated during the battle, some of the participants mentioned the three-headed leadership {{as one of the}} reasons for the defeat. The rivality among the groups had surfaced easily during the groups, as recognized by Nouri: [...] "In Ndjamena we wanted to send out a radio message, but we were unable to agree on which leader was going to read it out", adding that [...] "after the fall of the regime <b>our</b> <b>objectives</b> are different." ...|$|E

The Russian Agriculture Minister Alexander Krivoshein, who was especially trusted by Nicholas, noted that:"...our rearmament programme had not been completed and it seemed doubtful whether our Army and Fleet would {{ever be able to}} compete with those of Germany and Austria-Hungary as regards modern technical efficiency... No one in Russia desired a war. The disastrous consequences of the Russo-Japanese War had shown the grave danger which Russia would run in case of hostilities. Consequently our policy should aim at reducing the possibility of a European war, but if we remained passive we would attain <b>our</b> <b>objectives...</b> In his view stronger language than we had used hitherto was desirable." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} meeting Roy R. Rubottom, Jr., Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, {{summarized}} {{the evolution of}} Cuba–United States relations since January: [...] "The period from January to March might be characterized as the honeymoon period of the Castro government. In April a downward trend in US–Cuban relations had been evident… In June we had reached the decision {{that it was not}} possible to achieve <b>our</b> <b>objectives</b> with Castro in power and had agreed to undertake the program referred to by Undersecretary of State Livingston T. Merchant. On 31 October in agreement with the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department had recommended to the President approval of a program along the lines referred to by Mr. Merchant. The approved program authorized us to support elements in Cuba opposed to the Castro government while making Castro's downfall seem to be the result of his own mistakes." [...] In February 1960, the French ship La Coubre was blown up in Havana Harbor as it unloaded munitions, killing dozens. The explosion was blamed on the CIA by the Cuban government.|$|E

During the time when the previous Government prohibited integration within our communities, rather than divide into separate administrative structures for each population group, we opted to limit membership of the Bahá'í Administration to the black adherents who were and remain in the majority of our membership and thereby placed the entire Bahá'í community under the stewardship of its black membership....
