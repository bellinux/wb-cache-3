50|$|As World War II {{interrupted}} any {{prospects for}} a world championship match, Fine turned to chess writing. In 1939, Fine became the first grandmaster-class player to edit the classic <b>opening</b> <b>guide</b> Modern Chess Openings. His work on the sixth edition of the book led to {{a significant increase in}} sales. In 1941 he wrote Basic Chess Endings, a compendium of endgame analysis which, some 70 years later, is still considered one of the best works on this subject. His book was the most comprehensive on the subject written to that time, included significant original work by Fine, and received worldwide acclaim. His The Ideas Behind the Chess Openings, though now out of date, is still useful for grasping the underlying ideas of many standard chess openings; it was revised in 1989.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the accuracy of depth implant insertion and to describe the frequency of early surgical complications or unexpected events, recorded using a single, totally guided, stereolithographic surgi-guide (bone-, mucosa- and teeth-supported) for both osteotomy site preparation and implant delivery. Ten adults were included in this study. Six patients were treated in both arches, and the number of computer aided implantology (CAI) interventions was 16, which equalled the number of guides used, for a total of Ill implants inserted. Complications and unexpected events occurred during the positioning of the surgical guide and whilst preparing the implant site and installing implants. In order to minimize the risk of complications and unexpected events, attention must be paid to every stage of treatment, including checking computed tomography (CT) images, guide manufacturing, proper guide positioning in the mouth, guide fixation, rotational allowance of drill in tubes, shape and sharpness of the drills, first entry point, mouth <b>opening</b> and <b>guided</b> implant insertion...|$|R

40|$|A new {{decision-making}} {{tool that}} will assist designers {{in the selection}} of appropriate daylighting solutions for buildings in tropical locations has been previously proposed by the authors. Through an evaluation matrix that prioritizes the parameters that best respond to the needs of tropical climates (e. g. reducing solar gain and protection from glare) the tool determines the most appropriate devices for specific climate and building inputs. The tool is effective in demonstrating the broad benefits and limitations of the different daylight strategies for buildings in the tropics. However for thorough analysis and calibration of the tool, validation is necessary. This paper presents a first step in the validation process. RADIANCE simulations were conducted to compare simulation performance with the performance predicted by the tool. To this end, an office building case study in subtropical Brisbane, Australia, and five different daylighting devices including <b>openings,</b> light <b>guiding</b> systems and light transport systems were simulated. Illuminance, light uniformity, daylight penetration and glare analysis were assessed for each device. The results indicate the tool can appropriately rank and recommend daylighting strategies based on specific building inputs for tropical and subtropical regions, making it a useful resource for designers. ...|$|R

40|$|In shogi {{the use of}} {{an opening}} {{database}} is not as effective as for example in chess. Tests with a large opening database show that on average only move suggestions for the first nine moves can be expected. Therefore, planning the development of pieces in the <b>opening</b> must be <b>guided</b> in a different way to avoid that the program will be at a disadvantage early in the game. In this paper we propose two methods for partially matching the game position with positions in the database. The first partial matching method is half matching, in which only the pieces of the player to move are matched to the positions in the database. The second type of matching is quarter matching, where the pieces of the player to move in two 5 &times; 5 sections of the board are matched to positions in the database. We show that with these matching methods, we can extend the phase of the game in which the opening database is effective.

Most of the RANS turbulence models solved the shear stress by linear difference scheme and isotropic models, so they could not capture all kinds of vortexes in the pump-turbine well.
