Compared to conventional conductors, HTLS conductors have some of the improved electrical and mechanical characteristics, where by employing these conductors in overhead transmission lines, some of the complex issues related to power transmission could be resolved. However due to their novel appearance and lack of service experiences in the field, most of the utilities in the world are in a dilemma whether to use these conductors instead of ACSR or other conventional types of conductors that have provided a great service to the utilities throughout hundreds of years. Situation in Sri Lanka is also not that different. Almost the entire Sri Lanka’s transmission system is comprising with overhead lines constructed using conventional conductors, especially ACSR. Therefore the knowledge and the experience regarding the use of HTLS or any other types of conductors remain minimal among utility engineers. Therefore under this study, the use of these so called HTLS conductors for Sri Lanka’s electricity system is discussed in terms of technical and economic aspects under three different categories of <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> <b>construction.</b> Conclusions are drawn based on simulations results and comparisons are also elaborated...|$|E

40|$|The voltage-sourced converter-based HVDC link, {{including}} the modular multilevel converter (MMC) configuration, {{is suitable for}} wind power, photovoltaic energy, {{and other kinds of}} new energy delivery and grid-connection. Current studies are focused on the MMC principles and controls and few studies have been done on the overvoltage of transmission line for the MMC-HVDC link. The main reason is that environmental factors have little effect on DC cables and the single-phase/pole fault rate is low. But if the cables were replaced by the <b>overhead</b> <b>lines,</b> although the <b>construction</b> cost of the project would be greatly reduced, the single-pole ground fault rate would be much higher. This paper analyzed the main overvoltage types in multiple-terminal MMC-HVDC network which transmit electric power by <b>overhead</b> <b>lines.</b> Based on ± 500 [*]kV multiple-terminal MMC-HVDC for wind power delivery project, the transient simulation model was built and the overvoltage types mentioned above were studied.

40|$|Telephone {{interviews}} were conducted with 23 utility engineers concerning the future prospects for high-temperature superconducting (HTS) transmission cables. All have direct responsibility for transmission in their utility, most of them in a management capacity. The engineers represented their utilities as members of the Electric Power Research Institute`s Underground Transmission Task Force (which has since been disbanded). In that capacity, they followed the superconducting transmission cable program and are aware of the cryogenic implications. Nineteen of the 23 engineers stated the market for underground transmission would grow during the next decade. Twelve of those specified an annual growth rate; the average of these responses was 5. 6 %. Adjusting that figure downward to incorporate the remaining responses, this study assumes an average growth rate of 3. 4 %. Factors driving the growth rate include the difficulty in securing rights-of-way for <b>overhead</b> <b>lines,</b> new <b>construction</b> techniques that reduce the costs of underground transmission, deregulation, and the possibility that public utility commissions will allow utilities to include overhead costs in their rate base. Utilities have few plans to replace existing cable as preventive maintenance, even though much of the existing cable has exceeded its 40 -year lifetime. Ten of the respondents said the availability of a superconducting cable with the same life-cycle costs as a conventional cable and twice the ampacity would induce them to consider retrofits. The respondents said a cable with those characteristics would capture 73 % of their cable retrofits...|$|R

40|$|The {{in-service}} {{performance of}} transmission tower foundation systems is poorly understood. This knowledge deficiency is particularly acute {{with regard to}} the dynamic and transient loading of these foundations in uplift. There is also uncertainty surrounding the integrity of existing assets as design practice appears to overestimate the capacity of the foundations when they are subject to testing. A significant component of cost of new high voltage <b>overhead</b> <b>line</b> route <b>construction</b> or uprating involves the maintenance or reinforcement of the individual transmission tower foundation systems. Therefore, a more developed understanding of the foundation system behaviour is required to facilitate these works in a cost-effective and timely manner. To {{gain a better understanding of}} foundation system performance, a series of full scale rapid uplift tests were carried out in July 2012. The tests bridged understanding of the load-displacement, load-rate and rate effects of soils from previous experimental research to field scale, with associated construction and in situ soil nonlinearities. The tests made use of modern instrumentation and monitoring techniques in combination with rigorous numerical finite element back analysis to update understanding of in situ failure mechanisms and capture uplift capacity enhancements due to the application of rapid loading. The field tests and numerical back analysis results highlighted significant limitations in current design practice particularly the reliance on an outdated failure mechanism and ultimate limit state criterion. The results of the rapid uplift tests compared to standard industry practice suggested that the latter method may be unduly conservative leading to an underestimation of in-service capacities. The results presented will lead to a better understanding of foundation system performance and more legitimate design and testing practice technical specifications...|$|R
