5|$|The {{scene where}} Sarah {{encounters}} the Fire Gang {{had to be}} altered in post-production {{as it had been}} filmed against black velvet cloth, to disguise the puppeteers, and a new forest background was added behind. Jim Henson was unhappy with the compositing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> scene, although he considered the puppetry featured in it worthy of inclusion.|$|E
5|$|Before the film's {{worldwide}} release date, Pixar {{granted a}} wish from 10-year-old Colby Curtin {{to see the}} film before she died. Colby {{had been diagnosed with}} cancer and was too sick to go to a theater. A Pixar employee flew to the Curtins' house with a DVD <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> film and screened it for her and her family. Curtin died seven hours later at 9:20 pm, shortly after seeing the film.|$|E
5|$|The AFM {{played a}} leading role in {{organizing}} and institutionalizing Pentecostalism in the Midwest and Southwest and from 1909–1912 absorbed smaller Pentecostal groups. It also established relationships with Pentecostal missions in the Midwest. The Midwestern Pentecostal movement centered around the Stone Church, pastored by William Piper, and the North Avenue Mission, pastored by William Howard Durham, both in Chicago, Illinois. Durham was the lead promoter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Finished</b> Work doctrine which, in time, the AFM would adopt and in doing so discard the Wesleyan view of sanctification as a second work of grace.|$|E

5|$|The ancient Egyptians could {{fabricate}} a {{wide variety}} of objects from glass with great skill, {{but it is not clear}} whether they developed the process independently. It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished. However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> glass. A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040. The main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and environmental profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> products. The reasons to use LCA arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements {{that could be used in}} order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes. In addition, the purpose was to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days before}} {{the signing of the}} 1890 act, Barber wrote to the {{superintendent}} of the Philadelphia Mint, Oliver Bosbyshell, setting forth proposed terms of a competition to select new coin designs. Barber suggested that entrants be required to submit models, as opposed to drawings, and that the designs be in low relief, which was used for coins. He proposed that the entries include the lettering and denomination, as submissions without them would not adequately show the appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> coin. He received a reply that due to other work, the Mint {{would not be able to}} address the question until the spring of 1891.|$|E

5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used {{in a number of}} applications, including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut into the shape of the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E
5|$|In a {{preliminary}} study for The World Before the Flood {{now in the}} York Art Gallery, the broad structure {{is similar to that}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> work, but the focus is more strongly on the central group of women. In Etty's oil sketch and in preliminary drawings the right-most of the dancing figures, wearing a green skirt, faces outward with her arms behind her back, forming a closed circle together with the central group of dancers. In the finished work, she gestures outwards from the circle, creating a clear narrative flow in the positions of the figures: from the single men on the left, to the man choosing a wife, to the group of dancing women, to the couple leaving the circle of dancers to join the reclining lovers on the far right.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford began {{a career}} in law, working as a court stenographer, trial lawyer and prosecutor. He became a special judge in the 14th Judicial District of Missouri at some time after 1895. He {{developed}} {{an interest in the}} doctrines of Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell, which led to his joining the Bible Student movement, and he was baptized in 1906. He was appointed the legal counsel for the Watch Tower Society in 1907, as well as a traveling representative prior to his election as president in 1917. His early presidency was marked by a dispute with the Society's board of directors, in which four of its seven members accused him of autocratic behavior and sought to reduce his powers. The resulting leadership crisis divided the Bible Student community and contributed to the loss of one-seventh of adherents by 1919 and thousands more by 1931. Rutherford and seven other Watch Tower executives were imprisoned in 1918 after charges were laid over the publication <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Finished</b> Mystery, a book deemed seditious for its opposition to World War I.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth season}} of the American {{television}} comedy The Office premiered in the United States on NBC on September 27, 2007, and concluded on May 15, 2008. The season consisted of 9 half-hour episodes, and 5 hour-long episodes to comprise the 19 total episodes of material created. The Office is an American adaptation of the British TV series of the same name, and is presented in a mockumentary format, portraying {{the daily lives of}} office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictitious Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. The season was interrupted and shortened due to the effects of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, in which the writers and some actors of The Office went on strike; although 30 half-hour episodes had been ordered, only 19 were actually filmed. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> episodes were condensed into hour-long episodes, resulting in only 14 episodes being aired.|$|E

25|$|While the Portuguese wine Port is {{similarly}} {{made with a}} mutage halting the fermentation, there are some distinct differences in how vin doux naturels like Maurys are made. For one, the fortifying spirits used in Port are of a lower alcohol strength (traditionally 77%) while those used for vin doux naturels are often 95%. The spirits are then added to the VdNs later in the fermentation process than with Port. More of the fortifying spirits are often used in Port production, representing up to a fifth (20%) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> volume of wine compared to the spirits accounting for around 15% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> volume of the VdNs. This means that most VdNs contain less water and alcohol than the typical Port wine.|$|E
25|$|In general, none {{of these}} early malts would have been well {{shielded}} from the smoke involved in the kilning process, and consequently, early beers {{would have had a}} smoky component to their flavors; evidence indicates that maltsters and brewers constantly tried to minimize the smokiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> beer.|$|E
