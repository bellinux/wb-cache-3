25|$|In the U.S., the Federal Reserve most {{commonly}} uses overnight repurchase agreements (repos) to temporarily create money, or reverse repos to temporarily destroy money, which offset temporary {{changes in the}} level of bank reserves. The Federal Reserve also makes <b>outright</b> <b>purchases</b> and sales of securities through the System Open Market Account (SOMA) with its manager over the Trading Desk at the New York Reserve Bank. The trade of securities in the SOMA changes the balance of bank reserves, which also affects short-term interest rates. The SOMA manager is responsible for trades that result in a short-term interest rate near the target rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), or create money by the outright purchase of securities. More rarely will it permanently destroy money by the outright sale of securities. These trades are made with a group of about 22 banks and bond dealers called primary dealers.|$|E

5000|$|Investment in land {{often takes}} the form of {{long-term}} leases, as opposed to <b>outright</b> <b>purchases,</b> of land. These leases often range between 25 and 99 years. Such leases are usually undertaken between national or district governments and investors. Because the majority of land in Africa is categorized as “non-private" [...] as a result of government policies on public land ownership and a lack of active titling, governments own or control most of the land that is available for purchase or lease. Purchases are much less common than leases due to a number of countries’ constitutional bans on outright sales of land to foreigners.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} such a Scots rebel who started in the colony as a convict was James Pittillo. He survived his {{indenture}} and in 1726 was granted 242 acre on Wagua Creek. He gradually became a major landowner in the area. He was appointed as a tobacco inspector in Bristol Parish in 1728 and that year served with William Byrd II on his spring and fall expeditions to survey the border between Virginia and North Carolina. Taking advantage of land grants due to headrights, for people whose passage he paid to the colony, and <b>outright</b> <b>purchases,</b> Pittillo ultimately owned more than 4000 acre in the area of Prince George County, Brunswick, and Dinwiddie counties in Southside Virginia.|$|E

50|$|Perkins {{was one of}} {{the largest}} land owners in the state. Portage County, Ohio records of 1815 show that he paid one-eleventh of all state real estate taxes from the county. Some of the townships listed are in present-day Summit County, Ohio. Most of these {{holdings}} were acquired through <b>outright</b> <b>purchases.</b> Some of his holdings were in what is now Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio and western Akron, Ohio. On March 25, 1815, he purchased 1,298 acres from Samuel Parkman for $2.08 an acre. This tract would become most of downtown Akron. When he learned of plans for a canal system that would run from Cleveland to the Ohio River, he immediately began to make more purchases of more land in this area. Some of this land was located near Summit Lake, located in what is now south Akron. He hoped that the new canal would be routed through this lake, increasing the value of the land. In 1825, he was successful in convincing the other canal commissioners of this route and therefore donated land to the state for the canal right-of-way. Also in 1825, he and Paul Williams (a settler from Connecticut) donated 100 lots of land to the state, thus founding the City of Akron. It was recorded on December 6, 1825 at the Portage County seat of Ravenna. Due to its location at the highest point on the new canal, Akron quickly became a prosperous town. However, Gen. Perkins never lived in Akron. His oldest son, Colonel Simon Perkins, moved to the Akron area in 1834 to oversee his father's holdings in the area. His large house, the Perkins Stone Mansion, was completed in 1837 and remains to this day, now operated as a house museum by The Summit County Historical Society of Akron, Ohio. Col. Perkins also operated a large sheep farm and wool business, among other concerns, which for a time was managed by the abolitionist John Brown.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} Large Scale Asset Purchases (LSAPs) in a New-Keynesian DSGE {{model that}} features distinct mortgage and corporate loan markets. We show that following a significant disruption of financial intermediation, central-bank purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are uniformly less effective at easing credit market conditions and stabilizing economic activity than <b>outright</b> <b>purchases</b> of corporate bonds. Moreover, {{the size of}} the effects crucially depends {{on the extent to which}} credit markets are segmented, i. e. to which a "portfolio balance channel" is at work in the economy. More segmented credit markets imply larger, but more local effects of particular asset purchases. With strongly segmented credit markets, large scale purchases of MBS are useful to stabilize the housing market but do little to mitigate the contractionary effect of the crisis on employment and output...|$|E

40|$|Inflation in {{the euro}} {{area has been}} below the European Central Bank's target {{for almost a year}} now and it is also {{expected}} to remain at a very low level in the near future. On the one hand, such a low level of inflation is not in line with the ECB's objective. On the other hand, there is the risk that this situation will lead to a slide into deflation. In view of the ECB's historically low policy rates, the question arises as to which monetary policy options are available. In order to counteract possible deflation, primarily unconventional measures remain open to the ECB, such as <b>outright</b> <b>purchases</b> of securities. But the onus is also on fiscal and economic policy to actively address low inflation and the risks of deflation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{consequences}} of equity injections into banks with purchases of corporate and government bonds in a financial crisis situation using a New Keynesian model in which non-financial firms predominantly take non-market-based debt from banks instead of issuing securities. Our results show that equity injections into banks are more welfare enhancing than asset purchases following a financial shock located in the banking sector. Equity injections remove the frictions that have initiated the stress and, at the same time, relax borrowing conditions. <b>Outright</b> <b>purchases</b> also increase welfare but lower returns with negative effects on banks' profits, while the effect on asset prices to stabilize banks' balance sheets is of minor importance due to the dominance of non-market-based debt. Furthermore, we demonstrate that {{the origin of the}} financial shock matters crucially for the efficacy of measures...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{paper is}} a {{short-term}} debt instrument issued by large corporations. The commercial paper market {{has long been}} viewed as a bastion of high liquidity and low risk. But twice during the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009, the commercial paper market nearly dried up and ceased being perceived as a safe haven. Major interventions by the Federal Reserve, including large <b>outright</b> <b>purchases</b> of commercial paper, were eventually used to support both issuers of and investors in commercial paper. We will offer {{an analysis of the}} commercial paper market during the financial crisis. First, we describe the institutional background of the commercial paper market. Second, we analyze the supply and demand sides of the market. Third, we examine the most important developments during the crisis of 2007 - 2009. Last, we discuss three explanations of the decline in the commercial paper market: substitution to alternative sources of financing by commercial paper issuers, adverse selection, and institutional constraints among money market funds. ...|$|E
40|$|Sovereign debt crises may {{be driven}} by either self-fulfilling {{expectations}} of default or fundamental fiscal stress. This paper studies the mechanisms by which either conventional or unconventional monetary policy can rule out the former. Conventional monetary policy is modelled as a standard choice of inflation, while unconventional policy as <b>outright</b> <b>purchases</b> in the debt market. By intervening in the sovereign debt market, the central bank effectively swaps risky government paper for monetary liabilities only exposed to inflation risk and thus yielding a lower interest rate. We show that, provided fiscal and monetary authorities share the same objective function, there is a minimum threshold for the size of interventions at which a backstop rules out self-fulfilling default without eliminating the possibility of fundamental default under fiscal stress. Fundamental default risk does not generally undermine the credibility of a backstop, nor does it foreshadow runaway inflation, even when the central bank is held responsible for its own losses...|$|E
30|$|Some notable shocks {{that have}} arisen {{as a result}} of land {{privatization}} are conflicts due to multiple claims on a given piece of land, loss of livestock passage corridors and public spaces, live fencing material growing to take over land used for other purposes and if eaten had a harmful effect on livestock, land grabbing and dispossession of customary pastoral land users, and environmental degradation on surrounding rangelands (Odouri et al. 2006). In southern Ethiopia, the renting of grazing lands by traders for market animals after purchases can be directly traced to the past five years and the increase in high-value export trade in the region (Tiki and Little 2013). As involvement in export markets grows and the demand increases for high-quality animals, one can expect that private grazing leases or <b>outright</b> <b>purchases</b> of communal lands may grow. Unfortunately, these changes occur in settings where communal access to land provide flexible responses to temporal and spatial variability in pasture availability, which are important means of coping with the kinds of climate shocks that were previously discussed.|$|E

It presents two methods through which public managers can estimate and assess the value of procuring motor vehicles either under lease payment or direct purchase. Using data from selected government agencies, the net present values generated suggest that <b>outright</b> <b>purchase</b> of low-end vehicles is preferable to leasing. For high-end models, leasing offers a more practical option. The findings, however, are far from conclusive because assumptions regarding the variables and input data are subject to change. Results can be significantly improved with better and more accurate statistics. To gain sufficient understanding of the issue, factors other than those covered by the study, i. e., economies of scale and entry of commercial banks, must also be explored...|$|R
