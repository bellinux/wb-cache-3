5|$|On-Loan {{cards are}} issued for usage in day-to-day functions, {{primarily}} for fare payment in transport systems. They are further classified into Child, Adult, Elder, and Personalised categories, {{with the first}} three based on age and different amounts of fare concession. With {{the exception of the}} Personalised cards, On-Loan cards are anonymous; no personal information, bank account, <b>or</b> <b>credit</b> card details are stored on the card, and no identification is required for the purchase of these cards. If an owner loses a card, only the stored value and the deposit of the card are lost. On-Loan Octopus cards may be purchased at all MTR stations, the KMB Customer Service Centre, New World First Ferry (NWFF) Octopus Service Centres, and the New World First Bus (NWFB) Customer Service Centre. A student on-loan Octopus Card was initially issued, but was discontinued in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Turnpike Commission {{announced}} plans to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this, tolls will be paid using either E-ZPass <b>or</b> <b>credit</b> cards. Drivers unable to pay by either of these methods will be billed in the mail using license plate recognition; an additional surcharge will be applied. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls.|$|E

5|$|Toll plazas {{are located}} along the South Bay Expressway at all {{northbound}} onramps and southbound offramps; {{there is also}} a mainline Otay Mesa Toll Plaza {{at the southern end of}} the facility just north of Otay Mesa Road. The toll road is equipped with the FasTrak electronic toll collection system, with drivers being charged a prorated toll based on the distance traveled. Those paying by cash <b>or</b> <b>credit</b> card are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which toll booth they pass through, using a barrier toll system. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver that passes through the Otay Mesa Toll Plaza ends up paying $3.50 regardless of the distance they actually traveled.|$|E

5|$|In addition, {{the credit}} {{was given to}} Augustus for each {{subsequent}} Roman military victory after this time, {{because the majority of}} Rome's armies were stationed in imperial provinces commanded by Augustus through the legatus who were deputies of the princeps in the provinces. Moreover, if a battle was fought in a Senatorial province, Augustus' proconsular imperium maius allowed him to take command of (<b>or</b> <b>credit</b> for) any major military victory. This meant that Augustus was the only individual able to receive a triumph, a tradition that began with Romulus, Rome's first King and first triumphant general. Lucius Cornelius Balbus was the last man outside Augustus' family to receive this award, in 19BC. (Balbus was the nephew of Julius Caesar's great agent, who was governor of Africa and conqueror of the Garamantes.) Tiberius, Augustus' eldest son by marriage to Livia, was the only other general to receive a triumph—for victories in Germania in 7BC.|$|E

With this system, tolls will be paid with E-ZPass <b>or</b> <b>credit</b> cards. Drivers unable to pay by either method will be billed by mail (using license plate recognition), and a surcharge will be imposed. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls. On March 6, 2012, the turnpike commission {{announced that it was}} implementing an all-electronic tolling plan. The turnpike commission will save $65million annually on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. Plans call for a 76-percent surcharge on motorists without E-ZPass who are billed by mail; this surcharge could raise the toll for a motorist without E-ZPass to well over $50 to travel the entire turnpike. On January 3, 2016, all-electronic tolling was introduced in the westbound direction at the Delaware River Bridge mainline toll plaza, while the eastern terminus of the ticket system was moved from the Delaware River Bridge to Neshaminy Falls.|$|E
