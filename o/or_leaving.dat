5|$|The {{national}} flag is sometimes flown by Singapore-registered vessels, {{although this is}} considered incorrect, as such vessels are required to hoist proper national colours either when entering <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> port. The ensign is red and charged with a circle enclosing a crescent surmounted by five stars in a circle, all in white. The {{national flag}} is not used by coast guard ships and military warships; both classes of ships have their own specific ensigns.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> as they choose. Journey {{was released}} on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
5|$|AirTrain JFK is free {{within the}} {{terminal}} area {{and to the}} hotel and car rental shuttle buses at Federal Circle. Entering <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> the system at the Jamaica or Howard Beach stations requires that a $5 fare be paid using a MetroCard. A $1 fee is charged for all new MetroCard purchases. Transferring to the Q3, Q10, or B15 from Terminal 5 requires an extra $2.75 fare, since the MTA does not offer free transfers from the AirTrain. Consequently, entering the subway at either Jamaica or Howard Beach costs $7.75, and entering the LIRR at Jamaica costs $14.25 during peak hours and $9 during off-peak with the LIRR CityTicket.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Germans {{allowed the}} Judenrat {{to set up}} a {{judicial}} system.

In June 1942, Gens took the responsibility for carrying out the death sentence imposed on five men from the ghetto who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted of committing a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time. Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes at the gates leading into the ghetto. The police also organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.|$|E

5|$|On 27 July, as the {{squadron}} neared Rochefort, it was spotted by HMS Mars, a Royal Navy ship {{of the line}} stationed off the port to intercept French ships entering <b>or</b> <b>leaving.</b> Signalling {{to the rest of}} the British squadron, Captain Robert Dudley Oliver took Mars in pursuit, chasing the French squadron all through the night and into the next morning, by which time the frigate Rhin had fallen far behind the others. Recognising that Rhin was in danger of being captured, Lamellerie turned back to her defence with his main squadron but then changed his mind, turning once more and retreating to Rochefort as Oliver took possession of the heavily outgunned Rhin.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 10 November 1808 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} of the Napoleonic Wars, in which a British frigate defeated and captured a French frigate in the Bay of Biscay. The action formed part of the blockade of the French Biscay ports during the war by the British Royal Navy, a strategy designed to prevent ships from entering <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> French harbours, thus eliminating foreign trade with France and damaging the French economy as well as cutting France off from her overseas colonies. The French ship in the action, Thétis, was destined for the French held West Indian island of Martinique with a cargo of flour and military supplies, including over 100 soldiers to reinforce the island's garrison.|$|E
5|$|The Red Ensign of Singapore {{is a civil}} ensign used by privately owned, non-military {{ships that}} are {{registered}} in Singapore. The overall design of the ensign is a modification of the national flag, with {{the ratio of the}} width to the length extended to 1:2. The ensign was created by law in 1966. The use of this ensign is regulated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). According to the MPA, the Red Ensign is the only ensign to be used on Singaporean civilian ships, and the national flag is not an acceptable substitute. The ensign must be hoisted on all Singaporean ships on entering <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> port.|$|E

5|$|The most {{prominent}} building in Lookout Point {{is the local}} fire station, which also serves both Caversham and Green Island. This 1956 structure is located immediately {{to the north of}} the saddle and is a prominent landmark upon entering <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> Dunedin. Not far from the fire station to the north-east is Dunedin's tallest tree, a eucalyptus measuring an estimated 100 metres. The Dunedin Southern Motorway officially begins at the Lookout Point saddle, between Calton Hill and Maryhill, and sweeps down over broken hill country past Green Island to Mosgiel and the Taieri Plains.|$|E
5|$|The station's {{architecture}} is an austere combination {{of concrete and}} stainless steel, with stacked banks of escalators supported from the cross-bracing structures spanning the station box and routes for passengers entering <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> the station separated from those changing between lines. As with the other underground stations on the extension, the Jubilee line platforms feature platform screen doors to improve airflow through the system and increase safety. The station design won a number of awards including Civic Trust awards in 2000 and 2002, the Royal Fine Art Commission Millennium Building of the Year award in 2000 and the RIBA Award for Architecture in 2001. Both projects were jointly short-listed in 2001 for the RIBA's prestigious Stirling Prize.|$|E
5|$|By {{the autumn}} of 1794, the {{squadron}} was {{under the command of}} Commodore Sir Edward Pellew in the frigate HMS Arethusa, accompanied by HMS Artois under Captain Edmund Nagle, HMS Diamond under Captain Sir Sidney Smith and HMS Galatea under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats. All four ships had specially selected crews and equipment and the squadron formed the elite force of the Channel Fleet's light warships. Pellew led his squadron out of Cawsand Bay on 19 October with the intention of cruising off the entrance to Brest and intercepting shipping entering <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> the port. The French fleet, its principal squadrons blockaded in Brest, continued to send raiders to sea. One such ship, was the large newly commissioned 40-gun frigate Révolutionnaire under Captain Antoine René Thévenard with a hastily assembled and disaffected crew and a main battery of 18–pounder cannon, which departed from the Channel port of Le Havre on 13 October, sailing westwards towards the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> {{the back door of}} the house with a box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E
5|$|Eberhardt {{was well}} educated; {{along with the}} other {{children}} in the family, she was home-schooled by Trophimowsky. She was fluent in French, spoke Russian, German and Italian, and was taught Latin, Greek, and classical Arabic. She studied philosophy, metaphysics, chemistry, history, and geography, though she was most passionate about literature, reading the works of authors including Pierre Loti, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Leo Tolstoy, Voltaire and Émile Zola while she was a teenager, and was also an admirer of the poets Semyon Nadson and Charles Baudelaire. At an early age she began wearing male clothing, enjoying its freedom, and her nonconformist father did not discourage her. The children of deMoerder resented their stepfather, who forbade them from obtaining professions <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> the home, and effectively used them as slaves to tend to his extensive gardens. Eberhardt's sister Nathalie married against Trophimowsky's wishes in 1888, and was subsequently cut {{off from the rest of}} the household. Nathalie's departure had a profound effect on Eberhart's childhood, as she had been responsible for most of the home duties; the household subsequently suffered from a lack of hygiene and regular meals.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians {{depicted}} in literature were relatively {{rare in the}} 1950s. It was the publisher's policy in any novel involving lesbianism that the characters would never receive any satisfaction from the relationship. One or both usually ended up committing suicide, going insane, <b>or</b> <b>leaving</b> the relationship. Marijane Meaker discusses this in the 2004 foreword of Spring Fire: she was told by editor Dick Carroll that because the books were distributed by the U.S. Post Office instead of private companies delivering directly to stores, postal inspectors would send the books back to the publisher if homosexuality was depicted positively. The Postal Service relaxed their censorship after several First Amendment obscenity trials, including Roth v. United States and another regarding Allen Ginsberg's Howl in the mid-1950s, which gave Bannon a modicum of freedom in her plots. Although the ending to Odd Girl Out did not veer {{too far from the}} unsatisfactory resolution formula of Spring Fire, Women's Barracks, and Radclyffe Hall's The Well of Loneliness, it examined Laura's internal struggle in the realization that despite her femininity, she was deeply in love with another woman, and at the end she embraced it, which was rare in lesbian fiction.|$|E
