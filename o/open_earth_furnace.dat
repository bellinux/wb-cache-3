40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of open earth pan furnace used conventionally for preparing jaggery (gur) is very low. Dry bagasse {{is used as}} a fuel to produce heat in a combustion process in the <b>open</b> <b>earth</b> <b>furnace.</b> The energy loss due to inefficient combustion process, the energy loss through exhaust gases and other losses due to furnace wall, convection and radiation bring the thermal efficiency of open earth pan furnace to a low value. Certain quantity of energy produced in combustion process is used to sensibly heat the sugarcane juice to its evaporation temperature. Solar collectors can supply the sensible heat required to raise the sugarcane juice temperature up to its boiling point, thereby reducing the total quantity of heat required in preparing the jaggery. Solar drier can be used to supply hot air required for the combustion process to burn the bagasse in more efficient manner. This paper presents analytical calculations done to study the performance improvement of the jaggery making unit using solar collector and solar drier...|$|E

Therefore, {{from the perspective of}} a user, the Earth Observation data and other kinds of geospatial data necessary to satisfy his or her information need can only be found in different data silos, where each silo may contain only part of the needed data. Opening up these silos by publishing their contents as RDF and interlinking them with semantic connections allows the development of data analytics applications with great environmental and financial value. In this paper, we present the life-cycle of big, linked and <b>open</b> <b>Earth</b> Observation data and we show how to support its various stages using the software stack developed by the projects EU research projects TELEIOS and LEO.

He was about to rise when he stopped suddenly and became motionless.|$|R
