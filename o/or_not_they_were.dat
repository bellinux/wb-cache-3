5|$|With the film's Laserdisc release, Variety first {{reported}} in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character. While undetectable when {{played at the}} usual rate of 24 film frames per second, the Laserdisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the Laserdisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on CNN and various newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Dixon then {{travelled}} to Australia {{with his}} wife to engage in itinerant preaching there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did not yet {{know the name of}} the man he was looking for. In Adelaide, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in Perth, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> headed for heaven or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians {{as a result of his}} evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.|$|E
5|$|Henry of Huntingdon {{records that}} noblemen sent their {{children}} to be educated at Bloet's household, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> destined {{for a career in}} the church. King Henry's illegitimate son Robert of Gloucester was educated in Bloet's care. Another illegitimate son of Henry's, Richard of Lincoln, was also in Bloet's household for an education. Gilbert of Sempringham, who founded the Gilbertine Order, was also educated in Bloet's household, entering it before Bloet's death and continuing there under Bloet's successor Alexander of Lincoln. Besides educating laymen, Bloet educated his own household clergy, including sending some of them to study under Ivo, Bishop of Chartres. He was known for his ostentatious manner of living, and served personally in war when needed. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury claimed that he hated monks. Henry of Huntingdon, however, remembered him as handsome, cheerful and affable. Earlier in his episcopate, Bloet had aided Christina of Markyate's family in their attempts to get the religious hermit to marry, at one point giving a judicial judgement that she must marry, which she refused to do. It was only after Bloet's death that Christina was able to be consecrated as a recluse at St Albans Abbey.|$|E

Regardless of its official membership, the Temple also regularly drew 3,000 people to its San Francisco services alone, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> technically registered members.

Except for a brief reference to marriage, the surviving work of Isabella includes no love poem addressed to a man, while Diego's lyrics described his feelings towards his beloved, possibly referring to a specific woman, or simply conventional laments, following the poetic style of the era. However, Isabella's brothers, after being informed of the letters, suspected an extra-marital affair and, in order to redeem the family honour, prepared a cruel plan of punishment.|$|E
25|$|With this {{motivation}} came a short book of only thirty-three poems published {{soon after}} her death by her father. It was not abnormal for poets, especially for women, never to see their work published in their lifetime. Since Killigrew died at the young age of 25 she was only able to produce a small collection of poetry. In fact, the last three poems were only found among her papers {{and it is still}} being debated about whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> actually written by her. Inside the book is also a self painted portrait of Anne and the Ode by family friend and poet John Dryden.|$|E
25|$|During his {{original}} trial, Reynolds had challenged two jurors, {{both of whom}} stated that they had formed an opinion on the guilt or innocence of Reynolds before the trial. The court held that universal education and press reports {{made it hard to}} find jurors who had not formed some opinion. It found that Reynolds had failed to meet the requirement that he, as challenger of a juror's objectivity, demonstrate that a juror had developed a real and strong opinion. The prosecution had discharged two potential jurors who refused to say whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> living in polygamy. The Court held that it would not overturn a case based on the legality of challenges to dismissed jurors.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1920s, Morse met pianist Bob Downey. He {{became her}} accompanist {{on stage and}} {{companion}} in life, and the two booked international shows together, including {{a tour of the}} United Kingdom, concluding with a show at the Piccadilly Theatre in London, England. They subsequently lived together as a couple, although whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> ever actually married remains questionable. She and Downey eventually opened a small club in Texas, which they operated until it burned down in 1939. Later they resettled in Rochester, New York. Downey eventually left Morse for a striptease dancer. This end to their relationship left Morse devastated and ever more dependent upon alcohol, which by the 1930s had become a constant companion.|$|E
25|$|The Seminoles, {{who spoke}} the same {{language}} as the Creeks, {{did not have any}} schools or churches; the board of foreign missions directed Loughridge to visit them and learn whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> willing to establish a mission and school. In the summer of 1846, he visited them with his interpreter, and learned that the most of their chiefs were willing to have schools and allow preaching in their nation. In April 1847, Hon. Walter Lowrie, secretary of the board of foreign missions, New York, visited the mission, and gave new life to the Christian cause of education by entering into an agreement with the chiefs to enlarge the Koweta Mission, and to establish the Tullahassee Mission, that would accommodate eighty students, forty boys and forty girls; the schools were funded by both the Presbyterian Church and the Creek school fund.|$|E
25|$|In {{an early}} {{preview of the}} game's demo Episode Duscae, GameSpot's Alexa Ray Corriae praised the {{interactions}} between Noctis and his companions, citing them as {{a good example of}} deep platonic love between men. In a review of Brotherhoods first episode, Meghan Sullivan from IGN also praised the interactions between the main characters, particularly finding comical how Noctis removed parts from his hamburger and this being discussed by his friends as whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> spoiling him. Similarly, Destructoid's Chris Carter became attached to Noctis and his friends ever since the Brotherhood series and expects more from the video game. A fragrance was created in the character's image. There has been an internet meme focused on Noctis and his friends in the Regalia looking at photoshopped images. Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto found it comical and motivated fans to produce more in order to increase people's interest in Final Fantasy XV.|$|E

25|$|The United States and Germany {{signed an}} {{agreement}} on September 19, 1995, providing for reparations for certain U.S.-citizen survivors of the Holocaust, with compensation to be paid in two stages. The first stage provided for compensation for Hugo Princz and {{a small group of}} other known concentration camp survivors, through a lump-sum payment to the United States of 3 million Deutsche Mark (about $2.1 million). The second stage was to provide for compensation for additional, similarly-situated claimants. Legislation passed in early 1996 authorized the Commission to receive and adjudicate cases of additional claimants, a process which it completed in March 1998. Following further negotiations, the German Government paid to the United States in June 1999 an additional lump sum of 34.5 million Deutsche Mark (about $18 million) in final settlement of any and all claims of United States citizens against Germany for Nazi persecution in concentration camps, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> adjudicated by the Commission. In the ensuing months, the Department of the Treasury completed the process of distributing the settlement fund to the claimants previously found eligible for awards.|$|E
500|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Minnesota Territory in 1848 and the treaty of 1851 waves of immigrants from the U.S. and Europe came to the territory rapidly changing the demographics. Even as these changes occurred in many areas the vagueness of the racial divisions between [...] "Indians" [...] and [...] "whites" [...] persisted. As late as 1857 it was common practice in some jurisdictions for men to be allowed to vote based on whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> wearing European clothing. According to some observers natives at a given polling location would share a single pair of trousers each wearing them only long enough to cast a ballot.|$|E
500|$|The Chancery's {{jurisdiction}} over [...] "lunatics" [...] came from two sources: first, the King's prerogative {{to look after}} them, which was exercised regularly by the Lord Chancellor, and second, the Lands of Lunatics Act, which gave the King (and therefore the Chancellor) custodianship of lunatics and their land; the Lord Chancellor exercised the first right directly and the second {{in his role as}} head of the Court of Chancery. This jurisdiction applied to any [...] "idiots" [...] or [...] "lunatics", regardless of whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> British, or whether their land was within England and Wales. They were divided into two categories– idiots, [...] "who have no glimmering of reason from their birth and are, therefore, by law, presumed never likely to attain any", and lunatics, [...] "who have had understanding but have lost the use of it". Lunatics and idiots were administered separately by the Lord Chancellor under his two prerogatives; the appeal under the King's prerogative went directly to the King, and under the Lands of Lunatics Act 1324 to the House of Lords.|$|E

500|$|The quoted {{material}} by Dave Champion is false; it {{does not}} appear in the Court's decision. In Evans v. Gore, the U.S. Supreme Court actually did rule that a federal income tax on certain income of federal judges was unconstitutional. The Evans v. Gore ruling has been interpreted as barring application of the Federal income tax to a Federal judge who had been appointed prior to the enactment of the tax. This was the Court's year 1920 interpretation of the [...] "Compensation Clause", the rule that Federal judges [...] "shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office" [...] under Article III, section 1 of the U.S. Constitution. The decision in Evans v. Gore was eviscerated in the 1939 U.S. Supreme Court decision of O'Malley v. Woodrough, and was expressly overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court itself in 2001, in the case of United States v. Hatter. In Hatter, the Supreme Court stated: [...] "We now overrule Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> appointed before enactment of the tax." ...|$|E
500|$|David Gautreaux {{was cast}} as Xon on September 26, after {{approaching}} the casting director himself, having no agent. He {{had heard about}} the part, as he was dating the employee of an agent at the time. The final audition for the role had eight actors, including Gautreaux, of various ages and sizes. Gautreaux later said that the one thing they all had in common was a slightly alien appearance. He was hired to a $15,000 fee for the pilot, a guaranteed payment for the 13 episodes whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> filmed, and a six-year option on his contract. Despite this, he was required to return for a further audition within a couple of weeks. Majel Barrett was due to return as Christine Chapel, this time as a doctor, and the actress was concerned that the romantic chemistry she shared with Nimoy might not work with a younger actor. She instead wanted an older British actor to play the role. Gautreaux, now with an agent, secured a further $2,500 fee to return and audition again, since it would cause him to miss out on a guest appearance for the same fee on the television series Fantasy Island. He retained the part, saying that the other actor was [...] "absolutely abominable". It was only after this further audition that he was told what few others knew at the time: that Phase II had already been cancelled, and they were instead going to make a feature film.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, a CIAR-funded {{study on}} secondhand smoke {{exposure}} by Peter Lee was published. The tobacco industry {{hoped that the}} study would undermine the validity of a 1981 study by Takeshi Hirayama, which reported a positive association between secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk. The final paper concluded that studies like Hirayama's were subject to misclassification bias, and therefore, had [...] "little scientific basis". In 1995, the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology published two studies funded by the CIAR examining the association between ETS and heart disease. Both studies concluded that ETS exposure from spouses did not {{increase the risk of}} heart disease, and that previous conclusions to the contrary were due to publication bias. Both of these studies have been criticized for suffering from exposure misclassification, because both studies failed to distinguish between current and former smokers. In 2003, a study funded by the center was published in the BMJ. Authored by James Enstrom and Geoffrey Kabat, the study found little association between secondhand smoke and coronary heart disease or lung cancer. This study has been criticized for failing to distinguish between those who were exposed to second-hand smoke and those who were not, because, according to the American Cancer Society, the study's participants were enrolled in 1959, [...] "when exposure to secondhand smoke was so pervasive that virtually everyone was exposed to ETS, whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> married to a smoker." ...|$|E
