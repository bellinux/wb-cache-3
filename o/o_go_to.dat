40|$|Several {{contemporary}} {{problems have}} pointed to the desirability of a detailed level kinetics approach to modeling the distribution of vibrational energy in NO. Such a model is necessary when vibrational redistribution reactions are insufficient to maintain a Boltzmann distribution over the vibrational energy states. Recent calculations of the rate constant for the first reaction of the Zeldovich mechanism (N 2 + <b>O</b> (<b>goes</b> <b>to)</b> NO + N) {{have suggested that the}} product NO is formed in high vibrational states. In shock layer flowfields, the product NO molecules may experience an insufficient number of collisions to establish a Boltzmann distribution over vibrational states, thus necessitating a level kinetics model. In other flows, such as expansions of high temperature air, fast, near-resonance vibrational energy exchanges with N 2 and O 2 may also require a level specific model for NO because of the relative rates of vibrational exchange and redistribution. The proposed report will integrate computational and experimental components to construct such a model for the NO molecule...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} twofold. In a first part, we extend the {{classical}} differential calculus to continuous non differentiable functions by developping {{the notion of}} scale calculus. The scale calculus {{is based on a}} new approach of continuous non differentiable functions by constructing a one parameter family of differentiable functions f(t, ǫ) such that f(t, ǫ) → f(t) when <b>ǫ</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> zero. This lead to several new notions as representation, fractal functions and ǫ-differentiability. The basic objets of the scale calculus are left and right quantum operators and the scale operator which generalize the classical derivative. We then discuss some algebraic properties of these operators. We define a natural bialgebra, called quantum bialgebra, associated to them. Finally, we discuss a convenient geometric object associated to our study. In a second part, we define a first quantization procedure of classical mechanics following the scale relativity theory developped by Nottale. We obtain a non linear Schrödinger equation via the classical Newton’s equation of dynamics using the scale operator. Under special assumptions we recover the classical Schrödinger equation and we discuss the relevance of thes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a square matrix Aǫ whose entries have asymptotics {{of the form}} (Aǫ) ij = aijǫ A ij + o(ǫ A ij) when <b>ǫ</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> 0, for some complex coefficients aij and real exponents Aij. We look for asymptotics of the same type for the eigenvalues of Aǫ. We show that the sequence of exponents of the eigenvalues of Aǫ is weakly (super) majorized by the sequence of corners of the min-plus characteristic polynomial of the matrix A = (Aij), and that the equality holds for generic values of the coefficients aij. We derive this result from {{a variant of the}} Newton-Puiseux theorem which applies to asymptotics of the preceding type. We also introduce a sequence of generalized minimal circuit means of A, and show that this sequence weakly majorizes the sequence of corners of the min-plus characteristic polynomial of A. We characterize the equality case in terms of perfect matching. When the equality holds, we show that the coefficients of all the eigenvalues of Aǫ can be computed generically by Schur complement formulæ, which extend the perturbation formulæ of Viˇsik, Ljusternik and Lidskiĭ, and have fewer singular cases. 1...|$|R

40|$|Glucose oxidase (GO) and {{pyranose}} oxidase (P 2 O) improve dough {{stability and}} bread quality. We here studied whether their {{mode of action}} resides in crosslinking of proteins and/or arabinoxylan (AX) molecules through the production of H 2 O 2. Evidence for both was deduced from a decrease in extractability of protein and AX from dough made with P 2 <b>O,</b> <b>GO</b> or H 2 O 2, using sodium dodecyl sulfate containing buffer and water, respectively. Addition of H 2 O 2, P 2 <b>O</b> or <b>GO</b> <b>to</b> a glutathione solution sharply decreased its sulfhydryl (SH) content. P 2 <b>O</b> or <b>GO</b> can trigger protein crosslinking through formation of disulfide (SS) bonds. As a result thereof, SH/SS interchange reactions between low molecular mass SH containing compounds and gluten proteins can be hampered. Furthermore, {{a decrease in the}} level of monomeric ferulic acid (FA) esterified to AX in dough points to a role of FA bridges in crosslinking of AX molecules. Our results indicate that the molecular mechanism of dough and bread improvement by P 2 <b>O</b> and <b>GO</b> resides in crosslinking of gluten proteins and AX by formation of H 2 O 2. They furthermore show that the extent of crosslinking upon addition of P 2 <b>O</b> or <b>GO</b> strongly depends on the concentration (and production rate) of H 2 O 2. status: publishe...|$|R
