To study <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> a 77 GHz meteorological radar, since the raindrop size are comparable to the wavelength, it is necessary to use the general Mie scattering theory.

Different operative frequencies commonly used in radar meteorology are considered with both the Rayleigh and Mie scattering theory formulation. Comparing them it is shown that with <b>the</b> increasing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radar <b>working</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> Rayleigh approximation lead to an always larger underestimation of rain.

A particular {{attention is paid to}} <b>the</b> theoretical basis <b>of</b> helicopter vibrations, definition of <b>working</b> <b>frequency,</b> regime and profile <b>of</b> flight during <b>the</b> test. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibration measurement are shown in the frequency domain. Introduction Nowadays, possibility of defining loads and vibrations is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important requests in the design and modification of processes on helicopters. The loads occuring on the main rotor during flight are <b>the</b> basic source <b>of</b> vibrations on <b>the</b> helicopter. Possibilities to satisfy international standards in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> structural and human vibrations are based on continuous and adequate measurement and analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibration levels on all elements of helicopters. This paper shows <b>the</b> procedures <b>of</b> vibration measuring and analyzing in order to define efficiency of vibration damping using a modern acquisition system NetdB 12 and its software dBFA Suite. Theoretical analysis of vibration sources on the helicopter main rotor The helicopter rotor operates in a complex aerodynamic flow field. The aerodynamic loads on the rotor blade vary considerably as it moves around the rotor disc, and in steady flight these loads are periodic. A particular attention is paid to a theoretical basis of vibration sources on a helicopter. A complex aerodynamic field in <b>the</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helicopter main rotor during different profiles of flight is shown and explained. This part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper gives <b>the</b> equations <b>of</b> force and moments on the main rotor with the aim to define basic <b>working</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Sources <b>of</b> vibrations and <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>frequencies</b> on <b>the</b> gazelle helicopter <b>The</b> sources <b>of</b> vibrations on <b>the</b> Gazelle helicopter (main rotor, tail rotor and engine) are described as well as the vibration transfer from the sources to the structure through the helicopter transmission and the structure as a receiver <b>of</b> vibrations. <b>The</b> <b>working</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gazelle helicopter are defined and the causes for avoiding the low vibration frequency range are explained. Methodology and procedure of vibration testing on the gazelle helicopter <b>The</b> procedure <b>of</b> vibration testing has a few steps (pre-test, test and post test step), given in Fig. 5. After <b>the</b> determination <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>frequencies</b> and <b>the</b> testing point, the next step is selecting test equipment and installment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> accelerometers and other probes. After these preparations, the last step in the pre-test procedure is choosing the flight profiles in which the vibrations are measured. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> testing and analysis of vibration damping at the structure - pilot seat connecting point The testing results are collected in the test phase. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibration measurement are shown in the time and frequency domain for the chosen flight conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gazelle helicopter. The results are given for two profiles of flight (for acceleration and for the left and right turn). The analysis must give an answer about <b>the</b> efficiency <b>of</b> vibration damping at the structure - pilot seat connecting point. The conclusions must not be ambiguous and must give enough elements for making a decision about subsequent actions. Vibration levels <b>of</b> in <b>the</b> acceleration phase For this phase of flight, all helicopter flight parameters are recorded and given as a function of time (velocity, altitude, drift of commands, loads und angular velocity) while the vibrations are given in the frequency domain. The vibrations at the tested connecting point are analyzed in <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> velocity, followed by the conclusions and comments about <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> vibrations in <b>the</b> phase <b>of</b> acceleration. Level <b>of</b> vibrations during <b>the</b> left and the right turn For this profile <b>of</b> flight, <b>the</b> frequency spectrum for both turns is given and the fundamental difference in that spectrum is explained. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> these two turns reveals <b>the</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vibration level at the test point at a particular frequency. Conclusion The illustrated methodology and <b>the</b> procedures <b>of</b> measuring and analyzing the low-frequency vibration range on the Gazelle helicopter can be applied for all types of aircraft which are in operational use in the Serbian Air Forces. The shown procedure can be used for measuring and analyzing vibrations on all elements of helicopter systems, aiming at meeting international standards, continuous system developing, modifying technical systems and detecting potential failure elements in the systems in operational service...|$|R
