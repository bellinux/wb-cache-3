At Number 2123 is Mitchells Café and Take Away, which claims to be the oldest café in Leith; while this claim is unverified, the premises has certainly been operating in café format since at least 1924, when it opened its doors as an Italian ice cream parlour. Many long-time Leithers still refer to Mitchells as Lannys; so ingrained is the <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> cream cafe in their memories.|$|E
500|$|In 2016, cores were {{retrieved}} from the Allan Hills in Antarctica {{in an area}} where <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> lay near the surface. [...] The cores were dated by potassium-argon dating; traditional ice core dating is not possible as not all layers were present. [...] The oldest core was found to include ice from 2.7 million years ago—by far the oldest ice yet dated from a core.|$|E
50|$|Sea ice freezes and melts {{due to a}} {{combination}} of factors, including the age of the ice, air temperatures, and solar insolation. During the winter the area of the Arctic Ocean covered by sea ice increases, usually reaching a maximum extent during the month of March. The area covered in sea ice then decreases, reaching its minimum extent in September most years. First-year ice melts more easily than <b>older</b> <b>ice</b> for two reasons: 1) First-year ice is thinner than <b>older</b> <b>ice,</b> since the process of congelation growth has had less time to operate; and 2) first-year ice is less permeable than <b>older</b> <b>ice,</b> so summer meltwater tends to form deeper ponds on the first-year ice surface than on <b>older</b> <b>ice,</b> and deeper ponds mean lower albedo and thus greater solar energy capture.|$|R

500|$|However, {{microbiologist}} David Pearce of the University of Northumbria in Newcastle, UK, {{stated that}} the DNA could simply be contamination from the drilling process, and not representative of Lake Vostok itself. The <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> cores were drilled in the 1990s to look for evidence of past climates buried in the ice, rather than for life, so the drilling equipment was not sterilized. [...] Also Sergey Bulat, a Lake Vostok expert at the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute in Gatchina, Russia, doubts {{that any of the}} cells or DNA fragments in the samples would belong to organisms that might actually exist in the lake. He says that it is very probable that the samples are heavily contaminated with tissue and microbes from the outside world.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2015, Arctia Shipping {{announced}} that Otso has been chartered to an unnamed client to support seismic surveys in the Arctic {{for two years}} with an option of two additional years. The vessel will be upgraded for service in the northern latitudes by increasing her ice strengthening, now adequate for icebreaking in the Baltic Sea, to Polar Class 4 (PC-4) which is intended for vessels operating year-round in thick first-year ice which may include <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> inclusions. Furthermore, a [...] anti-rolling tank will be installed to improve her open water characteristics. Other additions include lifeboats to allow unrestricted worldwide service {{as well as a}} new helideck. The modifications, scheduled to be completed by July 2015, will be carried out by Rauma Marine Constructions. After the summer season in the Arctic, Otso will return to the Baltic Sea icebreaking duty by November as mandated by the icebreaking contract between Arctia Shipping and the Finnish Transport Agency.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} {{restoration}} work done on Locust Grove in the late 1980s, students from Longwood College visited the home and grounds and conducted an archaeological dig which covered various portions of the property. [...] Excavations were conducted at five points around the site, {{and a number of}} discoveries were made. [...] Chief among these was the grave of an infant discovered {{in the corner of the}} former kitchen garden near the house. [...] Oral tradition states that Francisco had a daughter who died in infancy sometime in the 1820s, and who was buried in the garden. [...] There are no formal records either of such a burial or of the birth of the child; however, the discovery of the grave lends greater credence to the story. [...] Also found on the grounds of the house were the remains of the foundation of a tobacco barn, known to have burned in 1826, as well as some bits of ash and a large collection of nails and nail fragments. [...] Excavations on and around the property also turned up the foundation and cellar of an <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> house, later used as a trash midden; the foundation of another small building, whose purpose remains uncertain; and a small spring associated through oral tradition with Peter Francisco. [...] Numerous beams and door and window frames original to the house were found and replaced during {{the restoration}} and excavation; the originals were set aside in the basement for further study.|$|E

It changes place. It is here to-day; it is there to-morrow. Next day it is gone. We cannot tell where it goes to or when it will come back. The very <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> comes back again and again.

60|$|Beyond {{the field}} was a ravine full of firs, through which Malley's Creek ran. To cross it meant a four-mile cut to Ramble Valley. The ice looked black and rotten.

If a crossing could be made at all it was only between Malley's spring-hole and the <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> road. Lady Jane swerved at the bank and whickered.|$|E
60|$|Towards sunset they {{rounded a}} high cape, beyond {{which was a}} deep and wide bay. On this the sun shone {{apparently}} on {{what appeared to be}} open water. For one moment a look of alarm flitted over the wizard's face, as he glanced quickly shoreward to see whether the ground-ice was passable; but it was only for a moment, for immediately he perceived that the light had dazzled and deceived him. It was not water, but new ice--smooth and refulgent as a mirror. The fringe of <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> on shore was disrupted and impassable. There was therefore only one course open to him.|$|E
60|$|The thaw {{which had}} {{by that time}} set {{steadily}} in had not broken up the <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> to the southward, so that no more thin ice or open water was met with. But although he had thus begun to take things more easily, Ujarak did {{not by any means}} waste time. The wretched man was very morose, even savage, insomuch that he would scarcely reply to the questions which were timidly put to him at times by the women. It was evident that he repented of his hasty flight, and no doubt was rendered desperate by the reflection that the matter was by that time past remedy.|$|E

60|$|Although {{strong enough}} to bear, the ice {{undulated}} terribly as they swept over it, and sent forth rending sounds, which cannot be conceived by those whose experience of young ice has been derived chiefly from lakelets and ponds. Dogs in such circumstances are apt to become terrified and to stop, in which case immersion is almost certain. But Ujarak gave his team no time to think. With lash and voice he urged them on until they were nearly frantic. The undulations became greater as they advanced, and the rending sounds continuous. Still the wizard plied his whip and shouted. Indeed it was his only chance. At {{the other side of}} the bay the <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> still adhered to the shore. If that could be reached, they would be safe. Eagerly the women strained their eyes, and even stretched out their hands as if to grasp the shore, for the fear of instant death had banished all other thoughts. A few minutes more, and Ujarak, standing up in his eagerness, flourishing the great whip, and shouting at the pitch of his voice, drove the yelling dogs off the crackling sheet of ice to a place of safety on the solid floe.|$|E
60|$|Hannibal sent {{forward to}} {{ascertain}} {{the cause of the}} difficulty, and found that the van of the army had reached a precipice down which it was impossible to descend. It was necessary to make a circuit in hopes of finding some practicable way of getting down. The guides and pioneers went on, leading the army after them, and soon got upon a glacier which lay in their way. There was fresh snow upon the surface, covering the ice and concealing the crevasses, as they are termed--that is, the great cracks and fissures which extend in the glaciers down through the body of the ice. The army moved on, trampling down the new snow, and making at first a good roadway by their footsteps; but very soon the <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> and snow began to be trampled up by the hoofs of the horses and the heavy tread of such vast multitudes of armed men. It softened to a great depth, and made the work of toiling through it an enormous labor. Besides, the surface of the ice and snow sloped steeply, and the men and beasts were continually falling or sliding down, and getting swallowed up in avalanches which their own weight set in motion, or in concealed crevasses where they sank to rise no more.|$|E
60|$|For a {{fortnight}} Mackenzie {{and his party}} remained at the lake, skirting its shores as best they could, and searching among the bays and islands of its western end for the outlet towards the north which they knew must exist. Heavy rain, alternating with bitter cold, caused them much hardship. At times it froze so {78} hard that a thin sheet of new ice covered even the open water of the lake. But as the month advanced the mass of <b>old</b> <b>ice</b> began slowly to break; strong winds drove it towards the north, and the canoes were presently able to pass, with great danger and difficulty, among the broken floes. Mackenzie met a band of Yellow Knife Indians, who assured him that a great river {{ran out of the}} west end of the lake, and offered a guide to aid him in finding the channel among the islands and sandbars of the lake. Convinced that his search would be successful, Mackenzie took all the remaining supplies into his canoes and sent back Leroux to Chipewyan with the news that he had gone north down the great river. But even after obtaining his guide Mackenzie spent four days searching for the outlet It was not till {{the end of the month}} of June that his search was rewarded, and, at the extreme south-west, the lake, after stretching out among islands and shallows, was found to contract into the channel of a river.|$|E
