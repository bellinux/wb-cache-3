40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the dynamical modelling and parameter identification of a biological wastewater treatment process from the galvanisation industry used to remove a mixture of <b>organic</b> matter and <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents.</b> In the present study we have considered mainly the measurements of dissolved oxygen and COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) collected on laboratory and pilot-scale processes. From the identification study, we can conclude that the degradation is characterized by two reactions: {{one part of the}} easily biodegradable effluent is degraded with fast kinetics while the remaining part of the effluent is degraded via a slower reaction. This has been modelled by considering two different classes of substrates that indeed correspond to real components of the mixture...|$|R

40|$|<b>Surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> are {{amphiphilic}} {{chemicals that}} are used in almost every sector of modern industry, the bulk of which are produced by organo-chemical synthesis. Those produced from biological sources (biosurfactants and bioemulsifiers), however, have gained increasing interest in recent years due to their wide structural and functional diversity, lower toxicities and high biodegradability, compared to their chemically-synthesised counterparts. This review aims to present a general overview on <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents,</b> including their classification, where new types of these biomolecules may lay awaiting discovery, and some of the main bottlenecks for their industrial-scale production. In particular, the marine environment is highlighted as a largely untapped source for discovering new types of <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents.</b> Marine bacteria, especially those living associated with micro-algae (eukaryotic phytoplankton), are a highly promising source of polymeric <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> with potential biotechnological applications. The high uronic acids content of these macromolecules has been linked to conferring them with amphiphilic qualities, and their high structural diversity and polyanionic nature endows them with the potential to exhibit a wide range of functional diversity. Production yields (e. g. by fermentation) for most microbial <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> have often been too low to meet the volume demands of industry, and this principally remains as the most important bottleneck for their further commercial development. However, new developments in recombinant and synthetic biology approaches can offer significant promise to alleviate this bottleneck. This review highlights a particular biotope in the marine environment that offers promise for discovering novel surface-active biomolecules, and gives a general overview on specific areas that researchers and the industry could focus work towards increasing the production yields of microbial <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R

30|$|<b>Surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> are {{generally}} used {{to decrease the}} surface tensions of polymer solutions, which significantly affect the generation of bubbles. As a result, the formation and stabilization of bubbles are greatly dependent on the composition and physicochemical properties of the <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> used [29]. Previously, we found that even {{just a bit of}} sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS), a <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent,</b> could significantly reduce the surface tension, facilitate the spinning process, and improve mechanical properties of electrospun polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofibers [30]. Therefore, SDBS was added in the electrospun solution to generate bubbles on a liquid surface in this study. The effect of bubbles on the morphology and production of nanofibers was investigated experimentally and theoretically. The theoretical analysis results of electric field were in good agreement with the experimental data and showed that the bubbles would decrease the quality and production of nanofibers.|$|R

40|$|The {{described}} agglomeration of drug microparticles {{blended with}} excipient microparticles {{is a technique}} for the size enlargement of micronized products that could be damaged by granulation or compaction techniques. These agglomerates {{can be used as}} oral prompt or delayed-release dosage forms administered as they are or dispersed in a liquid. The composition and quantity of the excipient microparticles resulted to be the crucial factors for the agglomerate quality. Therefore, adjusting the content of <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> between 8 - 20 % of the excipient microparticles, it is possible to agglomerate microparticles of drugs that could not be agglomerated per se. Increasing the surfactant concentration in the spray-dried excipient microparticles or increasing the fraction of these excipient microparticles in the blend, the agglomeration was improved. The spray drying technique concentrates the <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> on the microparticle surface. By tumbling, the <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> present on microparticles excipient surface was spread to fill the inter-particle interstices of drug particles giving rise to more resistant agglomerates.

40|$|Sodium {{hypochlorite}} (NaOCl) {{is recommended}} as an endodontic irrigant {{in view of}} its broad antimicrobial and tissue dissolution capacities. To enhance its penetration into inaccessible areas of root canals and to improve its overall effect, the addition of <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> has been suggested. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to review the effect of the reduction of the surface tension on the performance of NaOCl in endodontics. A search was performed in the Medline electronic database (articles published up to 28 July 2012, in English) with the search terms and combinations as follows: ‘sodium hypochlorite AND surface tension or interfacial force or interfacial tension or <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> or amphiphilic agent or surface active agent or surfactant or tenside or detergent'. The purpose of this search was to identify publications that compared NaOCl alone and NaOCl modified {{with the addition of a}} <b>surface-active</b> <b>agent</b> in endodontics. A hand search of articles published online (‘in-press’ and ‘early view’), and appearing in the reference list of the articles included, was further performed, using the same search criteria as the electronic search. The search identified 302 publications, of which 11 fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the review. The evidence available suggests that <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> improve the penetration of NaOCl in the main canal and have no effect on its pulp tissue dissolution ability.

40|$|Summary. The {{spermicidal}} activities against human spermatozoa of a {{range of}} non-ionic, anionic and cationic <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> have been determined with the method of Baker, Ransom & Tynen (1937). Although it has been concluded that surface-tension-lowering properties do not directly influence spermicidal power, the surface-tension/concentration curves of a number of the compounds were studied. Solubilities in water, hexane, and ethyl oleate were also determined in an attempt to find out whether there was any relationship between spermicidal action and solubilities in these solvents. The results obtained on the compounds studied showed broadly that appreciable oil solubility and good surface-tension-lowering properties were desirable for spermicidal activity in non-ionic and anionic <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents.</b> The cationic compounds studied were active in spite of low fat solubility. The lack of precision of the spermicidal results made definite activity/ solubility or activity/surface-tension relationships difficult to formulate...|$|R

40|$|Most {{hydrodynamic}} correlations {{and models}} used for gas-liquid-solid fluidized beds implicitly {{assume that the}} major physical properties of the liquid (density, viscosity and surface tension) are sufficient to characterize bubble dynamics. While {{this is true for}} pure liquids, multi-component liquids require additional properties due to <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> preferentially accumulating at the gas-liquid interface. Experiments were first conducted to evaluate the effects of <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> (alcohols as well as commercial anionic, cationic and non-ionic surfactants) on the phase holdups and minimum liquid fluidization velocities in a fluidize bed composed of air, water and glass beads of 1. 2 and 5 mm in diameter. The gas-liquid interfacial behaviour of the liquid solutions was then characterized by measuring the foamability as well the dynamic surface tension and dilatational surface elasticity using the maximum pressure bubble method. The presence of <b>surface-active</b> <b>agents</b> decreases the minimum liquid fluidization velocity and the effect is more important for the larger particles. The effect of surfactants on the bed phase holdups, and in particular the gas holdup, is significant and more pronounced in the coalesced bubble flow regime where foaming occurred. Further, the bed gas holdups are lower than those observed in the freeboard. The widely used gas holdup correlations proposed by Han et al. (1990) and Larachi et al. (2001) failed. Furthermore, the approach of Gorowara and Fan (1990) which uses the dynamic surface tension also failed as all surfactant solutions present similar phase holdups despite very different surface tension behaviour.
