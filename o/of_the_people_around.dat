25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder (NPD) is a {{personality disorder}} {{in which there}} is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive need for admiration, and a lack of understanding of others' feelings. People affected by it often spend a lot of time thinking about achieving power or success, or about their appearance. They often take advantage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> them. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of situations.|$|E
25|$|Rebellion and {{rejection}} are also expressed themes in this story. Bartleby refuses {{to conform to}} the normal ways <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> him and instead, simply just doesn't complete his tasks requested by his boss. He does not make any request for changes in the workplace, but just continues to be passive to the work happening around him. Just as public rejects changes from a normal routine, this rebellious style by Bartleby causes his co-workers to reject him as he is not behaving the same {{as the rest of the}} work place environment. The narrator tries multiple tactics to get Bartleby {{to conform to the}} standards of the workplace, and ultimately realizes that Bartleby's mental state is not that of normal society. Although the narrator sees Bartleby as a harmless person, the narrator refuses to engage in the same peculiar rhythm that Bartleby is stuck in.|$|E
25|$|Bonhomme Richard {{was about}} the same length as Alliance, and {{originally}} had almost the same armament, with a broadside of just over 200 pounds (91kg) from 18 guns, but Jones had been able to add six second-hand 18-pound guns, mounted {{in such a way that}} they could be rotated to fire through ports low down on either side, adding 108 pounds (49kg) of shot to a full broadside. In the event, though, these big guns only fired eight shots between them, because two of them quickly burst open under the strain, killing most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> them, so the remainder were abandoned. Serapis, one of the Royal Navy’s newest ships, also had 18-pound guns (10 on each side, contributing 180 pounds (82kg) to a total 22-gun broadside of around 280 pounds (130kg)) which were in good condition. Additionally, being designed as a warship, Serapis was more manoeuvrable than the Bonhomme Richard. By coincidence, due to desertions and the need to crew captured vessels, Bonhomme Richard’s crew had been reduced from around 400 to about the same as Serapis, 320.|$|E

500|$|Dr. Meredith Grey is the {{daughter}} of world-renowned surgeon Ellis Grey, and grew up in her shadow. Ellis was a deeply flawed, emotionally and verbally abusive, neglectful mother towards her. Meredith is described as a [...] "dark and twisty," [...] damaged person who sees the world in varying shades of gray morality. Because of this, she is an emotionally complex person capable of empathizing with others when they're at their lowest points, and a sensitive observer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> her. Meredith is a graduate of Dartmouth College and nearly did not attend med school due to conflicts with her mother. Meredith was directionless after obtaining her undergrad and had plans to sleep and party her way through Europe. After a month abroad, Meredith was called back to care for Ellis, who had developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease, and Meredith obtained her M.D.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Hutcherson voiced the {{character}} Nod in the animated action-adventure 3D film Epic, {{loosely based on}} William Joyce's book, The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs; the film is his most commercially successful except for The Hunger Games series. As filming approached for The Hunger Games sequel, , he enlisted celebrity trainer Bobby Strom to assist him in five hour-long workouts per week. The film brought in $420 million at the North American box office, making it his most commercially successful film. Todd Gilchrist of Indiewire proclaimed of the actor's performance that [...] "Hutcherson's maturing talents achieve a parallelism with {{the character}}'s self-actualization, proving subtler and more self-aware with every resigned decision he makes on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> him that he loves." [...] Hutcherson received his second MTV Movie Award for [...] "Best Male Performance" [...] {{for his role in}} the sequel.|$|E

One Narodnaya Rasprava member, I. I. Ivanov, disagreed with Nechayev about the distribution of propaganda, and left the group.

2500|$|Green roofs serve several {{purposes}} for a building, such as absorbing rainwater, providing insulation, creating a habitat for wildlife, increasing benevolence and decreasing stress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> the roof {{by providing a}} more aesthetically pleasing landscape, and helping to lower urban air temperatures and mitigate the heat island effect.

2500|$|Rome {{sent the}} praetor Caius Vetilius {{to fight the}} rebellion. He {{attacked}} a group of Lusitanian warriors who were out foraging, and after killing several of them, the survivors took refuge {{in a place that}} was surrounded by the Roman army. They were about to make a new agreement with the Romans when [...] Viriatus, mistrusting the Romans, proposed an escape plan. The Lusitanians inflamed by his speech made him their new commander. His first act was to rescue the currently trapped resisting Lusitanians whom he took over command of. First by lining up for battle with the Romans, then scattering the army as they charged. As each way broke apart and fled in different directions to meet up at a later location, Viriatus with 1,000 chosen men held the army of 10,000 Romans in check by being in a position to attack. Once the rest of the army had fled, he and the thousand men escaped as well. [...] Having effectively saved all of the Lusitanians soldiers immediately fortified the loyalty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> Viriatus.|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain deeply disliked Cheltenham, {{and felt}} lonely {{and out of}} place there. The young Chamberlain was [...] "a {{compulsive}} dreamer", {{more interested in the}} arts than in the military, and he developed a fondness for nature and a near-mystical sense of self. Chamberlain's major interests in his studies at Cheltenham were the natural sciences, especially astronomy. Chamberlain later recalled: [...] "The starlight exerted an indescribable influence on me. The stars seemed closer to me, more gentle, more worthy of trust, and more sympathetic – for that is the only word which describes my feelings – than any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>around</b> me in school. For the stars, I experienced true friendship". During his youth, Chamberlain – while not entirely rejecting at this point his liberalism – became influenced by the romantic conservative critique of the Industrial Revolution. Bemoaning the loss of [...] "Merry Old England", this view argued for a return to a highly romanticized view of a mythic, bucolic period of English history that had never existed, with the people living happily in harmony with nature on the land overseen by a benevolent, cultured elite. In this critique, the Industrial Revolution was seen as a disaster which forced people to live in dirty, overcrowded cities, doing dehumanizing work in factories while society was dominated by a philistine, greedy middle class.|$|E
