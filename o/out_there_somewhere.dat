"Dear Future Husband" [...] was {{inspired}} by Trainor's love for harmonies and a joke she made with her father, where she would say [...] "that her future husband is <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere,</b> 'chilling. Trainor reminisced on her past romantic relationships, where she was mishandled, and with the track, {{she wanted to make}} a statement that women should be treated better by their boyfriends. In an interview with Seventeen, Trainor said, [...] "It's like, I'm awesome, why would you not want to marry me and date me?"

Both times as he crossed home plate, he looked up and pointed to the sky. [...] "That was for him", Youkilis said. [...] "There are some crazy things that have happened in my life.

500|$|Patton's [...] "big break" [...] came in 2002, when he {{was cast}} to replace Steve Burns as Joe, the second host of the Nickelodeon children's {{television}} program Blue's Clues. [...] He was up for a part in [...] at the time, but considered the role as Joe [...] "a happy accident". [...] Patton became a [...] "household name" [...] and has been called [...] "an unqualified star to the 5-and-under set and their parents". [...] He was subjected to [...] "the same kind of scrutiny" [...] as Burns, {{who was involved in}} Patton's selection and helped train him, to earn the role. [...] Patton was selected out of 1,500 auditions. [...] He had never seen the show before his audition, but like Burns was the favorite with preschool test audiences. [...] He said, [...] "I am convinced that I got that part because of a Christopher Walken impression I sometimes do. [...] There's a tape <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>somewhere,</b> with both Steve Burns and myself doing a Blue's Clues scene both as Christopher Walken, which we did at the screen test. I haven't seen the tape, but I know somewhere it still exists". [...] Beginning in September 2000, Burns trained Patton to take over the host spot and advised him not to [...] "think of [...] as children's TV", but rather as [...] "acting and telling the truth".|$|E

I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in <b>there</b> <b>somewhere...</b> but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|R
500|$|As the {{fighting}} {{continued into the}} Makthar Valley, Juskalian {{was assigned to the}} 26th Infantry Regiment's headquarters. When attempting {{to save the life of}} a fellow soldier following heavy fighting, he was captured by German troops at Kasserine Pass in Tunisia on January 28. Juskalian described his capture as follows: [...] "One of our intelligence officers had gone out to check on the situation, and word came back that he'd been wounded and was <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere.</b> So another officer and I went out in a Jeep and found him, but he was dead. Then we came under fire, so we couldn't drag him out of there." [...] After telling the driver to return to the command post, Juskalian investigated the conditions of the other U.S. soldiers. [...] "I thought they were all right because we hadn't heard anything from them, but they'd been overrun by the Germans." [...] Having lost his glasses, Juskalian could not distinguish the soldiers that were approaching him from 50feet (15m) away. The soldiers were Germans and took him prisoner. Juskalian said about his capture, [...] "I was irritated with myself for being so foolhardy, I shouldn't have been there." [...] Juskalian later learned, while still a prisoner of war (POW), that he had been awarded the Silver Star for his rescue attempt. After his first two days of being a POW, he was promoted to major.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere.</b> Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E
500|$|Title {{was entirely}} written and {{composed}} by Meghan Trainor and Kevin Kadish, and produced by Kadish. The pair recorded the EP at The Carriage House in Nolensville, Tennessee. It was mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York City, New York. Besides writing and composing the record, Trainor was {{also responsible for}} its drum programming, percussion instrumentation, clapping and ukulele melodies, as well as handling the EP's executive production with Kadish. Title was developed using {{a wide range of}} other instrumentation; drums, acoustic guitar, electric guitar and bass—all produced by Kadish. David Baron and Jim Hoke were the only two other musicians involved in the EP's production, and were responsible for the record's piano, baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone and hammond organ instrumentation. In an interview with The Baltimore Sun, Kadish spoke of the record's conception, [...] "We were like, 'Let's do a '50s EP and see if anybody likes it, just for fun.'" [...] Regarding the title of the EP, Trainor told Popjustice, [...] "So I've called the EP Title. Cos obviously everyone was going, 'what's the title', and I was like, 'hey, I'm clever, I'm gonna make it this'." [...] The name was deemed [...] "creative" [...] by Idolator's Mike Wass. Dear Future Husband" [...] was inspired by a joke Trainor made with her father, where she would say that her future husband [...] "is <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere,</b> chilling". Trainor described the EP as having a [...] "doo-wop feel" [...] reminiscent of [...] "All About That Bass," [...] but being different lyrically. Trainor noted that Title takes on themes that [...] "not {{a lot of people think}} about," [...] such as commitment and staying true to one's self. The EP was Epic Records' idea to prove that Trainor was not a one-hit wonder, following the success of her debut single, [...] "All About That Bass". In an interview with James Sullivan of The Boston Globe, the singer said that Title focuses on [...] "an awkward 19-, 20-year-old, when you're pretty sure you're an adult but you're not, yet." [...] She went on to add, [...] "All the songs sound very similar—very personal, girl power anthems." [...] Trainor felt the EP's album tracks showcased her better than what [...] "All About That Bass" [...] did.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005's Infinite Crisis miniseries, it was {{revealed}} that the Earth-Two Lois Lane Kent, along with Superboy, Alexander Luthor, Jr., and Superman, have been watching the events of the post-Crisis DC Universe from their pocket dimension. Out of the four observers, she {{is the only one who}} still believes that the new universe is just going through a rough patch; Superboy Prime and Alex Luthor are convinced that Earth is utterly corrupt, and Kal-L is slowly becoming swayed to their way of thinking. This version of Lois is frail, and died for reasons not explicitly revealed, though probably connected to her octogenarian status. This was the main reason for Kal-L's determination to restore Earth-Two, as he believed that Lois' health would recover once back on her proper Earth. Despite the restoration of Earth-Two, Lois Lane Kent died in the arms of her husband, Superman, in Infinite Crisis #5, regardless of Kal-L's protests that he could not let her die. After Kal-L died at the hands of Superboy-Prime at the end of Infinite Crisis #7, he commented that he finally understood Lois' final words [...] "It's... not... going..." [...] as meaning that it would never end for them, and one day it would be understood that even the heroes who had been lost in the original Crisis were still <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>somewhere.</b> After his demise, they are shown reunited in the stars, while their bodies are buried on Earth alongside Kon-El's, who gave his life to stop Superboy-Prime's attempts to restore his Earth.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{broadcast}} in the United States on NBC on Monday, September 21, 1998, in the 9:3010 p.m. (PST) timeslot. In its original American broadcast, the pilot tied with Working for forty-first place in {{ratings for the}} week of September 21–27, 1998. With a Nielsen rating of 8.6, equivalent to approximately 8.4 million viewing households, it was the fifteenth-highest-rated show on NBC the week it aired. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Joyce Millman of Salon Entertainment said the episode has [...] "glimmers of class" [...] and the jokes are [...] "relatively sophisticated". John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that Burrows's direction was [...] "sharp as usual" [...] and the writing was [...] "above average". Brian Lambert of the St. Paul Pioneer Press said the pilot was [...] "nicely staged by veteran director Jimmy Burrows, and coming from a couple producers, Max Mutchnick and David Cohan, who assisted Boston Common and Dream On, the show – {{which is to say}} the pilot episode (everything could go to hell next week) – has the best verbal interplay of any of the season's new sitcoms." [...] William Horn from the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) thought the episode was a [...] "wonderful" [...] representation of a gay man's life [...] "regardless of whether he's in a relationship in that very moment. I think it's important that American audiences realize that lesbians and gay men are not simply all about sexual situations." [...] Ellen Gray of the Chicago Tribune was also positive about the show: [...] "For those who believe that Hollywood's engaging in a conspiracy to 'normalize' a sexual orientation that many Americans still find abhorrent, Will & Grace will look like a candy-coated poison pill. To those who think that Hollywood isn't moving fast enough in offering sexual parity for gays, it may just look like poison. But... there's a large audience <b>out</b> <b>there</b> that's <b>somewhere</b> in the mushy middle, an audience that might be ready to embrace Will & Grace." ...|$|R
60|$|But she was not. Day {{followed}} day, {{each one}} seemingly more hopeless than the other. This consideration beat like a knell into her brain, love could {{never come to}} her.

She had always regarded Durade strangely, wondering that in spite of his kindness to her she could not really care for him. She understood now and hated him passionately. And if there was any one she feared it was Durade. Allie lost herself in the past, seeing the stream of mixed humanity that passed through Durade's gambling-halls. No doubt he was on his way, first to search for her mother, and secondly, to profit by the building of the railroad. But he would never find her mother. Allie was glad.|$|E

He kind o' pokes around the law school (it's in our building--that's where I saw him first, in the elevator), just as an excuse. He hates the law; he told me so. He comes in to see me sometimes. Of course I leave the door open." [...] She smiled. [...] "But it don't {{make any difference to}} him. He's just the same here as he is anywhere--I mean he knows how to treat a woman.
