5|$|The {{giant otter}} is large, gregarious, and diurnal. Early travellers' reports {{describe}} noisy groups surrounding explorers' boats, but little scientific information was {{available on the}} species until Duplaix's groundbreaking work in the late 1970s. Concern <b>over</b> <b>this</b> endangered species has since generated a body of research.|$|E

George is losing his sight to cytomegalovirus and {{is taking a}} drug that is manufactured by a company that, {{as a member of}} ACT UP, George is protesting. George struggles through the film to resolve his conflicted feelings <b>over</b> <b>this,</b> his guilt over abandoning Zero during the final days of his illness and his fear that the same thing will happen to him.|$|E
5|$|After {{missing the}} 1898 season for Auckland, Gallaher {{continued}} to be selected for the province throughout 1899 and 1900. The side was undefeated <b>over</b> <b>this</b> time; he played for them twice in 1899, and in all four matches in 1900. He represented Auckland province a total of 26 times over his career.|$|E

5|$|Another study {{focusing}} on the Gulf of Mexico, using a mix of data from US pelagic longline surveys from the mid-1950s and observations from the late-1990s, estimated a decline in numbers in this location of 99.3% <b>over</b> <b>this</b> period. However, changes in fishing practices and data collection methods complicate estimates.|$|E
5|$|At 1:55p.m., {{just before}} the start of the war, a {{reconnaissance}} force swam to the east bank of the Suez Canal, two kilometers south of Fort Lahtzanit, and laid two ropes across the canal to facilitate the crossing of friendly forces. At 2:05p.m., as Operation Badr began, an artillery barrage was initiated against the fort using just the 85mm guns and B-10 recoilless rifles of the brigade's anti-tank company; the use of high trajectory artillery guns was forbidden since a number of Egyptian aircraft were flying <b>over</b> <b>this</b> area.|$|E
5|$|During its {{six years}} as the Tour DuPont, the race was won by Dutch rider Erik Breukink, Greg LeMond, Raúl Alcalá, Russian Viatcheslav Ekimov, and twice by Lance Armstrong. <b>Over</b> <b>this</b> time, a prologue time trial held in Wilmington, Delaware, became the {{traditional}} start to the race. Between 1992 and 1994, the race included a stage from Port Deposit and Hagerstown in Maryland, but in 1995, South Carolina was included on the route {{for the first time}} in its place. Every edition of the Tour DuPont visited Richmond, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Australia was set {{a target}} of 348 {{to win in the}} fourth innings of the match from {{approximately}} 107 <b>overs.</b> <b>This</b> was the same target required by India in the Tied Test at the same ground in 1986.|$|R

5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{the only}} fully trained crews were pilots, other crew members being volunteers from skilled ground trades who {{underwent}} short courses in gunnery and bomb aiming. Pilots {{were responsible for}} navigation, and when accurate navigation was essential, a second pilot was carried. Early in 1936 the Air Navigation School had been formed at RAF Manston to take <b>over</b> <b>this</b> training for all pilots destined for Coastal and Bomber Commands. Conversion training for Flying Boats was also given there.|$|E
5|$|Group 18 Structure 2 is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Its {{earliest}} phase dates to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west. A later construction phase was built <b>over</b> <b>this.</b> It consisted of a rectangular platform that supported a bench. A small pyrite disc was found near the front wall. Obsidian prismatic blades were found on top of the platform, together with pieces of a thin earthenware bowl. Burial 69 was found in front of the base of the platform.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, Pope Pius IX, {{with the}} support of the {{overwhelming}} majority of Catholic bishops, whom he had consulted from 1851 to 1853, proclaimed the Immaculate Conception as a Dogma in the Catholic Church. In 1870, the First Vatican Council affirmed the doctrine of papal infallibility when exercised in specifically defined pronouncements. Controversy <b>over</b> <b>this</b> and other issues resulted in a breakaway movement called the Old Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|The Centenary Test {{was played}} from 12 to 17 March 1977, with a rest day on 15 March. At that time, Test matches in Australia were played with 8-ball <b>overs.</b> <b>This</b> was the 800th Test match ever played, and the 225th {{between the two}} countries.|$|R

5|$|In November 1912, a {{bill was}} publicised under the LER name that {{included}} a plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L's Richmond branch tracks. The District line already ran trains <b>over</b> <b>this</b> route, and the Piccadilly tube service would provide additional connections. The bill received assent as the London Electric Railway Act, 1913 on 15 August 1913. The advent of World War I prevented work on the extension starting. Post-war, a shortage of funds and other priorities meant that the extension was postponed until the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In October, the 2/48th Battalion paraded {{through the}} streets of Adelaide to Mitcham railway station prior to its {{embarkation}} for the Middle East. The battalion's voyage overseas was postponed until 17 November, when the unit boarded the SS Stratheden. The ship made a stop at Perth, where Derrick was confined on board for going absent without leave to sightsee. He was soon in more trouble, and was charged and fined for punching another soldier who taunted him <b>over</b> <b>this</b> incident.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} trends across the broader Australian population, the {{proportion}} of ADF personnel who are not religious has increased considerably over recent years.

5|$|In nature, sixteen {{repositories}} {{were discovered}} at the Oklo mine in Gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations {{were found to}} have moved less than 10ft (3 m) <b>over</b> <b>this</b> period, though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} where Tracy is on his bacon run, every mention of January 17th is either shot so the actor's mouth is hidden or dubbed <b>over.</b> <b>This</b> can be seen most clearly when Cerie says January 17th.

5|$|Irish {{zoologist}} Nicholas Aylward Vigors {{established the}} genus Platycercus in 1825, {{based on the}} distinctive architecture of the feathers in the tail and wing, including P. flavigaster and P. brownii within it. English naturalist James Francis Stephens named it Platycercus xanthogaster in 1826, {{though there was no}} need for a new binomial name. Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews noted that the name Platycercus flaviventris was commonly used in the 19th century, but highlighted the priority of both P. brownii and P. caledonicus <b>over</b> <b>this,</b> positing the last as the most senior name. He believed the specimens used for P. brownii had come from Derwent in Tasmania.|$|E

5|$|Jim Dawson devoted {{an entire}} chapter of his 2006 Modern History of the Fart to Shatner's alleged {{flatulence}} in Mind Meld, which he compares {{to the sound}} of someone stepping on a tribble.

5|$|Like Pedra Branca, the Sultan of Johor {{held the}} {{original}} ancient title to Middle Rocks. As Singapore had not exercised any {{rights as a}} sovereign over Middle Rocks, the ICJ determined that Malaysia retained sovereignty <b>over</b> <b>this</b> maritime feature. As for South Ledge, the ICJ noted that it fell within the apparently overlapping territorial waters of mainland Malaysia, Pedra Branca and Middle Rocks. As the Court had not been mandated {{to draw the line}} of delimitation with respect to the territorial waters of Malaysia and Singapore in the area in question, it simply held that sovereignty over South Ledge belonged to the state which owned the territorial waters in which it is located.|$|E
