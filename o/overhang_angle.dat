40|$|The paper {{presents}} a topology optimization approach that designs an optimal structure, called a self-supporting structure, which {{is ready to}} be fabricated via additive manufacturing without the usage of additional support structures. Such supports in general have to be created during the fabricating process so that the primary object can be manufactured layer by layer without collapse, which is very time-consuming and waste of material. The proposed approach resolves this problem by formulating the self-supporting requirements as a novel explicit quadratic continuous constraint in the topology optimization problem, or specifically, requiring the number of unsupported elements (in terms of the sum of squares of their densities) to be zero. Benefiting form such novel formulations, computing sensitivity of the self-supporting constraint with respect to the design density is straightforward, which otherwise would require lots of research efforts in general topology optimization studies. The derived sensitivity for each element is only linearly dependent on its sole density, which, different from previous layer-based sensitivities, consequently allows for a parallel implementation and possible higher convergence rate. In addition, a discrete convolution operator is also designed to detect the unsupported elements as involved in each step of optimization iteration, and improves the detection process 100 times as compared with simply enumerating these elements. The approach works for cases of general <b>overhang</b> <b>angle,</b> or general domain, and produces an optimized structures, and their associated optimal compliance, very close to that of the reference structure obtained without considering the self-supporting constraint, as demonstrated by extensive 2 D and 3 D benchmark examples.

40|$|Solar shading is an {{important}} element {{not only for the}} purpose of reducing direct solar heat gain, but also for controlling the quality of daylighting and associated glare. The balance between the prevention of heat gains and natural daylight penetration is crucial for energy saving in building cooling and lighting. However, many buildings nowadays do not show proper use of solar shading. One of the main factors is the lack of understanding and proper use of shading design tools or methods. The main objective of this research is to determine the optimum external solar shading geometry for energy efficiency in hot humid tropic. Besides, this research also accesses the application of computer simulation tools for shading design. Two methodologies were employed in this research. The first one was an assessment on computer simulation tools using scaled physical model measurement. Desktop Radiance 2. 0 and VELUX Daylight Visualizer 2. 5 were selected and evaluated for proper application under tropical sky. The second methodology was building energy simulation using e-QUEST- 3. This experiment was to investigate the impact of room geometry, fenestration size and external overhang depth on building energy consumption. The results showed that the highest energy saving achieved was as much as 70 percents. The relationship of the 3 variables was discussed and prediction tool for optimum shading was developed for energy efficiency. Futhur study can be carried out on other types of shading devices and variables such as room height, <b>overhang</b> <b>angle,</b> colour, etc. The findings can be further developed into simplified shading design tool...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of additive manufacturing has allowed for increased flexibility {{and complexity of}} designs over formative and subtractive manufacturing. However, a limiting factor of additive manufacturing is the as-built surface quality {{as well as the}} difficulty in maintaining an acceptable surface roughness in overhanging structures. In order to optimize surface roughness in these structures, samples covering a range of <b>overhang</b> <b>angles</b> and process parameters were built in a laser powder bed fusion system. Analysis of the surface roughness was then performed to determine a relationship between process parameters, angle of the overhanging surface, and surface roughness. It was found that the analysis of surface roughness metrics, such as Rpc, Rsm, and Rc, can indicate a shift between surfaces dominated by partially melted powder particles and surfaces dominated by material from the re-solidified melt track...|$|R

[...] It {{is defined as}} the angle between the ground and the line drawn between the front tire and the lowest-hanging part of the vehicle at the front <b>overhang.</b> Departure <b>angle</b> is its counterpart {{at the rear of the}} vehicle - the maximum ramp angle from which the car can descend without damage. Approach and departure angles are also referred to as ramp angles.|$|R
50|$|Western {{and eastern}} sun can provide warmth and lighting, but are {{vulnerable}} to overheating in summer if not shaded. In contrast, the low midday sun readily admits light and warmth during the winter, but can be easily shaded with appropriate length <b>overhangs</b> or <b>angled</b> louvres during summer and leaf bearing summer shade trees which shed their leaves in the fall. The amount of radiant heat received {{is related to the}} location latitude, altitude, cloud cover, and seasonal / hourly angle of incidence (see Sun path and Lambert's cosine law).|$|R

50|$|In DMLS, {{powder bed}} {{supports}} the parts {{and keep them}} held in place. However, support structures are explicitly required {{for most of the}} downward facing surfaces that make an angle less than 45 degrees with the powder bed. This is {{because of the fact that}} powder bed alone is not sufficient enough to hold the liquid phase of the metal that is created when laser is scanning the powder. Support structures are also required to restrict curling/warping of the melted powder due to high-temperature gradients. The <b>overhangs</b> having <b>angles</b> less than 45 degrees should be avoided if possible at the design stage. The main advantage of this is to reduce material usage and the post processing requirement of removing support structures from the designed components.|$|R
50|$|The Old Faithful museum, {{the first}} of the series, was built at a cost of $8,500 and was {{completed}} in 1929. The museum was a low T-shaped single-story structure of rustic log and stone construction. Two stepped sections of roof dominated the main portion of the building with deep <b>overhangs</b> supported by <b>angled</b> log brackets resting on a raised stone foundation sill. A perpendicular wing extended {{in the direction of the}} parking lot. The building resembled the Madison and Fishing Bridge museums. The museum's surroundings featured an amphitheater for ranger talks and a small garden of native botanical specimens.|$|R
40|$|Airborne dust {{originating}} from the {{transport and storage}} of raw coal has {{detrimental effects on the}} environment. Warkworth Mining is seeking to reduce the dust emissions caused by the dumping of raw coal at their facility in Singleton, NSW. The suggested strategy was the construction of windbreaks, for which commercial designs exist. The MISG was asked to advise on the placement and design of such windbreaks. The problem was approached by studying results in the literature on windbreak design, selecting a few possible configurations, and then testing these by solving numerically for the wind velocity around the dumping site. It was concluded that a long fence on the upwind side of the dumping hoppers would provide moderate protection, but would interfere with current operating procedures. As a better option, a long downwind fence immediately behind the hoppers would provide a similar reduction in the dust emission, and allow more effective use of water sprays. Although fine details of the fence design could not be modelled numerically, we concluded that it was desirable for the fence to have an <b>angled</b> <b>overhang</b> {{in the vicinity of the}} hoppers, and a porous section near the base to reduce turbulent flows...|$|R
40|$|This study evaluates shading {{performance}} on house facades of selected three terraced houses in Putrajaya, Malaysia {{as the case}} studies. Terraced house type is selected for the case study {{because it is the}} most popular house type built in this country to house an increase of the urban population. Its total number built in urban area increases from 27 % of the total dwellings in 1980 to 40 % in 1990, and to slightly more than 60 per cent in 2000. The Case Study A, B, and C are atypical style of terraced house facade designs built in Putrajaya. These postmodern designs exhibit a range of complex geometric elements blending of colonial and traditional elements with colorful styles on the house facade. In this study, the time at which the sun path perpendicular to the house facade will be used to gain the results of shading performances when the house facades have their maximum exposure to the direct sunlight. The house facade was divided into two main parts which are opaque and glazing surface elements. The amount of shading area on the opaque and glazing surface was simulated using the SunTool program. In conclusion, the Case Study C had the highest average percentage of the shading area, which is 64. 43 %, followed by the Case Study A 60. 41 % and Case Study B 56. 29 %. These results showed that the facade designs had excellent horizontal shading elements with roof <b>overhangs</b> for high <b>angle</b> sunlight but they had weak vertical shading elements {{due to a lack of}} considerations of louvered elements to block low angle sunlight...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIntroduction Many {{clinical}} anatomy {{studies have}} looked into how {{variations in the}} acromion, coracoacromial ligament (CAL) and subacromial space are associated with rotator cuff injuries. However, no study up to now had defined anatomically the fibro-osseous canal that confines the supraspinatus muscle in the subcoracoacromial space. Through an anatomical study of the scapula, we defined the bone-related parameters of this canal and its anatomical variations. Materials and methods This study on dry bones involved 71 scapulas. With standardised photographs in two orthogonal views (superior and lateral), the surface area of the subcoracoacromial canal and the anatomical parameters making up this canal were defined and measured using image analysis software. The primary analysis evaluated the anatomical parameters of the canal {{as a function of}} three canal surface area groups; the secondary analysis looked into how variations in the canal surface area were related to the type of acromion according to the Bigliani classification. Results Relative to glenoid width, the group with a large canal surface area (L) had significantly less lateral overhang of the acromion than the group with a small canal surface area (S), with ratios of 0. 41 ± 0. 23 and 0. 58 ± 0. 3, respectively (P = 0. 04). The mean length of the CAL was 46 ± 8 mm in the L group and 39 ± 9 mm in the S group (P = 0. 003). The coracoacromial arch angle was 38 ° ± 11 ° in the L group and 34 ° ± 9 ° in the S group; the canal surface area was smaller in specimens with a smaller coracoacromial arch angle (P = 0. 20). Conclusion Apart from acromial morphology, there could be innate anatomical features of the scapula that predispose people to extrinsic lesions to the supraspinatus tendon (lateral <b>overhang,</b> coracoacromial arch <b>angle)</b> by reducing the subcoracoacromial canal's surface area.
