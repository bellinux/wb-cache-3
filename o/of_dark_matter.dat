5|$|Dark {{matter is}} the matter in the {{universe}} that cannot be seen. Because of the gravitational effect it exerts on stars and galaxies, scientists know that approximately 80% of the matter in the universe is dark matter. The spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> in the universe is largely unknown; SIM Lite would have helped scientists answer to this question.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental to the {{structure}} of the Universe is the existence <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> and dark energy. These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe. For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components.|$|E
5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster {{is in the form}} <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter,</b> with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter in the form of galaxies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} the relic {{abundance}} of the minority component <b>of</b> asymmetric <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> can be very sensitive to the expansion rate of the Universe and the temperature of transition between a non-standard pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmological phase and the standard radiation dominated phase, if chemical decoupling happens before this transition. In particular, because the annihilation cross section <b>of</b> asymmetric <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> is typically larger than that <b>of</b> symmetric <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> in the standard cosmology, the decrease in relic density of the minority component in non-standard cosmologies {{with respect to the}} majority component may be compensated by the increase in annihilation cross section, so that the annihilation rate at present <b>of</b> asymmetric <b>dark</b> <b>matter,</b> contrary to general belief, could be larger than that <b>of</b> symmetric <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> in the standard cosmology.

5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} Milky Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way. The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> in the local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to detecting extrasolar planets, SIM {{would have helped}} astronomers construct {{a map of the}} Milky Way galaxy. Other important tasks would have included collecting data to help pinpoint stellar masses for specific types of stars, assisting in the determination of the spatial distribution <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> in the Milky Way and in the local group of galaxies and using the gravitational microlensing effect to measure the mass of stars.|$|E
5|$|Rubin's {{calculations}} {{showed that}} galaxies must contain {{at least five}} to ten times as much dark matter as ordinary matter.

5|$|The Coma Supercluster, itself {{part of the}} Coma Filament, {{contains}} the Coma and Leo Cluster of galaxies. The Coma Cluster (Abell 1656) is 230 to 300 million light-years away. It {{is one of the}} largest known clusters, with at least 10,000 galaxies (mainly elliptical, with a few spiral galaxies). Due to its distance from Earth, most of the galaxies are visible only through large telescopes. Its brightest members are NGC 4874 and NGC 4889, both with a magnitude of 13; most others are magnitude 15 or dimmer. NGC 4889 is a giant elliptical galaxy with one of the largest known black holes (21 billion solar masses), and NGC 4921 is the cluster's brightest spiral galaxy. After observing the Coma Cluster, astronomer Fritz Zwicky first postulated the existence <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> during the 1930s. The massive galaxy Dragonfly 44 discovered in 2015 was found to consist almost entirely <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter.</b> Its mass is very similar to that of the Milky Way, but it emits only 1% of the light emitted by the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The strongest {{evidence}} for dark matter comes from galactic motion. Galaxies rotate {{much faster than}} the amount of visible matter suggests they should; the gravity from the ordinary matter {{is not enough to}} hold the galaxy together. Scientists theorize that the galaxy is held together by huge quantities <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter.</b> Similarly, clusters of galaxies do not appear to have enough visible matter to gravitationally balance the high speed motions of their component galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object.

In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter,</b> which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a model <b>of</b> two-component <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> {{based on a}} hidden U(1) D symmetry, in which relic densities <b>of</b> the <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> are determined by forbidden channels and thermal freeze-out. The hidden U(1) D symmetry is spontaneously broken to a residual Bbb Z(4) symmetry, and the lightest Bbb Z(4) charged particle can be a <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> candidate. Moreover, depending on the mass hierarchy in the dark sector, we have two-component <b>dark</b> <b>matter.</b> We show that the relic density <b>of</b> the lighter <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> component can be determined by forbidden annihilation channels which require larger couplings compared to the normal freeze-out mechanism. As a result, a large self-interaction <b>of</b> the lighter <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> component can be induced, which may solve small scale problems of ΛCDM model. On the other hand, the heavier <b>dark</b> <b>matter</b> component is produced by normal freeze-out mechanism.

5|$|The Big Bang {{theory is}} the {{prevailing}} cosmological {{model for the}} universe from the earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe expanded from a very high density and high temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for {{a broad range of}} phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background (CMB), large scale structure and Hubble's law. If the known laws of physics are extrapolated to the highest density regime, the result is a singularity which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 billion years ago, which is thus considered the age of the universe. After the initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of subatomic particles, and later simple atoms. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through gravity in halos <b>of</b> <b>dark</b> <b>matter,</b> eventually forming the stars and galaxies visible today.|$|E
