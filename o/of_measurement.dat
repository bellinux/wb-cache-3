5|$|Although {{the metric}} system {{has changed and}} {{developed}} since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of units <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> now known as base units.

5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
5|$|Articulographs able {{to measure}} in three {{dimensions}} use six transmitter coils organized in a spherical configuration. The transmitters are arranged so that the axis of a sensor coil is never perpendicular to more than three transmitters. Through the transmitter configuration and ability to measure in multiple dimensions, three-dimensional articulographs {{are able to make}} measurements outside of the midsagittal plane. 2D articulographs require restrictive headmounts to ensure that the subject's head does not move off the plane <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> Because 3D articulographs are able to measure outside of the midsagittal plane, a less restrictive headmount is able to be used.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution in 1789, most countries and even some cities had their own system <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> Although different countries might have used units of measure with the same name, such as the foot, or local language equivalents such as pied, Fuß, and voet, there was no consistency in the magnitude of those units, nor in the relationships with their multiples and submultiples, much like the modern-day differences between the US and the UK pints and gallons.|$|E

50|$|Line speed, billed on the 95th percentile, {{refers to}} the speed in which data flows from the server or device, {{measured}} every 5 minutes for the month, and dropping the top 5% <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> that are highest, and basing the usage for the month on the next-highest measurement. This {{is similar to a}} median measurement, which {{can be thought of as}} a 50th percentile <b>measurement</b> (with 50% <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> above, and 50% <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> below), whereas this sets the cutoff at 95th percentile, with 5% <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> above the value, and 95% <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> below the value.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution, much of modern-day Germany and Austria were part of the Holy Roman Empire which had become a loose federation of kingdoms, principalities, free cities, bishoprics and other fiefdoms, each with its own system <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> though in most cases such system were loosely derived from the Carolingian system instituted by Charlemagne a thousand years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{magnitude}} {{of many of the}} units comprising the SI system <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is ultimately defined by the mass of a -year-old, golf-ball-sized piece of metal, the quality of the IPK must be diligently protected to preserve the integrity of the SI system. Yet, despite the best stewardship, the average mass of the worldwide ensemble of prototypes and the mass of the IPK have likely diverged another µg since the third periodic verification years ago. Further, the world's national metrology laboratories must wait for the fourth periodic verification to confirm whether the historical trendspersisted.|$|E
