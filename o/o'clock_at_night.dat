A Japanese Christian captain led the charge, rallying his fellow coreligionists with the reasoning that if the carrack was not destroyed or captured, Ieyasu would turn his wrath onto the Christian community and the churches would be destroyed. A few Japanese succeeded in boarding the ship but were promptly cut down (Pessoa himself apparently killed two) or were forced to jump into the water.|$|E

2500|$|London died on Sunday, June 6, 1926. As he was {{crossing}} Second Avenue at 15th Street, {{he was caught}} in the middle of heavy automobile traffic passing in both directions. London became confused and when he halted in the middle of the road he was struck by a car, suffering internal injuries. The driver rushed him to Bellevue Hospital, where London’s daughter was an intern. When she saw her father, London’s only concern was that the driver not be punished. [...] "It’s not his fault", said London [...] "and he is a poor man."

25|$|The chase lasted all day, until 11 <b>o'clock</b> <b>at</b> <b>night</b> when Pique {{was able}} to range {{alongside}} Seine and fire a broadside. The two exchanged fire for several hours, with the lighter Pique suffering considerable damage to her masts and rigging. Jason then ranged up and Captain Stirling called upon Milne to anchor, but Milne did not hear and was determined to see Seine captured, and pressed on. Before the battle could be resumed Pique ran suddenly aground. Jason too ran aground before she could swing way, while Seine was observed to have grounded, and lost all her masts in the process. As the tide rose Seine {{was able to}} swing into a position to rake the two British ships. With difficulty the sailors of Jason dragged several guns to the bow in order to exchange fire, while Pique {{was able to bring}} her foremost guns to bear. Under fire from both British ships, the appearance on the scene of Mermaid convinced the French to surrender. Jason had lost seven killed and 12 wounded, while Pique sustained casualties of two killed and six wounded. Seine however had 170 killed and 100 wounded.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{were driven}} down to London by Aspinall on New Year's Eve in 1961, for the now-famous Decca audition, but Aspinall lost his way, and the trip took ten hours.

[...] In 1963, Aspinall was joined by Mal Evans, who also helped set up the Beatles' {{equipment}} (and acted as a bodyguard) which freed Aspinall to concentrate on other duties, like arranging appointments or buying things for them, such as suits, boots, meals, or drinks.|$|E
500|$|From {{this point}} on, combat {{centered}} on the village of Unterhausen, [...] west-south-west of Neuburg center. A few French platoons drove the Austrians from the forest located between the village and the Danube with a bayonet charge by the grenadiers of the 109th. As French reserves arrived, the Austrians counterattacked and retook the woods, the heights at Oberhausen, and the village. [...] According to Lecourbe's account, the Austrians, [...] "embolden by this first success, soon covered all the surrounding heights, on which they planted about twenty-five or thirty pieces of cannon." [...] At eight <b>o'clock</b> <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> after twelve hours of battle, companies of the 14th and 46th Regiments (French) moved along a small road {{on the right of}} the village, and another group proceeded on the left, enveloping the village. [...] The subsequent simultaneous French attack at both flanks and the center convinced the Austrians that, despite the defensive barrages laid by their artillery in Oberhausen, the French had been massively reinforced. The attack on the village, executed without firing a shot, involved fierce hand-to-hand fighting in which the commander of the 46th Regiment and the First Grenadier of France, Latour D'Auvergne, were both killed.|$|E

40|$|Analyzing the {{heritage}} of Christianity, we see that since the very beginning, Sunday, {{the first day of}} the week, has always been the day of common Church gathering to celebrate the Eucharist. In the very beginning, as pointed by Tertullian, the celebration took place <b>at</b> <b>night</b> because of the precessions. Night or dawn gave more privacy and security. After the Edict of Milan it became a custom that a Mass should be celebrated after three <b>o’clock,</b> or <b>at</b> <b>night,</b> if they fell around so-called Quattro Tempora. In the middle ages it was believed that any time of the day is good to celebrate the Eucharist, but missa conventualis et sollemnis in hora Tertia. After the Council of Trent the time of the main Sunday Eucharist – summa – was determined by the bishop and in Poland it was at 10. 00 AM. Often before this Mass was a Mass primaria celebrated. In the beginning of XX century the Code of Canon Law of 1917 stated that it was not allowed to celebrate a private Mass earlier than an hour before dawn or an hour after noon. For the solemnities that had its own vigil, the celebrations of the Eucharist took place in the evening. The purpose of that practice was to prepare for the celebration of the solemnity of the next day. Along with industrialization, introduction of different work shifts, persecution of the Church and other specific circumstances, it was allowed to celebrate Mass in the evening. This rule was especially visible during the Second World War and shortly after when the Sunday evening Mass was celebrated for the prisoners of war, those who were detained and foreigners. After the Church adapted the rule that the canonical hour for the Vespers would be called Vespers I, a discussion on the celebration of the Mass on Saturday evening started among the moral theologians. Participation in the Saturday evening Mass was supposed to satisfy the obligation of participation in the Sunday Mass and the holy days de praecepto. The Church recognized that there was a large group of the faithful who practiced sports and hunted on Sundays and that there was also an insufficient number of priests in some parishes. Therefore, so-called pre-holyday Mass was introduced to enable more participation in the Masses. The document Eucharisticum Mysterium of 1967 definitely recognized that the participation in Saturday vigil Mass satisfied the obligation of Sunday Mass participation. It was reconfirmed again by the Code of Canon Law in 1983 and by Dies Domini of John Paul II and the II Council of the Church of Poland...|$|R

Occasionally echoes from regions above the normal F-layer have been obtained, Occurrence of complex echoes is found to be associated with variation of one or other of the terrestrial magnetic elements.
