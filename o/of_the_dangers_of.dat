He recommended that every new player should be warned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> becoming involved with bookmakers, and the penalties that it entails. The ICC announced that no further action would be taken against Waugh and Warne as {{they could not be}} tried twice for the same offence.|$|E

Critics contended that during his tenure, Texas ranked near the bottom in environmental evaluations. Supporters pointed to his efforts to raise the salaries of teachers and improve educational test scores.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, the {{increasing}} wealth of middle class merchants and traders meant that commoners began emulating the aristocracy, {{and threatened to}} break {{down some of the}} symbolic barriers between the nobility and the lower classes. The response came in two forms: didactic literature warning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> adapting a diet inappropriate for one's class, and sumptuary laws that put a cap on the lavishness of commoners' banquets.|$|E

5|$|After filming, {{parts of}} the {{interior}} sets of the So'na ships were added using CGI. Stage 15 on the Paramount lot {{was used for the}} climactic scene between Picard and Ru'afo. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> the four-story scaffolding-like set, the actors were attached by safety cables at all times. Paramount's B tankwhich was used to represent San Francisco Bay in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Homewas used to shoot footage of Picard, Data and Anij at the Ba'ku lake. For a scene in which Data walks along a lake-bed, the actor's tricorder prop was covered with plastic to make it watertight.|$|E
5|$|By 2009 {{some of the}} {{conditions}} required for a currency war had returned, with a severe economic downturn seeing global trade in that year decline by about 12%. There was a widespread concern among advanced economies {{about the size of}} their deficits; they increasingly joined emerging economies in viewing export led growth as their ideal strategy. In March 2009, even before international co-operation reached its peak with the 2009 G-20 London Summit , economist Ted Truman {{became one of the first}} to warn <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> competitive devaluation. He also coined the phrase competitive non-appreciation.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} Rusty's landfall, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services placed 30personnel {{on standby}} and began aerial surveys {{to determine if}} residents needed aid. Residents in Pilbara were warned <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> asbestos in damaged or destroyed structures in early March as {{they were allowed to}} return home. A week after Rusty passed through Pilbara, an algal bloom the size of Tasmania appeared offshore. Unprecedented turbidity from the storm stirred up a large column of nutrients from the seafloor and brought it to the surface, causing the rapid increase in algae. Despite its size, it was not expected to have any lasting effects in the region.|$|E

Al•Ith, upon returning to Zone Three, is shunned by its inhabitants for failing to attend to their zone's needs, and Zone Three's stasis manifests itself in xenophobia when Al•Ith brings back new perspectives, followed by visitors from Zone Four.|$|E
5|$|On 13 June 1944 the V-1 {{flying bomb}} {{offensive}} began and Cunningham was tasked with assisting with their interception. He also coordinated his efforts with No. 100 Group RAF, which {{were engaged in}} intruder operations over occupied Europe. Cunningham was concerned at using Mosquitoes for intercepting V-1s because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> the bomb exploding and damaging the attacking fighter. One of his former commanding officers and current Group Captain Edward Crew—an ace with 15 enemy aircraft and 31 V-1s shot down—was forced to bail out when the nose of his Mosquito was split open. The operations did last long and by August 1944 the Mosquitoes were back on bomber support missions.|$|E

5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
5|$|Be Here Now is {{the third}} studio album by English rock band Oasis, {{released}} on 21 August 1997 by Creation Records. Oasis had achieved worldwide success with their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe and 1995 follow up (What's the Story) Morning Glory? The third album was highly anticipated by both fans and music critics. Oasis' management company, Ignition, were aware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> overexposure, and before release sought to control the media's access to the album. The campaign included limiting pre-release radio airplay and forcing journalists to sign gag orders. The tactics resulted in the alienation of both the press and many industry personnel connected with the band, and fueled large-scale speculation and wide publicity within the British music scene.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder {{attends a}} parole hearing for Monte Propps, {{a serial killer}} he helped to {{apprehend}} in the late 1980s. Propps' method of killing involved brainwashing his kidnapped victims until {{they were willing to}} commit suicide by drowning; however he is now seen as a model reformee and is released. Shortly afterwards, Mulder meets with Frank Black, who warns him <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> the offender's freedom. The two visit the released man's halfway house, arriving shortly after his parole officer; inside they find Propps drowned in his bath. In an alley outside, they parole officer is also found dead, with the ouroboros symbol of the Millennium Group tattooed on her neck. A child in the alley momentarily speaks to Black with the voice of a demonic entity he recognises, warning of impending disaster.|$|E

5|$|Like in Texas, a {{mosquito}} outbreak occurred in Louisiana. Only pesticides {{acceptable to the}} US Environmental Protection Agency and the US Fish and Wildlife Service were allowed to be used. FEMA officials warned homeowners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> floodwaters, including mold, mildew, and bacteria. By {{three months after the}} storm, just under 100,000 Louisiana citizens applied for federal aid, totaling to over $110million (2001USD, $143million 2012USD). $25million (2001USD, $32million 2012USD) of the total was for business loans, while an additional $8million was for public assistance for communities and state agencies. More than 750 flood victims in Florida applied for governmental aid, totaling to $1.29million (2001USD, $1.5million 2007USD). In Pennsylvania, 1,670 flood victims applied for federal aid, totaling to $11.5million (2001USD, $14.3million 2012USD). $3.4million (2001USD, $4.4million 2012USD) of the total was to replace a SEPTA rail bridge over Sandy Run in Fort Washington.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Hamad died {{suddenly}} at 11:40 EAT (08:40 UTC) on 25 August 1896. His 29-year-old nephew Khalid bin Bargash, who was suspected {{by some of}} his assassination, moved into the palace complex at Zanzibar Town without British approval, in contravention of the treaty agreed with Ali. The British government preferred an alternative candidate, Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourably disposed towards them. Khalid was warned by the consul and diplomatic agent to Zanzibar, Basil Cave, and General Mathews to think carefully about his actions. This course of action had proved successful three years earlier when Khalid had tried to claim the sultanate {{after the death of}} Ali, and the British consul-general, Rennell Rodd, had persuaded him <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> such an action.|$|E
5|$|Edward I had {{the major}} {{ingredients}} for gunpowder shipped to Stirling in 1304, probably {{to produce a}} form of Greek fire, to be shot into the town in earthenware pots by siege engines. The English probably had projectile gunpowder artillery in the 1320s and the Scots by the next decade. The first clear recorded use in Britain was when Edward III besieged Berwick in 1333, where it was used alongside mechanical siege engines. The first use by the Scots was probably against Stirling Castle in 1341. Gunpowder artillery began to fully replace mechanical engines in the late fourteenth century. The Stewarts attempted to follow the French and English crowns in building up an artillery train. The abortive siege of Roxburgh in 1436 under James I was probably the first conflict in which the Scots made serious use of artillery. James II had a royal gunner and received gifts of artillery from the continent, including two giant bombards made for Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, one of which, Mons Meg, still survives. Although these were probably already outdated on the continent, they represented impressive military technology when they reached Scotland. James II enthusiasm for artillery cost him his life and demonstrated some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> early artillery, when a gun exploded at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460. James III also experienced ill-fortune, when artillery sent from Sigismund, Archduke of Austria sank in a storm en route to Scotland in 1481. James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a foundry in 1511. Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign. However, his 18 heavy artillery pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing Scots army, proving ineffective against the longer range and smaller calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden.|$|E
