40|$|The {{design of}} a {{solid-state}} circuit breaker that can be interconnected to a second breaker to form a transfer switch is presented. The breaker operates on a nominal 270 -V dc circuit and controls power to loads of up to 15 A. Automatic <b>overload</b> <b>trip</b> is provided {{as a function of}} excess energy measured through the breaker and/or excess current through the breaker. After an <b>overload</b> <b>trip,</b> up to nine preprogrammable attempts to reclose may be tried with programmable delays between each attempt. The breaker or switch is remotely controllable. Test data on performance in the laboratory over temperatures from - 45 to 100 C are provided. The feasibility of solid-state switch gear has been established...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{revolves around}} a time dependent thermal <b>overload</b> <b>trip</b> unit inside automated switching mechanisms. The first part addresses {{the principle of}} the function of a thermal overcurrent trip unit and the possible construction solutions. The biggest emphasis is given to bimetal as a base construction feature of the thermal overcurrent trip unit. Besides the materials that are most suitable for the creation of bimetal, various bimetal parameters that are needed for its design are also analyzed. The next subject of the thesis is an introduction to the elemental calculations for the bimetal component and the summary of mathematical relations for the calculation of the most commonly used solutions. A predominant part of this thesis revolves around the theoretical calculation of the thermal <b>overload</b> <b>trip</b> in a previously estabilished circuit breaker for a specific type of the bimetal and a specific required tripping characteristic. The previously estabilished calculation is then verified by measuring. The measuring itself consists of the measurement of the free bending of the bimetal in dependence on heat. The last part of this thesis includes the assessment of the results calculated from the theoretical standpoint, compared with the results given by the measurement...|$|E
40|$|This master‘s thesis {{deals with}} the thermal <b>overload</b> <b>trip</b> unit in {{automatically}} operated electrical switching devices. The {{first part of this}} thesis serves as a basis for a design of thermostatic bimetal element in electrical switching device. The thesis presents important parameters and calculation principles needed for the design of bimetal element. The thesis further describes the operating principle of thermal trip unit and its possible design solutions. The main part is devoted to analytical calculation and measurement of specific thermostatic bimetal type contained in thermal trip unit of molded case circuit breaker. It is measurement of force and deflection, depending on temperature change. In the next part a numerical model of the bimetallic strip was created and its deflection was simulated. The analytical results are compared with the measured and simulated results {{at the end of the}} thesis...|$|E
30|$|One component’s <b>overload</b> <b>tripping</b> {{will lead}} to other components’ tripping, which {{will result in a}} {{cascading}} failure. Similar to conventional generators, wind turbines have overload protection, however, the trigging value error of protection device {{will lead to}} protection uncertainty.|$|R
30|$|In the 2011 Southwest America {{blackout}} case, {{real-time tools}} of the affected grids were inadequate and nonoperational when needed to provide early-warning information and preventive control decisions. For instance, if IID’s DSA system had identified in advance the impact of H–NG line tripping and given preventive control suggestions, the operators could have taken action before the line tripping to adjust the system condition and thus the <b>overload</b> <b>tripping</b> of CV transformers {{could have been avoided}} so that the cascading evolution could have been interrupted at its initial stage. In addition, if IID’s DSA system had alarmed the operators that on that day, total power flow of the two CV transformers was at such a high level that only preventive control measures could have avoided <b>overload</b> <b>tripping</b> of the second transformer upon the tripping of the first, the operators could have dispatched additional generation to alleviate the transformer loading to avoid the loss of both transformers. Moreover, if IID had in its DSA system modeled its neighboring network using APS’s complete topological model with real-time measurement data instead of a highly simplified equivalent model of pseudo-generators plus tie lines, the DSA could have assessed the impact of a sudden loss of H–NG on its power system before it actually happened and IID could have taken proper preventive control actions before the H–NG line tripped.|$|R
40|$|The {{thrust of}} urban {{planners}} {{today is to}} develop methods of travel for adaptation to their environments. This is meant to match the high population growth rates in developing countries. Transportation congestion is a problem faced many cities today. Routes and facilities tend to be <b>overloaded,</b> <b>trips</b> tend to be long and services provided for public transport become inconsistent and inconvenient. This study examines {{the factors that influence}} modes of travel used by the commuters in Gweru as a first step towards isolating the causes of transport problems. This way the needs of different socioeconomic groups can be understood. An attempt is also made in this study to use simple travel models in determining modal split. These models are adapted {{in the context of the}} study area...|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of thermal {{overload}} relay. In one type, a bi-metallic strip located close to a heater deflects as the heater temperature rises until it mechanically causes the device to trip and open the circuit, cutting power to the motor should it become overloaded. A thermal overload will accommodate the brief high starting current of a motor while accurately protecting it from a running current overload. The heater coil and the action of the bi-metallic strip introduce a time delay that affords the motor time to start and settle into normal running current without the thermal <b>overload</b> <b>tripping.</b> Thermal <b>overloads</b> can be manually or automatically resettable depending on their application and have an adjuster that allows them to be accurately set to the motor run current.|$|R
30|$|Type 0 : Ordinary, {{which we}} may {{classify}} as the baseline of “everyday” outage restorations (Duffey and Ha 2013; IEEE 2013), with simpler equipment replacement, line repairs, and/or reconnection {{due to an}} effectively instantaneous outage. Without any significant additional damage due to extreme events and/or weather effects, or any degraded access difficulties, power restoration can be achieved usually {{within a few hours}} to a day (for example, damage limited to transformer fires, <b>overload</b> breaker <b>trips,</b> single tree falls).|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the failure was the setting of a {{protective}} relay {{on one of the}} transmission lines from the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Station No. 2 in Queenston, Ontario, near Niagara Falls. The safety relay was set to trip if other protective equipment deeper within the Ontario Hydro system failed to operate properly.On a particularly cold November evening, power demands for heating, lighting, and cooking were pushing the electrical system to near its peak capacity. Transmission lines heading into Southern Ontario were heavily loaded. The system operators were not aware of a potential ambiguity between the extremely heavy power flows into Ontario and the setting upon which the relay was properly designed to operate. As a result of this ambiguity, at 5:16 p.m. Eastern Time, a small variation of power originating from the Robert Moses generating plant in Lewiston, New York caused the relay to trip, disabling a main power line heading into Southern Ontario. Instantly, the power that was flowing on the tripped line transferred to the other lines, causing them to become overloaded. Their own protective relays, which are also designed to protect the line from <b>overload,</b> <b>tripped,</b> isolating Beck Station from all of Southern Ontario.|$|R
5000|$|The dynamic {{controller}} {{could also}} provide other ancillary services, such as aiding blackstart recovery - {{the ability of}} a power grid to be brought back to service after a power outage [...] - [...] if programmed with that function. Generally blackstarts are made more difficult because of the large number of reactive loads attempting to draw power simultaneously at start up when voltages are low. This causes huge <b>overloads</b> that <b>trip</b> local breakers delaying full system recovery. The dynamic controller could have these loads [...] "wait their turn", as it were, until full power had been restored.|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{reliability}} {{issues in}} electric transmission networks, {{we use a}} probabilistic approach to study the occurrence of large failures in a stylized cascading failure model. In this model, lines have random capacities that initially meet the load demands imposed on the network. Every single line failure changes the load distribution in the surviving network, possibly causing further lines to become <b>overloaded</b> and <b>trip</b> as well. An initial single line failure can therefore potentially trigger massive cascading effects, and {{in this paper we}} measure the risk of such cascading events by the probability that the number of failed lines exceeds a certain large threshold. Under particular critical conditions, the exceedance probability follows a power-law distribution, implying a significant risk of severe failures. We examine the robustness of the power-law behavior by exploring under which assumptions this behavior prevails...|$|R
50|$|The counter-emf aids the {{armature}} resistance {{to limit the}} current through {{the armature}}. When power is first applied to a motor, the armature does not rotate. At that instant the counter-emf is zero and the only factor limiting the armature current is the armature resistance and inductance. Usually the armature resistance of a motor is less than 1 Ω; therefore the current through the armature would be very large when the power is applied. This current can make an excessive voltage drop affecting other equipment in the circuit and even <b>trip</b> <b>overload</b> protective devices.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor {{traditional}} screw transmission {{with long}} stroke length, the long screw {{is difficult to}} be processed, and the original space is large. Aiming at making up the defects, a novel dynamic combination screw transmission mechanism is put forward. The transmission principle, the parameter of extension ratio and meshing conditions of bracing screw and connecting screw are introduced. The carrying capacity is analyzed by simulation. The results show that number of connecting screw is key of parameter ratio and can be adjusted, and the large carrying capacity and accurate positioning meet the special requirement of big <b>trip</b> <b>overloading</b> linear drive applications...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{model has}} been {{proposed}} to simulate and evaluate post-earthquake functional performance of a highway transportation network system. The model combines the Monte Carlo simulation method and the modified incremental assignment method (MIAM); the former generates damage states of the transportation network, and the latter simulates traffic behavior in each damage state, producing a set of link flows. On this basis, various performance measures for links, O-D pairs, centroids, cross sections and the total network have been defined to evaluate aggregate and non-aggregate conditions of the network function. Proposed measures reflect mixed effects attributed to decrease in O-D trips due to facility damage and <b>overload,</b> increase in <b>trip</b> length due to detouring actions, and increase in travel time due to detouring and congestion, etc...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During {{the voltage}} unbalance, the {{resulting}} {{adverse effects on}} equipments such as induction motors and power electronic converters and drives on ASDs have been described. It has been observed that during unsymmetrical fault, the input rectifier slips into the single phase operation and draw heavy currents which may actuate the <b>overload</b> protection and <b>trip</b> the ASDs. The application of supercapacitors bank with boost converter to inject energy at DC-Link under voltage unbalance condition has been incorporated. The supercapacitor provides ride-through and reduces the current overshooting by injecting energy at DC-Link. Based on the designed topology, simulation model in MATLAB 7. 5 (Sim Power Block set) has been developed for voltage unbalance conditions with supercapacitor as an energy storage device. The designed control technique is modeled, simulated and successfully implemented in the laboratory. The extensive simulation results supported by experimental results were provided to validate the proposed syste...|$|R
50|$|Protection of {{traction}} motors from short circuits {{is accomplished by}} means of a fast-acting circuit breaker, which disconnects the traction circuit within 2-5 milliseconds if the current exceeds 575±25 amps. In case of a short to ground where the current does not exceed this level, protection is accomplished by a differential relay which compares current {{at both ends of the}} circuit and opens the circuit breaker if the difference in current exceeds 40 amps. The {{traction motors}} are also protected by a wheelslip relay which trips if the angular velocity of one of the traction motors significantly differs from the others (wheelslip, skidding, stripped gears, etc.) and an <b>overload</b> relay which <b>trips</b> if the current in a traction motor's circuit exceeds 265 amps; tripping of these relays automatically reduces the train's acceleration. The engineer's instrument panel has warning lights which illuminate when any of these relays trip (except for the differential relay—its action can be deduced from certain peculiarities in the tripping of the circuit breaker), and the tripping of the wheelslip relay also activates a warning bell.|$|R
50|$|Frequency of {{the system}} will vary as load and {{generation}} change. Increasing the mechanical input power to a synchronous generator will not greatly affect the system frequency, but will produce more electric power from that unit. During a severe <b>overload</b> caused by <b>tripping</b> or failure of generators or transmission lines the power system frequency will decline, due to an imbalance of load versus generation. Loss of an interconnection, while exporting power (relative to system total generation) will cause system frequency to rise. Automatic generation control (AGC) is used to maintain scheduled frequency and interchange power flows. Control systems in power stations detect changes in the network-wide frequency and adjust mechanical power input to generators back to their target frequency. This counteracting usually takes a few tens of seconds due to the large rotating masses involved. Temporary frequency changes are an unavoidable consequence of changing demand. Exceptional or rapidly changing mains frequency is often a sign that an electricity distribution network is operating near its capacity limits, dramatic examples of which can sometimes be observed shortly before major outages. Large solar farms can reduce their average output and use the extra capacity to assist in providing grid regulation; response of solar inverters is faster than generators, {{because they have no}} rotating mass.|$|R
