2500|$|Homophobia is {{prevalent}} in India. Public discussion of homosexuality in India has been inhibited {{by the fact}} that sexuality in any form is rarely discussed openly. In recent years, however, attitudes towards homosexuality have shifted slightly. In particular, there have been more depictions and discussions of homosexuality in the Indian news media and in Bollywood. [...] Several organisations, including the Naz Foundation (India) Trust, the National AIDS Control <b>Organisation,</b> <b>Law</b> Commission of India, Union Health Ministry, National Human Rights Commission of India and the Planning Commission of India have expressed support for decriminalising homosexuality in India, and pushed for tolerance and social equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. India is among countries with a social element of a third gender. But mental, physical, emotional and economic violence against LGBT community in India prevails. Lacking support from family, society or police, many gay rape victims don't report the crimes.|$|E

In January 1926 the Chief of Staff, General Debeney, proposed to the Conseil a [...] "totally new kind of army. Only 20 infantry divisions would be maintained on a standing basis". Reserves could be called up when needed. The Conseil had no option in the straitened circumstances but to agree. Pétain, of course, disapproved of the whole thing, pointing out that North Africa still had to be defended and in itself required a substantial standing army. But he recognised, after the new Army <b>Organisation</b> <b>Law</b> of 1927, that the tide was flowing against him.

40|$|Business and {{commerce}} form the twin engine that propels {{the economy of}} a modern nation. They ensure steady economic growth and development. In an age of globalisation, they assume even greater importance {{than at any time}} in human history. A nation risks being marginalised or left behind in the race for a share of the world economic market unless it ensures the stability of its business and commercial sector. Trade regulation, good governance and democratic institutions go hand in hand in guaranteeing political and social equilibrium. Thus, laws designed to facilitate trade {{and commerce}} are a vital component of the political and social equation. In a developing economy such as that of Papua New Guinea, the place of commercial and business law cannot be underrated. This text, Commercial and Business <b>Organisations</b> <b>Law</b> in Papua New Guinea, is therefore a timely and apposite treatise in Papua New Guinea's economic environment, given the nation's vast and mostly untapped natural resources and therefore its potential for participation in the global market. The book covers business <b>organisations</b> <b>law</b> and various aspects of commercial law in Papua New Guinea. This is a valuable book for law students, legal practitioners, accountants and business executives, not only within Papua New Guinea but also in Australia and throughout the South Pacific...|$|R

It contains accessible contributions about opportunities and threats of big data. The authors have put special emphasize on big data institutions.

40|$|This {{document}} represents {{business model}} overview for PETRA. The business model {{is an integral}} part of the governance handbook, (D 7. 3), but is also listed as a separate deliverable. For all details, please refer to deliverable 7. 3. Here an abbreviated version is presented. The model uses a business model canvas to look at the main revenue and costs streams, risks and assumptions. The business model is based on information that was gathered from the demonstrators and literature. On the revenue side of the business model, the context and policies in place very much drive the expected revenues. Rather than providing an expected outcome, the model proposed existing and well developed approaches to estimate possible revenues, given a specific context.

40|$|With a {{sizeable}} expected growth {{of demand for}} rail transport in the Netherlands the coming decades, and limited resources for expansion of the rail network, intensified utilization of the infrastructure is to be expected. To adequately manage this growth a ppropriate tools for policy analysis are needed. Because of the unstructuredness of many problems in the rail sector and decision-making in a network type environment additional scrutiny is placed on these tools. By performing a modelling study into the interrelations of modal split, mobility and operations using System Dynamics, the possibilities and pitfalls of using this method for policy analysis in Dutch rail system have been explored. Although classical policy analysis {{has proven to be}} possible, modelling the operational part of the system has proven challenging. Alternative usages of System Dynamics for enhancing policy analysis, by improving understanding about the complex dynamic behaviour of the system are suggested.

40|$|Peer-to-peer {{sharing economy}} {{platforms}} potentially have big effects on values in society. Policymakers {{need to develop}} governance arrangements {{to benefit from the}} positive effects, while simultaneously mitigate the negative effects. This requires having a structured overview of the effects of these platforms on the diversity of values that are involved. Currently no theoretical overview of these effects on values is available. The objective {{of this article is to}} structure the research into the effects of sharing economy platforms. We use a theoretical mapping that was developed by using a Grounded Theory approach. By positioning the literature onto the map, we derived an overview of the extend in which each effected value has been studied so far. Based on this mapping, we propose five research themes into specific effects of peer-to-peer sharing economy platforms: social values, consumer and societal risks, working conditions and labor market dynamics, environmental sustainability and innovation.

40|$|How can {{municipalities}} {{be helped}} in choosing {{their level of}} involvement in a local sustainable energy company? This research investigates how municipalities can be helped in choosing their level of involvement in a local sustainable energy company. It aims to know which different choices municipalities can make in deciding on their involvement in LSECs through an empirical study. This research started from the analysis that many municipalities struggle with the complexity and risks of their involvement in LSECs and the uncertainty of outcomes of these decisions {{on the level of}} municipal involvement. This main research question was answered using 4 different collection methods, a desk research, a set of interviews, participant observation and a full population questionnaire. The theory study shows us that there are four aspects on which decisions have to be made. These four aspects together determine how municipal involvement in a LSEC looks like.

40|$|Complex {{underground}} infrastructure {{construction projects}} tend {{to develop in}} a state of “bounded manageability”. Various types of uncertainties are inherent to these projects and put the project manager in front of serious challenges, risking budget overruns, delays and sometimes even technical failure. Managing such a project is a matter of considering the options to keep ambitions and means in balance, without losing control. In practice this means that project managers, when confronted with these uncertainties in their projects, have to make trade-offs that have strong “double-bind” characteristics. With every advantage come serious downsides. This disables them to make optimal decisions. Moreover, a chosen path pre-defines conditions for later trade-offs that were often not considered explicitly when choosing this path. This research provides a new framework for understanding uncertainty in the management of projects. It maps out the typical manageability dilemmas that evolve in complex underground infrastructure projects and comes with suggestions to improve this manageability.

40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, urban {{infrastructures}} in China have seen an enormous upgrade, and due to large-scale urbanization many more investments are due in the coming years. In order to supplement public funding, Public Private Partnerships (PPP) and municipal bonds have recently grown popular in China. The introduction of this new policy does not occur in a void but should be understood as the path-dependent consequence of a historical evolution of funding arrangements for urban development. How have Chinese governments traditionally arranged financing for these extensive investments and how has the emphasis in funding sources shifted over time? We argue that the evolution of urban development financing has gone through three phases (planned economy, reform and pilot, and socialist market economy), each with different emphasis in financial sources. Our analysis demonstrates how weaknesses in earlier phases present challenges that new solutions in later phases are aimed to address.

40|$|Thirty {{years of}} {{research}} on validation and verification (V&V) has returned a plethora of methods, statistical techniques, and reported case studies. It is that abundance of methods that poses a major challenge. Because of overlap between methods and time and budget constraints, {{it is impossible to}} apply all the available methods in a single study, so a careful selection of methods has to be made. This paper builds on two assumptions: a) that both simulations and V&V methods can be defined on the basis of different characteristics and b) that certain V&V methods are more suitable than others for different kinds of simulations. The present study aims at identifying the specific characteristics that make a V&V method more effective and more efficient than others, when confronting these with the simulations' different characteristics. The conclusion will advance a methodology for choosing the most appropriate method or methods for validating and/or verifying a simulation.

40|$|While {{cybercrime}} {{has existed}} {{for many years and}} is still reported to be a growing problem, reliable estimates of the economic impacts are rare. We develop a survey instrument tailored to measure the costs of consumer-facing cybercrime systematically, by aggregating different cost factors into direct losses and expenses for protection measures. We use our instrument to collect representative primary data on the prevalence of seven different types of consumer-facing cybercrime in six European countries. Our results show that cybercrime rather causes losses of time than money and that the losses of victims are dwarfed by the expenses for preventive protection. We identify scams to be the worst type of cybercrime in terms of losses. While identity thefts associated with financial accounts cause high initial losses for the victims, most of them receive substantial compensation. We find that loss distributions are skewed to the left, bearing the risk of overestimating costs when looking at figures summarized by the arithmetic mean.
