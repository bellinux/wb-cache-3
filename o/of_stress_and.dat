5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} occurred off {{the coast}} of Nicaragua at 6:16p.m. on September 2. Some damage was also reported in Costa Rica. At least 116 people were killed and several more were injured. The quake was located in an active zone <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> deformation. It created tsunamis disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Stress has {{effects on}} the immune system, {{which may explain why}} some cases {{directly}} correlate with stress. It is often stated that ulceration is exacerbated during examination periods and lessened during periods of vacation. Alternatively, {{it has been suggested that}} oral parafunctional activities such as lip or cheek chewing become more pronounced during periods <b>of</b> <b>stress,</b> <b>and</b> hence the mucosa is subjected to more minor trauma.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 Nicaragua {{earthquake}} was {{the first}} tsunami earthquake to be captured on modern broadband seismic networks. The initial surface wave magnitude was estimated at 7.2. The shock occurred on the subduction interface between the Cocos and Caribbean Plates, an active zone <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> deformation, and due {{to the absence of}} sediment on the ocean floor off Nicaragua, the slip propagated up-dip {{all the way to the}} trench bottom, a creator of large tsunamis. This occurrence of slip of a plate interface filled with soft subducted sediments caused the rupturing process to be slower than the average subduction zone thrust earthquakes while the focus of the earthquake was much shallower than the typical subduction zone earthquake.|$|E

It's numerically analyzed the influence of main pipe's ramification due to modification of mechanical and geometrical parameters. Modeled loads are based on evaluation of internal forces of thin shell and induced loads by circular weld thermal field. The study <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> strain it's made using finite elements method by a static tri dimensional analysis performed both for evaluation <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> strains in presence and absence of internal pressure. The obtained results represent a comparative factor for technical regulation in the safety assessment in operation of natural gas pipelines...|$|R

5|$|In Quenya, the {{stressing}} of a syllable is {{predictable and}} non-phonemic (i.e. {{the meaning of}} a word never changes depending on the stress), but it is partly determined by syllable weight. Words of two syllables are stressed on the first syllable. In words of three or more syllables, the stress is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy, otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable, i.e. the third-to-last syllable. In Quenya, heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel, a diphthong, or a cluster of two consonants (ll, ld, mm, ss, etc.). Certain combinations of consonants, e.g. ny, ry, are also regarded as heavy. Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta (not colloquially in Tarquesta) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable. Quenya has also a secondary accent. The placement <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse.|$|E

40|$|The Rho {{subfamily}} of the Rho small G protein family (Rho) regulates formation <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> fibers <b>and</b> focal adhesions in {{many types}} of cultured cells. In moving cells, dynamic and coordinate disassembly <b>and</b> reassembly <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> fibers <b>and</b> focal adhesions are observed, but the precise mechanisms in the regulation of these processes are poorly understood. We previously showed that 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA) first induced disassembly <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> fibers <b>and</b> focal adhesions followed by their reassembly in MDCK cells. The reassembled stress fibers showed radial-like morphology that was apparently different from the original. We analyzed here the mechanisms of these TPA-induced processes. Rho inactivation and activation were necessary for the TPA-induced disassembly <b>and</b> reassembly, respectively, <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> fibers <b>and</b> focal adhesions. Both inactivation and activation of the Rac subfamily of the Rho family (Rac) inhibited the TPA-induced reassembly <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> fibers <b>and</b> focal adhesions but not their TPA-induced disassembly. Moreover, microinjection or transient expression of Rab GDI, a regulator of all the Rab small G protein family members, inhibited the TPA-induced reassembly <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> fibers <b>and</b> focal adhesions but not their TPA-induced disassembly, indicating that, furthermore, activation of some Rab family members is necessary for their TPA-induced reassembly. Of the Rab family members, at least Rab 5 activation was necessary for the TPA-induced reassembly <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> fibers <b>and</b> focal adhesions. The TPA-induced, small G protein-mediated reorganization <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> fibers <b>and</b> focal adhesions was {{closely related to the}} TPA-induced cell motility. These results indicate that the Rho and Rab family members coordinately regulate the TPA-induced reorganization <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> fibers <b>and</b> focal adhesions that may cause cell motility...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The work {{presents}} results <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> strains <b>of</b> three-layer vascular stent (Cr-Ni-Mo – Ta – Cr-Ni-Mo) and one-layer uniform one (Cr-Ni-Mo) used in operative cardiology. Design/methodology/approach: On {{the basis}} of the geometrical model a finite element mesh was generated. The discretization process was realized {{with the use of the}} SOLID 95 element. The set boundary conditionsrepresented the phenomena which occur during balloon expanding. Findings: The numerical analysis of the three-layer stent showed diverse distribution <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> strains in theindividual layers. Minimum stresses in the analyzed range of expansion diameters (d = 2. 25 ÷ 3. 50 mm) were observedin the middle layer made <b>of</b> tantalum. Maximum <b>stresses</b> were observed in the layer made of the stainless steel. Research limitations/implications: Values <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> strains in different stents’ regions caused by applieddisplacements are valuable information for appropriate design of the geometry, hardening of the metallicbiomaterial and forming of physio-chemical properties of surface layer. Originality/value: The obtained results are valuable for selection of surface layer which is mainly responsiblefor ensuring proper hemocompatibility of the stent.

40|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> state <b>and</b> {{plastic anisotropy}} on the fracture behaviour of a rolled AA 7075 -T 651 aluminium plate under quasi-static loading conditions is studied both experimentally and numerically. Material tests {{in different directions}} of the plate were carried out using specimens with various shapes to provide a wide range <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> states. The strain to failure and the failure modes were found to vary strongly with the stress state, {{but also with the}} loading direction due to the complex microstructure of the alloy. Finite element simulations adopting an anisotropic plasticity model were used to obtain local values <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>and</b> strains and to define the strains at fracture for the various stress states. The numerical simulations show that due to the heterogeneous <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> strain fields in the specimens, {{it is very difficult to}} accurately locate the point where fracture initiates and thus to determine the local fracture strain as a function <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> state <b>and</b> loading direction...|$|R
