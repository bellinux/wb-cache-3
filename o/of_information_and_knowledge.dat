Moreover, the rate of growth <b>of</b> the <b>information,</b> <b>knowledge,</b> <b>and</b> skills needed by agriculture students is so rapid that many students risk becoming agriculturally obsolete unless they continually learn and update themselves.

As such, {{information and communication technologies}} can play an essential role in the sharing of knowledge and expertise in the service of sustainable development and in a spirit of solidarity. And yet, for many observers, the world is witnessing rising levels of ethnic, cultural and religious intolerance, often using the same communication technologies for ideological and political mobilization to promote exclusivist worldviews. This mobilization often leads to further criminal and political violence and to armed conflict. This also leads to new modes of intolerance such as cyberbullying.|$|E

2500|$|Since gender, age, racial, income, and {{educational}} {{gaps in the}} digital divide have narrowed compared to past levels, some researchers suggest that the digital divide is shifting from a gap in access and connectivity to ICTs to a Knowledge divide. A knowledge divide concerning technology presents {{the possibility that the}} gap has moved beyond access and having the resources to connect to ICTs, to interpreting and understanding information presented once connected. Generations of youth within the 8 to 18 age range called 'Generation M' have grown up alongside the exponential growth of the Internet and personal computer and because of this, in many situations, 'Generation M' has surpassed the technological knowhow of their parents and teachers simply because of their extended experience with technology, which usually started in early stages of life. [...] From their foundational experiences 'Generation M' has developed innovative ideas and products based on these continually improving electronic resources and tools which have helped augment the span and quality <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>and</b> <b>knowledge</b> transmission. Thus the digital divide in the United States is no longer just a matter of lack of access as mentioned previously but a sort of race where the generations that created computers and the Internet must now keep up with the improving skill level of 'Generation M'. The exponential development of ICT has also developed situations where there is a great disparity in ICT skill levels among people of the same generation due to the differences in internet connection speeds in addition to differing levels of access and availability which can dictate the type and overall amount of media and information people are able to consume.|$|E
