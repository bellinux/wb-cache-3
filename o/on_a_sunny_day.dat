5|$|While {{the root}} of the parsnip is edible, {{handling}} the shoots and leaves of the plant requires caution as the sap is toxic. Like many other members of the family Apiaceae, the parsnip contains furanocoumarins as a defense against herbivory, photosensitive chemicals that causes a condition known as phytophotodermatitis. The condition is a type of chemical burn rather than an allergic reaction, and is similar to the rash caused by poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made but these have been small in number compared to {{the number of people who}} grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day</b> when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone to seed. The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate.|$|E

25|$|Spirit-Eater (Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday) — a {{creature}} made by sorceries and a seed item {{belonging to the}} person whose physical form it assumes, being designed to imitate them. It requires a year of House Time to grow from Nothing. It can grow mentally conducive mold on people and can only be destroyed if its seed item is plunged into Nothing. The mold originates from the (fictional) planet called Avraxyn; its mutant form, present in Spirit-Eaters, is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact between and only between the Spirit-Eater and natural beings, wherein after it communicates knowledge of its model to the former. A Spirit-Eater's true form varies and can only be seen through a veil of raindrops <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day.</b> At all other times, it resembles its model. Its technical name is 'Cocigrue', which it shares with a legendary monster called Cocquigrue or Coquecigrue.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} {{exposure time}} {{depended on the}} lighting conditions, {{the sensitivity of the}} photographic plate, and the camera lens aperture used. In a letter to Leo Tolstoy requesting a portrait sitting, Prokudin-Gorsky described the exposure as taking one to three seconds, but later, when recollecting his time with Tolstoy, he described a six-second exposure <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day.</b> Blaise Agüera y Arcas studied one landscape view, photographed in broad daylight but showing a clear, well-defined moon, and used the moon's movement to estimate that the whole procedure of three filtered exposures and two repositionings of the camera's plate holder had taken over a minute. The lens aperture Prokudin-Gorsky chose to use greatly affected the exposure time required. A small aperture is often used for landscape photography because it allows objects at various distances to all be sharply imaged at the same time, while the use of a large aperture is common for portraiture and plainly evident in the Tolstoy portrait. All other factors being equal, if for example a 16-second exposure was required when using a 1/4-inch-diameter aperture, an exposure of only 1 second would suffice with a 1-inch aperture.|$|E

2500|$|... 1) Concentrating sunlight: A {{mirrored}} {{surface with}} high specular reflectivity {{is used to}} concentrate light from the sun on to a small cooking area. Depending on the geometry of the surface, sunlight can be concentrated by several orders of magnitude producing temperatures high enough to melt salt and smelt metal. For most household solar cooking applications, such high temperatures are not really required. Solar cooking products, thus, are typically designed to achieve temperatures of 150°F (65°C) (baking temperatures) to 750°F (400°C) (grilling/searing temperatures) <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} the use of f-numbers in {{photography}} is the sunny 16 rule: an approximately correct exposure will be obtained <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day</b> by using an aperture of 16 and the shutter speed closest to the reciprocal of the ISO speed of the film; for example, using ISO 200 film, an aperture of 16 and a shutter speed of 1/200 second. The f-number may then be adjusted downwards for situations with lower light. Selecting a lower f-number is [...] "opening up" [...] the lens. Selecting a higher f-number is [...] "closing" [...] or [...] "stopping down" [...] the lens.|$|E

2500|$|In Cairo Maclean dined with Alexander Cadogan, his FO superior, and {{the next}} day {{reported}} to Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary. [...] He stated his conclusions straightforwardly: that the Partisans were important militarily and politically and would influence the future of Yugoslavia whether the Allies helped them or not; their impact on the Germans could be greatly increased by Allied support; they were Communist and oriented towards the USSR. He says that his report created [...] "something of a stir". [...] He was sent back to collect two Yugoslav liasison officers who had not been allowed to come out with him on the first Navy pick-up. [...] From Bari on the Italian Adriatic coast, now a centre of operations for the Tactical Air Force, he saw that this would prove difficult, as the German offensive had captured the whole Dalmatian coast. Fortunately, he had asked Air Marshal Sholto Douglas to assign him a liaison officer, and Wing Commander John Selby proved a godsend. [...] Together they obtained the use of a Baltimore bomber and an escort of Lightnings. Twice they set out from Italy <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day</b> and twice the clouds blocked them from the Bosnian hills. On the third day the fighters were unavailable so the bomber set out alone, but again the weather made it impossible to land. [...] On their return to Italy, they received a signal that the Partisans had captured a small German plane that they proposed to use. [...] As they were loading up the plane, an enemy aircraft, alerted by a traitor, bombed the landing strip at Glamoc, killing Whetherly, Knight, and Ribar, and wounding Milojevic. This event, at the end of November, proved a spur to getting the mission higher priority, and soon Maclean got a large Dakota and half a squadron of Lightnings to complete the landing operation. [...] Milojevic and Velebit accompanied Maclean to Alexandria, where the Yugoslavs decompressed for a few days, while Maclean sought out the prime minister.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next stop}} was in Sydney {{to play the}} champions New South Wales. Ian Craig was captain of Australia as well as New South Wales, which had won the Sheffield Shield 8 times since the war, the last 4 in succession, and {{would go on to}} win another 5. On a wicket known to take spin Jim Laker was unfit to play, as was Peter Loader, Willie Watson, still {{recovering}} from his knee surgery, Fred Trueman had a cold, but volunteered to play and Peter May had recovered sufficiently to captain the team. Craig won the toss and batted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>day</b> on a good wicket. After Sid Carroll was bowled by a Trueman outswinger in the first over Jim Burke made a ponderous 104 and Neil Harvey a somewhat quicker 149 to finish the day on 243/1. Taking the new ball the next day Trueman (2/62) had Harvey caught off a skyer, which brought in Norm O'Neill, who stroked his way to 84 not out. The other batsman went for runs and Lock (4/121) picked up the wickets of Burke, Craig (who looked very unwell) and Brian Booth for ducks and Alan Davidson for 8. Richie Benaud was caught and bowled off a Trevor Bailey long-hop and Craig declared on 391/7 before O'Neill could complete his century. The MCC openers were soon out; Arthur Milton (10) bowled by the huge Gordon Rorke (1/15) and Peter Richardson (21), caught by Harvey off Peter Philpott. Peter May (29) and Tom Graveney (36) saw out the second day, but the next highest scorer was last man Brian Statham with 27 as the New South Wales leg-spinners Richie Benaud (5/48) and Philpott (4/87) worked their way through the order, leaving [...] "Barnacle Bailey" [...] on 14 not out in a total of 177. The improvement of Benaud's bowling since his great tour of South Africa was evident just two weeks before the first Test. Craig enforced the follow on, but the MCC recovered as Richardson (87) and Milton (81) put on 170 for the first wicket, easily their best effort of the tour. Philpott took 5 catches in the match and removed both openers, one off Davidson (2/37) and the other off Benaud (2/84) and the MCC slumped to 217/4. Tom Graveney (59), Roy Swetman (52) and Colin Cowdrey (42 not out) played out the last day and the tourists ended on a comfortable 356/4. Strangely Swetman, using his feet more than the other batsman, played the spinners better than the other batsmen, who were struggling. After the match the MCC announced that John Mortimore would be sent out to reinforce the team as it appeared that the pitches would take spin. He was also an all-rounder who could strengthen the lower order batting and his arrival would allow the team to rest Laker and Lock in the state games.|$|E
