5|$|Eugenides {{and several}} critics {{compared}} Cal's condition to mythical creatures {{described by the}} ancient Greeks. The author alluded his protagonist's nature and heritage to the Minotaur, the half-man and half-bull creature. Cal's father is conceived after his grandparents' attendance of a theatric play entitled The Minotaur. The puzzle of Cal's genetic identity is akin to the creature's labyrinth, and the thread that leads out of the maze is held here by his paternal grandmother, a former silk farmer. Frances Bartkowski, a scholar of English, named Callie in her puberty as a chimera. The mythical monster is an analogy for a complex personality, a mixture of body parts from various animals that each represents a human aspect or characteristic. Similarly, adolescent Callie is an amalgamation of her genes, neither male nor female, neither adult nor child, and yet all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time.|$|E

It spent ten weeks inside the top five – eight <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top. In 2009, the album sold 99,000 copies in the US, making it the sixth best-selling music DVD of the year. As of December 29, 2010 it had sold 162,000 units in the US, and ranked at number fifteen on the DVD year-end chart of 2010. It additionally became the best-selling music video of 2010 in the US.

5|$|In the series, Clark Kent {{attempts}} {{to live the}} life of a normal human being, and struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an on-again, off-again relationship with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In Smallville, Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start of the show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until season two and six, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 season, on 18 July 2008, Evra was charged with four {{separate}} counts of improper conduct by the FA. The charges were related to an incident that occurred during the 2007–08 season when Evra had an altercation with a Chelsea groundsman during a warm-down following a match on 26 April. The defender denied the charges and was supported by several members of the club's staff, who commented that the player was racially abused by the groundsman prior to the confrontation. Evra remained free to play for United up to the date of the hearing despite the charges being made in July 2008. He began the campaign in similar fashion to last season as Manchester United won the Community Shield following the team's 3–0 victory over Portsmouth on penalties. Evra was ever-present in Manchester United's first 22 competitive matches of the season, starting 19 <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> hearing on 5 December, Evra was found guilty of improper conduct, and handed a four-match ban – due to start on 22 December 2008 – and a £15,000 fine.|$|E
5|$|The Kop {{was built}} in 1906 due to the high turnout for matches and was called the Oakfield Road Embankment initially. Its first game was on 1 September 1906 when the home side beat Stoke City 1–0. In 1906 the banked stand {{at one end of}} the ground was {{formally}} renamed the Spion Kop after a hill in KwaZulu-Natal. The hill was the site of the Battle of Spion Kop in the Second Boer War, where over 300 men of the Lancashire Regiment died, many of them from Liverpool. At its peak, the stand could hold 28,000 spectators and was one of the largest single-tier stands in the world. Many stadia in England had stands named after Spion Kop, but Anfield's was the largest <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time; it could hold more supportersc than some entire football grounds.|$|E

5|$|The {{ability of}} the {{existing}} airport infrastructure to meet forecast demand is limited, and government policy published in 2003 supports the development of additional airport capacity by 2030 to address this. The strategy is generally based on making {{the best use of}} existing facilities, although an additional five new runways nationwide are considered to be necessary, three <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> London airports of Stansted, Heathrow and, {{towards the end of the}} timeframe involved, Gatwick. This policy is designed to be a balanced and measured approach to the future of the air transport industry; one that recognises both an economic advantage in providing for growth in demand for air travel and also the need to address the consequent environmental impacts. The strategy has been criticised by the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, by environmentalist and campaign groups, and in research papers, for implementing a predict and provide model that overstates the economic advantages whilst paying insufficient heed to the environmental consequences.|$|E
5|$|Two officers' batmen, William Charles Daniel and James Wilson (no {{relation}} to Allan Wilson), soon became prime suspects, with Daniel arraigned as the senior instigator. They {{were accused of}} accepting the gold from Petchan and Sehuloholu, then keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message. Both men denied all charges. Neither Daniel nor Wilson had been members of the rear guard on 2 December, though either or both could have been there {{at some point during}} the day. No Matabele witness recognised either <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> court in Bulawayo, where the case was heard by the Resident Magistrate and four assessors.|$|E
5|$|Late that day, {{mountain}} pioneers destroyed some isolated Yugoslav bunkers in {{the area}} penetrated by Kampfgruppe Palten, and German aircraft again attacked the 7th Army's air reconnaissance assets {{on the ground at}} Cerklje, destroying most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> second attempt. This was followed by Italian air attacks on 7th Army troop concentrations. The VVKJ was unable to interdict the Axis air attacks because their fighters were based too far away. After having been grounded {{for most of the day}} by poor weather, in the afternoon, Yugoslav bombers flew missions against airfields and railway stations across the Reich frontier. By the close of 6 April, the 7th Army was still largely mobilising and concentrating, and fifth column actions meant that nearly all the fighting was conducted by border troops. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska was deployed along the southern bank of the Drava around Ptuj and Maribor, and a reinforced infantry regiment was approaching Dravograd from the west. German and Italian air attacks interfered with the deployment of troops and command was hampered by reliance on civilian telegraph and telephone services. LI Infantry Corps had occupied Gornja Radgona, Murska Sobota and Radenci, and had crossed the Drava near Sveti Duh. XLIX Mountain Corps captured border crossings on the approaches to Dravograd, but were held up by border troops in mountain passes located further west.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' seats to fracture where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E
