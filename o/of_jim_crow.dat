5|$|In Nashville, {{like most}} Southern cities, African Americans were {{severely}} disadvantaged under the system <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> segregation.

5|$|Newspapers {{in major}} {{international}} cities and Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and socialist publications reported outrage about the verdict and strong criticism of American society. Southern newspapers, particularly in Mississippi, {{wrote that the}} court system had done its job.

5|$|Reconstruction and rioting, {{coupled with}} the {{implementation}} <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws in Louisiana led most of the Turpeau family to leave the area and become professionals in the north. David DeWitt became a well-known preacher {{and a member of}} the Ohio House of Representatives and his daughter, Leontine T. Kelly born in Washington, D.C. was the first black woman bishop of the United Methodist Church. George remained in Louisiana, living in Lake Charles, which was very near Jennings, the destination of several of Turpeau's future trips from Nicaragua.|$|E

5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained many {{participants}} in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools. In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws had been achieved. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Although St. Louis {{enforced}} {{a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws, the area generally {{had a lower}} level of racial violence and fewer lynchings than the American South. The St. Louis black community was stable and relatively concentrated along the riverfront or near the railroad yards. Although informal discrimination had existed in the St. Louis housing market {{since the end of the}} Civil War, only in 1916 did St. Louis pass a residential segregation ordinance. The ordinance quickly was invalidated by court injunctions, but private restrictive covenants in St. Louis real estate transactions limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks and were another form of racial discrimination. In 1948 the U.S. Supreme Court overturned such real estate limitations as unconstitutional in Shelley v. Kraemer, a court case based on the sale of a St. Louis house (the Shelley House) to a black family.|$|E
5|$|The Negro Motorist Green Book (at times styled The Negro Motorist Green-Book or titled The Negro Travelers' Green Book) was {{an annual}} guidebook for African-American roadtrippers, {{commonly}} referred to simply as the Green Book. It was originated and published by New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles {{as soon as they}} could, but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.|$|E

25|$|After the Readjuster Party disappeared, Virginia Democrats rapidly passed {{legislation}} and constitutional amendments that effectively disfranchised African Americans and many poor whites, {{through the use}} of poll taxes and literacy tests. They created white, one-party rule under the Democratic Party for the next 80 years. White state legislators passed statutes that restored white supremacy through imposition <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> segregation. In 1902 Virginia passed a new constitution that reduced voter registration.|$|E
25|$|Though racism {{among the}} {{residents}} of Ybor City was not generally an issue, it was situated in the American Deep South in the era <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow,</b> so its organizations had to follow the segregationist laws of Tampa. Ybor's Cuban immigrants were often racially mixed, and skin tones within families might cover a range of human colorations. Local law, however, required that darker-skinned and lighter-skinned people not socialize publicly.|$|E
25|$|Lillian Eugenia Smith (December 12, 1897 – September 28, 1966) was {{a writer}} and social critic of the Southern United States, known most {{prominently}} for her best-selling novel Strange Fruit (1944). A white woman who openly embraced controversial positions on matters of race and gender equality, she was a southern liberal unafraid to criticize segregation and work toward the dismantling <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws, {{at a time when}} such actions virtually guaranteed social ostracism.|$|E

25|$|Rustin {{was also}} {{a pioneer in the}} {{movement}} to desegregate interstate bus travel. In 1942, he boarded a bus in Louisville, bound for Nashville, and sat in the second row. A number of drivers asked him to move to the back, according to Southern practice <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow,</b> but Rustin refused. The bus was stopped by police 13 miles north of Nashville and Rustin was arrested. He was beaten and taken to the police station, but was released uncharged.|$|E
25|$|John Tyler Morgan (June 20, 1824 – June 11, 1907) was {{a general}} in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, a six-term U.S. senator {{from the state of}} Alabama after the war. An ardent racist and ex-slave holder, he was a proponent <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws, states rights and racial {{segregation}} through the Reconstruction era. He was an expansionist, arguing for the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii against the native population's will and for U.S. construction of an inter-oceanic canal in Central America.|$|E
25|$|In 1892 {{the first}} Mississippi River bridge at Memphis opened. As a result, the city began to prosper again, and it regained its charter and home rule in 1893. African Americans {{in the city}} were closed out of many {{opportunities}} by the segregated school system, in which their facilities were underfunded, and disenfranchisement by state laws passed in the late 1880s, which resulted in their exclusion from voting and other participation in the political system. State law and local custom imposed a system <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> based on white supremacy, and in the late 1890s the police force was closed against blacks.|$|E

25|$|The loss of {{political}} influence {{contributed to the}} difficulties of African Americans {{in their attempts to}} obtain extended credit in the late 19th century. Together with imposition <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> and racial segregation laws, whites committed an increased rate of lynchings of blacks, mostly men, beginning in the 1890s and extending to 1930. Cotton crops failed due to boll weevil infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913, creating crisis conditions for many African Americans. With control of the ballot box and more access to credit, white planters bought out such farmers, expanding their ownership of Delta bottomlands. They also took advantage of new railroads sponsored by the state.|$|E
25|$|African Americans {{emerged from}} the Civil War with the {{political}} experience and stature to resist attacks, but disfranchisement and imposition <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> in the South {{at the turn of}} the 20th century closed them out of the political system and judicial system in many ways. Advocacy organizations compiled statistics and publicized the atrocities, as well as working for enforcement of civil rights and a federal anti-lynching law. From the early 1880s, the Chicago Tribune reprinted accounts of lynchings from other newspapers, and published annual statistics. These provided the main source for the compilations by the Tuskegee Institute to document lynchings, a practice it continued until 1968.|$|E
25|$|More than 85 {{percent of}} the {{estimated}} 5,000 lynchings in the post-Civil War period occurred in the Southern states. With economic strains across the Deep South and a low price for cotton, 1892 was a peak year when 161 African Americans were lynched. The passage <b>of</b> <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> laws, beginning in the 1890s, completed the revival of white supremacy in the South. Terror and lynching {{were believed to be}} used to enforce both these formal laws and a variety of unwritten rules of conduct meant to assert white domination. In most years from 1889 to 1923, 50 to 100 lynchings occurred annually across the South. They were at a peak in {{the last decade of the}} 19th century, but remained high for years.|$|E

The crow would run all around, as far as the string would let him go; but he couldn't get away. And when they went out of doors Twinkle held the end of the cord in her hand, as one leads a dog, and <b>Jim</b> <b>Crow</b> would run along in front of her, and then stop and wait. And when she came near he'd run on again, screaming [...] "Caw! Caw!" [...] at the top of his shrill little voice.|$|R
