6000|$|It was Kauffman who {{answered}} this question, speaking with apparent good humor {{but with a}} tinge of sarcasm in his voice: [...] "My dear young lady, your own disposition to secrecy--a quality quite necessary in a detective--should show you the absurdity <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>question.</b> Can we be too careful {{in these days of}} espionage? No emissary of the Kaiser must know the construction of this wonderful projectile; none should even know that it exists. Even should our government refuse to adopt it; we must not let the Central Powers know of it. My own negotiations with Mr. Colton and Mrs. Charleworth have been camouflaged by my disguise as a suspender merchant. It was equally important that Mr. Dyer's connection with us be wholly unsuspected. When the projectile is adopted, and these works are manufacturing it in quantities to help win the war, still no information concerning it must be made public. You must realize that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{went before}} {{and what will}} follow me, I regard as two black impenetrable curtains, which hang down at the two {{extremities}} of human life, and which no living man has yet drawn aside. Many hundreds of generations have already stood before them with their torches, guessing anxiously what lies behind. On the curtain of Futurity, many see their own shadows, the forms of their passions enlarged and put in motion; they shrink in terror at this image of themselves. Poets, philosophers, and founders of states, have painted this curtain with their dreams, more smiling or more dark, as the sky above them was cheerful or gloomy; and their pictures deceive the eye when viewed from a distance. Many jugglers too make profit of this our universal curiosity: by their strange mummeries, they have set the outstretched fancy in amazement. A deep silence reigns behind this curtain; no one once within it will answer those he has left without; all you can hear is a hollow echo <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>question,</b> as if you shouted into a chasm. To {{the other side of}} this curtain we are all bound: men grasp hold of it as they pass, trembling, uncertain who may stand within it to receive them, quid sit id quod tantum morituri vident. Some unbelieving people there have been, who have asserted that this curtain did but make a mockery of men, and that nothing could be seen because nothing was behind it: but to convince these people, the rest have seized them, and hastily pushed them in.'[11] ...|$|E
60|$|Unfortunately the British Parliament does not, at present, {{quite know}} that all manner of things and {{relations}} of things, spiritual equally with material, all manner of qualities, entities, existences whatsoever, in this strange visible and invisible Universe, are equally inflexible of nature; that, they will, one and all, with precisely the same obstinacy, continue to obey their own law, not our law; deaf as the adder to all charm of parliamentary eloquence, and of voting never so often repeated; silently, but inflexibly and forevermore, declining to change themselves, even as sulphuric acid declines to become sweet milk, though you vote so {{to the end of}} the world. This, it sometimes seems to me, is not quite sufficiently laid hold of by the British and other Parliaments just at present. Which surely is a great misfortune to said Parliaments! For, it would appear, the grand point, after all constitutional improvements, and such wagging of wigs in Westminster as there has been, is precisely what it was before any constitution was yet heard of, or the first official wig had budded out of nothing: namely, to ascertain what the truth <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>question,</b> in Nature, really is! Verily so. In this time and place, as in all past and in all future times and places. To-day in St. Stephen's, where constitutional, philanthropical, and other great things lie in the mortar-kit; even as on the Plain of Shinar long ago, where a certain Tower, likewise of a very philanthropic nature, indeed one of the desirablest towers I ever heard of, was to be built,--but couldn't! My friends, I do not laugh; truly I am more inclined to weep.|$|E

40|$|In his {{encounter}} with the youth during his January 18, 2015 visit in the Philippines, Pope Francis was reduced to silence when Glyzelle Palomar, a street child, tearfully asked him: “Why do children suffer so much {{even if it is}} through no fault of their own?” The Pope digressed from his prepared speech and instead spontaneously responded that “the heart <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> has no reply. Only when we too can cry about the things you said can we come close to answering that question. Why do children suffer so much? Why do children suffer? When the heart is able to ask itself and weep, then we can understand something. ” This papal challenge on the ability or maybe the need to cry echoes what Walter Brueggemann calls as “the costly loss of lament”. When taken seriously, the challenges that lament poses on biblical interpretation and application confront the "selectiveness" that has characterized the praying of the psalms. Paul VI, for example, noted in the fourth principle of the Liturgy of the Hours in the Apostolic Constitution Promulgation that “[I]n this new arrangement of the psalms some few of the psalms or verses which are somewhat harsh in tone have been omitted, especially because of the difficulties that were foreseen from their use in vernacular celebration. ” (1976 edition; p. 15) Walter Brueggemann critiques this tendency and scrutinizes the importance of verbalizing the raw feelings expressed in these psalms and compared it with what he calls as “seasons of life”: orientation, disorientation, and new orientation. This short presentation will first expound on these categories of Brueggemann and focus on two of the most disturbing laments in the psalms (88 and 109). It will also enumerate the “costs” {{of not being able to}} authentically and honestly lament. Finally, it will offer an alternative image of God in the Psalms with the hope of helping believers articulate their struggles, affirm their strength, and be agents of change as they face the world through what Pope Francis calls “eyes cleansed by tears”. status: publishe...|$|E
