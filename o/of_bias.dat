5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims <b>of</b> <b>bias</b> {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier and that it could have shaken public confidence on the fairness of the hearing.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Sinclair {{broke the}} record of most goals scored in the Olympics for women's soccer, {{claiming}} the golden boot of the competition from two goals against South Africa, one against Great Britain, and three against the United States. She scored a hat-trick in a 4–3 extra time loss in the semifinal match against the American squad. Canada was unhappy {{with the performance of}} referee Christina Pedersen, who made a series of controversial decisions in favour of the Americans. Sinclair was ultimately fined a reported $3,500 and banned four matches for post match comments, which accused Pedersen <b>of</b> <b>bias</b> and deciding the result of the match before it had kicked off.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{the latest}} {{aggregated}} {{research has found}} {{no difference in the}} prevalence of self-harm between men and women. This is in contrast to past research which indicated that up to four times as many females as males have direct experience of self-harm. However, caution is needed in seeing self-harm as a greater problem for females, since males may engage in different forms of self-harm (e.g., hitting themselves) which could be easier to hide or explained as the result of different circumstances. Hence, there remain widely opposing views as to whether the gender paradox is a real phenomenon, or merely the artifact <b>of</b> <b>bias</b> in data collection.|$|E

Using stylized examples of time inconsistency, regret, and overconfidence, this paper illustrates possible interactions among them. As is generally true in second-best environments, the existence <b>of</b> <b>biases</b> does not imply the possibility of welfare improvements from correcting them. If only some biases are known, even correction <b>of</b> all known <b>biases</b> has ambiguous effects. With costly correction, the presence <b>of</b> some <b>biases</b> may be optimal. Further, if the correct decision is unknown, then the presence <b>of</b> <b>biases</b> {{does not imply that}} mistakes are made. ...|$|R
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave an appearance of a real likelihood <b>of</b> <b>bias.</b> On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
5|$|Kulesza {{left his}} job soon afterwards; {{according}} to Majchrzak, he resigned in protest at the players' punishments, which he thought were too harsh. Officials at Widzew Łódź accused the PZPN <b>of</b> <b>bias,</b> saying the association had not supervised the players properly and should shoulder {{some of the}} blame. Directors at Widzew and ŁKS Łódź briefly considered resigning their PZPN memberships and organising their own league championship, but did not. The national team players' council, at that time comprising Marek Dziuba, Paweł Janas and Wojciech Rudy, wrote an open letter expressing surprise at {{what they saw as}} excessive sanctions against Terlecki, Boniek, Żmuda and Młynarczyk. They admitted the goalkeeper's conduct had been far from exemplary, but contended that the incident was only minor, and had been exacerbated by disproportionately prominent and negative press coverage.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial at}} the upper {{regional}} court in Dresden began on 26 October 2009. It took place under strict security precautions due to alleged death threats to Wiens. All concurrent trials were transferred to other local venues, due to the security concerns, the great interest by the national and international media, and the public. El-Sherbini's widower, brother and parents acted {{in the role of}} 'co-claimant' and were represented by eight lawyers. On {{the first day of the}} trial, the entire prosecution counsel constituted of eight lawyers from Germany, France and Egypt was present in court; the defendant arrived in court shrouded behind a mask, sunglasses, hat and a hood. The judge asked the defendant to remove his head attire and to confirm his name and date of birth. The defendant complied, except for removing his sunglasses, for which he was fined for contempt of court. The defence counsel motioned for the judges to be removed from the trial on the grounds <b>of</b> <b>bias</b> as they were colleagues of witnesses and worked near the crime scene. This was denied by a separate panel that had ruled on this motion.|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} work, the author {{observed}} that Boolean inverse semi-groups, with semigroup homomorphisms preserving finite orthogonal joins, form a congruence-permutable variety <b>of</b> algebras, called <b>biases.</b> We give a full description <b>of</b> varieties <b>of</b> <b>biases</b> in terms <b>of</b> varieties of groups: (1) Every free bias is residually finite. In particular, the word problem for free biases is decidable. (2) Every proper variety <b>of</b> <b>biases</b> contains a largest finite symmetric inverse semigroup, {{and it is}} generated by its members that are generalized rook matrices over groups with zero.

Antoine de Saint-Exupery, “Fortress” Three studies showed that the group of {{observers}} accurately recognized biases in other people’s behaviors while the group of actors was unable to detect the same biases in their own behaviors.

25|$|Thus, in general, the {{commonly}} perceived {{differences between the}} two tests relate to the stringency and the perspective of the inquiry the court takes when applying each test. The reasonable suspicion test is usually considered to be of a less stringent standard as compared to the real likelihood <b>of</b> <b>bias</b> test. The reasonable suspicion test is also thought to be applied {{from the perspective of the}} public (or in the eyes of a reasonable man), while the real likelihood <b>of</b> <b>bias</b> test is applied from the court's perspective.|$|E

25|$|The {{view has}} been taken by {{scholars}} {{that there is no}} practical difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In a 2008 paper, Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan concede that there is a slight difference in the meaning of the terms real likelihood and reasonable suspicion, but are of the view that this difference is hardly material. The gap between the two tests is considerably narrow and, in practice, the two tests are unlikely to yield different results in most cases. It was stated in Cook International Inc. v. B.V. Handelmaatschappij Jean Delvaux (1985) that the contrast between the tests was between reasonable suspicion <b>of</b> <b>bias</b> on the one hand, and the appearance of a real likelihood <b>of</b> <b>bias</b> on the other. Hence what must be established is the appearance of a real possibility <b>of</b> <b>bias</b> and this is not very different from establishing that a fair-minded member of the public could have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant was not possible.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{illustrating}} the virtues and vices <b>of</b> <b>biased</b> rationality.

In {{the last part of the}} paper we will illustrate our main contention according to which debising rationality is made possible when human learning becomes an option ecologically supported by the accumulation of knowledge in the human cognitive niche. In order to provide ground to this idea, we will employ the lens model introduced by Egon Brunswik...|$|R

However, the identification of true positives in the second stage was useful only when the magnitude <b>of</b> the <b>bias</b> was not small and the number <b>of</b> <b>biased</b> items was large (20 % or 40 % of the test).
