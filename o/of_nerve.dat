5|$|The {{central nervous}} system {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The {{central nervous system}} is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E

5|$|A {{commonly}} cited quote by Ralph Nader {{states that}} {{a pound of}} plutonium dust spread into the atmosphere {{would be enough to}} kill 8 billion people.

Nader's views were challenged in 1976 by Bernard Cohen, as described in the book Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology.

5|$|As {{is typical}} for such small animals, {{there are no}} {{respiratory}} or circulatory organs. The nervous system is relatively simple. The brain consists of two ganglia, one {{on either side of}} the pharynx, connected by a commissure. From these lead a pair <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> cords which run along either side of the body beside the longitudinal muscle bands. The primary sensory organs are the bristles and ciliated tufts of the body surface which function as mechanoreceptors. There are also ciliated pits on the head, simple ciliary photoreceptors and fleshy appendages which act as chemoreceptors.|$|E
5|$|Chelicerate nervous {{systems are}} based on the {{standard}} arthropod model of a pair <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> cords, each with a ganglion per segment, and a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia just behind the mouth with those ahead of it. If one assume that chelicerates lose the first segment, which bears antennae in other arthropods, chelicerate brains include only one pair of pre-oral ganglia instead of two. However, there is evidence that the first segment is indeed available and bears the cheliceres.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{demyelinating disease}} {{in which the}} insulating covers <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> cells {{in the brain and}} spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, blindness in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.|$|E

50|$|A {{spinal nerve}} {{is a mixed}} nerve, which carries motor, sensory, and {{autonomic}} signals between the spinal cord and the body.

These are grouped into the corresponding cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral and coccygeal regions of the spine. There are eight pairs <b>of</b> cervical <b>nerves,</b> twelve pairs <b>of</b> thoracic <b>nerves,</b> five pairs <b>of</b> lumbar <b>nerves,</b> five pairs <b>of</b> sacral <b>nerves,</b> and one pair <b>of</b> coccygeal <b>nerves.</b> The spinal <b>nerves</b> are part <b>of</b> the peripheral nervous system.|$|R

Symptoms include ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, retinitis pigmentosa and other forms <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> dysfunction.

5|$|The {{cause is}} unknown. The {{underlying}} mechanism involves an autoimmune disorder {{in which the}} body's immune system mistakenly attacks the peripheral nerves and damages their myelin insulation. Sometimes this immune dysfunction is triggered by an infection or, less commonly, surgery or vaccination. The diagnosis is usually made based on the signs and symptoms, through the exclusion of alternative causes, and supported by tests such as nerve conduction studies and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid. There {{are a number of}} subtypes based on the areas of weakness, results <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> conduction studies, and the presence of certain antibodies. It is classified as an acute polyneuropathy.|$|E
5|$|The {{nervous system}} of an insect {{can be divided}} into a brain and a ventral nerve cord. The head capsule is made up of six fused segments, each with either a pair of ganglia, or a cluster <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> cells outside of the brain.

5|$|The {{three main}} {{characteristics}} of MS are {{the formation of}} lesions in {{the central nervous system}} (also called plaques), inflammation, and the destruction of myelin sheaths of neurons. These features interact in a complex and not yet fully understood manner to produce the breakdown <b>of</b> <b>nerve</b> tissue and in turn the signs and symptoms of the disease. Additionally, MS is believed to be an immune-mediated disorder that develops from an interaction of the individual's genetics and as yet unidentified environmental causes. Damage is believed to be caused, at least in part, by attack on the nervous system by a person's own immune system.|$|E
