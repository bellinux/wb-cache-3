40|$|The {{variability}} {{and structure}} <b>of</b> surface soil <b>moisture</b> along a hillslope is still poorly understood {{on the northern}} Loess Plateau of China. In this study, a field experiment was conducted on a small-scale hillslope in Liudaogou catchment and aimed to characterize the pattern of upper 15  cm soil moisture. During the experimental period, mean soil moisture on the hillslope was dominated by an antecedent rainfall event. The values <b>of</b> mean <b>moisture</b> were positively proportional to the antecedent precipitation amount and then decreased during the next dry-down period. The variance <b>of</b> surface <b>moisture</b> decreased with increasing mean moisture. The spatial patterns <b>of</b> surface <b>moisture</b> could be separated into four groups by the structures <b>of</b> surface <b>moisture</b> along the hillslope during the experimental period. Rainfall property and soil response to rainfall jointly exerted some control on the spatial patterns <b>of</b> surface <b>moisture.</b> Gradient, soil bulk density, and surface rock fragment content contributed little to the patterns <b>of</b> surface <b>moisture</b> along the hillslope.

However, less {{is known about the}} consequences of global warming-induced decrease <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> on alpine wetland ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. To determine response of natural alpine wetland community to decrease <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture,</b> we did a gradient analysis <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> by sequence space-series variation. We used sequence space-series variation <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> to reflect potential time-series variation <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> in alpine wetland community, by examining the effects of spatial heterogeneity <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> on wetland community, as well as by determining how shifts in above- and below-ground properties of alpine wetland community. We found that vegetation aboveground biomass, cover and height all significantly increased with increase <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture,</b> but species richness was decreased. Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available nitrogen, total phosphorus and available phosphorus all significantly increased with increase <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture,</b> but soil pH value, total potassium and available potassium were significantly decreased. Meanwhile, species richness showed significantly positive correlations to aboveground biomass, covers and height. Aboveground biomass, vegetation covers and height were all significant positively related to soil organic carbon, total N, P, and available N, P, but negatively related to total K. But, species richness were significant negatively related to soil organic carbon, total N, P, and available N, P, but positively related to total K. Our observation indicates that decreasing <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> may potentially negatively impact on the above- and below-ground properties in alpine wetland community...|$|R

40|$|The profile {{characteristics}} and the temporal dynamics <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> variation were studied at 26 locations in Da Nangou catchment (3. 5 km(2)) in the loess area <b>of</b> China. Soil <b>moisture</b> measurements were performed biweekly at five depths {{in the soil}} profile(0 - 5, 10 - 15, 20 - 25, 40 - 45 and 70 - 75 cm) from May to October 1998 using Delta-T theta probe. Soil moisture profile type and temporal variation type {{and their relationship to}} topography and land use were identified by detrended canonical correspondence analysis (DCCA) and correlation analysis. The profile distribution <b>of</b> time-averaged soil <b>moisture</b> content can be classified into three types i. e. decreasing-type, waving-type and increasing-type. The profile features <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> (e. g. profile gradient and profile variability) are influenced by different environmental factors. The profile type <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is only attributed to land use while profile gradient and profile variability <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is mainly related to land use and topography (e. g. landform type and slope). The temporal dynamics <b>of</b> layer-averaged soil <b>moisture</b> content is grouped into three types including three-peak type, synchro-four-peak type and lagged-four-peak type. These types are controlled by topography rather than by land use. The temporal dynamic type <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> shows significant correlation with relative elevation, slope, aspect, while temporal variance displays significant relation with slope shape. The mean soil moisture is related to both the profile and dynamics features <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> and is controlled by both land use and topography (e. g. aspect, position, slope and relative elevation). The spatial variability <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> across landscape varies with both soil depths and temporal evolution. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

First, the characteristics <b>of</b> the soil <b>moisture</b> in the hillslopes with different vegetativecover was compared in qantitative terms. It turned out that diffusivity <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> ina bare-soil land in drying process was larger than that in a forest land.

5|$|The {{alkylation}} {{reaction is}} more widely used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because {{the reaction is}} more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as other}} materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace <b>of</b> <b>moisture</b> is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts reaction is that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E

Analysis <b>of</b> the soil <b>moisture</b> dynamic and {{the relative importance of}} land use and topography for the spatial variability <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> is the basis for guiding ecosystem restoration and agricultural development. We analysed the spatial variability <b>of</b> soil <b>moisture</b> for five land-use types within 44 sample plots (176 sample points) at the five depths (020, 2040, 4060, 6080 and 80100 ?cm) in the Anjiagou catchment of the Loess Plateau from April to September 2002. The depth-averaged soil <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> cropland was the highest among the five land-use types, followed by fallowland, woodland, shrubland and wasteland during high soilwater contents period (from 24 April to 23 June). The time-averaged soil <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> all the five land-use types first decreased with depth during the wet moisture status and then increased with depth during the dry conditions (from 12 July to 9 August). The time-averaged soil <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> fallowland, cropland and shrubland was decreased with depth, but both wasteland and woodland was decreased and then increased with depth in the medium moisture status (from 23 August to 18 September). Land use was the key factor that influenced the spatial variability <b>of</b> the time-averaged <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> the four soil layers (2040, 4060, 6080 and 80100 ?cm) during the wet and medium soilwater content condition. Land use had a weak influence on the spatial variability <b>of</b> the time-averaged <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> all the five soil layers in the dry moisture status. Slope aspect had a significant influence on the time-averaged soil <b>moisture</b> <b>of</b> some soil layers in the wet and medium moisture statuses for wasteland, shrubland, woodland and fallowland.
