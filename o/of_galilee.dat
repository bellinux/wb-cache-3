5|$|In Tibnin, in modern-day Lebanon, and in Safad, Zahir or his son Ali had Crusader-era fortresses rebuilt. Zahir {{fortified}} {{the village}} of Harbaj, although the village and its fort were in ruins by the late 19th century. At Tabgha on the Sea <b>of</b> <b>Galilee,</b> Zahir built five fountains, one of which remained standing by the 19th century. That remaining fountain was the largest {{of its kind in}} Galilee. In {{the village of}} I'billin, Zahir's brother Yusuf built fortifications and a mosque. The I'billin fortress was later used as the headquarters of Aqil Agha, the 19th century semi-autonomous Arab sheikh <b>of</b> <b>Galilee.</b>|$|E

5|$|On Friday, May 14, the Syrian 1st Infantry Brigade, {{commanded}} by Colonel Abdullah Wahab el-Hakim, was in Southern Lebanon, positioned to attack Malkia.

5|$|In John, Mary {{is alone}} at first, but Peter and the beloved disciple {{come and see}} the tomb as well. Jesus then appears to Mary at the tomb.

In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("Doubting Thomas") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance.

5|$|Liman von Sanders {{was forced}} to {{withdraw}} from Nazareth {{in the early morning}} when the 5th Cavalry Division unsuccessfully attacked the town.

If this line, across the two main roads and railway lines to Damascus could be held, time could be gained for the consolidation of the retreating columns into a strong defence of Damascus.|$|E

5|$|Prosperity {{ended in}} 1100 or 1101, when Haifa was besieged and {{blockaded}} by European Christians {{shortly after the}} end of the First Crusade, and then conquered after a fierce battle with its Jewish inhabitants and Fatimid garrison.

Following their victory at the Battle of Hattin, Saladin's Ayyubid army captured Haifa in mid-July 1187 and the city's Crusader fortress was destroyed.

5|$|There {{are various}} climatic areas in Israel and areas it has settled that allow {{a variety of}} {{products}} to be grown.

5|$|This {{development}} {{gave the}} Israeli forces time to organize their defenses at Samakh (Tzemah). During {{the course of}} May 16, Israeli gunboats harassed the Syrian positions on the southeastern Sea <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> shore, trenches were dug, and roadblocks were set up. Meanwhile, Syrian aircraft made bombing runs on Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan, Degania Bet and Afikim. The attack on Samakh (Tzemah) resumed before dawn on May 17—the Syrians attacked the village's northern positions, but their armor stayed behind. The infantry thus could not advance into the concentrated Israeli fire from the village itself, despite severe ammunition shortages on the Israeli side.|$|E
