25|$|As in Schlueter, Carroll here interprets Valentine's {{actions as}} a gift to Proteus, but unlike Schlueter, and more in line with {{traditional}} criticism of the play, Carroll also argues that such a gift, as unacceptable as it is to modern eyes, is perfectly understandable when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> cultural and social milieu of the play itself.|$|E
25|$|This concept may {{be easier}} for the reader to grasp if <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> {{relationship}} of the cube and the hemicube. An ordinary cube has 8 corners, they could be labeled A to H, with A opposite H, B opposite G, and so on. In a hemicube, A and H would be treated as the same corner. So would B and G, and so on. The edge AB would become the same edge as GH, and the face ABEF would become the same face as CDGH. The new shape has only three faces, 6 edges and 4 corners.|$|E

30|$|Indeed, we {{have studied}} the {{influence}} of the cylinder radius on gravity double differences above the cylinder centre in the two mentioned cases, i.e., <b>the</b> first <b>one</b> <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> real injection depth of Soultz-sous-Forêts geothermal plant and <b>the</b> second <b>one</b> <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> cumulated injected volume on the 27 th of July 2016.

25|$|More {{interesting}} is the understanding that the sums over the energies of standing waves should be formally understood as sums over the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian. This allows atomic and molecular effects, such as the van der Waals force, {{to be understood as}} a variation on the theme of the Casimir effect. Thus <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> Hamiltonian of a system {{as a function of the}} arrangement of objects, such as atoms, in configuration space. The change in the zero-point energy as a function of changes of the configuration can be understood to result in forces acting between the objects.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} business {{view of the}} EV1 as {{a failure}} is inherently controversial. If it is viewed {{as an attempt to}} produce a viable EV product, then it was a success, although certainly from GM's perspective the vehicle was not a commercial success, since the high profit margins typically seen with internal combustion engine vehicles remained elusive. However, if <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> vehicle as a technological showpiece—a production electric car that actually could replace a gasoline powered vehicle—then the program's outcome is less definitive. The EV1 was produced for the consumer market, and many lessees found driving an EV1 to be a favorable experience.|$|E
25|$|In the Edo period, sports {{became a}} popular {{way to spend}} time. The only problem {{was that they were}} often {{accompanied}} by gambling. A notice to punish playing and betting on sumo without authorization was repeatedly posted to little effect. Kyūdō was encouraged by shoguns and daimyōs as a pastime, and contests as well as record making attempts were held. On April 26, 1686, a samurai named Wasa Daihachiro competing in the Tōshiya made an unsurpassed record of shooting 13,053 arrows and hitting the mark 8,133 times over a 24-hour period. This is even more remarkable when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> shooting range for this attempt, a 120-meter-long corridor with a ceiling of only 2.2 meters. In the Olympic Games, archers shoot over a distance of only 70 meters. Martial arts like jujutsu were popular but schools avoided inter-school matches, leaving room only for intramural matches.|$|E

25|$|The {{spontaneous}} {{emergence of}} the Gacaca activities and the gradual support for Gacaca by the authorities was clearly motivated {{by the fact that}} the ordinary justice system was virtually non-existent after the genocide. The Gacaca had to do what it did before—relieve the pressure on the ordinary courts. These were now not working slowly, as they did before, but not working at all. Once they started to work, they were quickly overloaded with the cases of genocide suspects who were filling the prisons. This new form of justice was bold, but not unprecedented: This becomes evident when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> emerging numbers of Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (TRC) as, for example, that in South Africa. The slogan of the South African TRC “Revealing is Healing” and its argument that truth-telling serves as a “therapeutic function” underline this assumption. The TRC format was suggested to the Rwandan government, but ultimately they chose to pursue mass justice through Gacaca; a system where their country had roots and familiarity.|$|E
25|$|For {{the rest}} of the 1900s Tyldesley was, despite the {{emergence}} of Hobbs always in the forefront of English professional batting and seldom failed to be {{near the top of the}} batting averages, which he headed in the wet summer of 1910 with an average of 46. Though the 1905 Ashes series was his most successful with two centuries, from the following year Tyldesley gradually dropped out of the representative scene, playing his last Test in 1909. However, in 1906 against that year County Champions, Kent, Tyldesley made his highest score of 295 not out and would certainly have made a triple hundred had he not ran out of partners. With Reggie Spooner rarely available owing to business calls between 1907 and 1910, and Archie MacLaren declining, Lancashire were much too dependent upon Tyldesley to make a respectable score and he played superbly especially when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> fire in Old Trafford pitches in fine weather at that time.|$|E
25|$|Refineries {{examine whether}} {{it makes sense}} {{economically}} to install alkylation units. Alkylation units are complex, with substantial economy of scale. SAAU and HFAU have comparable capital investment costs. It {{is not surprising that}} the two processes are competitive on a capital cost basis, when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> basic process differences. The SAAU has a more expensive reactor section and requires refrigeration. However, equal costs are realized in the HF unit by the need for feed driers, product treating, regeneration equipment and more exotic metallurgy. In addition, most refiners will require a dedicated cooling system for an HF unit, to remove the risk of site-wide corrosion in the case of an HF leak. It should be noted that these capital cost estimates do not account for the additional safety and mitigation equipment now required in HF units. Due to the possible hazardous aerosol formation when the HF catalyst is released as a superheated liquid, expensive mitigation systems are now required in many locations throughout the world where HF is used as an alkylation catalyst.|$|E

50|$|The Rainbow was {{followed}} by a sequel in 1920, Women in Love. Although Lawrence conceived of the two novels as <b>one,</b> <b>considering</b> <b>the</b> titles The Sisters and The Wedding Ring for the work, they were published as two separate novels at the urging of his publisher. However, after the negative public reception of The Rainbow, Lawrence's publisher opted out of publishing the sequel.|$|R
25|$|For {{positive}} integers, this proof can be geometrized: if <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> quantity x'n as {{the volume}} of the n-cube (the hypercube in n dimensions), then the derivative is the change in the volume as the side length is changed – this is x'n1, which can be interpreted as the area of n faces, each of dimension n1 (fixing one vertex at the origin, these are the n faces not touching the vertex), corresponding to the cube increasing in size by growing in the direction of these faces – in the 3-dimensional case, adding 3 infinitesimally thin squares, one to each of these faces. Conversely, geometrizing the fundamental theorem of calculus, stacking up these infinitesimal (n1) cubes yields a (hyper)-pyramid, and n of these pyramids form the n-cube, which yields the formula. Further, there is an n-fold cyclic symmetry of the n-cube around the diagonal cycling these pyramids (for which a pyramid is a fundamental domain). In the case of the cube (3-cube), this is how {{the volume of}} a pyramid was originally rigorously established: the cube has 3-fold symmetry, with fundamental domain a pyramids, dividing the cube into 3 pyramids, corresponding {{to the fact that the}} volume of a pyramid is one third of the base times the height. This illustrates geometrically the equivalence between the quadrature of the parabola and the volume of a pyramid, which were computed classically by different means.|$|E
500|$|Sperner's lemma {{is a more}} {{advanced}} application of the same strategy. The lemma states that {{a certain kind of}} coloring on a triangulation of a simplex has a subsimplex that contains every color. Rather than directly construct such a subsimplex, it is more convenient to prove that there exists an odd number of such subsimplices through an induction argument. A stronger statement of the lemma then explains why this number is odd: it naturally breaks down as [...] when <b>one</b> <b>considers</b> <b>the</b> two possible orientations of a simplex.|$|E
