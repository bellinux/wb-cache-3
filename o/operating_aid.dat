40|$|National Center for Education Statistics, 117, 108 {{school districts}} {{provided}} {{elementary and secondary}} education in 1939 - 40. By 2006 - 07, the number of districts had dropped to 13, 862, a decline of 88 percent. The rate of consolidation has slowed in recent years, but at least a few districts continue to consolidate every year in many states. Most state governments have policies that influence school district consolidation. The most common form of policy is a state aid program designed to encourage district reorganization, typically in the form of consolidation, by providing additional money for operations or capital projects during the transition to the new form of organization. The aid bonus from consolidation can be quite large. In New York, consolidating districts may receive an increase in their basic <b>operating</b> <b>aid</b> of up to 40 percent for five years, with declining increases for an additional nine years. On top of this aid, consolidating districts also may receive a 30 percent increase in building aid for projects initiated within 10 years of consolidation. In many cases, however, state aid policies concerning consolidation are contradictory. In fact, {{about a third of the}} states, including some that offer consolidation bonuses, use <b>operating</b> <b>aid</b> formulas that compensate school districts for sparsity (i. e. low population density) or for small scale and thereby discourage consolidation, according to Yao Huang, a contributor to Helping Children Left Behind: State Aid and the Pursuit of Educational Equity.

This article focuses on the Draft Guidelines’ statements on “start-up aid,” which seek to integrate the Commission’s statements in last year’s Charleroi decision into a consistent state aid policy framework. It is submitted here that such an attempt is highly problematic, given {{the absence of a}} coherent and objective justification for start-up aid in its proposed form. The Commission should not depart from its long-standing hostility to <b>operating</b> <b>aid</b> for reasons of perceived political expediency. At the very least, the Commission should limit the distortive effects of such aid to the greatest possible extent, in particular by limiting it to routes to and from truly regional airports...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA lot {{of cases}} had arouse {{in the past decade}} about {{agreements}} between regional airports and low-cost carriers. These agreements are challenged {{on the basis of the}} State Aids European control as they rise concerns not only about competition distortions between airlines but also about fiscal competition risks among Member States or local governments. Such phenomena could be expected as regional airports are characterized by significant overcapacities and overlapping inducing a substitutability for airlines. Surprisingly, the new 2014 guidelines on State Aids granted to airlines open the way to transitory <b>operating</b> <b>aid</b> schemes, an option apparently at odds with the European longstanding principles. Our purpose in this paper is to demonstrate with the help of the development of a model, that such agreements can make sense from the economic point of view provided that the relationship between the carrier and the airport is no longer analyzed as a vertical chain, inducing an assessment in terms of economic dependence, but as a two-sided market. The favorable usage terms granted to low cost carriers generate additional flows on the other side, with commercial revenues from shops or parking. Consequently, subsidizing operating costs might be rational, even for a private investor in a market economy, and might be a perennial device...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a study on {{rainfall}} characteristics of Pahang, for the period 1998 to 2013. In December 2014 flooding caused by torrential rainfall had drowned the main roads {{in the state of}} Pahang. As a result, the <b>operating</b> <b>aid</b> to flood victims face difficulties. The main objective {{of this study was to}} asses the variability of annual daily maximum rainfall.

40|$|As {{issued in}} the Competition Policy Brief {{on the new}} state aid rules for a {{competitive}} aviation industry by the Competition Directorate-General of the European Commission in February 20141, {{it will be more}} difficult for unprofitable airports, to obtain financial public subsidies on EU, national or regional level. Although the positive impact of small airports on the regional development and general accessibility was mentioned, still the <b>operating</b> <b>aid</b> to the airports shall be cut out over a maximum of 10 years. It has been further stated {{that the vast majority of}} small and regional airports experience problems to cover their running operative costs, as a result from an intensive market competition and overlapping of airports’ catchment areas preventing even some promising airports from growth. Public subsidies are mostly used by the airport management for infrastructural investments, to cover operating losses or to attract price-sensitive airlines. Herewith, among other things, the EU Commission is pointing out at the lack of cooperation structures and network strategies among the regional airports and at rather isolated and individual approach during elaboration of the airport development scenarios. However, the Competition Policy Brief permits public aid to regional airports, among other things if there is sufficient transports need to establish transition periods for small airports; the need for more flexibility of the regional airports in the remote areas has been underlined. The EU Commission is expecting herewith not to close the regional airports, but to stimulate them to operate on cost efficient and profitable basis, and that only the most inefficient airports will be closed...|$|E

40|$|This report {{identifies}} the 11 Long Island districts {{with the most}} student poverty and compares them with the 11 districts with middle student poverty, and the 11 districts with the least student poverty. In addition to poverty, this report looks at the demographic composition of these districts, and percentage of English language learners. Historically on Long Island, as elsewhere, {{there has been a}} large funding gap between school districts with high poverty and those with little poverty. The funding gap, as examined by The Education Trust and others, documents the difference in educational opportunity between school districts. In order to make this calculation it is necessary to both examine expenditures per pupil and student need (as measured by the proportion of student poverty). Policy makers and researchers across the spectrum agree that it generally costs more to provide equivalent educational opportunity to students from poor households as those from middle class or wealthier households. This report factors student poverty into the measurement of the funding gap. The report examines the effectiveness since 2007 of different state school aid categories at closing the funding gap [...] specifically looking at foundation aid, high tax aid and all state <b>operating</b> <b>aid</b> as a whole.

40|$|Decent work {{includes}} {{capacity building}} between expatriate and their host national aid workers. Optimizing empowerment to enable decent work amongst local aid workers {{may depend on}} human factors, alongside wider poverty reduction efforts, such as economic and political reform. This study sought to explore which of local:expatriate numerical ratio, expatriate social dominance, strength of Filipino identity and perceptions of workplace justice were predictive of different levels of subjective empowerment amongst aid workers in one particular lower-income, highpoverty country, the Philippines. Responses to an online survey available in both English and Tagalog were obtained from N = 98 employees of diverse locally <b>operating</b> <b>aid</b> organisations in the Philippines during two months in early 2011 (29 % male; 71 % female; mean age = 35. 5 years; all resident in the Philippines). The survey included measures of empowerment (Spreitzer, 1995), estimated local:expatriate numerical ratio, perceived social dominance (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle, 1994), social identity (Ellemers, Kortekaas, & Ouwerkerk, 1999), justice (Niehoff & Moorman, 1993), social desirability (D. G. Fischer & Fick, 1993), estimated local:expatriate salary ratio {{and a number of}} demographic control measures (e. g., age, years of relevant work experience, level of education). Respondents chose to participate by clicking a link in an email sent by seven development sector practitioners who agreed to assist the researcher with distribution of invitations to their staff or contact lists. The link opened an online survey hosted by kwiksurveys. co. uk. Data was downloaded from the kwiksurveys. co. uk online database and analysed by the researcher using SPSS. Controlling for age and other demographic variables, the best predictor of enabling empowerment was the fairness of personal interactions (interactional justice; =. 331). Interactional justice was also a significant predictor of the perceptions local employees had specifically about their impact in their workplace (=. 295), although this relationship was strongest when employees’ sense of self respect was weaker, implying that a secure social identity may act as a buffer to consequences of injustice, all other things being equal (interaction effect = -. 233). Distributive justice predicted iv each of four distinct facets of empowerment (competence; meaning; self-determination i. e., sense of control over one’s work; and impact, i. e., sense of making a difference in one’s work). The overall pattern of results suggests that justice plays a more significant role than either dominance or identity in contributing to empowerment amongst Filipino aid employees. Strikingly, fair interpersonal treatment may matter more than distributive justice. Alongside the effects of justice, expatriate attitudes towards hierarchy and host nationals’ sense of self respect are also significant factors, impacting empowerment in different ways. Given potential distortions arising from unknown response rate and a self-report methodology, further research, ideally with better control of sampling, is suggested. Possible avenues include exploring whether interpersonal treatment may matter more than distributive justice in collectivistic societies; whether self respect may act as a buffer against the effects of injustice; and how social dominance operates outside its traditional research contexts...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is in the first place to obtain a clear insight into the state of affairs {{regarding}} problem pupils within Primary Education (PE) as well as concerning the role, meaning and function of the existing assistance offered to them. Secondly, we seek to deepen the insight into the basic causes of dysfunction among PE children. We finally make our own contribution towards the development of a model of efficient and effective social-pedagogical assistance that is fully adapted to the Surinamese context and aimed especially at groups of PE pupils whose problems originate mostly in factors outside the school. The study is divided into three parts: Part 1 (we introduce the subject and review the relevant literature to place the issue within it s own academic field) After dealing with the concept of a problem pupil in the third chapter, we indicate that this designation is be used in this study to refer to PE pupils in favour of whom some measures must be taken in the short term to maximalise their chances to complete school in a normal way. In the last chapter of part 1 our choice for one particular socio-pedagogical view, namely that of Prof. dr. N. Perquin, is justified as we ponder upon the most fitting scientific approach to the subject [...] Part 2 (is an extended report on the empirical research that we have carried out) Results of the research (phase I) At first, the data of the research were processed and analysed at district level (per formed stratum). These analyses formed the basis for the summaries per district and at national level. In order to make the definition of the problem operational, the presentation of the data of the research is organised around three sub-questions: A. what is the basis of the dysfunctionality of primary school children? B. what are the forms of assistance available to them, and, do they work? C. what kind of assistance is there in order to tackle problems that originate mostly outside the school? Sub A. The large number of problem pupils in the Surinamese primary schools is not only a separate problem in the city district Paramaribo but also at national level. In five districts the problem has to be qualified as very serious. The home situation of most PE pupils is at district and national level the most important cause of problems. Sub B Providing assistance to primary schools and their problem pupils leaves much to be desired. At national level more than half the number of primary schools lacks the adequate means to assist their problem pupils. Some of the districts lack any form of assistance at all. At national level it has appeared that only 3 of the 12 <b>operating</b> <b>aid</b> organisations play a clear and influential role. A large part of principals and teachers (at national level, more than half) is not satisfied with the assistance provided by the aid organisations. This research showed that forms of social work, aimed specifically at schools, hardly exist or do not exist at all. Sub C The root cause of most problems (3 out of 4) affecting Surinamese PE pupils {{can be traced back to}} factors that lie outside the ambit of the school. The results of the research (phase II) The large part of the parents of Surinamese problem pupils in PE comes from the lower socio-economic strata. A complex of factors within their environment adds to the problems making it very difficult for them to function optimally within the process of giving help to their children. The existing model of socio-pedagogical help and didactic supervision is, among other things, not able to provide to the large group of PE problem pupils with sound assistance and didactic supervision. Part 3 (an attempt is made to develop a model of assistance to PE pupils that adequately responds to the Surinamese problems). We hand out a global picture of the issue of problem children at primary school in Suriname and their assistance. This picture might be used as a foundation for further research into various domains. The findings regarding all 10 districts enable us to outline a youth educational and social strategy to tackle the problems affecting Primary Education...|$|E
