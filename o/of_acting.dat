40|$|Although {{absenteeism}} {{has been}} identified in theoretical models as a key long-term consequence of emotional labor, few studies have empirically examined this link. In this article, we investi-gate the relationship between surface acting and absenteeism and the moderating role <b>of</b> sur-face <b>acting</b> self-efficacy. Drawing on resource perspectives, we argue and show that when valued resources are threatened or lost as a result <b>of</b> surface <b>acting,</b> employees will actively strive to prevent further resource loss by withdrawing from work. We propose, however, that surface acting self-efficacy can help buffer the resource depleting effects <b>of</b> surface <b>acting</b> lead-ing to withdrawal. Using data from two sources, collected at two points in time, we surveyed 121 nurses and linked these data to absenteeism data collected 12 months postsurvey. Results showed direct effects <b>of</b> surface <b>acting</b> on absenteeism; in addition, higher surface acting self-efficacy minimized the detrimental effects <b>of</b> surface <b>acting</b> on absenteeism. We also found sup-port for the mediating role of affective commitment in explaining this interaction effect. These {{results suggest that the}} effects <b>of</b> surface <b>acting</b> on absenteeism are less detrimental for employ-ees with high surface acting self-efficacy as these individuals are less negatively affected by the drain on the motivational resources that keep them feeling attached to their workplace and, i...|$|R

5|$|This {{philosophy}} of approaching the art <b>of</b> <b>acting</b> has stood not only steadfast, {{but as the}} cornerstone <b>of</b> <b>acting</b> {{for much of the}} 20th century to this day. Mikhail Chekhov considered Ivanov a key moment in his brother's intellectual development and literary career. From this period comes an observation of Chekhov's that has become known as Chekhov's gun, a dramatic principle that requires that every element in a narrative be necessary and irreplaceable, and that everything else be removed.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} emotional labor variability, which captures individual differences in surface acting and deep acting fluctuations over time. In a multilevel study of 78 customer service employees who provided 522 matched daily surveys over a two-week period, employees who were more variable in their use <b>of</b> surface <b>acting</b> reported lower levels of job satisfaction {{and higher levels of}} work withdrawal. Selfmonitoring was positively associated with both the level and variability <b>of</b> surface <b>acting,</b> and the effects <b>of</b> surface <b>acting</b> variability on job satisfaction and work withdrawal were weaker when self-monitoring was high. The results for deep acting were inconsistent. Overall, our results demonstrate how the concepts <b>of</b> surface <b>acting</b> variability and deep acting variability can extend theory and research on emotional labor as well as on self-monitoring...|$|R

With his brother's encouragement, he attended the Gaiety School <b>of</b> <b>Acting,</b> dropping out when he was cast as Danny Byrne on Ballykissangel, a BBC drama about a young English priest who becomes part of an Irish rural community. As an 18-year-old travelling in Sydney, he was at one time suspected for attempted murder. The police sketch looked remarkably like him and he had even described blacking out during the night in question. His only alibi was apparently a journal kept by his friend that explained the two had been across town that night, taking MDMA.|$|E
5|$|Following Whitman's {{resignation}} and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served as acting governor {{for three and}} a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office <b>of</b> <b>acting</b> governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as much as any other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey.|$|E
