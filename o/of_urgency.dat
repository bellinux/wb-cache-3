40|$|The {{needs of}} {{companies}} are evolving and {{becoming more and more}} demanding each year, which result in more complex stakeholder relations. The complexity of the projects increases as well. For instance, stakeholders do not always have the same sense <b>of</b> <b>urgencies</b> and their expectations from the same project might differ. Such variety in demand urges project managers to opt for a new; more broaden management approach that includes more human type of issues as well as hard skills. One area this situation is observed in contemporary projects is software development projects with complex stakeholder environment, where the project managers have responsibility to deliver high quality end delivery {{at the same time to}} meet the demands of stakeholders with different sense <b>of</b> <b>urgencies.</b> This study aims for answering the research question “How can software projects having unclear requirement definitions and stakeholders with different sense <b>of</b> <b>urgencies</b> can be managed successfully?” The research is proposing a structured set of methodologies with a guideline to professionals and the researchers to manage software development projects having unclear requirement definition and stakeholders with different sense <b>of</b> <b>urgencies.</b> Systems Engineering, Policy Analysis and ManagementMulti Actor SystemsTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R
40|$|The {{needs of}} {{companies}} are evolving and becoming more demanding each year, which resulted in more complex stakeholder relations. Stakeholders do not always have the same sense <b>of</b> <b>urgencies</b> and their expectations from the same project might differ. Although current literature suggests successful methodologies for software development projects, it remains inadequate when different sense <b>of</b> <b>urgencies</b> take place among the stakeholders. This creates {{the risk of developing}} negotiated nonsense software. There is a need of a more broaden approach where human types of issues are involved together with the traditional project management methods.

At 11:30 PM, the paratroopers began moving, with a battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Yitzhak Mordechai spearheading the advance. Ya'iri, acting with a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> had decided to go into action without awaiting sufficient intelligence, or performing adequate reconnaissance on Egyptian defenses. His unit lacked artillery observers and, rather than wait for one to arrive, it was agreed the paratroopers would request fire support of the 162nd Division's command net. The brigade was acting without armor support.|$|E
5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E
5|$|Parallel to NDRE's work, NTNF {{was working}} with ESRO to gain support for a {{telemetry}} station. There was a degree <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> as ESRO wanted the facility completed by 1967 {{in time for the}} launch of the spacecraft ESRO-2. NTNF and ESRO were also working on the establishment of Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund. The agreement to build the station was approved by the Parliament of Norway in mid 1966. Part of the reason for the Norwegian support was the opportunity of training Norwegians in pulse-code modulation and digital computing. For NDRE the station was a chance to apply its latest minicomputer, the Simulation for Automatic Machinery (SAM).|$|E

Therefore, they recommended, the choice of speaker should depend on the overlap of noise and speech spectra. Female voices did, however, appear to have an advantage in that they could portray a greater range <b>of</b> <b>urgencies</b> because <b>of</b> their usually higher pitch and pitch range.

5|$|Production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin {{was driven}} by the forethought and {{determination}} of Ernest Hives, who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> encountered in his frequent correspondence with Air Ministry and local authority officials. Hives was an advocate of shadow factories, and, sensing the imminent outbreak of war, pressed ahead with plans to produce the Merlin in sufficient numbers for the rapidly expanding Royal Air Force. Despite the importance of uninterrupted production, several factories were affected by industrial action. By {{the end of its}} production run in 1950, 168,176 Merlin engines had been built; over 112,000 in Britain and more than 55,000 under licence in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Returning to England in 1934, Morgan assumed {{command of}} the 4th Anti-Aircraft Battery, which was {{deployed}} to Malta during the diplomatic crisis that accompanied the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935. He served in the War Office from 1936 to 1938. Here he became increasingly disturbed at the lack <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> that the government displayed {{in the face of}} a war that Morgan and his fellow staff officers felt was inevitable and imminent. That year he was promoted colonel and became General Staff Officer (Grade 1) of the 3rd Division, in which Brigadier Bernard Montgomery commanded the 8th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer Roland Huntford, the {{references}} to Shackleton's physical breakdown made in Scott's The Voyage of the Discovery, published in 1905, reopened the wounds to Shackleton's pride. It became a personal mission that he should return to the Antarctic and outperform Scott. He began looking for potential backers for an expedition of his own; his initial plans appear in an unpublished document dated early 1906. These include a cost estimate of £17,000 (updated value £) for the entire expedition. He received his first promise of financial backing when early in 1907 his employer, Beardmore, offered a £7,000 loan guarantee (updated value £). With this in hand, Shackleton felt confident enough to announce his intentions to the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) on 12 February 1907. One reason for Shackleton's sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> was {{the knowledge that the}} Polish explorer Henryk Arctowski was planning an expedition, which was announced at the RGS on the same day as Shackleton's. In the event, Arctowski's plans were stillborn.|$|E

40|$|I {{develop a}} social choice {{approach}} to analyzing the endogenous assignment of individual rights. The rights are assigned {{on the basis}} of aggregation of the individual judgments of the relative importance (<b>urgency)</b> <b>of</b> particular interests that rights serve to protect. The key results of the model are two impossibility theorems: one induced by the conflicts between endogenously assigned rights, the other, underscoring the robustness of Sen’s theorem to requiring consistency between the assignments of rights and the underlying urgency judgments, by the conflicts be-tween endogenously assigned rights and Pareto. The theorems show that these conflicts persist even in the presence of unanimous agreements on the relative evaluation <b>of</b> individual <b>urgencies</b> and on the intrapersonal comparisons <b>of</b> <b>urgencies</b> across bundles <b>of</b> alternatives- arguably, the most demanding restrictions on the underlying preference domains that are consistent with the liberal commitment to “protecting while disagreeing. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{view of the}} board's lack <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> C {{took nearly}} a year to {{research}} this project. The proposed main battery of eight 14-inch guns was kept constant while other factors were calculated—speeds of 26, 29 and 32 knots; operating ranges of 5000, 7000 and 8000 miles; and belt armor of 8, 11 and 14 inches. On 12 July 1912, Naval Constructor R.H. Robinson presented these studies at a lecture he gave at the Naval War College with the General Board in attendance. There, he emphasized 8 inches as an absolute minimum for armor protection and recommended a radius of 8000 miles, {{the same as in}} U.S. battleships. The General Board's reaction was to request two battlecruisers for the 1914 Naval Building Program and ask C for a slightly modified version of the proposed ship, but the Naval War College felt the design had serious problems and that a fast battleship would be a more practical option.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 24September that Edward left Acre. Arriving in Sicily, he was met {{with the news that}} his father had died on 16November, 1272. Edward was deeply saddened by this news, but rather than hurrying home at once, he made a leisurely journey northwards. This was due partly to his still-poor health, but also to a lack <b>of</b> <b>urgency.</b> The {{political}} situation in England was stable after the mid-century upheavals, and Edward was proclaimed king at his father's death, rather than at his own coronation, as had until then been customary. In Edward's absence, the country was governed by a royal council, led by Robert Burnell. The new king embarked on an overland journey through Italy and France, where among other things he visited Pope Gregory X. Only on 2 August 1274 did he return to England, and he was crowned on 19 August.|$|E

It directed an intensive research effort, and in July 1941, produced two comprehensive reports that reached the conclusion that an atomic bomb was not only technically feasible, but could be produced before the war ended, perhaps in as little as two years. The Committee unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb as a matter <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> although it recognised that the resources required might be beyond those available to Britain. A new directorate known by the deliberately misleading name of Tube Alloys was created to coordinate this effort.

40|$|Reserve {{attention}} {{capacity of}} a pilot was calculated using a pilot model that allocates exclusive model attention according to the ranking <b>of</b> task <b>urgency</b> functions whose variables are tracking error and error rate.

The <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> the single loop vertical task is simply {{the magnitude of the}} vertical tracking error, while the multiloop horizontal task requires a nonlinear <b>urgency</b> measure <b>of</b> error and error rate terms. Comparison of model results with flight simulation data verified the computed model statistics of tracking error of both axes, lateral and longitudinal stick amplitude and rate, and side task episodes. Full data for the simulation tracking statistics as well as the explicit equations and structure <b>of</b> the <b>urgency</b> function multiaxis pilot model are presented...|$|R

5|$|The British {{decided to}} {{despatch}} {{one of their}} Commonwealth ministers to Rhodesia for talks during early July, but debated for a while over {{whether it should be}} Bottomley or his deputy, Cledwyn Hughes, who should be sent. Wilson considered this a matter <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> as he had heard a rumour that Rhodesia might declare independence on its main national holiday, Rhodes' Day (that year 12 July), but this proved false. On 15 July, Britain's High Commissioner to Rhodesia, John Baines Johnston, was instructed to propose a week-long round of talks between Smith and Hughes in Salisbury. Johnston was given permission to cave if the Rhodesian Prime Minister insisted on meeting with Bottomley, but this did not prove necessary: Smith cabled back on the 18th accepting Hughes' visit. The British delegation arrived in Salisbury four days later.|$|E
5|$|Land {{transport}} {{utilized the}} advanced system of Roman roads. The in-kind taxes paid by communities included {{the provision of}} personnel, animals, or vehicles for the cursus publicus, the state mail and transport service established by Augustus. Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve Roman miles, and tended to grow into a village or trading post. A mansio (plural mansiones) was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the cursus publicus. The support staff at such a facility included muleteers, secretaries, blacksmiths, cartwrights, a veterinarian, and a few military police and couriers. The distance between mansiones was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day. Mules were the animal most often used for pulling carts, travelling about 4mph. As {{an example of the}} pace of communication, it took a messenger a minimum of nine days to travel to Rome from Mainz in the province of Germania Superior, even on a matter <b>of</b> <b>urgency.</b> In addition to the mansiones, some taverns offered accommodations as well as food and drink; one recorded tab for a stay showed charges for wine, bread, mule feed, and the services of a prostitute.|$|E
