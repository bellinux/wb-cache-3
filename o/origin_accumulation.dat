40|$|The Doha Round {{differs from}} {{previous}} multilateral rounds since {{a number of}} participating countries are negotiating and implementing bilateral and regional free trade agreements (FTAs) {{at the same time}} as they are negotiating multilaterally. The standard arguments against FTAs involve that they create trade diversion, are difficult to administrate, involve complex rules of origin that impost added costs on firms, and attract the attention and political capital of policy makers away from the multilateral negotiation. This paper poses other arguments about FTAs being beneficial to the multilateral process. For instance, they have allowed some countries to achieve zero tariffs with all their main trading partners, and therefore a large majority of their trade, and often involve reforms in sensitive issues that, once undertaken, allow governments to assume a more offensive position at the WTO. Most importantly, by creating trade diversion away from countries that act as laggards in all negotiation fronts, they generate the competitive pressure that can move those nations to assume a more constructive position in the multilateral negotiations; also, it may be easier to harmonize existing FTAs than to seek comprehensive plurilateral and multilateral agreements from scratch. Beyond the discussion of whether FTAs help or hinder multilateral progress, the paper discusses changes in the multilateral rules, and best practices in bilateral negotiations, that can help make both fronts better complements. The issues mentioned include guidelines among rules of origin, <b>origin</b> <b>accumulation,</b> harmonization of standing agreements, bilateral trade facilitation and solutions to preference erosion.

40|$|Abstract Background Two {{processes}} {{may contribute}} to the formation of global centers of biodiversity: elevated local speciation rates (the center of origin hypothesis), and greater accumulation of species formed elsewhere (the center of accumulation hypothesis). The relative importance of these processes has long intrigued marine biogeographers but rarely has been tested. Results To examine how <b>origin</b> and <b>accumulation</b> affected the Greater Caribbean center of diversity, we conducted a range-wide survey of mtDNA cytochrome b in the widespread Atlantic reef damselfish Chromis multilineata (N = 183) that included 10 locations in all four tropical Atlantic biogeographic provinces: the Greater Caribbean, Brazil, the mid-Atlantic ridge, and the tropical eastern Atlantic. We analyzed this data and re-evaluated published genetic data from other reef fish taxa (wrasses and parrotfishes) to resolve the origin and dispersal of mtDNA lineages. Parsimony networks, mismatch distributions and phylogenetic analyses identify the Caribbean population of C. multilineata as the oldest, consistent with the center of origin model for the circum-Atlantic radiation of this species. However, some Caribbean haplotypes in this species were derived from Brazilian lineages, indicating that mtDNA diversity has not only originated but also accumulated in the Greater Caribbean. Data from the wrasses and parrotfishes indicate an origin in the Greater Caribbean in one case, Caribbean <b>origin</b> plus <b>accumulation</b> in another, and accumulation in the remaining two. Conclusion Our analyses indicate that the Greater Caribbean marine biodiversity hotspot did not arise through the action of a single mode of evolutionary change. Reef fish distributions at the boundaries between Caribbean and Brazilian provinces (the SE Caribbean and NE Brazil, respectively) indicate that the microevolutionary patterns we detected in C. multilineata and other reef fishes translate into macroevolutionary processes and that <b>origin</b> and <b>accumulation</b> have acted in concert to form the Greater Caribbean biodiversity hotspot. </p...|$|R

During the geological period, 3 major oil & gas fillings occurred in the Longwangmiao Formation, namely Caledonian-Hercynian filling that was small in scale and produced the first phase of paleo-oil reservoir that soon destroyed by Caledonian movement uplift, large-scale Permian filling that gave rise to the second-phase of paleo-oil reservoir and the Triassic-Jurassic filling that enriched the second phase of paleo-oil reservoir.

40|$|The <b>origin</b> of {{electron}} <b>accumulation</b> at wurtzite InN surfaces {{is explained}} in terms of the bulk band structure. Ab initio calculations of the electronic structure of wurtzite InN reveal an unusually low conduction band minimum at the Gamma-point. As a result, the branch point energy, E-B, which is the crossover point from donor-type to acceptor-type surface states, is located in the conduction band at the Gamma-point. This allows donor-type surface states to exist in the conduction band. The donor-type surface states emit their electrons into the conduction band, thus giving rise to electron accumulation at the surface. Experimental measurements, probing the conduction band electron plasma, confirm the existence of electron accumulation at InN surfaces, with a surface Fermi level location in agreement with the predictions of the ab initio theory...|$|R

Bioaccumulation of mercury, chromium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) was also determined. Levels of mercury and PAHs were higher in tissues of chubs sampled from the most downstream station, reflecting an anthropogenic pollution of industrial <b>origin.</b> Otherwise, <b>accumulation</b> of Cr was quite similar in fish along the entire course of Cecina River confirming a natural origin due to local geochemical features.

We have separated the vesicle markers into two groups by equilibrium isodensity centrifugation. The major population of vesicles contains Bg 12 p, an endoglucanase destined to be a cell-wall component, as well as Pma 1 p, the major plasma membrane ATPase. In addition, Snc 1 p, a synaptobrevin homologue, copurifies with these vesicles. Another vesicle population contains the periplasmic enzymes invertase and acid phosphatase. Both vesicle populations also contain exoglucanase activity; the major exoglucanase normally secreted from the cell, encoded by EXG 1, is carried in the population containing periplasmic enzymes. Electron microscopy shows that both vesicle groups have an average diameter of 100 nm. The late secretory mutants sec 1, sec 4, and sec 6 accumulate both vesicle populations, while neither is detected in wild-type cells, early sec mutants, or a sec 13 sec 6 double mutant. Moreover, a block in endocytosis does not prevent the accumulation of either vesicle species in an end 4 sec 6 double mutant, further indicating that both populations are of exocytic <b>origin.</b> The <b>accumulation</b> of two populations of late secretory vesicles indicates the existence of two parallel routes from the Golgi to the plasma membrane...|$|R

This can be correlated with decreased apoptosis but not with enhanced homeostatic turnover potential of these cells. PD- 1 ablation increased the frequency of memory phenotype CD 4 IFN-γ producers but decreased the respective frequency of IL- 17 A-producing cells. In particular, IFN-γ producers were more abundant but IL- 17 A producing cells were more scarce among PD- 1 KO T(EM) -phenotype cells relative to WT. Transfer of peripheral naïve CD 4 T cells suggested that accumulated PD- 1 KO T(EM) -phenotype cells are of peripheral and not of thymic <b>origin.</b> This <b>accumulation</b> effect was mediated by CD 4 cell-intrinsic mechanisms as shown by mixed bone marrow chimera experiments.

The variability of sediment fluxes during Holocene times is related to the post-glacial sea-level rise and changes in river discharge and coastal erosion input. Whereas during the late/middle Holocene most of the terrigenous sediments were deposited in the estuaries and the areas directly off the estuaries, huge amounts of sediments accumulated on the Kara Sea shelf farther north during the early Holocene before about 9 Cal. kyrs. BP. The maximum accumulation at that time is related to the lowered sea level, increased coastal erosion, and increased river discharge due to the final stage of mountain deglaciation of the Putoran Massif. Increased supply of Yenisei-derived material indicated by peak magnetic susceptibility values probably occurred in climate-related pulses culminating near 11, 10, and 9 Cal. kyrs. BP. As sea level rose, the main Holocene depocenter migrated southward. Based on hydrogen index values and n-alkanes, the organic matter is predominantly of terrigenous <b>origin.</b> Maximum <b>accumulation</b> rates of 1. 5 to more than 6 g cm- 2 y- 1 occurred in the early Holocene sediments, suggesting more humid climatic conditions with an increased vegetation cover in the source area at that time.

40|$|The {{polyamine}} spermine is transported {{into the}} mitochondrial matrix by an electrophoretic mechanism having as driving force the negative electrical membrane potential (DW). The presence of phosphate increases spermine uptake by reducingDpH and enhancingDW. The transport {{system is a}} specific uniporter constituted by a protein channel exhibiting two asymmetric energy barriers with the spermine binding site located in the energy well between the two barriers. Although spermine transport is electrophoretic in <b>origin,</b> its <b>accumulation</b> does not follow the Nernst equation {{for the presence of}} an efflux pathway. Spermine efflux may be induced by different agents, such as FCCP, antimycin A and mersalyl, able to completely or partially reduce theDWvalue and, consequently, suppress or weaken the force necessary to maintain spermine in the matrix. However this efflux may also take place in normal conditions when the electrophoretic accumulation of the polycationic polyamine induces a sufficient drop inDWable to trigger the efflux pathway. The release of the polyamine is most probably electroneutral in origin and can take place in exchange with protons or in symport with phosphate anion. The activity of both the uptake and efflux pathways induces a continuous cycling of spermine across the mitochondrial membrane, the rate of which may be prominent in imposing the concentrations of spermine in the inner and outer compartment. Thus, this event has a significant role on mitochondrial permeability transition modulation and consequently on the triggering of intrinsic apoptosis...|$|R

40|$|Replication forks {{routinely}} encounter damaged DNA and {{tightly bound}} proteins, leading to fork stalling and inactivation. To complete DNA synthesis, {{it is necessary}} to remove fork-blocking lesions and reactivate stalled fork structures, which can occur by multiple mechanisms. To study the mechanisms of stalled fork reactivation, we used a model fork intermediate, the origin fork, which is formed during replication from the bacteriophage T 4 origin, ori(34). The origin fork accumulates within the T 4 chromosome in a site-specific manner without the need for replication inhibitors or DNA damage. We report here that the origin fork is processed in vivo to generate a regressed fork structure. Furthermore, origin fork regression supports two mechanisms of fork resolution that can potentially lead to fork reactivation. Fork regression generates both a site-specific double-stranded end (DSE) and a Holliday junction. Each of these DNA elements serves as a target for processing by the T 4 ATPase/exonuclease complex [gene product (gp) 46 / 47] and Holliday junction-cleaving enzyme (EndoVII), respectively. In the absence of both gp 46 and EndoVII, regressed origin forks are stabilized and persist throughout infection. In the presence of EndoVII, but not gp 46, there is significantly less regressed <b>origin</b> fork <b>accumulation</b> apparently due to cleavage of the regressed fork Holliday junction. In the presence of gp 46, but not EndoVII, regressed origin fork DSEs are processed by degradation of the DSE and a pathway that includes recombination proteins.

We show that the ability of L. major to trigger macrophage LD accumulation is independent of parasite viability and uptake and can also be observed in non-infected cells through paracrine stimuli suggesting that LD formation is from cellular <b>origin.</b> The <b>accumulation</b> of LDs is demonstrated using confocal microscopy and live-cell imagin in parasite-free cytoplasmic region of the host cell, but also promptly recruited to the proximity of Leishmania parasites. Indeed LDs are observed inside parasitophorous vacuole and in parasite cytoplasm suggesting that Leishmania parasites besides producing their own LDs, may take advantage of these high energy sources. Otherwise, these LDs may help cells defending against parasitic infection. These metabolic changes, rising as common features during the last years, occur in host cells infected by a large number of pathogens and seem {{to play an important role}} in pathogenesis. Understanding how Leishmania parasites and different pathogens exploit this LD accumulation will help us define the common mechanism used by these different pathogens to manipulate and/or take advantage of this high-energy source...|$|R
40|$|Fluids {{produced}} from oil or gasfields and aquifers are naturally radioactive {{due to the}} presence of potassium- 40 and isotopes from decay chains of uranium- 238 and thorium- 232 in these reservoirs. Thus, natural radionuclides can be carried away towards surface when petroleum or geothermal reservoirs are drilled and produced. These radio- nuclides can precipitate in deposits forming in process equipment, which can then be unusually radioactive, expose workers to hazardous materials and create waste disposal problems. Workers can also be exposed to high concentrations of radon. Due to their natural <b>origin,</b> these <b>accumulations</b> of radionuclides in equipment are called Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (NORM). They are also known as TENORM, because they are technologically enhanced. In closed systems, exposition to gamma radiations penetrating equipment to the external surface can be reduced by restricting and controlling access to appropriate areas. But personnel may come into direct contact with NORM during maintenance and cleaning operations, when opening equipment and vessels. In France, hygiene and safety rules concerning the protection of workers in the petroleum and geothermal industries are formulated in a speciac legislation related to extraction and mining. Presently, both petroleum and geothermal industries are not included in the list of activities which have to follow radioprotection measures given by this legislation. French authorities are currently planning to update the list by including these two activities. There is a real need to realize a state-of-the art of the exposition level of French workers and to match the dose limits to those given by the Labor and Public Health Codes. This paper will present the origin of NORM and radon contamination in the petroleum and geothermal industries and discuss the French legislation evolution for the radioprotection of personnel working in these two industrie...|$|R
