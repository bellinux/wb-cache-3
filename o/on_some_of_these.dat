5|$|Canadian {{neurologist}} C. Miller Fisher {{described the}} variant {{that bears his}} name in 1956. British neurologist Edwin Bickerstaff, based in Birmingham, described the brainstem encephalitis type in 1951 with Philip Cloake, and made further contributions with another paper in 1957. Guillain had reported <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> features prior to their full description in 1938. Further subtypes have been described since then, such as the form featuring pure ataxia and the type causing pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness. The axonal subtype was first described in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. In vitro studies <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> molecules {{have revealed that}} they are able to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors in vivo. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It is suggested that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in a shower of sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E

25|$|Two {{different}} classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations {{took place on}} the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later <b>on,</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> mechanisms were operated by electric motors and reduction gearing that operated a crank and connecting rod to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of the group's first album in 1973, they were banned from {{competing}} in the isicathamiya competitions because of their ability to win many of the competitions. They were, however, welcome to perform for the audience. Following this, the group started performing for their own audiences in shows that were specially made and, soon afterwards, the group began touring around South Africa in their own concerts, but due to the Apartheid system in use, they were often stopped by police guards; <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> occasions they were even made to lie down on the ground whilst being searched. Shortly afterwards, they were allowed to tour without permits.|$|E

25|$|The Finns modernized their T-26s in 1942–1943. Eight T-26 mod. 1931 tanks {{received}} turrets {{from the}} single-turreted T-26 or BT tanks. Additionally, turrets from irreparable T-26s or BTs of different models were mounted on KhT-26s, KhT-130s and KhT-133s, which had flame-throwing equipment removed. A ball mount for the DT tank machine gun was installed <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> tanks {{in the front}} armoured plate of the underturret box. In addition, some Finnish T-26s had a modified driver's hatch opened to the left {{as well as a}} different kit of spare parts tools, and many tanks were equipped with a special rear beam for towing guns and damaged vehicles.|$|E

Guest stars <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> programs have occasionally had Muppet versions of themselves. It was a regular practice {{for the first few}} episodes of The Muppet Show, and ZZ Top, among others, have appeared as Muppet versions of themselves on Sesame Street. Muppet versions of real people have also appeared in other shows, such as in 30 Rock.|$|E
25|$|The Iron Age saw an {{expansion}} {{in the use of}} fibulae. The rounded bow fibula underwent several variations and were usually highly decorated with incised or moulded geometric designs. In one variation, the foot of the fibula that had previously terminated {{at the end of the}} arch with a simple catch plate, lengthened significantly. These extended foot fibulae, such as the Kahn type and the Pauken type, were found in the 7th to 5th centuries BC. The first long, bilateral springs appeared <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> variants in the Hallstatt D2 era (5th century BC). These fibulae, such as the Doublezier type, looked similar to the Roman-era crossbow fibulae but were not the latter’s direct precursor.|$|E

25|$|Philip IV {{placed the}} knights under {{surveillance}} for a period, and the scandal {{began to take}} shape. The accusations centred on suggestions that Blanche and Margaret had been drinking, eating and engaging in adultery with Gautier and Philippe d'Aunay in the Tour de Nesle over a period. The Tour de Nesle was an old guard tower in Paris next to the river Seine and had been bought by Philip IV in 1308. The third sister-in-law, Joan, was initially {{said to have been}} present <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> occasions and to have known of the affair; later accusations were extended to have included suggestions that she had also been involved in adultery herself.|$|E
25|$|A {{company called}} American Model Toys {{brought out a}} line of realistic, {{detailed}} cars beginning in 1948. In 1953 it released a budget line. It ran into financial difficulty, reorganized under the name Auburn Model Trains, and ended up selling its line to Nashville, Tennessee-based Kusan, a plastics company who continued its production until 1961. The tooling was then sold to a small company run by Andrew (Andy) Kriswalus in Endicott, New York, who operated as Kris Model Trains, or KMT. Andy Kriswalus only produced the box, stock, and refrigerator cars from the Kusan dies, and <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> cars he mounted die-cast trucks from the Kusan tooling. After Kriswalus' death, the tooling was sold to K-Line and Williams Electric Trains, who continued {{to use it to}} produce parts of their budget lines.|$|E
25|$|According to Pentecostals, all {{manifestations of}} the Spirit are to {{be judged by the}} church. This is made possible, in part, by the gift of discerning of spirits, which is the {{capacity}} for discerning the source of a spiritual manifestation—whether from the Holy Spirit, an evil spirit, or from the human spirit. While Pentecostals believe in the current operation of all the spiritual gifts within the church, their teaching <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> gifts has generated more controversy and interest than others. There are different ways in which the gifts have been grouped. W. R. Jones suggests three categories, illumination (Word of Wisdom, word of knowledge, discerning of spirits), action (Faith, working of miracles and gifts of healings) and communication (Prophecy, tongues and interpretation of tongues). Duffield and Van Cleave use two categories: the vocal and the power gifts.|$|E

25|$|Tiwanaku monumental {{architecture}} {{is characterized by}} large stones of exceptional workmanship. In contrast to the masonry style of the later Inca, Tiwanaku stone architecture usually employs rectangular ashlar blocks laid in regular courses. Their monumental structures were frequently fitted with elaborate drainage systems. The drainage systems of the Akapana and Pumapunku structures include conduits composed of red sandstone blocks held together by ternary (copper/arsenic/nickel) bronze architectural cramps. The I-shaped architectural cramps of the Akapana were created by cold hammering of ingots. In contrast, the cramps of the Pumapunku were created by pouring molten metal into I-shaped sockets. The blocks have flat faces that {{do not need to}} be fitted upon placement because the grooves make it possible for the blocks to be shifted by ropes into place. The main architectural appeal of the site comes from the carved images and designs <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> blocks, carved doorways, and giant stone monoliths.|$|E
500|$|Production of {{the album}} began quickly with {{the writing of the}} track [...] "Politik", which was a song seen as a {{reflection}} of the world at the time, giving the band a renewed perspective on their lives and society. Many of the song lyrics on the album relate strongly to the theme of urgency. Martin has commented that previous songs were more relaxed since they were in a comfortable state of mind: [...] "Perhaps there's a bit more urgency <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> songs. And that's born from all the places we've been and the things we've experienced." [...] Martin has explained. In relation to the theme of urgency, Martin has also started that the album's title means [...] "doing something on impulse".|$|E
500|$|The {{first session}} for the Wonderwall soundtrack {{took place on}} 22 November 1967 at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London. That day, Harrison {{recorded}} with a tabla player and flautists Richard Adeney and Jack Ellory, taping the pieces [...] "Swordfencing", [...] "India", [...] "Backwards Tabla" [...] and [...] "Backwards Tones". On 23 November, he carried out further work <b>on</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> selections, with two oboe players, a trumpeter and two flautists. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter state {{that some of these}} recordings may have been used as musical cues in the film but excluded from the soundtrack album, while [...] "Swordfencing" [...] was a piece that Harrison incorporated into [...] "Dream Scene" [...] on the album. Over this period, Harrison also worked at a second London location, De Lane Lea Studios. According to a contemporary issue of Beatles Monthly magazine, the sessions continued at Abbey Road on 11, 20 and 31 December.|$|E
