25|$|The cover artwork for {{the single}} depicts the song's lyrics written {{on top of a}} woman's face, {{depicted}} in 1980s-style vivid coloring. The image is an altered picture of the band's bassist Ami Kusakari from the photoshoot for the band's album Shin-shiro, as she brushed hair <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The covers were made by design team Hatos, who have worked with Sakanaction since their second album Night Fishing. Yamaguchi requested something relating to Japanese psychedelic literature, and to the 1980s, but never considered that Hatos would put the song's lyrics on the cover.|$|E
25|$|With core ideas down, the {{remaining}} Titan team began putting these {{together as a}} prototype to present to management. They took the classes they had made for Titan and remade these as Heroes, giving them core abilities from the Titan skill set they believed worked best together, and developing backstory and personality for the heroes. Existing art assets from Titan for the various player avatars were also reused and refined to create {{the appearance of the}} heroes. The initial gameplay used maps they had developed for Titan along with Tracer, one of the reworked Titan heroes; at that point, they had not included any animations so Tracer would fire by shooting lasers <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The prototype proved successful within Blizzard, and the team was given the greenlight to proceed. Overwatch became Blizzard's second attempt at launching a new franchise since StarCraft in 1998. Some of the additional heroes came from the classes they created for the Crossroads concept as well as the Starcraft tie-in that they brainstormed prior to settling on Overwatch.|$|E
6000|$|As there, {{with his}} bushy red beard, he stood, [...] Pricked out to double its size, [...] He squinted so cross, 'twas {{as much as}} she could [...] To keep the tears <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> her eyes, [...] To keep the tears <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
60|$|Her hands {{fell to her}} side, the {{pleasure}} died <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face--only <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> still questioned him. Fitzgerald carefully laid his hat on a vacant chair.|$|R
60|$|With immeasurable {{contempt}} looking brightly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> steady <b>eyes,</b> {{his wife}} stopped him.|$|R
60|$|I strove {{in vain to}} hide my confusion. This lady only smiled {{the deeper}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{baffling}} <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|A {{serious look}} {{came into the}} girl's face. The smile died <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She shivered.|$|E
60|$|She laughed {{softly and}} wiped the tears <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> They were really very {{beautiful}} eyes notwithstanding the dark rims encircling them.|$|E
6000|$|... "When did {{you come}} to Washington?" [...] she asked, trying to keep her {{consciousness}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> which she let dwell kindly upon him.|$|E
60|$|Tears rolled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> little <b>eyes</b> as she spoke, and {{she covered}} her round {{face with her}} pocket-handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|She laughed good-humouredly, {{then looked}} up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> blue <b>eyes</b> as if asking what more I had to say.|$|R
60|$|He strode {{at once to}} Klara, who {{greeted him}} with an ironical little smile and a coquettish look <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dark <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Before God, no!" [...] she answered, {{the anger}} blazing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> shaking in her voice. [...] "I sing no {{more in this}} accursed city!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The terror faded <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and {{her whole}} body relaxed. “Oh, yes, I do remember,” she said. “And you won one of the canoe races.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's gone; never mind--my fault,' said Miss Cameron, disappointed, but amused at the girl's dismay as {{she shook}} the water <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and gasped bravely: ...|$|E
50|$|Kim Goodman is a {{woman who}} is able to pop <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> sockets by 12 {{millimeters}} (0.47 inches). She holds the world record for the farthest eyeball protrusion. She lives in Chicago, Illinois. She discovered her eyeball popping talent one day when she was hit on the head with a hockey mask. Her eyeballs popped out much further than usual and ever since that day she could pop them out on cue, as well as when she yawns.|$|R
60|$|Jane's {{question}} had roused Bess <b>out</b> <b>of</b> stupefaction. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> suddenly darkened and dilated. She stepped toward Venters {{and held up}} both hands as if to ward off a blow.|$|R
60|$|She laughed--and, in {{the very}} act of laughing, changed again. Fright looked wildly at Ovid <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> staring <b>eyes.</b> Some terrifying remembrance had {{suddenly}} occurred to her. She sprang to her feet.|$|R
60|$|Her hands rested for {{a moment}} caressingly upon his shoulders. A whole world of {{wonderful}} things was shining <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> It was only her lips that were cruel.|$|E
6000|$|Maud Barrington {{regarded}} him steadily, and the smile died <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "But," [...] she said slowly, [...] "is all that quite beyond realization. Could you not bring it about?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was getting}} quieter, {{but she still}} looked wildly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and kept her back turned toward the bit of grass, {{as if she was}} afraid to look in that direction.|$|E
60|$|The gypsy {{woman looked}} at him reproachfully <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> one {{uncovered}} <b>eye.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyebrows {{and looked at me}} wonderingly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> placid blue <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} so strangely submissive {{in her voice}} that he again looked suspiciously at her. But he {{was shocked to see}} that she was quite pale now, and that the fire had gone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dark <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Presently a great wave swept Debby up, and {{stranded}} {{her very}} near him, {{much to her}} confusion and his satisfaction. Shaking the spray <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> she was hurrying away, when Frank said,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bo, {{our host}} {{will soon have}} need of his hunting {{abilities}} if your appetite holds," [...] said Helen, {{as she tried to}} keep her hair <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> while she laced her boots.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Putney {{was silent}} for a moment. [...] "I'm {{satisfied}} with the present, so long as Ralph--" [...] The tears suddenly gushed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and ran down over the fine wrinkles of her plump little cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|Clementina's face brightened. She wanted {{very much}} to go. She should meet some {{pleasant}} people; she always did, at Miss Milray's. Then the light died <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gay <b>eyes,</b> and she set her lips. [...] "No, I told her I shouldn't go." ...|$|R
60|$|Kenneth {{had turned}} {{around on his}} stool and was {{regarding}} old Will Rogers earnestly, brush and pallet alike forgotten. Beth {{was trying to keep}} the tears <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>eyes,</b> for the old man's voice was even more pathetic than his words.|$|R
60|$|She {{was sitting}} upon a rude bench beside the window, {{looking at him}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> great, dark <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... [TIBBY starts off, {{turns back}} and lifts her face. He bends to [...] kiss her, and flinging her arms round his neck, {{she gives him}} a [...] good hug. Then, knuckling the sleep <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> she runs.] ...|$|E
60|$|Angela read it slowly, {{and then}} at length the poison did its work. She did not speak wildly any more, or call upon Arthur; she was stung back to sense, but all the light went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Can you guess,' said Little Dorrit, folding {{her small}} hands tight in one another, {{and looking at}} him with all the earnestness of her soul looking {{steadily}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> 'what I am {{going to ask you}} not to do?' ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{she gave}} a great start--the colour faded <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes,</b> fascinated, gazed in front <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> the pupils dilated.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have always}} been misunderstood," [...] she declared, looking at him pathetically <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{delightful}} <b>eyes.</b> [...] "What you call my flirtations have been simply my attempts, more or less clumsy, to gain a husband.

60|$|She {{looked at}} him reflectively <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dark, full <b>eyes.</b> He looked into them once and turned away--he {{scarcely}} knew why.|$|R
