5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Pillau was ceded to Italy as a war {{prize in}} 1920. Renamed Bari, she was {{commissioned}} in the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in January 1924. She was modified and rebuilt several times <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> In the early years of World War II, she provided gunfire support to Italian troops in several engagements in the Mediterranean. In 1943, she was slated to become an anti-aircraft defense ship, but while awaiting conversion, she was sunk by USAAF bombers in Livorno in June 1943. The wreck was partially scrapped by the Germans in 1944, and ultimately raised for scrapping in January 1948.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire and had taken a step back from his {{businesses}} to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer George R. Lawrence and cartoonist John T.

Further defences were added to the walls until work stopped around 1290. Local disputes remained. De Clare argued with Humphrey de Bohun, the earl of Hereford, in 1290 and the following year the case was brought before the king, resulting in the temporary royal seizure of Caerphilly.|$|E
5|$|The Singapore {{strategy}} was a naval defence {{policy of the}} British Empire that evolved {{in a series of}} war plans from 1919 to 1941. It aimed to deter aggression by the Empire of Japan by providing for a base for a fleet of the Royal Navy in the Far East, able to intercept and defeat a Japanese force heading south towards India or Australia. To be effective it required a well-equipped base; Singapore, at the eastern end of the Strait of Malacca, was chosen in 1919 as the location of this base; work continued on this naval base and its defences <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E

The university operated the Royal Conservatory of Music from 1896 to 1991 and the Royal Ontario Museum from 1912 to 1968; both still retain close ties with the university as independent institutions. The University of Toronto Press was founded in 1901 as Canada's first academic publishing house. The Faculty of Forestry, founded in 1907 with Bernhard Fernow as dean, was Canada's first university faculty devoted to forest science. In 1910, the Faculty of Education opened its laboratory school, the University of Toronto Schools.|$|E

He remains widely regarded as one of British football's all-time great managers.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1940s {{through the}} 1960s, the Triangle was the {{commercial}} and cultural heart of Jerusalem, with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German-Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele. Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 {{and the expansion of}} the city away from the downtown core, the commercial viability of the Triangle declined. The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets of the Triangle to an open-air pedestrian mall in 1982. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing the reputation of the Triangle as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis.|$|E

After a decade as governor of Indiana Territory, Harrison made his reputation fighting the Native Americans, notably at the 1811 Battle of Tippecanoe and, once the War of 1812 began, the British. He was triumphant over both at the Battle of the Thames in 1813. After the war, {{he was elected to}} Congress from Ohio and served in a variety of federal offices <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> A regional Whig candidate for the White House in 1836, he finished second to Van Buren and did not stop running for president until he won the office four years later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} between 1910 and 1920, Auburn High changed from an academy of the classic 19th-century model, {{focusing}} on the traditional Latin course, to a high school offering vocational and technical courses {{in addition to the}} academic offerings. Auburn High added vocational courses to the curriculum in 1918, the eighth high school in the state to implement such a program. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> Auburn High developed its modern extracurricular face, forming band, choir, drama, and other programs, as well as diversifying occupational classes. In 1925, Auburn High {{became one of the first}} high schools in the state to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. A new school building was constructed in 1931, and in 1956, the school was officially renamed Auburn High School.|$|E

These collaborative policies are particularly interesting for countries in Asia seeking access to energy, trade routes in Central Asia and Siberia, and agricultural goods.|$|E

In addition, with no major professional hockey league left to challenge it, the NHL began calling its league champions the world champions, notwithstanding {{the lack of any}} interleague championship. In doing so, the NHL copied a policy that had been adopted by the then still-fledgling National Football League from its start in 1920 (and which the National Basketball Association would also assert upon its founding in 1946).|$|E
5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{took power}} upon deposing his uncle, King Andrianjafy, who had ruled over Imerina Avarandrano (Northern Imerina). Prior to Andrianampoinimerina's reign, Imerina Avarandrano had been locked in {{conflict}} with the three other neighboring provinces of the former kingdom of Imerina that had last been unified under King Andriamasinavalona a century before. Andrianampoinimerina established his capital at the fortified town of Ambohimanga, a site of great spiritual, cultural and political significance that was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001. The king's original royal lodgings can still be visited at Ambohimanga today. From this position, he progressively extended his domain first over all Imerina and then over the greater Highlands, absorbing the Betsileo, Sihanaka, Bezanozano and Bara territories. Having reigned for 23 years {{at the time of his}} death, Andrianampoinimerina had successfully reunited Imerina and vastly expanded the Merina kingdom, with the intent to ultimately unify all of Madagascar under Merina rule. His son and heir, Radama I, continued the conquests Andrianampoinimerina had begun, and <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> largely achieved his father's vision.|$|E

While a member of parliament, in 1798, he married Lord Boringdon's daughter, Theresa, who would bear him ten children <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> After leaving Parliament, Villiers continued his presence at Court, and carried messages from the Princess Royal in Stuttgart to the king. In 1803, the duties of his office as paymaster were extended, and on 9 May, he was reappointed as Paymaster and Inspector-General of Marines, with a salary of £1,000 p.a. In the same year, he was commissioned a captain in the Watford Volunteer Cavalry. Villiers was prepared to intercede with the king on behalf of Pitt to fulfill the latter's desire for a more comprehensive ministry, which, however, was frustrated; and to bring Pitt's friends into the Ministry of All the Talents in 1806.|$|E
