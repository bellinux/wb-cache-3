40|$|Organotin {{compounds}} (OTC) are deposited {{from the}} atmosphere into terrestrial ecosystems and can accumulate in soils. We studied the adsorption and desorption of methyltin and butyltin compounds in organic and mineral soils in batch experiments.

The strength of OTC adsorption correlated well with the carbon content and cation exchange capacity of the soil {{and was in the}} order mono- > di- > tri-substituted OTCs and butyltin > methyltin compounds. The OTC adsorption coefficients were much larger in organic soils (Kd > 104) than in mineral soils. The adsorption and desorption showed a pronounced hysteresis. Trimethyltin adsorption was partly reversible in all soils (desorption 2 – 12 % of the adsorbed amounts). Dimethyltin, tributyltin and dibutyltin exhibited reversible adsorption only in mineral soils (desorption 4 – 33 % of the adsorbed amounts). Mono-substituted OTCs adsorbed almost irreversibly in all soils (desorption < 1 % of adsorbed amounts). Trimethyltin was more mobile and more bioavailable in soils than <b>other</b> <b>OTCs.</b> It might therefore be leached from soils and accumulate in aquatic ecosystems.

40|$|Abstract Background Surveillance of Over-the-Counter {{pharmaceutical}} (OTC) sales as {{a potential}} early indicator of developing public health conditions, in particular in cases of interest to biosurvellance, has been suggested in the literature. This paper {{is a continuation of}} a previous study in which we formulated the problem of estimating clinical data from OTC sales in terms of optimal LMS linear and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters. In this paper we extend our results to predict clinical data multiple steps ahead using OTC sales as well as the clinical data itself. Methods The OTC data are grouped into a few categories and we predict the clinical data using a multichannel filter that encompasses all the past OTC categories as well as the past clinical data itself. The prediction is performed using FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters and the recursive least squares method in order to adapt rapidly to nonstationary behaviour. In addition, we inject simulated events in both clinical and OTC data streams to evaluate the predictions by computing the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves of a threshold detector based on predicted outputs. Results We present all prediction results showing the effectiveness of the combined filtering operation. In addition, we compute and present the performance of a detector using the prediction output. Conclusion Multichannel adaptive FIR least squares filtering provides a viable method of predicting public health conditions, as represented by clinical data, from OTC sales, and/or the clinical data. The potential value to a biosurveillance system cannot, however, be determined without studying this approach in the presence of transient events (nonstationary events of relatively short duration and fast rise times). Our simulated events superimposed on actual OTC and clinical data allow us to provide an upper bound on that potential value under some restricted conditions. Based on our ROC curves we argue that a biosurveillance system can provide early warning of an impending clinical event using ancillary data streams (such as OTC) with established correlations with the clinical data, and a prediction method that can react to nonstationary events sufficiently fast. Whether <b>OTC</b> (or <b>other</b> data streams yet to be identified) provide the best source of predicting clinical data is still an open question. We present a framework and an example to show how to measure the effectiveness of predictions, and compute an upper bound on this performance for the Recursive Least Squares method when the following two conditions are met: (1) an event of sufficient strength exists in both data streams, without distortion, and (2) it occurs in the <b>OTC</b> (or <b>other</b> ancillary streams) earlier than in the clinical data. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To examine consumers' {{confidence}} in their own, and also in <b>other</b> people's, over-the-counter (<b>OTC)</b> skills and to describe their attitude towards the availability of OTC painkillers. Moreover we examined the association between {{confidence in}} OTC skills and attitudes. Design:Cross-sectional survey. Mixed methods (postal and electronic) self-administered questionnaire. Participants: Members of the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel. Main outcome measures: Consumers' {{confidence in their}} own, and in <b>other</b> people's, <b>OTC</b> skills was examined. Confidence was measured by three questions regarding obtaining information on, choosing and using OTC medication. Consumers' attitudes towards availability were assessed using six safety profiles, by asking which channel consumers prefer for each profile. Results: The response rate was 68 % (n= 972). Consumers feel confident about their own OTC skills (mean 3. 74; 95 % CI 3. 69 to 3. 79, on a 5 -point Likert scale), but have less confidence in <b>OTC</b> skills of <b>others</b> (mean 2. 92; 95 % CI 2. 88 to 2. 96). Consumers are conservative in their attitudes towards the availability of OTC painkillers. Most consumers prefer painkillers to be available exclusively in pharmacies (41 - 71 % per profile indicated pharmacy only). Moreover, there is an association between confidence in OTC skills and attitudes (p= 0. 005; β=- 0. 114). Consumers who are more confident about their own OTC skills prefer OTC painkillers to be more generally available. Conclusions: Consumers feel confident about their own OTC skills. However, they would prefer painkillers with safety profiles resembling those currently available OTC, to be available as OTC in pharmacies exclusively. Consumers' confidence in the <b>OTC</b> skills of <b>others</b> is more consistent with their attitudes towards availability of OTC painkillers. Until consumers themselves realise that they are {{also one of the}} others, they may overestimate their own OTC skills, which may entail health risks. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

Insights from market microstructure theory and analogies with <b>other</b> <b>OTC</b> markets, in par-ticular the TRACE system in the corporate bond market, suggest that increased transparency primarily benefits uninformed traders, while in-formed market participants–large dealers, market makers and some large buy–side firms – are likely to bear its costs.

However, little is known of patient experiences of pharmacy distribution and services related to OTC medicines. The {{aim of this study}} is to explore patient experiences of purchasing OTC medicines in Flemish community pharmacies. Method Data were gathered from an anonymous postal questionnaire survey of patients purchasing OTC medicines in a random sample of Flemish community pharmacies in April 2008. The self-administered questionnaire related to the most recent purchase of OTC medicines by a patient in a community pharmacy. The questionnaire included questions about: (a) sources of information about OTC medicines; (b) the patient relationship with pharmacist and physician; (c) organization and layout of the pharmacy; (d) distribution channels; and (e) patient satisfaction. Questions were generally measured using Likert scales. The questionnaire was piloted among patients. Results One hundred and fifty-five pharmacies consented to distribute questionnaires to five patients each, yielding a total of 358 useable questionnaires (response rate of 46 %). The first point of contact about OTC medicines was the pharmacist (61 % of patients), followed by the physician (29 %). Newspapers and the internet were not viewed as primary sources of advice on OTC medicines. Patients tended to purchase OTC medicines for the acute treatment of pain, gastro-intestinal conditions, common cold, cough or musculo-skeletal pain. More than 75 % of patients felt that pharmacists provided sufficient information about the health condition and OTC medicine use.
