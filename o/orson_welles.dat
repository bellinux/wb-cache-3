5|$|Chimes at Midnight (onscreen {{title and}} UK title: Falstaff (Chimes at Midnight), Spanish release: Campanadas a medianoche), is a 1965 English-language Spanish-Swiss co-produced film {{directed}} by and starring <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles.</b> The film's plot centres on William Shakespeare's recurring character Sir John Falstaff and the father-son relationship he has with Prince Hal, who must choose between loyalty to his father, King Henry IV, or Falstaff.|$|E
5|$|In March 2004 an Internet hoax stated rumours about a lost 1956 {{version of}} Moonraker by <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles,</b> and a James Bond web site {{repeated}} it on April Fool's Day in 2004 as a hoax. Supposedly, this recently discovered lost film was 40 minutes of raw footage with Dirk Bogarde as Bond, Welles as Drax, and Peter Lorre as Drax's henchman.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{follows the}} {{conflicts}} of the Varner family after ambitious drifter Ben Quick (Newman) arrives in their small Mississippi town.

5|$|Back in the West End, Richardson was {{in another}} Sherriff play, The White Carnation, in 1953, and in November {{of the same year}} he and Gielgud starred {{together}} in NCHunter's A Day by the Sea, which ran at the Haymarket for 386 performances. During this period, Richardson played Dr Watson in an American/BBC radio co-production of Sherlock Holmes stories, with Gielgud as Holmes and <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles</b> as the evil Professor Moriarty. These recordings were later released commercially on disc.|$|E
5|$|Campbell Playhouse (CBS Radio, March 31, 1939). Directed and {{introduced}} by <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles.</b> This was a non-musical {{version of the}} story that was based more closely on Edna Ferber's novel than on the musical. From the original stage cast Helen Morgan repeated her portrayal of Julie, here singing one song not from the musical. Welles portrayed Cap'n Andy, Margaret Sullavan was Magnolia, and author Edna Ferber made her acting debut as Parthy. This version made Julie into an illegal alien who must be deported.|$|E
5|$|When {{producer}} Kevin McClory {{had first}} planned {{the film in}} 1964 he held initial talks with Richard Burton for the part of Bond, although the project came to nothing because of the legal issues involved. When the Warhead project was launched in the late 1970s, a number of actors were mentioned in the trade press, including <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles</b> for the part of Blofeld, Trevor Howard to play M and Richard Attenborough as director.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Welles's {{daughter}} Beatrice Welles sued Turner Entertainment, {{claiming the}} Welles estate {{is the legal}} copyright holder of the film. She claimed that Welles's deal to terminate his contracts with RKO meant that Turner's copyright of the film was null and void. She also claimed that the estate of <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles</b> was owed 20% of the film's profits if her copyright claim was not upheld. In 2007 she was allowed {{to proceed with the}} lawsuit, overturning the 2004 decision in favor of Turner Entertainment on the issue of video rights.|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{research}} {{also notes that}} Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a BNC Mitchell, the other a handheld French Éclair camera which <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles</b> had used in Touch of Evil (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a Moviola on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor George Tomasini worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.|$|E
5|$|The film {{attracted}} {{attention for}} {{the appearance of}} <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles</b> as Will Varner, the patriarch of the family. 20th Century Fox wanted to avoid the casting of Welles due to his temperament, but the studio was persuaded by Ritt, who considered him the right actor for the role. The director and the actor had several marked differences during the shooting of the movie, which included problems with {{the interpretation of the}} lines, costume design and the position of Welles while shooting the scenes. At one point during the production, Welles informed Ritt {{that he did not want}} to memorize his lines, requesting instead that they be dubbed afterwards. Part of the cast was intimidated by Welles' temperamental attitude.|$|E

5|$|Gert Fröbe as Auric Goldfinger: A wealthy, psychopathic man {{obsessed with}} gold. <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles</b> was {{considered}} as Goldfinger, but his financial demands were too high; Theodore Bikel auditioned for the role, but failed. Fröbe was cast because the producers saw his {{performance as a}} child molester in the German film Es geschah am hellichten Tag. Fröbe, who spoke little English, said his lines phonetically, but was too slow. To redub him, he had to double the speed of his performance {{to get the right}} tempo. The only time his real voice is heard is during his meeting with members of the Mafia at Auric Stud. Bond is hidden below the model of Fort Knox whilst Fröbe's natural voice can be heard above. However, he was redubbed {{for the rest of the}} film by stage actor Michael Collins.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Miller portrayed {{a police}} {{inspector}} in Terence Young's One Night with You, which also featured a young Christopher Lee {{in a minor}} role. After an uncredited role as an Italian waiter at the Savoy Hotel in The Blind Goddess (1948), he had a substantial role as George II of England in Anthony Kimmins's biopic Bonnie Prince Charlie about the Jacobite Risings alongside David Niven, who portrayed Charles II. In 1949, he appeared as Tony the café proprietor in Lawrence Huntington's Man on the Run; a customer in Jack Warner's The Huggetts Abroad; Leon Stolz in Arthur Crabtree's Don't Ever Leave Me alongside Petula Clark and Jimmy Hanley; and had uncredited roles as black marketeer Herr Schindler in I Was a Male War Bride and as a headwaiter in the classic film noir The Third Man opposite <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles</b> and Joseph Cotten.|$|E
5|$|Josef von Sternberg was {{directing}} in Hollywood at {{the same}} time. Films of his such as Shanghai Express (1932) and The Devil Is a Woman (1935), with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style, anticipated central elements of classic noir. The commercial and critical success of Sternberg's silent Underworld (1927) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films. Successful films in that genre such as Little Caesar (1931), The Public Enemy (1931) and Scarface (1932) demonstrated {{that there was an}} audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists. An important, possibly influential, cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism, with its romantic, fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes. The movement's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang (1932), a forerunner of noir. Among films not considered films noir, perhaps none had a greater effect {{on the development of the}} genre than Citizen Kane (1941), directed by <b>Orson</b> <b>Welles.</b> Its visual intricacy and complex, voiceover narrative structure are echoed in dozens of classic films noir.|$|E
