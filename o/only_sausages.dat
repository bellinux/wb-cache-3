40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the quality of {{selected}} meat products, which are offered under private labels on the Czech market. Four types of meat products (ham salami, Debrecen roast, Vysočina sausage, Poličan sausage) from four retail chains (A, B, C, D) were subjected to laboratory and sensory analyses in order to determine their quality. The total number of 128 meat product samples in eight different batches was measured from March to November 2014. Instrumental analysis included determination of salt content, dry matter, fat, and water activity (<b>only</b> Vysočina <b>sausage</b> and Poličan sausage). Sensory evaluation covered an assessment of the texture quality, appearance after slicing, smell and taste. The results were compared with Decree 264 / 2003 Coll. and statistically evaluated. It was found that all products meet all legal requirements. Only in Debrecen roast the salt content was exceeded in some batches, and the fat content in one batch. However, the average value of all eight batches corresponded to the values declared on the packaging. The best products were evaluated as follows: ham salami B and C, Kladno roast D (ranked Debrecen roast), Vysočina sausage B and Poličan sausage B.

40|$|Irradiated samples {{had higher}} thiobarbituric acid {{reactive}} substances (TBARS) than nonirradiated at day 0 {{but the difference}} disappeared during storage in both packaging types. Storage increased the production of volatiles and changed the composition of volatiles <b>only</b> in aerobic-packaged <b>sausage.</b> Irradiation and the fatty acid composition had significant effects on lipid oxidation, volatile production, and sensory characteristics of cooked pork sausages during storage but that oxygen availability had a stronger effect than irradiation and fatty acid composition. Storage increased the production of volatiles and changed the composition of volatiles <b>only</b> in aerobicpackaged <b>sausage.</b> Among the volatile components, 1 -heptene and 1 -nonene were influenced most by irradiation dose, and aldehydes by packaging type. The TBARS values and volatiles of vacuum-packaged irradiated cooked sausage had very low correlation. The TBARS, however, had very high correlation {{with the amount of}} aldehydes and total volatiles, and ketones and alcohols with long retention times in aerobic-packaged pork sausage. The low correlations of irradiation-dependent volatiles (e. g., 1 -heptene and 1 -nonene) with TBARS values regardless of packaging and storage conditions indicated that volatile compounds responsible for irradiation odor were different from those of lipid oxidation odor in cooked pork sausages. Irradiation of cooked pork sausage, especially at 4. 5 kGy and in aerobic packaging, may result in some diminution of typical meaty aromas and increases in an odor described by the panelists in this study as like wet wool or wet animal hair. The training and controlled test situation used in this study may result in greater discrimination in the panel than would exist in most consumers. Whether the changes caused by irradiation would be noticed by consumers or reduce the acceptability of the product to consumers was not addressed in this study. The data obtained suggest that TBARS values may not be useful in predicting the odor changes in cooked irradiated meat products...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of irradiation on the chemical attributes of sausages, TBARS values, volatile compounds, gas compounds, and hydrocarbons of vacuum-packaged sausages were analyzed during 60 d of refrigerated storage. A sulfur-containing volatile compound (dimethyl disulfide), a gas compound (methane), and radiation-induced hydrocarbons (1 -tetradecene, pentadecane, heptadecane, 8 -heptadecene, eicosane, 1, 7 -hexadecadiene, hexadecane) were mainly detected in irradiated sausages, and the concentrations of the compounds were irradiation dosedependent. Especially methane and a few hydrocarbons were detected <b>only</b> in irradiated <b>sausages</b> and their amounts were dose-dependent. On the other hand, TBARS values, other off-odor volatiles (carbon disulfide, hexanal), and gas compounds (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide) were found both in irradiated and nonirradiated sausages. Therefore, it is suggested that irradiation-induced hydrocarbons (1 -tetradecene, pentadecane, heptadecane, 8 -heptadecene, eicosane, 1, 7 -hexadecadiene, hexadecane), dimethyl disulfide, and methane can be used as markers for irradiated sausages...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{microbial}} ecology of three naturally fermented sausages produced in northeast Italy was studied by culture-dependent and -independent methods. By plating analysis, {{the predominance of}} lactic acid bacteria populations was pointed out, {{as well as the}} importance of coagulase-negative cocci. Also in the case of one fermentation, the fecal enterocci reached significant counts, highlighting their contribution to the particular transformation process. Yeast counts were higher than the detection limit (> 100 CFU/g) in <b>only</b> one fermented <b>sausage.</b> Analysis of the denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) patterns and sequencing of the bands allowed profiling of {{the microbial}} populations present in the sausages during fermentation. The bacterial ecology was mainly characterized by the stable presence of Lactobacillus curvatus and Lactobacillus sakei, but Lactobacillus paracasei was also repeatedly detected. An important piece of evidence was the presence of Lactococcus garvieae, which clearly contributed in two fermentations. Several species of Staphylococcus were also detected. Regarding other bacterial groups, Bacillus sp., Ruminococcus sp., and Macrococcus caseolyticus were also identified {{at the beginning of the}} transformations. In addition, yeast species belonging to Debaryomyces hansenii, several Candida species, and Willopsis saturnus were observed in the DGGE gels. Finally, cluster analysis of the bacterial and yeast DGGE profiles highlighted the uniqueness of the fermentation processes studied. Copyright © 2005, American Society for Microbiology.

Six genotypic groups were distinguished {{on the basis of}} Rep-polymerase chain reaction with the GTG 5 primer, some of which were found <b>only</b> in the <b>sausages</b> ripened at temperatures lower than 10 °C for the first two months and lower than 16 °C for the remaining three months, according to the traditional ripening process. Six strains were selected as representative of the genotypic profiles and further characterised.

None of the strains produced histamine or tyramine in vitro. One strain was able to slightly inhibit Listeria (L.) monocytogenes and L. innocua and all six strains were able to slightly inhibit Enterobacteriaceae isolated from Ventricina del Vastese sausages in vitro. Results showed that most L. sakei strains can have a role in improving the safety of low acidity fermented sausages, even though a limited acidifying capacity was observed in a meat-like substrate, and that L. sakei strains able to produce biogenic amines are unlikely to occur in spontaneously fermented meat products...|$|R
40|$|Standing fast sausage modes in flare loops were {{suggested}} {{to account for}} {{a considerable number of}} quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in the light curves of solar flares. This study continues our investigation into the possibility to invert the measured periods P and damping times τ of sausage modes to deduce the transverse Alfvén time R/v_ Ai, density contrast ρ_ i/ρ_ e, and the steepness of the density distribution transverse to flare loops. A generic dispersion relation (DR) governing linear sausage modes is derived for pressureless cylinders where density inhomogeneity of arbitrary form takes place within the cylinder. We show that in general the inversion problem is under-determined for QPP events where <b>only</b> a single <b>sausage</b> mode exists, be the measurements spatially resolved or unresolved. While R/v_ Ai can be inferred to some extent, the range of possible steepness parameters may be too broad to be useful. However, for spatially resolved measurements where an additional mode is present, it is possible to deduce self-consistently ρ_ i/ρ_ e, the profile steepness, and the internal Alfvén speed v_ Ai. We show that at least for a recent QPP event that involves a fundamental kink mode in addition to a sausage one, flare loop parameters are well constrained, even if the specific form of the transverse density distribution remains unknown. We conclude that spatially resolved, multi-mode QPP measurements need to be pursued for inferring flare loop parameters. Comment: 25 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication in Solar Physic...|$|R
40|$|Summary- Criteria for the {{selection}} of lactic acid bacteria (LAS) with application in meat fermenta-tion are: i) suitability for propagation and preparation of starter cultures; and ii) safe performance in the fermenting substrate. The selection has to take in consideration the various, specifie requirements of the fermentation process. In Europe these are usually best fulfilled by strains of Lactobacillus curva-tus (L curvatus) and L sake. Sorne strains of L curvatus exhibit the potential to form tyramine and/or phenylethylamine {{and should not be}} used. Strains of L sake are free of this potential. Suitable isolates should be competitive and suppress the growth of undesired organisms. The formation by the strains of bacteriocin (for example curvacin A) can increase their competitiveness. A final proof of the suitability of the isolate is obtained in practical tests. An improvement of LAS in starter cultures can be achieved by either combining compatible strains to increase the overall metabolic activity above that level pre-sent in one single strain or by genetic modification. We have cloned and expressed in L sake and L cur-vatus the genes coding for catalase (katA) and Iysostaphin (lys) by use of vectors derived from LAS plasmids. Catalase activity is a technological important property not present in L curvatus. Its expres-sion was subjected to regulation in response to oxygen as it was observed in the gene donor L sake. Alter removing repetitive sequences in lys, the transformed strains of L sake and L curvatus acquired the potential to kill staphylococci not <b>only</b> in fermenting <b>sausages</b> but also in mayonnaise-based sal-ads...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{preincubation}} at 4 °C, 20 °C and 37 °C {{and the effect}} of preincubation as planktonic cells or cells attached to surfaces for 48 or 96 h at 37 °C on the subsequent behaviour of Listeria monocytogenes during storage on chilled processed meats was determined. Two L. monocytogenes strains were grown in Tryptic Soy Broth under the above preincubation conditions, inoculated at ∼ 6 log cfu g- 1 onto slices of both bologna and summer sausage, vacuum packaged and incubated at 4 °C for 6 weeks. Initially and at weekly intervals L. monocytogenes numbers were determined by plating samples on Modifed Oxford Agar followed by incubation at 37 °C for 48 h. Results indicated that under all preincubation conditions both strains could grow on the bologna and not on the summer sausage. Preincubation at 4 °C resulted in a reduced lag phase of both strains of the pathogen on bologna as compared to the other temperatures. Preincubation at 37 °C, on the other hand, resulted in reduced survival in one strain <b>only</b> on summer <b>sausage</b> as compared to the other temperatures. Preincubation under attached conditions for 48 h had no effect on the growth of either strain on the bologna, but enhanced survival of one of the strains on summer sausage as compared to 96 h attached and planktonic growth conditions. The importance of preincubation conditions to the growth and survival kinetics of L. monocytogenes on foods was confirmed by the present study and existing data was extended to include specific meat products. More significantly, however, a novel preincubation effect was described and the role of strain-dependent variations with respect to kinetic and predictive studies was highlighted. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Peel and kernel often {{discarded}} during mango processing, {{are potential}} sources of antioxidants and could be utilised as additives to preserve meat products. The cultivar, physicochemical characteristics and stage of maturity are important factors that influence the antioxidant activity of mango flesh, peel and kernel. The cultivar Tommy Atkins, imported into New Zealand and the four cultivars; “Cat Hoa Loc”, “Cat Chu”, Ghep” and “Nam Dok Mai” grown in Vietnam were compared to determine which of the cultivars have antioxidant potential. Tommy Atkins and Nam Dok Mai were less mature than the other three Vietnamese cultivars based on maturity score, firmness, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA) and Vitamin C. The antioxidant capacity of the mango flesh from all the cultivars ranged from 252. 6 to 754. 4 GAE 100 g⁻¹ DW, (total phenolic content), 43. 6 to 70. 0 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (ABTS radical scavenging activity) and 30 to 51. 6 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (DPPH radical scavenging activity). Mango peel antioxidant capacity was higher than flesh and ranged from 822. 3 to 8084. 9 GAE 100 g⁻¹ DW (total phenolic content), 406. 3 to 1188. 3 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (ABTS radical scavenging activity) and 210. 6 to 735. 4 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (DPPH radical scavenging activity). The antioxidant capacity values of mango kernel was the highest and ranged from 6286. 0 to 13888. 8 GAE 100 g⁻¹ DW (total phenolic content), 1066. 3 to 2227. 6 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (ABTS radical scavenging activity) and 667. 4 to 2205. 7 µmol TE g⁻¹ DW (DPPH radical scavenging activity). Flesh from Tommy Atkins and Cat Chu contained the highest antioxidant capacity than flesh from any other cultivar. Kernel from Tommy Atkins had the highest antioxidant capacity than any other cultivar whereas peel from Nam Dok Mai contained the highest antioxidant capacity than peel from any other cultivar. In all the cultivars investigated, kernel showed the highest content of total phenolic content and antioxidant capacities followed by peel then flesh, except for Nam Dok Mai whose kernel and peel contained similar antioxidant capacities. The tannin content was significantly higher in kernel (21. 3 - 54. 7 g kg⁻¹ DW), than peel (7. 9 - 22. 9 g kg⁻¹ DW) than flesh (0. 9 - 1. 1 g kg⁻¹ DW) in all the cultivars. There were no oxalates detected in flesh {{in any of the}} cultivars. Small amounts of oxalates were detected in peel from all the cultivars and in kernel from Nam Dok Mai and Tommy Atkins. Peel and kernel from Cat Chu contained low levels of tannins and oxalates and are possible sources of antioxidants to prevent oxidative damage in food products. Drying is usually used to produce dried products that can be mechanically incorporated into foods. Freeze, sun, vacuum and microwave drying reduced the hydrophilic antioxidants and antioxidant capacity of mango flesh whilst forced-air drying increased the total phenolic content (TPC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). In the case of peel, all the drying treatments reduced hydrophilic and lipophilic oxygen radical absorbance capacity (H-ORAC and L-ORAC) whilst microwave and freeze drying increased TPC and FRAP. For kernel, vacuum, followed by freeze drying increased the H-ORAC values and antioxidant capacity as measured by ABTS, DPPH and FRAP whilst the other drying treatments reduced the antioxidant activities. The relationship between the physicochemical parameters (maturity) of Tommy Atkins mango fruits with the antioxidant capacity of their flesh, peel and kernel fractions as measured by their total phenolic content, ABTS, DPPH, FRAP, H-ORAC and L-ORAC activities was investigated. The physicochemical properties firmness, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, TSS:TA, vitamin C and moisture content were significantly correlated (p < 0. 05) with the stage of maturity of the Tommy Atkins mango fruits. Thus, any one of the measured physicochemical parameters could be used as an indicator of fruit maturity in Tommy Atkins. All the antioxidant assays TPC, ABTS, DPPH, FRAP and H-ORAC were significantly correlated (p < 0. 05) to each other indicating that phenolics in flesh, peel and kernel are good sources of antioxidants. In mango peel, only weak-to-moderate correlations were found between the lipophilic antioxidants (H-ORAC) and hydrophilic antioxidants (H-ORAC) or antioxidant capacity as measured by TPC, ABTD, DPPH and FRAP. Mango kernel from the less ripe mangoes with low maturity score, TSS, TSS:TA ratio and a high TA, firmness and vitamin C content were relatively high in antioxidant capacity relative to those from ripe mangoes. Peel colour was an unreliable index of the maturity of Tommy Atkins fruit or the antioxidant capacity of their peel, flesh and kernel. The incorporation of freeze dried mango peel (1 % w/w) or kernel (1 % w/w) into pork sausages or patties on inhibiting lipid oxidation was investigated over a 10 day chilled storage period. There were small changes in TBARS (2 -thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) and myoglobin over the first 4 days whilst off-odours and volatiles increased at day 4 in the control pork sausages and patties without any antioxidants. The volatiles, 1 -pentanol (44. 0 %) and 3 -hydroxyl- 2 -butanone (45. 8 %) in the sausages and hexanal (36. 6 %), pentanal (10. 8 %) and 1 -pentanol (14. 6 %) in the patties were all identified as products of lipid oxidation and were generated by day 4. More volatiles, particularly hexanal, were released in the patties than in the sausages. The addition of mango kernel (1 % w/w) or peel (1 % w/w) or synthetic antioxidant BHT (0. 01 % w/w) to the sausages and patties immediately changed TBARS (<b>only</b> observed in <b>sausages),</b> myoglobin and volatiles at day zero but there was no effect on colour or odour. The redness of sausages was reduced and the discoloration (hue) increased dramatically at day 2 and remained unchanged across the remainder of the storage period whilst the colour of the patties decreased gradually from day 0 to day 10. The addition of mango kernel, peel and BHT stabilised the colour of the sausages and patties especially the redness across the 10 day storage period. The antioxidative effects of the additives were more pronounced after day 4 when the addition of mango kernel or peel or BHT to the sausages and patties inhibited lipid oxidation as shown by the maintenance of stable TBARS, colour (a* and hue) and myoglobin and a reduction in off-odour and volatiles, compared to the controls. The addition of peel or BHT maintained the pleasant odour of pork sausages and patties for up to 4 days of storage and kernel for 6 days. At 10 days, the mean TBARS values of the low (9. 1 % fat), medium (22. 2 %) and high (47. 4 %) fat control sausages were between 12. 1 to 15. 0 µmol MDA kg⁻¹ DW and sausages with added kernel between 3. 1 to 3. 8 µmol MDA kg⁻¹ DW. For patties, at 10 days, the TBARS values of control low, medium and high fat patties ranged from 12. 3 to 29. 2 µmol MDA kg⁻¹ DW and those with kernel from 6. 9 to 7. 9 µmol MDA kg⁻¹ DW. Mango kernel was more effective than peel or BHT in inhibiting lipid oxidation over the 10 day storage period. There was also an effect of the fat content (9. 1 to 47. 4 % fat) of the product on the effectiveness of the added antioxidants to inhibit lipid oxidation. The TBARS in patties and the discoloration and loss in redness of the patties and sausages were higher in the high (47. 4 % fat) compared to low (9. 1 %) fat products. Furthermore, at 6 days for sausages and 4 days for patties the inhibitory effects on lipid oxidation was more effective with kernel than peel or BHT in the high and medium fat products. Pork sausages with added kernel under O₂- permeable film at 4 ºC were assessed to be microbiologically safe to consume over a 10 day storage period. Pork patties had a high TVC and were contaminated with E. coli and were assessed unsuitable for human consumption. The dried kernel and peel products themselves were judged microbiologically safe to use as food supplements. In addition, mango kernel exhibited antimicrobial effects against E. coli, staphylococci, coliforms, yeasts and moulds and TVC in the pork sausages. Freeze dried mango kernel or peel contained antioxidants and if added to pork products extended their shelf life by inhibiting lipid oxidation (TBARS) and preventing changes in colour and odour. Kernel showed the highest antioxidant capacity, compared to peel or synthetic BHT. Dried mango kernel extended the shelf life of pork products for an additional 4 (patties) or 6 (sausages) days compared to patties or sausages without mango additives. In summary, dried mango kernel is an excellent natural source of antioxidants and prevents undesirable oxidative damage in pork products...|$|R
