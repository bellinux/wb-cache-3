5|$|In 1988, {{a single}} road closure (resulting from a gas leak <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> road in Wandsworth) caused severe {{congestion}} {{along the entire}} South Circular. A representative from Scotland Yard's Central Communications complex said the inadequate design of the road was indicative of several single points of failure in the London road network.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study by}} economists at St Gallen University credit rating {{agencies}} have fuelled rising euro zone indebtedness by issuing more severe downgrades since the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in 2009. The authors concluded that rating agencies were not consistent in their judgments, on average rating Portugal, Ireland, and Greece 2.3 notches lower than under pre-crisis standards, eventually forcing them to seek international aid. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> note: as of end of November 2013 only three countries in the eurozone retain AAA ratings from Standard & Poor, i.e. Germany, Finland and Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|As of 2007, the brewing {{industry}} is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. As of 2006, more than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons), {{the equivalent of a}} cube 510 metres <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>side,</b> of beer are sold per year, producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion). In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 million hectolitres (45 billion litres), or nearly twice that of the United States, but only 5 per cent sold were premium draught beers, compared with 50 per cent in France and Germany.|$|E

5|$|The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is {{an image}} of a small region in the {{constellation}} Ursa Major, constructed from a series of observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. It covers an area about 2.6 arcminutes <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>side,</b> about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in angular size to a tennis ball at a distance of 100metres. The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 over ten consecutive days between December 18 and December 28, 1995.|$|E
5|$|This system {{continued}} {{the tradition of}} having separate base units for geometrically related dimensions, e.g., mètre for lengths, are (100m2) for areas, stère (1m3) for dry capacities, and litre (1 dm3) for liquid capacities. The hectare, equal to a hundred ares, the area of a square 100 metres <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> (about 2.47 acres), is still in use. The early metric system included only a few prefixes from milli (one thousandth) to myria (ten thousand).|$|E
5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E

5|$|The new wing has six dormers (three <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>side),</b> and six dormers {{were added}} to the old house in the 1913 {{renovation}} (four on the east side, two on the west). The windows {{on the first floor of}} the new wing matched the old windows, but the windows in the second story of the addition have twelve panes in the upper sash and eight in the lower. As part of the renovation work, four new windows were placed in the 1850s house: two just west of the new wing, and two on the east wall of the lower part of the L. A small porch was added in the corner where the west wall of the new wing meets the north wall of the old house, and all the old porches were restored. In the original house two chimneys were restored and two replaced, and new fireplaces were installed in the living room, library, and dining room. The house has a total of 28 rooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{terminus}} of the Rother Navigation was <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>side</b> stream, at {{the southern}} edge of Midhurst. There was a wharf and basin, close to a road which is still called The Wharf, and an ashlar bridge crosses the navigation between the wharf and the junction with the main river. It was built in 1794, and was restored in 1977 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The first lock was near Little Topham farm. There was a lock cut across a loop to the north. Costers Brook, which flows north from springs near Cocking, and then alongside the river for a short distance, joins below the site of the lock. The bridge at South Ambersham was built of stone rubble in 1791, with a main arch across the navigation and a smaller arch to the north, which has been repaired with brick. Moorland Lock was on a straight cut across a large meander to the south, close to Moorlands Farm. Lodsbridge Lock also bypasses a meander to the south, which fed Lodsbridge Mill. The mill building dates from the eighteenth century, and has been converted into a house. The seventeenth-century timber-framed mill house is also a listed building. There was a motte castle immediately to the south of the mill. A modern timber yard and saw mill is located {{to the north of the}} lock site, and Lods Bridge, which carries a minor road over the river, dates from the construction of the navigation. The River Lod joins on the north bank just below the bridge.|$|E

In real measurements, the smallest has a length of one kilometer <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>side,</b> and the largest has a length of four kilometers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>side.</b> The size of a region and its layout of segments can be changed in a bitmap file provided for each region.|$|E
