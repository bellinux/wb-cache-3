5|$|The history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambulance</b> {{begins in}} ancient times, {{with the use}} of carts to {{transport}} incurable patients by force. Ambulances were first used for emergency transport in 1487 by the Spanish, and civilian variants were put into operation during the 1830s. Advances in technology throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to the modern self-powered ambulances.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambulance.</b> Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which ambulance operators can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|E

5|$|Ambulances {{often have}} two manufacturers. The first is {{frequently}} {{a manufacturer of}} light trucks or full-size vans (or previously, cars) such as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, or Ford. The second manufacturer (known as second stage manufacturer) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat) and turns it into an ambulance by adding bodywork, emergency vehicle equipment, and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods – either coachbuilding, where the modifications are started from scratch and built on to the vehicle, or using a modular system, where a pre-built 'box' is put on to the empty chassis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambulance,</b> and then finished off.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, <b>the</b> {{development}} <b>of</b> {{decision support}} tools for dynamic ambulance relocation and automatic ambulance dispatching is described. <b>The</b> <b>ambulance</b> dispatch {{problem is to}} choose which ambulance to send to a patient. <b>The</b> dynamic <b>ambulance</b> relocation problem occurs in <b>the</b> operational control <b>of</b> <b>ambulances.</b> <b>The</b> objective is to find new locations for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambulances,</b> to increase <b>the</b> preparedness in <b>the</b> area <b>of</b> responsibility.
