It's kind of like a bale of cotton has been <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and now it's off", said Doby. When he received word about his election it was via telephone call from fellow Hall member Ted Williams. Upon hearing of Doby's election, Gene Mauch, said, [...] "You have {{to be some kind of}} special person to go through what Larry and Jackie Robinson went through. They both are. I'm not too sure there's a player in the game today who could handle it." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} his Piano Sonata No. 3 (1973), [...] "a formidable piece of abstract composition" [...] according to Bowen, Tippett {{returned to the}} modern vernacular in his fourth opera The Ice Break (1976). Describing the music in {{an introduction to the}} published libretto, Tippett identifies [...] "two archetypal sounds: one relating to the frightening but exhilarating sound of the ice breaking on the great northern rivers in the spring; the other related to the exciting or terrifying sound of the slogan-shouting crowds, which can lift you <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> in triumph, or stamp you to death". [...] Although the work was generally regarded as a critical and public failure, aspects of its music have been recognised as among Tippett's best. The critic John Warrack writes that, after the violence of the opening acts, the third act's music has a lyrical warmth comparable to that of The Midsummer Marriage". William Mann in The Times [...] was equally enthusiastic, finding the music compelling and worthy of many a rehearing.|$|E
500|$|Joey Thurmond of Push Square wrote how playing {{through the}} {{campaign}} from Modern Warfare {{reminded him of}} its sheer memorability and how it had long endured with fans compared with other games in the series, saying [...] "there's tension and gravity shot through the experience, {{as if the world}} is <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> to push past every enemy line with explosive bravado or exacting stealth. [...] There's a grounded feel to player characters that make you another cog in the machine with the abilities and limitations of an ordinary soldier, not a supernatural saviour." [...] He praised the game's graphical enhancements, saying [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered looks and sounds like a fresh game on par with today's graphical and aural standards" [...] and calling it a [...] "ridiculously faithful remake", but wrote that the game still showed some slight signs of age, such as artificial intelligence problems and pacing issues. In short, he commended Raven Software [...] "for arguably delivering the most substantial, masterful remake we have ever experienced", and that [...] "Modern Warfare Remastered celebrates this legacy with updated visuals and sound that really go above and beyond the call of duty, sprucing up an old care package for a more modern age to near-perfection." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Christopher had {{performed}} this service for some time, {{a little child}} asked him to take him across the river. During the crossing, the river became swollen and the child seemed as heavy as lead, so much that Christopher could scarcely carry him and found himself in great difficulty. When he finally reached the other side, {{he said to the}} child: [...] "You have put me in the greatest danger. I do not think the whole world could have been as heavy on my shoulders as you were." [...] The child replied: [...] "You had <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulders</b> not only the whole world but Him who made it. I am Christ your king, whom you are serving by this work." [...] The child then vanished.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, young Habib {{spent his}} summer {{vacations}} in Monastir, among women who he helped with chores: help the servant called Fatma, bring the Baklava tray {{to the oven}} of uncle Hamida, monitor cooking then basting a ladle of honey or participating in the olive grove process. He also {{spent a lot of}} time with his father who insisted that he pursued with a studious education so he could avoid Ali's fate in the army: [...] "I do not want you to be cut back like a workhorse. I do not want you to be like me, sentenced to wear a kit <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> all day long", did he say to his son. At the end of the holidays, he returned to his brother's in Tunis where, after lessons, he strolled streets and admired the bey coming, on each Thursday to the Kasbah, to chair the seal ceremony. He was also marked with the 2011 Jellaz Affair which ended with the execution of Manoubi Djardjar in Bab Saadoun, where he noticed the hostility and mocking laughter of preponderants. The exiles and repression following the Tramway boycott aiming to protest against the Jellaz issue, soon created an atmosphere of revolt and contestation.|$|E

2500|$|Richie {{spoke to}} Inside Soap about Alfie's reaction, {{saying that when}} he discovers {{it is one of}} the three Branning brothers, it [...] "really tips him over the edge, and Alfie becomes a monster. He finally gets some balls and decides enough is enough. He tells Kat that he doesn't care about her anymore—he says she's filthy and disgusting. Alfie has kept going with Kat for the sake of their love and their history. But if he can't forgive her for this latest indiscretion, there's no way they can keep their family together." [...] He said that he and Wallace had [...] "a vested interest" [...] to get the scenes right, [...] "because our bosses gave us such a great opportunity. We spent a lot of time working on it—and I hope we've ticked every box." [...] Richie called the bedsit scene [...] "fantastic" [...] and told the BBC, [...] "It's very rare you get a 15-minute scene with two people in one room". He {{explained}} that he and Wallace spent a lot of time with the episode's director, Karl Neilson, [...] "just going over stuff, finding out where the emotions were, who was the victim, who was on the offensive, who was on the defensive", where usually there are no rehearsals. Richie also revealed that the bedsit set was a [...] "tiny space" [...] that was purposely built for the episodes, which Richie said was [...] "quite claustrophobic". He called it a [...] "square room [...] nowhere to hide", with [...] "every blink of the eye, every look, every frown, every sigh" [...] being seen, adding [...] "if you're looking angry, it's there to be seen, you're naked to it". He said he [...] "loved" [...] that about filming the episode, and said, [...] "you work hard to try and be as good an actor as you can and then you're given an opportunity by the BBC and by EastEnders to step up to the mark. Lorraine [...] believing that two actors could do that—it's a bit of a pressure <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>shoulders,</b> but me and Jessie loved it." [...] Richie and Wallace filmed the episode about two months before it was broadcast.|$|E
