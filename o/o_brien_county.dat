40|$|Planthoppers {{constitute}} {{a large group}} of phytophagous insects in the order Hemiptera and family Fulgoroidea including more than 9000 described species with division into 19 families distributed worldwide (<b>O</b> <b>Brien</b> and Wilson 1985). These insects occupy extensive ranges of habitats (Denno and Roderick 1990), and some major agri-cultural pests are included (Wilson and <b>O</b> <b>Brien</b> 1987). The Fulgoroidea consists of common her-bivores in both agricultural and natural systems, often causing severe damage to their host plants. Attention has focused on a number of planthopper species because of large damage incurred by the crops of maize, rice, wheat, and forage grasses. Several species of delphacids exhibit high repro-ductive potentials and dispersal capabilities which allow them to track changes in favorable resources and therefore predispose them to be agricultural pests (Denno and Roderick 1990).
