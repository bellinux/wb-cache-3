5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1707 Acts of Union, many regiments of the English and Scottish armies were {{combined}} under one operational command and stationed in the Netherlands for the War of the Spanish Succession. Although all the regiments were now part of the new British military establishment, they remained under the old operational-command structure and retained much of the institutional ethos, customs and traditions of the standing armies created shortly after the restoration of the monarchy 47 years earlier. The <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>seniority</b> of the most-senior British Army line regiments is based on that of the English army. Although technically the Scots Royal Regiment of Foot was raised in 1633 and is the oldest Regiment of the Line, Scottish and Irish regiments were only allowed to take a rank in the English army on the date of their arrival in England (or the date when they were first placed on the English establishment). In 1694, a board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of English, Irish and Scots regiments serving in the Netherlands; the regiment which became known as the Scots Greys were designated the 4th Dragoons because there were three English regiments raised prior to 1688, when the Scots Greys were first placed in the English establishment. In 1713, when a new board of general officers was convened to decide the rank of several regiments, the seniority of the Scots Greys was reassessed and based on their June 1685 entry into England. At that time there was only one English regiment of dragoons, and the Scots Greys eventually received the British Army rank of 2nd Dragoons.|$|E

50|$|A {{constitutional}} amendment in 1838 changed {{the tenure of}} office of the Supreme Court justices from life to a term of fifteen years. It provided that the commissions of the judges then in office should expire at intervals of three years, in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> their <b>seniority</b> as <b>of</b> January 1, 1839. Judge Gibson had opposed this change on broad grounds of public policy. At the suggestion of his associates, he resigned and was reappointed by Governor Joseph Ritner in 1838, thus prolonging his term by several years. This action was criticized by the newspapers.|$|R
25|$|As battery designations {{were tied}} to the brigade that the battery was {{assigned}} to, batteries were redesignated in a bewildering sequence as they were transferred between brigades. For example, E Battery of C Brigade (E/C Bty) might become N Battery of A Brigade (N/A Bty) upon transfer. Henceforth, batteries were designated in a single alphabetical sequence in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>seniority</b> from date of formation.|$|E
25|$|The brigade {{system was}} revived in 1901. Each brigade now {{commanded}} just two batteries {{and a small}} staff (a Lieutenant-Colonel in command, an adjutant and a brigade sergeant major).

25|$|In the justices' private conferences, current {{practice}} {{is for them}} to speak and vote in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>seniority</b> to begin with the chief justice first and end with the most junior associate justice.

25|$|The justices {{decide whether}} or not to hear oral {{arguments}} for the case. If the case is controversial or carries high public interest, an oral argument may be scheduled, although oral arguments were rare under Chief Justice Hernández Denton. When oral argument occurs, each side has twenty-five minutes to state its respective claims and five minutes for rebuttal. After the sides have ended their argument, each justice has ten minutes (in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>seniority)</b> to ask questions to each side. Justices may decide to yield the balance of their time to one of their colleagues.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd (Seaham) Corps was {{initially}} the largest, {{and the other}} three were attached to it for administrative purposes. In 1880 and 1881 the 2nd Durham won the Queen's Prize at the annual National Artillery Association competition held at Shoeburyness. By the end of the 19th Century, however, all four were independent units, attached to the Western Division of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) and ranked as 51 to 54 in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>seniority</b> among Volunteer Artillery units. In 1902, the divisional structure was abolished, and the units were renamed 1st–4th Durham RGA (Volunteers).|$|E
5000|$|Regiments were, at this time, {{known by}} semi-permanent nicknames {{or by the}} names of their colonels; in 1751, in an attempt to reduce confusion, regiments were {{assigned}} numbers in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> their <b>seniority.</b> The cavalry regiments of the line were numbered in three separate sequences; 1st through 4th Horse, then 1st through 3rd Dragoon Guards, then 1st through 14th Dragoons. [...] "Dragoon Guards" [...] was a new title, and did not denote a Guards' role; it was adopted by the three senior horse regiments in 1746, when George II reduced them to the status <b>of</b> dragoons in <b>order</b> to save money.|$|R
50|$|In other {{organizations}} (e.g., trade unions, societies, clubs) one or multiple vice presidents are {{elected by the}} members of the organization. When multiple vice presidents are elected, the positions are usually numbered to prevent confusion as to who may preside or succeed to the office of president upon vacancy of that office (for example: 1st vice president, 2nd vice president, and so on). In some cases vice presidents are given titles due to their specific responsibilities, for example: Vice President of Operations, Finance, etc. In some associations the first vice president can be interchangeable with executive vice president and the remaining vice presidents are ranked in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> their <b>seniority.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both {{sides were}} at a {{standstill}} in strong positions, Plessis-Praslin doubtful of the trustworthiness of his cavalry, but Turenne {{was too weak to}} attack, when a dispute for precedence arose between the Gardes Françaises and the Picardie regiment. The royal infantry had to be rearranged in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> regimental <b>seniority,</b> and Turenne, seeing and desiring to profit by the attendant disorder, came out of his stronghold and attacked with the greatest vigor. The battle (15 December 1650) was severe and for a time doubtful, but Turenne's Frondeurs gave way in the end, and his army, as an army, ceased to exist. Turenne himself, undeceived as to the part he was playing in the drama, asked and received the young king's pardon, and meantime the court, with the maison du roi and other loyal troops, had subdued the minor risings without difficulty. (March-April 1651).|$|R
25|$|John Jacob Astor III, son of William B. and {{grandson}} of John Jacob Astor, died in 1890, having served as trustee since 1858 and as treasurer since 1868. By his will, $400,000 {{was left to}} the library. As William Waldorf Astor declined to fill the vacancy, the board ceased to have an Astor on it. At the time of consolidation the trustees, in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>seniority,</b> were Markoe, Henry Drisler, John Lambert Cadwalader, Henry C. Potter, Stephen Van Rensselaer Cruger, Little, Stephen Henry Olin, King, Charles Howland Russell and Philip Schuyler.|$|E
25|$|During session, {{the court}} customarily sits with the justices seated in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{seniority}}.</b> The Chief Justice is {{seated in the}} center with the justice next in seniority {{on his or her}} right, the justice third in seniority on his or her left, and so on in alternating order such that the newest justice is seated on the far left. This arrangement may be disrupted if a senior justice replaces {{an active member of the}} court who is recused from hearing a case. Attorneys for each side are usually allowed fifteen minutes each to present their arguments. The justices often interrupt the attorneys to ask questions on some issue in the case.|$|E
25|$|Succession to the {{chieftain}}ship or kingship {{was through}} tanistry. When a man became chieftain or king, a relative {{was elected to}} be his deputy or 'tanist' (Irish: tánaiste, plural tanaistí). When the chieftain or king died, his tanist would automatically succeed him. The tanist had to share the same great-grandfather as his predecessor (i.e. was of the same derbfine) and he was elected by freemen who also shared the same great-grandfather. Tanistry meant that the kingship usually went to whichever relative was deemed {{to be the most}} fitting. Sometimes there would be more than one tanist at a time and they would succeed each other in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>seniority.</b> Some Anglo-Norman lordships later adopted tanistry from the Irish.|$|E
50|$|Although the New South Wales Court of Appeal {{commenced}} {{operation on}} 1 January 1966 with {{the appointment of}} the President, Sir Gordon Wallace, and six Judges of Appeal, Bernard Sugerman, Charles McLelland, Cyril Walsh, Kenneth Jacobs, Kenneth Asprey and John Holmes Dashwood, the Court of Appeal was established in 1965, replacing the former appellate Full Court of the New South Wales Supreme Court. The advent of the Court of Appeal was controversial, as it introduced another order and unexpectedly uprooted the established <b>order</b> <b>of</b> hierarchy and <b>seniority</b> among judges <b>of</b> the Supreme Court.|$|R
5000|$|The first locally {{recruited}} {{unit of the}} East India Company's {{forces in}} Bengal, raised in 1757 and present at the Battle of Plassey, {{was known as the}} Galliez Battalion (named after one of its first Captains) and called the Lal Pultan (Red Battalion) by its locally recruited members.The Bengal Native Infantry regiments underwent frequent changes of numbering during their period of existence, with the numbers assigned following a reorganisation bearing little or no connection to the regiments that held the pre-existing numbers. The traditional formation of British and Presidency armies' regiments was by a hierarchy in which the [...] "1st Regiment" [...] was the oldest and the highest number was given to the youngest. In 1764 however, the Bengal Native Infantry regiments were renumbered in the <b>order</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seniority</b> <b>of</b> their captain. The regiments were reorganised and renumbered (or renamed) twice in 1861, in 1864, again in 1885 and finally in 1903 the Bengal Army was absorbed into the British Indian Army and the Bengal Infantry ceased to exist.|$|R
50|$|On 11 November 1924, King Vajiravudh {{amended the}} Palace Law {{outlining}} {{a list of}} succession which adhered strictly to the Rules of Primogeniture, clearly stating that {{the son of a}} deceased heir would have precedence over the younger brother of his late father. This followed the European concept of primogeniture with added difference that whilst in Europe all male offspring would have their place in the line of succession, in Thailand rights of succession are only {{to be found in the}} male offspring who are descended from the King by royal consorts. King Vajiravudh also clearly outlines the various groups of consorts and grants rights of succession to their descendants in <b>order</b> <b>of</b> the <b>seniority</b> <b>of</b> the title of the consort - that is, the descendants of a consort of the first rank come before those of a consort of the second rank in the list of succession, and so on. The system applies equally to his own reign as to all previous and future reigns of the Chakri Dynasty. Thus, if the line of the reigning King fails, on his death one searches amongst the line of his predecessor for an heir, and if that line has failed, amongst the line of his predecessor. Rights of succession are thus clearly vested in all lines of descent from King Rama I through a King and a royal consort.|$|R
