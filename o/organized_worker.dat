40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the Service, Office, and Retail Workers’ Union of Canada (SORWUC), an independent, grassroots, socialist feminist union that <b>organized</b> unorganized <b>workers</b> in Canada in the 1970 s and 1980 s. It looks at SORWUC’s role in Canadian labour history in general, and {{its efforts to}} <b>organize</b> unorganized <b>workers</b> in particular, focusing on SORWUC’s efforts to <b>organize</b> <b>workers</b> at a pub and a restaurant in British Columbia. The central thesis of this work is that SORWUC’s socialist feminist unionism and commitment to <b>organizing</b> unorganized <b>workers</b> positioned the union as radically different from much of the 1970 s Canadian labour movement, and that this difference both helped and hindered the union {{in its efforts to}} organize the unorganized. By examining SORWUC from this neglected perspective, this thesis ultimately aims to demonstrate SORWUC’s importance to the historiography of class and labour organizing in Canada...|$|R
