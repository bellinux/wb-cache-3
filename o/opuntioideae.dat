40|$|Net CO 2 uptake over 24 -hour periods was {{examined}} for {{the leaves and}} for the stems of 11 species of cacti representing all three subfamilies. For Pereskia aculeata, Pereskia grandifolia, and Maihuenia poeppigii (subfamily Pereskioideae), all the net shoot CO 2 uptake was by the leaves and during the daytime. In contrast, for the leafless species Carnegiea gigantea, Ferocactus acanthodes, Coryphantha vivipara, and Mammillaria dioica (subfamily Cactoideae), all the shoot net CO 2 uptake was by the stems and at night. Similarly, for leafless Opuntia ficus-indica (subfamily <b>Opuntioideae),</b> all net CO 2 uptake occurred at night. For leafy members of the <b>Opuntioideae</b> (Pereskiopsis porteri, Quiabentia chacoensis, Austrocylindropuntia subulata), at least 88 % of the shoot CO 2 uptake over 24 hours was by the leaves and some CO 2 uptake occurred at night. Leaves responded to the instantaneous level of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) during the daytime, as occurs for C 3 plants, whereas nocturnal CO 2 uptake by stems of O. ficus-indica and F. acanthodes responded to the total daily PAR, as occurs for Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) plants.

40|$|DNA {{barcodes}} {{could be}} {{a useful tool for}} plant conservation. Of particular importance is the ability to identify unknown plant material, such as from customs seizures of illegally collected specimens. Mexican cacti are an example of a threatened group, under pressure because of wild collection for the xeriscaping trade and private collectors. Mexican cacti also provide a taxonomically and geographically coherent group with which to test DNA barcodes. Here, we sample the matK barcode for 528 species of Cactaceae including approximately 75 % of Mexican species and test the utility of the matK region for species-level identification. We find that the matK DNA barcode can be used to identify uniquely 77 % of species sampled, and 79 - 87 % of species of particular conservation importance. However, this is far below the desired rate of 95 % and there are significant issues for PCR amplification because of the variability of primer sites. Additionally, we test the nuclear ITS regions for the cactus subfamily <b>Opuntioideae</b> and for the genus Ariocarpus (subfamily Cactoideae). We observed higher rates of variation for ITS (86 % unique for <b>Opuntioideae</b> sampled) but a much lower PCR success, encountering significant intra-individual polymorphism in Ariocarpus precluding the use of this marker in this taxon. We conclude that the matK region should provide useful information as a DNA barcode for Cactaceae if the problems with primers can be addressed, but matK alone is not sufficiently variable to achieve species-level identification.

Wide-band tracheids (WBTs) of the {{photosynthetic}} and non-photosynthetic {{stems in}} species of Cactaceae. J. Torrey Bat. Soc. 137 : 16 - 29. 2010. -The absence of WBTs and wood polymorphisms in some {{species of the}} Caryophyllales {{may be related to}} the particular area of plant analyzed. The present research has the objective of studying the photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic stems of different species and stages of differentiation to register wood polymorphisms and to understand the distribution and occurrence of WBTs. Wood polymorphism was observed in the non-photosynthetic stern of young and adult plants of <b>Opuntioideae</b> and Cactoideae and is also found in the photosynthetic stem of young plants of some species of Cactoideae. Cactoideae present WBT/fibrous dimorphic wood that can be related to cambial variation associated with growth habits and plant development. As expected, in the photosynthetic stem of the adult columnar cacti the wood is monomorphic fibrous in which WBTs were not found. This wood contains a great amount of fibers due to necessity of the mechanical support. In contrast, the globular species do not possess fibers in this area of the stem in either adult or young plants. Opuntia monacantha Haw. had non-fibrous wood in which WBTs were observed in the axial system and in the inner parts of the rays. Fiber clusters were present in the axial system. This wood represents a variation in the wood types described for <b>Opuntioideae.</b> Also, in O. monacantha, cells similar to the WBTs were observed in the pith, which can be interpreted as variation in the morphogenic processes during the ontogeny of the plant, probably a case of homeosis. Monomorphic fibrous wood without WBTs was found along the entire stem of Pereskia bahiensis Gurke. This feature has been observed in other pereskias, and in addition to the others, indicates its proximity to the ancestral cacti.

40|$|The {{chemical}} composition and morphology of solid material isolated from various Cactaceae {{species have been}} analyzed. All of the tested specimens deposited high-purity calcium oxalate crystals in their succulent modified stems. These deposits occurred most frequently as round-shaped druses that sometimes coexist with abundant crystal sand in the tissue. The biominerals were identified either as CaC 2 O 4. 2 H 2 O (weddellite) or as CaC 2 O 4. H 2 O (whewellite). Seven different species from the <b>Opuntioideae</b> subfamily showed the presence of whewellite, and {{an equal number of}} species from the Cereoideae subfamily showed the deposition of weddellite. The chemical nature of these deposits was assessed by infrared spectroscopy. The crystal morphology of the crystals was visualized by both conventional light and scanning electron microscopy. Weddellite druses were made up of tetragonal crystallites, whereas those from whewellite were most often recognized by their acute points and general star-like shape. These studies clearly demonstrated that members from the main traditional subfamilies of the Cactaceae family could synthesize different chemical forms of calcium oxalate, suggesting a definite but different genetic control. The direct relationship established between a given Cactaceae species and a definite calcium oxalate biomineral seems to be a useful tool for plant identification and chemotaxonomy...|$|E
40|$|Examination of {{leaf and}} stem tissues {{in a broad}} range of genera {{resulted}} in the discovery and analysis of a novel tracheid type termed Wide-Band Tracheids (WBTs; the term is derived from the comparatively wide secondary wall) in derived genera of Aizoaceae, Cactaceae and Portulacaeae (Caryophyllales). In Aizoaceae, WBTs are only found in genera of Ruschioideae; in Cactaceae, WBTs are found in xylem of leaves and stems in genera of <b>Opuntioideae</b> and Cactaceae. However, in the genus Anacampseros (Portulacaceae), WBTs are found in leaf xylem, but not as part of the xylem of the stems and instead, WBTs are found in piths and rays. It was hypothesized that the wide secondary wall prevents primary wall contact during extreme water stress and thus WBTs were thought to differentiate in response to water-stress. In order to determine what factors cause WBT initiation and differentiation, seedlings of Anacamperos rufescens (Portulacaceae) were exposed to varying light intensities that mimicked spring and summer light levels found in southern Africa. In this experiment, results show that WBTs are generally formed in advance of probable water-stress event times. Furthermore, the number of WBTs are directly correlated to the intensity of light received as a seedling; however, the mean WBT size remained relatively unchanged, presumably due to a rigid genetic control. Results suggest that, in Anacampseros rufescens, the later a seedling germinates, the greater the number of WBTs differentiate, which pre-adapts the plant for future water-stress events...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aims There is {{considerable}} {{confusion in the}} literature concerning impermeability of seeds with 'hard' seed coats, because {{the ability to take}} up (imbibe) water has not been tested in most of them. Seeds of Opuntia tomentosa were reported recently to have a water-impermeable seed coat sensu lato (i. e. physical dormancy), in combination with physiological dormancy. However, physical dormancy is not known to occur in Cactaceae. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine if seeds of O. tomentosa are water-permeable or water-impermeable, i. e. if they have physical dormancy. Methods The micromorphology of the seed coat and associated structures were characterized by SEM and light microscopy. Permeability of the seed-covering layers was assessed by an increase in mass of seeds on a wet substrate and by dye-tracking and uptake of tritiated water by intact versus scarified seeds. Key Results A germination valve and a water channel are formed in the hilum-micropyle region during dehydration and ageing in seeds of O. tomentosa. The funicular envelope undoubtedly plays a role in germination of Opuntia seeds via restriction of water uptake and mechanical resistance to expansion of the embryo. However, seeds do not exhibit any of three features characteristic of those with physical dormancy. Thus, they do not have a water-impermeable layer(s) of palisade cells (macrosclereids) or a water gap sensu stricto and they imbibe water without the seed coat being disrupted. Conclusions Although dormancy in seeds of this species can be broken by scarification, they have physiological dormancy only. Further, based on information in the literature, it is concluded that it is unlikely that any species of Opuntia has physical dormancy. This is the first integrative study of the anatomy, dynamics of water uptake and dormancy in seeds of Cactaceae subfamily <b>Opuntioideae...</b>|$|E
