We aimed to estimate overall costs for patients experiencing none, <b>one,</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> exacerbations per year in the UK. Methods: A retrospective cohort of prevalent COPD patients was identified in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink UK database. Patients with information recorded for at least 12 months before and after cohort entry date were included (first prevalent COPD diagnosis confirmed by spirometry on/after April 1, 2009). Patients were categorized as having none, <b>one,</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations in the 12 months after cohort entry and further classified by the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) category of airflow obstruction and the Medical Research Council dyspnea scale. Study outcomes included counts of general practitioner interactions, moderate-severe COPD exacerbations, and non-COPD hospitalizations. Estimated resource use costs were calculated using National Health Service reference costs for 2010 – 2011. Results: The cohort comprised 58, 589 patients (mean age 69. 5 years, mean dyspnea grade 2. 5, females 46. 6 %, current smokers 33. 1 %). The average total annual per patient cost of COPD management, excluding medications, was £ 2, 108 for all patients and £ 1, 523, £ 2, 405, and £ 3, 396 for patients experiencing no, <b>one,</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> moderate-to-severe exacerbations, respectively. General practitioner interactions contributed most to these annual costs, accounting for £ 1, 062 (69. 7 %), £ 1, 313 (54. 6 %), and £ 1, 592 (46. 9 %) in patients with no, <b>one,</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> moderate-to-severe exacerbations, respectively. Conclusion: Disease management strategies focused on reducing costs in primary care may help reduce total COPD costs significantly.

25|$|The Diamant is a conventional, low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{and essentially}} an enlarged version of Piel's successful Emeraude {{designed to accommodate}} more passengers. This extra capacity is provided by a redesigned fuselage which is higher in the rear section and longer overall.

The wingspan is also greater than that of the Emeraude, allowing for a greater maximum take-off weight.

25|$|Boat 4 {{appears to}} have had about 42 people aboard (about 40 women and {{children}} and two or three crew members) when it was lowered. As it had been ordered, Perkis steered the boat {{along the side of the}} ship in search for open gangways, since he had been told to take on board more passengers through them, but found no one. This way, the boat ended up near the davits of Boat 16 (which had been already launched), and two greasers, Thomas Ranger and Frederick William Scott, who were standing near them, climbed down the falls to Boat 4 (Scott fell into the water but was hauled aboard the lifeboat). The boat then rowed away from the ship in order to avoid suction. A third man, lamp trimmer Samuel Ernest Hemming, climbed down the falls of another lifeboat and swam over to No. 4, which was about 200 yards far. Immediately after the sinking the boat rowed back to the wreckage to pick up more survivors (the only lifeboat to try immediately to do so). The boat picked up six or seven more men (trimmer Thomas Patrick Dillon, seaman William Henry Lyons, stewards Andrew Cunningham and Sidney Conrad Siebert, storekeeper Frank Winnold Prentice, and <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> unidentified swimmers) from the water. Two (Siebert and Lyons) later died of exposure. The number of occupants later increased when other people were transferred from Boat 14 and Collapsible Boat D. By the time it reached Carpathia at 8:00a.m. it had about 60 occupants.|$|E

At {{the height of the}} fires, over 9,000 firefighters and support personnel were assigned to Yellowstone at one time, {{and by the time the}} fires finally went out, more than 25,000 had been involved in the fire suppression efforts. Crews would normally work for 2 to 3weeks, be sent home, and then return for <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> <b>more</b> tours of duty. The normal workday was as long as 14hours. Assignments included digging firelines, watering down buildings, clearing undergrowth near structures, and installing water pumps. Hundreds of firefighters were assigned to engine crews, as much of the firefighting effort was aimed at protecting structures. No firefighters died in the park as a result of the fires, but one firefighter and an aircraft pilot died in separate incidents outside the park. A number of firefighters were treated for various injuries with the more common complaints being fatigue, headaches, and smoke inhalation. A few firefighters were exposed to noxious fumes from sulfur emissions from a geothermal area.|$|E
