5|$|In halides, {{berkelium}} {{assumes the}} oxidation states +3 and +4. The +3 state is most stable, especially in solutions, and the tetravalent halides BkF4 and Cs2BkCl6 are only {{known in the}} solid phase. The coordination of the berkelium atom in its trivalent fluoride and chloride is tricapped trigonal prismatic, with a coordination number of 9. In the trivalent bromide, it is bicapped trigonal prismatic (coordination 8) or <b>octahedral</b> (coordination 6), and in the iodide it is <b>octahedral.</b>|$|E
5|$|Anhydrous iron(III) {{chloride}} adopts the BiI3 structure, {{which features}} <b>octahedral</b> Fe(III) centres interconnected by two-coordinate chloride ligands. Iron(III) chloride hexahydrate consists of trans-+ cationic complexes and chloride anions, {{with the remaining}} two H2O molecules embedded within the monoclinic crystal structure.|$|E
5|$|Dark red, {{hygroscopic}} HTcO4 is {{a strong}} acid. In concentrated sulfuric acid, − converts to the <b>octahedral</b> form TcO3(OH)(H2O)2, the conjugate base of the hypothetical triaquo complex +.|$|E
5|$|Escher {{learned his}} wood {{engraving}} technique from Samuel Jessurun de Mesquita. He illustrated the <b>octahedral</b> compound of Stars in the beveled wire-frame style {{that had been}} used by Leonardo da Vinci in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli's 1509 book, De divina proportione.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metal cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although <b>octahedral</b> hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions exist as <b>octahedral</b> hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy <b>octahedral</b> cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The <b>octahedral</b> plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
5|$|Some tetracoordinate nickel(II) complexes, e.g. bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel chloride, exist both in {{tetrahedral}} {{and square}} planar geometries. The tetrahedral complexes are paramagnetic, whereas the square planar complexes are diamagnetic. In having properties of magnetic equilibrium and formation of <b>octahedral</b> complexes, they {{contrast with the}} divalent complexes of the heavier group 10 metals, palladium(II) and platinum(II), which form only square-planar geometry.|$|E
5|$|The +3 {{oxidation}} state {{is known in}} compounds like manganese(III) acetate, but these are quite powerful oxidizing agents and also prone to disproportionation in solution, forming manganese(II) and manganese(IV). Solid compounds of manganese(III) are characterized by its strong purple-red color and a preference for distorted <b>octahedral</b> coordination resulting from the Jahn-Teller effect.|$|E
5|$|The +4 {{oxidation}} state dominates titanium chemistry, but compounds in the +3 {{oxidation state}} are also common. Commonly, titanium adopts an <b>octahedral</b> coordination geometry in its complexes, but tetrahedral TiCl4 is a notable exception. Because {{of its high}} oxidation state, titanium(IV) compounds exhibit {{a high degree of}} covalent bonding. Unlike most other transition metals, simple aquo Ti(IV) complexes are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydrated}} form {{of aluminium}} chloride has an <b>octahedral</b> molecular geometry, {{with the central}} aluminum ion surrounded by six water ligand molecules. This means that the hydrated form cannot act as a Lewis acid since it cannot accept electron pairs, and thus this cannot {{be used as a}} catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aromatic compounds.|$|E
5|$|This {{characteristic}} {{is employed}} in analytical techniques using EDTA as a ligand. EDTA preferentially forms <b>octahedral</b> complexes– thus absorbing other cations such as Al3+ which might interfere – for example, in the solvent extraction {{of a complex}} formed between Be2+ and acetylacetone. Beryllium(II) readily forms complexes with strong donating ligands such as phosphine oxides and arsine oxides. There have been extensive studies of these complexes which show {{the stability of the}} O-Be bond.|$|E
5|$|Twelve binary halides, {{compounds}} {{with the}} formula VXn (n=2..5), are known. VI4, VCl5, VBr5, and VI5 {{do not exist}} or are extremely unstable. In combination with other reagents, VCl4 {{is used as a}} catalyst for polymerization of dienes. Like all binary halides, those of vanadium are Lewis acidic, especially those of V(IV) and V(V). Many of the halides form <b>octahedral</b> complexes with the formula VXnL6−n (X = halide; L = other ligand).|$|E
5|$|Using an even simpler {{approximation}} of the ions as impenetrable hard spheres, {{the arrangement of}} anions in these systems are often related to close-packed arrangements of spheres, with the cations occupying tetrahedral or <b>octahedral</b> interstices. Depending on the stoichiometry of the ionic compound, and the coordination (principally determined by the radius ratio) of cations and anions, a variety of structures are commonly observed, and theoretically rationalized by Pauling's rules.|$|E
5|$|Voidites are <b>octahedral</b> nanometer-sized {{clusters}} {{present in}} many natural diamonds, as revealed by electron microscopy. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that annealing of type-IaB diamond at high temperatures and pressures (>2600 °C) results in break-up of the platelets and formation of dislocation loops and voidites, i.e. that voidites {{are a result}} of thermal degradation of platelets. Contrary to platelets, voidites do contain much nitrogen, in the molecular form.|$|E
5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or <b>octahedral,</b> but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, and both the spheroidal shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E
5|$|In aqueous solution, the {{alkali metal}} ions form aqua ions of the formula +, where n is the {{solvation}} number. Their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly {{attached to the}} metal ion are said {{to belong to the}} first coordination sphere, also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond, with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity. The solvation number for Li+ has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the tetrahedral +: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 {{may be the result of}} the formation of contact ion pairs, and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach + through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an <b>octahedral</b> hexaaqua ion. There are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion, forming the <b>octahedral</b> + ion. While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed <b>octahedral</b> hexaaqua ions, it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the + and + ions, which have the square antiprismatic structure, and that caesium forms the 12-coordinate + ion.|$|E
5|$|In decavanadate, each V(V) {{center is}} {{surrounded}} by six oxide ligands. Vanadic acid, H3VO4 exists only at very low concentrations because protonation of the tetrahedral species − results in the preferential formation of the <b>octahedral</b> + species. In strongly acidic solutions, pH<2. + is the predominant species, while the oxide V2O5 precipitates from solution at high concentrations. The oxide is formally the inorganic anhydride of vanadic acid. The structures of many vanadate compounds have been determined by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{isotopes}} fractionate substantially {{during a}} wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in <b>octahedral</b> sites in clay minerals, where 6Li is preferred to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.|$|E
5|$|Pliny {{moves into}} {{crystallography}} and mineralogy, describing the <b>octahedral</b> {{shape of the}} diamond and recording that diamond dust is used by gem engravers to cut and polish other gems, owing to its great hardness. He states that rock crystal is valuable for its transparency and hardness, and can be carved into vessels and implements. He relates {{the story of a}} woman who owned a ladle made of the mineral, paying the sum of 150,000 sesterces for the item. Nero deliberately broke two crystal cups when he realised {{that he was about to}} be deposed, so denying their use to anyone else.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} forms {{white crystals}} where protactinium ions {{are arranged in}} pentagonal bipyramids and coordinated by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but the color is yellow. The coordination changes to <b>octahedral</b> in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Visible {{amounts of}} berkelium(III) {{chloride}} (BkCl3) were first isolated and characterized in 1962, and weighed only 3 billionths of a gram. It {{can be prepared}} by introducing hydrogen chloride vapors into an evacuated quartz tube containing berkelium oxide at a temperature of about 500 °C. This green solid has a melting point of 603 °C and crystallizes in the hexagonal crystal system isotypic with uranium(III) chloride (Pearson symbol hP8, space group P63/m, No. 176). Upon heating to just below its melting point, BkCl3 converts into an orthorhombic phase. The hexahydrate BkCl3·6H2O (berkelium trichloride hexahydrate) has a monoclinic structure with the lattice constants a = 966 pm, b = 654 pm and c = 797 pm. Another berkelium(III) chloride, Cs2NaBkCl6 can be crystallized from a chilled aqueous solution containing berkelium(III) hydroxide, hydrochloric acid and caesium chloride. It has a face-centered cubic structure where Bk(III) ions are surrounded by chloride ions in an <b>octahedral</b> configuration.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{has led to}} {{a better}} understanding of chemical bonds and non-covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, such as the tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the <b>octahedral</b> bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV), and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic C–C bonds and aromatic C–C bonds; this finding led to the idea of resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement.|$|E
5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, <b>octahedral)</b> forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E
25|$|Many metal ions {{coordinate}} six ligands in an <b>octahedral</b> or distorted <b>octahedral</b> configuration.|$|E
25|$|Fe3O4 has a cubic inverse spinel {{structure}} {{which consists}} of a cubic close packed array of oxide ions where all of the Fe2+ ions occupy half of the <b>octahedral</b> sites and the Fe3+ are split evenly across the remaining <b>octahedral</b> sites and the tetrahedral sites.|$|E
25|$|The vertex-first {{parallel}} {{projection of}} the 24-cell into 3-dimensional space has a rhombic dodecahedral envelope. Twelve of the 24 <b>octahedral</b> cells project in pairs onto six square dipyramids that meet {{at the center of}} the rhombic dodecahedron. The remaining 12 <b>octahedral</b> cells project onto the 12 rhombic faces of the rhombic dodecahedron.|$|E
25|$|Any shapes with {{icosahedral}} or <b>octahedral</b> symmetry {{will also}} contain tetrahedral symmetry.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method of}} {{constructing}} the 24-cell {{is by the}} rectification of the 16-cell. The vertex figure of the 16-cell is the octahedron; thus, cutting the vertices of the 16-cell at the midpoint of its incident edges produce 8 <b>octahedral</b> cells. This process also rectifies the tetrahedral cells of the 16-cell which also become octahedra, thus forming the 24 <b>octahedral</b> cells of the 24-cell.|$|E
25|$|O - chiral <b>octahedral</b> symmetry;the {{rotation}} {{group of}} the cube and octahedron; order 24.|$|E
25|$|In {{inorganic}} chemistry, the {{trans effect}} is the labilization (making more reactive) of ligands that are trans to certain other ligands, which {{can thus be}} regarded as trans-directing ligands. It is attributed to electronic effects and it is most notable in square planar complexes, although {{it can also be}} observed for <b>octahedral</b> complexes. The cis effect is most often observed in <b>octahedral</b> transition metal complexes.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{crystals}} of diamond, alum or fluorite {{are commonly}} <b>octahedral,</b> as the space-filling tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb.|$|E
25|$|Oh - full <b>octahedral</b> {{symmetry}}; {{the symmetry}} {{group of the}} cube and octahedron; order 48.|$|E
25|$|Each 24-cell in the 24-cell {{honeycomb}} has 24 neighboring 24-cells. With each neighbor {{it shares}} exactly one <b>octahedral</b> cell.|$|E
25|$|Based on a {{different}} theoretical underpinning this expression is {{also referred to as}} <b>octahedral</b> shear stress theory.|$|E
25|$|Structure: Consists of <b>octahedral</b> cages {{that share}} {{paddlewheel}} units to define pores of about 9.8Å in diameter.|$|E
25|$|MgCl2 {{crystallizes}} in the {{cadmium chloride}} motif, which features <b>octahedral</b> Mg. A variety of hydrates are known with the formula MgCl2(H2O)x, and each loses water with increasing temperature: x = 12 (−16.4°C), 8 (−3.4°C), 6 (116.7°C), 4 (181°C), 2 (ca. 300°C). In the hexahydrate, the Mg2+ remains <b>octahedral,</b> but is coordinated to six water ligands. The thermal dehydration of the hydrates MgCl2(H2O)x (x = 6, 12) {{does not occur}} straightforwardly.|$|E
