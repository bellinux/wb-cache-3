However, she is subsequently attacked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> {{bridge and}} repeatedly {{stabbed in the}} abdomen by the Waif, {{in the guise of}} an elderly woman. Arya pushes the Waif away, and barely escapes by jumping off the bridge and swimming away underwater. After surfacing, she is then left stumbling through the streets, critically wounded.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders laid siege to Damietta, on the Nile, in May 1217. Although they {{seized a}} strategically-important tower <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> island on 24 August, Al-Kamil (who had succeeded Al-Adil I in Egypt) {{controlled}} {{traffic on the}} Nile. In September, reinforcements commanded by Pope Honorius III's legate Cardinal Pelagius (who considered himself the crusade's supreme commander) arrived from Italy.|$|E

5|$|A {{full-size}} {{replica of}} the Coandă-1910, built in 2001, is displayed in Bucharest at the National Military Museum, and a scale model is displayed in the French Air and Space Museum at Paris – Le Bourget Airport. At {{the site of the}} historic Issy-les-Moulineaux airfield, a large plaque lists the three pioneers of flight most closely associated with the airfield: Louis Blériot, Alberto Santos-Dumont and Henri Farman. Later, a plaque honouring Coandă and Romanian aviation engineer Traian Vuia was placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> building {{under the auspices of the}} mayor of Issy-les-Moulineaux, L'Aéroclub de France, and the Romanian Association for Aviation History.|$|E
5|$|Around midnight, {{the men of}} the 72nd and the 52nd passed Bab al-Wad noiselessly {{and then}} {{separated}} towards their respective targets. One company took Deir Ayyub, which was empty, but then were discovered as they did so by enemies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> hill. They suffered the joint fire of the Legion's artillery and machines guns. Thirteen men were killed and several other injured. The company, composed mainly of immigrants, then retreated to Bab al-Wad. The 52nd Battalion was preparing to take the hill in front of Yalu, but received an order to retreat.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal's players {{train at}} the Shenley Training Centre in Hertfordshire, a {{purpose-built}} facility {{which opened in}} 1999. Before that the club used facilities <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> site owned by the University College of London Students' Union. Until 1961 they had trained at Highbury. Arsenal's Academy under-18 teams play their home matches at Shenley, while the reserves play their games at Meadow Park, {{which is also the}} home of Boreham Wood F.C..|$|E
5|$|Custer’s 7th Cavalry {{advance party}} {{attacked}} Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their {{camp on the}} Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize how large the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E
5|$|Harold's forces {{deployed}} in a small, dense formation {{at the top}} of steep slope, with their flanks protected by woods and marshy ground in front of them. The line may have extended far enough to be anchored <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> stream. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to provide protection from attack. Sources differ on the exact site that the English fought on: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.|$|E

5|$|In March 1933, Marquis claimed squatter's right <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> {{piece of}} land. He opened his Custer Battle Museum in April {{and moved to}} the property. He began {{publishing}} his own pamphlets for sale at the museum and the Custer battlefield. Titles in 1933 were: Sketch Story of the Custer Battle, She Watched Custer's Last Battle, Custer Soldiers Not Buried, and Which Indian Killed Custer?, in 1934 Sitting Bull and Gall the Warrior, and in 1935 Two Days After the Custer Battle.|$|E
5|$|Lost Coast follows Half-Life protagonist Gordon Freeman as {{he travels}} up a coastal cliff {{to destroy a}} Combine {{artillery}} launcher in a monastery, which is firing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> town. The Lost Coast level was originally created for Half-Life 2, but was ultimately removed from the game. As a result, it has several minor story details that {{were not included in}} Half-Life 2. The level received a generally positive reception, and there was consensus among reviewers that the new features included in Lost Coast should be integrated into future games released by Valve.|$|E
5|$|On June 6, 1969, {{a freight}} train {{operated}} by Great Northern rammed into several disconnected train cars {{in front of the}} Marysville depot, destroying the building, killing two men in an engine <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> siding and injuring two others. The crash, blamed on the engineer failing to adhere to the track's speed limit, caused $1 million in damage to railroad property and resulted in the demolition of the depot, which had served the city since 1891 and was not rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|Solsticial {{alignments}} {{also can}} be seen as displays of power. When viewed from a ceremonial plaza on the Island of the Sun (the mythical origin place of the Sun) in Lake Titicaca, the Sun was seen to rise at the June solstice between two towers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> ridge. The sacred part of the island was separated from the remainder of it by a stone wall and ethnographic records indicate that access to the sacred space was restricted to members of the Inca ruling elite. Ordinary pilgrims stood on a platform outside the ceremonial area to see the solstice Sun rise between the towers.|$|E
5|$|The Device Forts {{along the}} Solent also fell into Parliamentary hands {{early in the}} conflict. Calshot was garrisoned throughout, as was Brownsea, which was {{strengthened}} and equipped with additional guns. West Cowes was rapidly taken after firing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> Parliamentary ship, and the Royalist commander at Yarmouth quickly negotiated a surrender of his tiny garrison. The heavily outnumbered garrison at Southsea Castle was stormed by Parliamentary forces in a night attack. Like Camber, St Andrew's and Netley were rapidly occupied and then decommissioned by Parliament. In the north-east, Hull also sided with Parliament, and its castle and blockhouses were used {{as part of the}} town's defences during multiple sieges.|$|E
5|$|A {{cargo ship}} picked up {{eight of the}} {{aforementioned}} survivors from the Doña Marilyn; eleven other survivors were found on Maripipi Island and <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> inlet, ten were discovered on Sambawan Island, and four others were found floating in the water. In Almagro, 137survivors washed onshore on October25, 120ofwhom reached shore by either a life jacket or a life boat. Eighteen other survivors were buried in a common grave in Almagro and nine other bodies, also found in Almagro, were shipped to Tacloban. In Tacloban, six other survivors were buried, but over 60survivors were also found on the island, and were transported on four buses and taken to receive medical treatment. Twenty-two were found on Samar Island, including two in Calbayog. Overall, the shipwreck was confirmed to have killed 77, even though 261others were listed missing.|$|E

5|$|Almost 100 {{people were}} {{beheaded}} in Halifax {{between the first}} recorded execution in 1286 and the last in 1650, but as {{the date of the}} gibbet's installation is uncertain, it cannot be determined with any accuracy how many were dealt with by the Halifax Gibbet. By 1650 public opinion considered beheading to be an excessively severe punishment for petty theft; use of the gibbet was forbidden by Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, and the structure was dismantled. The stone base was rediscovered and preserved in about 1840, and a non-working replica was erected on the site in 1974. The names of 52 people known to have been beheaded by the device are listed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> plaque.|$|E
5|$|An away team boards the cube, {{discovering}} that either {{an accident or}} another species disabled the vessel. They take a Borg drone back onto Voyager, where the Doctor (Robert Picardo) accidentally revives it. After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all the people around him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies. Frazier explains that an electro-kinetic storm broke their link with the Borg hive mind. Instead, the separated drones settled <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> planet. Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories. After Voyager arrives, Frazier and her group want Janeway to re-activate the neuroelectric generator on the damaged cube to extend a new joint mind across the entire planet.|$|E
5|$|As {{numerous}} collectors {{had visited}} Negros prior to 1953 {{and did not}} record the species, {{it is likely that}} it was already very rare by the time of its discovery. It is suspected that the Negros fruit dove was originally a lowland species, but the destruction of forests in northern Negros forced the dove from its ideal habitat and led to its probable extinction. Today, no forest exists in northern Negros at an elevation lower than , and several searches in the 1990s of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding area failed to discover any sign of the species' continued existence. Ornithological fieldwork has discovered that the nearby island of Panay is home to some species previously thought to be endemic to Negros, including the Negros bleeding-heart. This discovery and the presence of unexplored lowland forests on Panay give hope that the Negros fruit dove may still exist in low numbers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>nearby</b> island. Other than the depiction of the bird on a Philippine environmental education poster in the 1990s, no conservation measures have been enacted to protect any surviving population.|$|E
