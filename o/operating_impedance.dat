40|$|With the {{explosive}} growth of the wireless market, the demand for low-cost and highly-integrated radio frequency (RF) transceiver has been increased. Keeping up with this trend, complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) has been spotlighted {{by virtue of its}} superior characteristics. However, there are challenges in achieving this goal, especially designing the transmitter portion. The objective of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of fully integrated CMOS transmitter module which includes power amplifier (PA) and transmit/receive (T/R) switch by compensating for the intrinsic drawbacks of CMOS technology. As an effort to overcome the challenges, the high-power handling T/R switches are introduced as {{the first part of this}} dissertation. The proposed differential switch topology and feed-forward capacitor helps reducing the voltage stress over the switch devices, enabling a linear power transmission. With the high-power T/R switches, a new transmitter front-end topology - differential PA and T/R switch topology with the multi-section PA output matching network - is also proposed. The multi-stage PA output matching network assists to relieve the voltage stress over the switch device even more, by providing a low switch <b>operating</b> <b>impedance.</b> By analyzing the power performance and efficiency of entire transmitter module, design methodology for the high-power handling and efficient transmitter module is established. Finally, the research in this dissertation provides low-cost, high-power handling, and efficient CMOS RF transmitter module for wireless applications.

40|$|In a {{positive}} polarity induction adder {{each of the}} induction cavities is a cathode, which emits electrons at a unique potential. These broad spectrum electrons strongly affect Magnetically Insulated Transmission Line (MITL) behavior. Electron flow decreases the cavity-to-MITL coupling efficiency, and reduces the power transport efficiency along the system. Also the <b>operating</b> <b>impedance</b> of the MITL is lowered, reducing the diode impedance required for good coupling and good total system power efficiency [l- 4]. It is therefore imperative to understand the details of MITL electron flow. In previous work, measurement of MITL electron flow for a twenty-stage linear induction adder (Hermes III), operated in positive polarity, was compared with simulations [l]. There was qualitative agreement, hut some differences were noted. For example, measured electron flow in the first cavities was greater than in the simulations. We have extended the work on this subject with detailed current measurementson a ten-stage linear induction adder (SABRE). Time resolved electron flow is determined from the difference between anode and cathode currents at several axial locations. A time-resolved mapping of electron flow versus adder length is constructed. Measurements of electron flow in the initial cavities agreed well with simulations.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. This thesis presents a justification for the study of regenerative damping, a general statement of the regenerative damping problem, and a detailed analysis of a specific proposed solution to the regenerative damping problem. Improvement in the efficiency of many physical systems is realized by the incorporation of regenerative devices, and all devices which dissipate power are candidates for investigation as regenerative systems. The viscous damper is a dissipative device which may be suitable for energy regeneration and is therefore investigated as such. Regenerative damping involves storing the power normally dissipated by a passive viscous damper. This task is accomplished by constructing a system which connects an energy storing device to the device being damped. The connecting system must efficiently transfer power from the device being damped to the storage device while simultaneously meeting the <b>operating</b> <b>impedance</b> of the storage device and producing a desired damping impedance. Many physical systems can accomplish this task, and the variable linear transmission is proposed for further investigation. Mathematical, graphical, and computer models are constructed to study the variable linear transmission. These models directly indicate the control strategies necessary to operate the device as a regenerative damper. Studies of kinematic performance and efficiency of the proposed damper indicate that a strong connection exists between the goodness of the performance of the proposed device as a damper and its efficiency. Both of these issues are directly related to the strategy used in the active control of the device. Results indicate that in its ideal state, the proposed damper exactly solves the problem of regenerative damping. For the non-ideal operation of the device, which includes the effects of system actuation dynamics, the performance looks promising but will require more investigation into optimal control strategies. Overall, the prospects for realizing regenerative damping are shown to be positive, and further investigation of this subject is encouraged...|$|E

Periodic transitions between a low and a high current operation point of the oscillating state are observed. The transition time of 20 Ã¢Â�Â� 25 s for the change from the low to the high operation is fast and {{does not depend on}} the operating parameters. Contrasting with this behavior, the downward transition depends strongly on the <b>operating</b> conditions. <b>Impedance</b> measurements indicate a high ionic resistance with low water content for the low current operation and a low ionic resistance of the membrane with high water content for the high current operation. An insight into the transitions is obtained by current density distributions at distinct times indicating a propagating active area with defined boundaries. The observations are in agreement with assuming a liquid water reservoir at the anode with a downward transition period depending on the operation conditions. The high current operation possesses a high electro-osmotic drag and a high permeation rate (corresponding to liquidÃ¢Â�Â�vapor permeation) leading to a large water flux to the cathode. Subsequently, the liquid reservoir at the anode is consumed leading to an anode drying. The system establishes a new quasi-stable operation point associated with a low current, low electro-osmotic drag coefficient, and a low water permeation (corresponding to vaporÃ¢Â�Â�vapor permeation). When liquid water is formed at the anode interface after some time the fast transition to the high current operation occurs. This interpretation is supported by conductive atomic force microscopy current images of the membrane showing a strong dependence of the ionic conductivity on the activation procedures with or without liquid water and also showing oscillatory behavior after the membrane is activated.

However, {{in the context of}} end-effector impedance control when the robot manipulator is redundant with respect to end-effector configuration, the question arises regarding how to control the impedance of the redundant joints. This paper considers multi-priority impedance control where a secondpriority joint space <b>impedance</b> <b>operates</b> in the null space of a first-priority Cartesian impedance at the end-effector. A control law is proposed that realizes both impedances while observing the priority constraint such that a weighted quadratic error function is optimized. This control law is shown to be a generalization of several motion and impedance control laws found in the literature. The paper makes explicit two forms of the control law. In the first, parametrization by passive inertia values allows the control law to be implemented without requiring end-effector force measurements. In the second, a class of parametrizations is introduced that makes the null space impedance independent of end-effector forces. The theoretical results are illustrated in simulation...|$|R

Of course, they are not simple cylinders and cones, so we briefly review some of the more interesting features of more realistic models before relating performance features and instrument quality to features of the input impedance spectrum. Acousticians and sometimes musicians have debated whether the upstream duct, the vocal tract, is important. Setting aside flute-like instruments, the bore resonances near which instruments usually <b>operate</b> have high <b>impedance</b> (tens of MPa. s. m- 3 or more) so the first order model of the tract is...|$|R
40|$|Micromesh bolometers {{have been}} used in several {{instruments}} working in the submillimeter band (e. g. [1]). The bolometers are usually placed inside a waveguide and consist of a mesh absorber, at a certain distance from a back short. The mesh is made of SiNi whose thermal conductivity is tuned to the incident power and <b>operating</b> temperature. The <b>impedance</b> of the mesh is initially matched to the incoming wave impedance, but it is then optimized with full wave simulations [2]. The mesh impedance is the one of the incoming wave since the period is usually much smaller than the wavelength. Future instruments will use higher frequencies, where subwavelength mesh period presents a fabrication challenge. In this case the impedance needs to be properly tuned. In this paper an analytical model based on the calculation of the Green’s function [3] is used to design such bolometer impedance. In particular a Parallel Plate Waveguide (PPW) spectrometer is considered, where the radiation couples from an input horn that excites the TE 1 PPW mode. Then the signal is focused with a curved grating into a bolometer mesh through waveguides [4], similar to the Z-Spec instrument [5]. These waveguides were overmoded and needed to be curved which reduced the overall efficiency. This work studies the possibility of receiving the TE 1 mode of a silicon-filled PPW directly by a resistive micromesh bolometer placed at the focal point. In order to thermally isolate the bolometer an air gap is needed. Thanks to the analytical model the impact on the matching can be studied and conclude that limits the input angle at which it can be used. The geometry studied is shown in Fig. 1 a; an elliptical reflector excited with a waveguide (black rectangle) focuses the signal to a resistive mesh...|$|R
40|$|The phenomenal {{growth of}} {{commercial}} communications {{has created a}} great demand for traveling-wave tube (TWT) amplifiers. Although the helix slow-wave circuit remains the mainstay of the TWT industry because of its exceptionally wide bandwidth, until recently it has been impossible to accurately analyze a helical TWT using its exact dimensions because {{of the complexity of}} its geometrical structure. For the first time, an accurate three-dimensional helical model was developed that allows accurate prediction of TWT cold-test characteristics including <b>operating</b> frequency, interaction <b>impedance,</b> and attenuation. This computational model, which was developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center, allows TWT designers to obtain a more accurate value of interaction impedance than is possible using experimental methods. Obtaining helical slow-wave circuit interaction impedance {{is an important part of}} the design process for a TWT because it is related to the gain and efficiency of the tube. This impedance cannot be measured directly; thus, conventional methods involve perturbing a helical circuit with a cylindrical dielectric rod placed on the central axis of the circuit and obtaining the difference in resonant frequency between the perturbed and unperturbed circuits. A mathematical relationship has been derived between this frequency difference and the interaction impedance (ref. 1). However, because of the complex configuration of the helical circuit, deriving this relationship involves several approximations. In addition, this experimental procedure is time-consuming and expensive, but until recently it was widely accepted as the most accurate means of determining interaction impedance. The advent of an accurate three-dimensional helical circuit model (ref. 2) made it possible for Lewis researchers to fully investigate standard approximations made in deriving the relationship between measured perturbation data and interaction impedance. The most prominent approximations made in the analysis were addressed and fully investigated for their accuracy by using the three-dimensional electromagnetic simulation code MAFIA (Solution of Maxwell's Equations by the Finite Integration Algorithm) (refs. 3 and 4). We found that several approximations introduced significant error (ref. 5) ...|$|R
