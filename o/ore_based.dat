The research builds upon previous methodologies in literature to determine ore sortability. The first attempt to create a standard methodology to assess the amenability of an ore to sorting at a pilot-scale was developed by Fitzpatrick (2008). Tong (2012) developed a methodology to assess the amenability of an ore to sensor-based sorting on an ideal laboratory-scale. These methodologies focus on determining the upgrading potential of an <b>ore</b> <b>based</b> on ore sorting amenability tests. In order to gain further acceptance of sorting technology in the mining industry, Lessard et al.

The protocol, developed during the current research, is used to determine the potential ore sortability based, firstly, on intrinsic particle properties and, secondly, based on laboratory-scale sensor sortability tests using ideal and industrial sensor measurement parameters. The intrinsic sortability results represent the ideal/ best- case sortability if a perfect separator existed and are calculated based on particle-by-particle ore characterisation. Ore that is intrinsically sortable is further assessed based on ideal laboratory-scale sensor sort ability tests using selected sensors. Ore sorting sensors that show potential based on the ideal sensor tests are further assessed by determining the sort ability of the ore using sensor measurement parameters similar to those used on industrial-scale ore sorting machine...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{evaluate}} heat stress among open-pit mine workers of iron <b>ore</b> <b>based</b> on Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index and also to investigate its relationship with physiological Strain. Material and Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 120 healthy miners, working in an open-pit mine, during summer season, in 2014. Physiological parameters, including core body temperatures and heart rate, were measured according to ISO 9886 standard and physiological strain indices, including Physiological Strain Index (PSI) and Physiological Strain Index based on Heart Rate (PSIHR), were calculated using the equation. Environmental variables as well as physiological parameters were simultaneously measured and recorded during work shift. WBGT index was calculated according to ISO 7243 and using the equation. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS software version 22.   Result: The mean WBGT index was estimated 29. 09 oC for workers. “Drilling” and “factory and Krasher” units showed the highest and lowest WBGT index values of 31. 06 oC and 29. 05 oC, respectively. Workers occupational exposure to heat stress were higher than recommended thresholds based on WBGT index in all work units. A statistically significant correlation was found between WBGT index and physiological strain indices (P value< 0. 001). The Pearson’s correlation coefficients were obtained 0. 658 and 0. 566 respectively, between WBGT index and values of PSI and PSIHR. Conclusion: WBGT index showed a higher correlation with physiological strain Index; and level of heat stress in all work units of mine was higher than recommended thresholds.

Direct replacement of primary sulfides is the dominant process. A complementary rock magnetism study shows similar horizontal magnetic fabrics for calamines and internal sediments.

The annual wind energy rejection percentage is calculated for Crete and Rhodes in this paper. The rejected wind energy {{is defined as the}} electric energy produced by the wind turbines and not absorbed by the utility network, mainly due to power production system's stability and dynamic security reasons. A parametric calculation of the annual wind energy rejection percentage, in terms of the installed wind power, the power demand and the maximum allowed wind power instant penetration percentage, is accomplished. The methodology takes into account (i) the wind power penetration probability, restricted by the thermal generators technical minima and the maximum allowed wind power instant penetration percentage over the instant power demand, and (ii) the wind power production probability, derived by the islands'wind potential. The present paper indicates that isolated power systems which <b>ore</b> <b>based</b> on thermal power plants have a limited wind power installation capacity-in order to achieve and maintain an adequate level of system stability. For a maximum wind power instant penetration percentage of 30 % of the power demand, in order to ensure an annual wind energy rejection percentage less than 109 %, the total installed wind power should not exceed the 40 % of the mean annual power demand. The results of this paper are applicable to medium and great size isolated power systems, with particular features: (i) the power production is based on thermal power plants; (ii) the power demand exhibits intensive seasonal variations and is uncorrelated to the wind data; ON the mean annual power demand is greater than 10 MW; and (iv) a high wind potential, presenting mean annual wind velocity values greater than 7 - 5 m s(- 1), is recorded.

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{naturally}} occurring ores as oxygen carriers in CLC processes is attractive {{because of their}} relative abundance and low cost. Unfortunately, they typically exhibit lower reactivity and lack the mechanical robustness required, when compared to synthetically produced carriers. Impregnation is a suitable method for enhancing both the reactivity and durability of natural ores when used as oxygen carriers for CLC systems. This investigation uses impregnation to improve the chemical and mechanical properties of a Brazilian manganese ore and a Canadian iron ore. The manganese ore was impregnated with Fe 2 O 3 and the iron ore was impregnated with Mn 2 O 3 {{with the goal of}} forming a combined Fe/Mn oxygen carrier. The impregnated ore’s physical characteristics were assessed by SEM, BET and XRD analysis. Measurements of the attrition resistance and crushing strength were used to investigate the mechanical robustness of the oxygen carriers. The impregnated ore’s mechanical and physical properties were clearly enhanced by the impregnation method, with boosts in crushing strength of 11 – 26 % and attrition resistance of 37 – 31 % for the impregnated iron and manganese ores, respectively. Both the unmodified and impregnated ore’s reactivity, for the conversion of gaseous fuel (CH 4 and syngas) and gaseous oxygen release (CLOU potential) were investigated using a bench-scale quartz fluidised-bed reactor. The impregnated iron ore exhibited a greater degree of syngas conversion compared to the other samples examined. Iron <b>ore</b> <b>based</b> oxygen carrier’s syngas conversion increases with the number of oxidation and reduction cycles performed. The impregnated iron ore exhibited gaseous oxygen release over extended periods in an inert atmosphere and remained at a constant 0. 2 % O 2 concentration by volume {{at the end of this}} inert period. This oxygen release would help ensure the efficient use of solid fuels. The impregnated iron ore’s reactivity for CH 4 conversion was similar to the reactivity of its unmodified counterpart. The unmodified manganese ore converted CH 4 to the greatest extent of all the samples tested here, while the impregnated manganese ore exhibited a decrease in reactivity with respect to syngas and CH 4 conversion...|$|E
40|$|The use of sensor based {{technology}} to distinguish in real-time between economic and sub-economic material {{could contribute to}} the optimization of the technology and economics behind mining operations. The goal {{of this study is}} to contribute to the development of a near-infrared sensor-based pre-sorting ore classification model. This study is focused on the 11. 6 Moz Lagunas Norte high sulphidation epithermal gold deposit in the La Libertad Region, Peru and is part of a research collaboration between Barrick Gold and Delft University of Technology. In the deposit 80 % of the gold is hosted in weakly metamorphosed quartzite of the Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous Chimu Fm. A correlation between alteration mineralogy and mineralization is present according to previous authors. In this study a sample set originated from 6 drill holes throughout the deposit was investigated to determine the nature of the correlation between alteration mineralogy, Au and sulphide content by using near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy. This method was chosen since alteration minerals typical for the deposit have diagnostic features in this range. Alteration mineralogy was determined with near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy for a whole rock sample suite. This resulted in the identification of mineralogy, typically observed in the advanced argillic zone of a high sulphidation epithermal deposit. The mineralogy was verified by XRD analyses. Furthermore iron bearing mineralogy, typically found in the oxidised breccia zone, was identified. Principal component analyses on the spectra resulted in the observation that the mineral compositions are mixtures between mineral end members, which can be coupled to progressively neutralising of acidic fluids in the hydrothermal system. Subsamples were extracted and were tested both spectrally, petrographic, and geochemical. This resulted in the conclusion that Au was focussed in fault zones. Partial least squares discriminant analyses was used to classify samples based on Au mineralization revealing that pyrophyllite is an indication for Au$ 0. 25 %. The Au model had an accuracy of 76 % adjusting the threshold would result in a small class which has a high certainty to not contain gold. Hence PLS-DA models showed it is possible to classify <b>ore,</b> <b>based</b> on the near-infrared reflectance spectrum. In which alteration mineralogy can be used as a calibrated proxy for gold and sulphide content at Lagunas Norte. Implementing a pre-sorting step based on NIR would result in a reduction of processed waste, which would result in a reduction of operational expenditure.
