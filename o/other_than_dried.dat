50|$|The Rias Baixas is {{the most}} well known region of Galicia and {{produces}} some of Spain's most sought after dry white wines based on the Albariño grape. While wines have been produced in this region for some time, exports of the wine {{to other areas of}} Europe didn't begin till 16th century and was kept at a steady pace till the phylloxera epidemic devastated the region's vineyards. At the turn of the 20th century many of the region's vineyards were replanted with low quality hybrid vines and some plantings of the Sherry grape Palomino that didn't produce as well in the cooler climate of Rías Baixas. In the 1970s growers began to replant native varieties like Albariño. Throughout the region 12 grape varieties are permitted, including the red wine grapes of Mencia and Espadeiro, but Albariño accounts for 90% of the region's production. The vineyard soils of the area are granite based and ideally situated for the damp maritime climate of the area. Despite the reputation for high yields in other parts of Galicia, Rías Baixas keeps the yield of its Albariño plantings low in order to produce concentrated fruity and fragrant wine. The wines are often a minimum alcohol content of 12% and are rarely produced in a style <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>dry.</b>|$|R

40|$|This study, with {{fieldwork}} {{undertaken in}} the Pang and Lambourn catchments in Southern England, investigates the occurrence and distribution of rapid groundwater flow in the Chalk and evaluates the degree of karstification. A survey of surface karst features revealed a clear spatial pattern in their distribution with three distinctive geomorphological zones. Stream sinks and dolines occur frequently in Zone 1 where there is extensive Palaeogene cover. Only dolines are present in Zone 2 where Clay-with-Flints deposits overlie areas of the Chalk {{and there is little}} surface karst, <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>dry</b> valleys, in Zone 3 where the Chalk outcrops. Tracer tests from three stream sinks in Zone 1 demonstrated connections to springs and rapid groundwater flow (1 - 6 km. d- 1) indicating connected networks of conduits and large fissures over distances up to 5. 1 km. Rapid flow was accompanied by variable tracer attenuation. Unsuccessful results at two other stream sinks were probably due to total attenuation. Further investigation at one site using four dyes and one bacteriophage tracer demonstrated the occurrence of diffusion (probably into the Chalk matrix), but indicated that diffusion is only a minor contributor to attenuation. Very high tracer losses (~ 75 % of dye and ~ 99 % of bacteriophage) appear to be due to transport down multiple flowpaths, many comprising at least one section in which flow is through narrow fissures and fractures. The Single Borehole Dilution technique was developed to identify the distribution of flowing horizons in all three zones. Flow horizons decrease with depth below ground level but have an average spacing of ~ 9 m. Comparison with borehole imaging data suggested that solutional enlargement of fractures to form fissures, tubules and small conduits is common in all areas, but that these features may have limited lateral extent. Overall the Chalk appears to be mildly karstic with small-scale karst development resembling the early stages of speleogenesis. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the optimum moisture content to subsoil based on tillage forces and soil disruption. Two different shanks, a straight shank and a “minimum−tillage ” shank, were tested in a Coastal Plain soil in the soil bins of the National Soil Dynamics Laboratory in Auburn, Alabama. A three−dimensional dynamometer measured tillage forces, and a laser profilometer measured soil disruption. Tillage forces and soil disruption measured in the driest soil condition were greatest. The “minimum−tillage ” shank required more energy and disrupted less surface soil than the straight shank. An index, the trench specific resistance (TSR), was developed to aid in determining the minimum amount of draft force necessary for maximally disrupting a deeper soil profile. Reduced values of TSR were found for the straight shank compared to the “minimum−tillage ” shank, as minimum draft produced maximum soil disturbance. Reduced values of TSR were also found for subsoiling operations conducted at all soil conditions <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the <b>driest.</b> Based on this research, subsoiling should not be conducted at the extreme driest soil condition due to increased draft forces and increased aboveground soil disruption...|$|R

40|$|Drying {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} methods of {{preserving}} food. Primitive societies practiced the drying of meat and fish in the sun long before recorded history. Today the drying of foods is still important as a method of preservation [1]. Drying is traditionally defined as that unit operation which converts a liquid, solid or semi solid feed material into a solid product of significantly lower moisture content. It is a complex process involving simultaneous coupled, transient heat, mass and momentum transport [2]. Food drying also involves simultaneous mass and energy transport phenomena [3]. Dried foods can be stored for long periods without deterioration occurring. The principal reasons for this are that the microorganisms which cause food spoilage and decay are unable to grow and multiply in the absence of sufficient water and many of the enzymes which promote undesired changes in the chemical composition of the food cannot function without water [1]. There are two general processes of drying; adiabatic and non-adiabatic drying processes. The adiabatic dryers involve a drying gas that provides the heat of vaporization and later carries the vapor away from the product. The non-adiabatic dryers involve heat flows into the solids from sources <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the <b>drying</b> gas, e. g. radiation or conduction by contact with a surface [4]. There are several ways to classify the drying methods. Drying methods can be subdivided by the way in which heat is supplied to the moist material and by the mod...|$|R
40|$|In my work I am {{concerned}} with the general concepts of movement and change and specifically with the profoundness {{of the idea that}} we are touched by fiber from the moment of birth until the moment of death. This accessibility of textiles combined with the vast historical foundation of textiles allows for abundant exploration as an artist. In her book, On Weaving, Anni Albers (1965) defines weaving as 2 ̆ 2 the making of a pliable plane 2 ̆ 2 (19). She further describes six structures used to create this pliable plane. They are interlacing (which we normally think of as weaving), plaiting or braiding, looping, knotting, twisting or twining, and matting or felting (Albers, 1965, p. 19). I embrace this definition of weaving because it describes the physicality of the textile itself, the process of making the textile, and the broad focus of weaving. DESCRIPTION OF WORKSUsing structures found in old dishtowels, a series of works titled 2 ̆ 2 Fragments of Everyday Life 2 ̆ 2 explores everyday events {{in the life of a}} dishtowel. Because dishtowels are used in many ways <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>drying</b> dishes, torn edges, stained areas, and twisted fibers communicate these possibilities. 2 ̆ 2 Waffle Fragment 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Waffle Towel 2 ̆ 2 use twenty harness waffle weave structures; 2 ̆ 2 Twill Towel 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Twill Fragment 2 ̆ 2 use twenty harness twill structures, all common structures found in dishtowels. Linen fibers painted with inks before interlacing work to create an integration of surface and structure to enhance the meanings of these humble textiles. 2 ̆ 2 Fragments of Everyday Life 2 ̆ 2 (Figure 1) illustrates these techniques. The series 2 ̆ 2 Deadhead 2 ̆ 7 s Straight Wardrobe 2 ̆ 2 uses the paper making process. This process mats cotton linter fibers and bonds them together with pressure. The paper doll image is used as a vehicle to explore the ordinary man 2 ̆ 7 s shirt and comment on how quickly a personal image can be changed and how superficial that change can be. The paper doll image works as a visual vehicle to facilitate these quick-change possibilities. The male shirt was chosen because it is less commonly thought of as an image maker.

A model-system was developed from the basic chemical composition of pineapple and the addition of other compounds containing one of the main aroma components (ethyl hexanoate).

40|$|Human {{cytomegalovirus}} (HCMV) is {{a widespread}} pathogen that can lay dormant in healthy individuals and establish lifelong latent infection. This successful co-existence is facilitated {{by a number of}} viral gene products that manipulate host cellular functions and immune responses. Among these immunomodulatory genes are four G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) encoded by HCMV, designated US 27, US 28, UL 33, and UL 78. Studies have shown the US 28 gene product to be a functional chemokine receptor that signals both constitutively and in a ligand-dependent manner, resulting {{in a wide range of}} cellular effects. In previous work, we have found that US 27 expression results in at least two biological effects: enhanced CXCR 4 signaling and increased in cellular proliferation in HEK 293 cells. Here, we examined the involvement of two protein domains, the DRY box and the C-terminal intracellular domain (CTD) of US 27, in mediating both cell proliferation and survival. While both domains were required for a proliferative effect, loss of either domain only moderately impacted cell survival, suggesting that US 27 may interact with cell survival pathways through protein regions <b>other</b> <b>than</b> the <b>DRY</b> box and CTD. Quantitative RT-PCR arrays were used to profile changes in cellular gene expression in the HEK 293 -US 27 cell line, and down-regulation of cell cycle regulators CDKN 1 A/p 21 /CIP 1 (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A) and SESN (Sestrin 2 or Hi 95) was observed.

50|$|Drought refuges form habitat mosaics {{which are}} prone to {{increased}} fragmentation by flow regulation. Some mosaics are more vulnerable to water abstraction <b>than</b> <b>others.</b> The <b>drying</b> of pools results in a patchy mosaic of pools in a dry channel which vary in suitability for different species and life stages.

Refuges with low abundance of species require less effort to be adequate than diverse refuges. The size of a pool influences the set of species, total number of organisms, and assembly structure because of physicochemical factors. Species richness and abundance are related to pool morphology. Shade, location, and soil composition are all contributing factors. Heavily shaded pools have colder water, where as lightly shaded pools have increased levels of primary productivity.
