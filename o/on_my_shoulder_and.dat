500|$|John de Lancie {{deliberately}} {{missed his}} first audition for Q {{as he was}} appearing as a lead in a play at the time. A second audition was arranged during lunchtime {{so that he could}} attend. He later said that after he auditioned, [...] "a big guy walked out, put his hands <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> said, 'You make my words sound better than they are.' I said, 'Well, you must be the writer.' And he said, 'I'm Gene Roddenberry.' I had absolutely no idea who that was." ...|$|E
500|$|Reports {{conflict}} {{about who}} shot first, {{but after two}} members of the mob approached the house, someone opened fire. Sarah Carrier was shot in the head. Her nine-year-old niece at the house, Minnie Lee Langley, had witnessed Aaron Carrier taken from his house three days earlier. When Langley heard someone had been shot, she went downstairs to find her grandmother, Emma Carrier. Sylvester placed Minnie Lee in a firewood closet in front of him as he watched the front door, using the closet for cover: [...] "He got behind me in the wood , and he put the gun <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> them crackers was still shooting and going on. He put his gun on my shoulder... told me to lean this way, and then Poly Wilkerson, he kicked the door down. When he kicked the door down, Cuz' Syl let him have it." ...|$|E
60|$|At last I felt a touch <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> heard Fabio's voice.|$|E
60|$|She paid no heed to me; {{she came}} back and put her hands <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> thoughtfully and sadly looked up in my face.|$|R
60|$|She put {{her hands}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> drew me down to kiss her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Smith, {{can you not}} {{guess so}} simple a thing?" [...] said Edra, placing her white hands <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> smiling {{straight}} into my face.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid his}} hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> {{gave me a}} slight turn, {{pointing}} with his other arm at the same time.|$|E
60|$|As I was marching sadly down Portugal Street, I felt a hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> a rough voice which I knew well.|$|E
60|$|She didn't {{seem to hear}} me: she put {{her hand}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> kept me where I was, sitting by her side.|$|E
60|$|What Dick's welcome was I did not hear, but {{judging from}} the grip he put <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> then <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hands, {{he was glad to}} see me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pull away my old hood {{that lies}} there <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> let me tie my pretty dress with this fine belt," [...] said Bud, feeling {{something}} on her back.|$|R
6000|$|... "We had rather {{hot work}} of it, {{that you may}} say. Now, you dog, slip <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> bosom! Pettitt makes the best shoulders, but for a bosom {{you will have to}} go to Ducrow." ...|$|R
60|$|The Sibyl {{laid her}} dry, fleshless hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> forced me roughly {{back into the}} chair from which I had just risen.|$|E
60|$|She {{laid her}} hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> {{looked at me}} in anxious silence. I saw she {{understood}} the serious risk that threatened us.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the best}} way I could have taken to compose her. She laid her head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> smiled faintly through her tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot," [...] {{said the}} Bull, [...] "the Scorpion {{has told me}} that some day, of which I cannot be sure, he will sting me where my neck is set <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> that I shall die bellowing." ...|$|R
6000|$|No {{positive}} responsibility lay <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> yet I did {{not feel}} easy in my mind. [...] "It is of your own free will," [...] I said, as the chaise drove through the lodge-gates, [...] "that your ladyship goes to London?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, an y' are so ill a jester," [...] said Lawless, [...] "ye {{shall have}} your word for me. 'Duckworth and Shelton' is the word; and here, to the illustration, is Shelton <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> to Duckworth do I carry him." ...|$|R

6000|$|Idris {{understood}} me: she {{bowed her}} head <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> wept. [...] "Why," [...] she again asked, [...] "do you tremble, Lionel, what shakes you thus?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pip," [...] said he, {{putting his}} large hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> moving {{me to the}} window, [...] "I don't know one from the other. Who's the Spider?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Do not be {{too sure}} even of that," [...] Staunton said. [...] "Polloch is an obstinate man, and I {{know as well as}} any one, perhaps, how set the Cabinet are upon this German rapprochement. Still--you have {{fastened}} the burden <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> I will carry it." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{instant she}} had let the curtain fall behind her, I flung a garment <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders</b> <b>and</b> a pair of {{slippers}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> feet. Looking from a lattice which opened into the court, I saw her {{in the act of}} passing through the street door, which she carefully left open.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Ruthven," [...] Frank said, [...] "if {{you will}} {{put your hand}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> keep quiet, I think I could carry you around. Goodall and Jackson can take Childers." ...|$|E

60|$|On {{re-entering}} the parlour, I found Diana {{standing at}} the window, looking very thoughtful. Diana {{was a great deal}} taller than I: she put her hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and,</b> stooping, examined my face.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{as young}} as you feel. Why, when I was twenty I felt I had all the cares and {{responsibility}} of the world <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders.</b> <b>And</b> now I am middle-aged more or less, I feel as light as if I were just beginning life." [...] He beamed down at her.|$|R
6000|$|... "How could I look {{men in the}} face, and {{how could}} I ever see the Maid again, if I go not?" [...] I said; and, {{loosening}} her grasp, she laid her hands <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> so gazed <b>on</b> me steadfastly, as if my picture could be fixed on the tablets of her brain.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never heard tell {{of such a}} {{thing in}} my life,' he was saying. 'In {{training}} for a month with all the weight of it <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> then when I get you as fit as a trout, and within two days of fighting the likeliest man on the list, you let yourself into a by-battle with a foreigner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Our eyes met, but I {{could not}} stand his inquiring glance and looked down. He came to me, and sitting {{on the arm of}} my chair, put his hand <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder</b> <b>and</b> said affectionately,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|We hailed {{one of the}} cabs {{which stood}} outside the hotel door, when a heavy hand was laid <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> a voice, strange but not unfamiliar, exclaimed, 'Dr. South, as I am a baronet--' ...|$|E
60|$|All of {{a sudden}} Jones stood up, {{and let out a}} wild Comanche yell. I was more startled by the yell than by the great hand he smashed down <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulder,</b> <b>and</b> for the moment I was dazed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] {{replied the}} Laird; [...] "I have no turn for that service, I should only have wasted {{bombazine}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> flour upon <b>my</b> three-tailed wig--should but have lounged away my mornings in the Outer-House, and my evenings at the play-house, and acquired no more law than {{what would have}} made me a wise justice at a Small-debt Court." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{was made}} to carry a house <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> will do so. I {{want to do the}} best I can for myself, and I shall never have such a chance again. And I cannot help myself, and don't know why; that is the plain truth of the matter.

60|$|I {{was glad}} to drink a long draught, and then, as I saw there was no exit, I could not but make myself more fit to be seen, for my hair had been pulled down <b>and</b> hung <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>shoulders,</b> <b>and</b> <b>my</b> face--ah! it had never looked {{anything}} like that, save on the one day when Eustace and I had the great battle, and our grand-mother punished us both by bread and water for a week.|$|R
