40|$|Background and Objectives: Gastric {{cancer is}} one of the common human {{malignancies}} particularly gastric adenocarcinoma. The stomach also represents the commonest gastrointestinal site for extra-nodal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. This study aims to find out the major types of gastric malignancies in Duhok city, their age and gender distribution and the trend of the types of gastric adenocarcinoma over a six year period from January 2008 till December 2013. Methods: This study included nearly all cases of gastric malignancies diagnosed in Duhok City and enrolled 155 cases. The type of malignancy was diagnosed by histopathological examination and supported in some cases by immunohistochemical staining procedures and investigations. The trend of the two major types of gastric carcinoma was determined over this six year period. Results: The results of this study showed that the carcinoma constitutes the largest proportion of gastric malignancies (87. 7 %), followed by lymphoma (6. 5 %) and then Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (4. 2 %) and lastly neuroendocrine tumors (1. 3 %). The mean age of the intestinal type (62. 1 years) was higher than that of the diffuse type (50. 15 years) and the difference was statistically significant (P: < 0. 05). Similarly the diffuse type was more common in women than men and also the difference was statistically significant (P: < 0. 05). The results of this study show that the trend of intestinal type over a six year period is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rise</b> <b>side</b> while the trend of the diffuse type is more or less the same...|$|E
50|$|Another {{difference}} is that under most practical circumstances, dissolved gases, vapor pressure, and (sometimes) lack of adhesion with tube walls, conspire to render the tensile strength within the liquid ineffective for siphoning. Thus, unlike a chain which has significant tensile strength, liquids usually have little tensile strength under typical siphon conditions, and therefore <b>the</b> liquid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>side</b> cannot be pulled up, {{in the way the}} chain is pulled up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R

25|$|Near the {{existing}} Sanford Field {{was a low}} area between the Old Campus (to the north) and the Ag Campus (to the south) with a small creek (Tanyard Creek) running through it, creating a clearly preferable choice for {{the location of the}} new stadium. This natural valley containing Tanyard Creek would result in reduced costs, as stands could be built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> hill, while the creek could be enclosed in a concrete culvert, on top of which the field would be constructed. The architect for the stadium was TC Atwood of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where North Carolina's Kenan Memorial Stadium had just been completed with a similar design. The 30,000-seat stadium was built in large part with convict labor, as were many public works projects of that era.|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{describe}} {{a number of}} different phenomena seen in the free-surface flow inside a partially filled circular cylinder which is rotated about its horizontal axis of symmetry. At low angular velocities the flow settles into a steady two-dimensional flow with a front where the coating film coalesces with the pool {{at the bottom of the}} cylinder. This mode becomes unstable at higher angular velocities, initially to a sloshing mode <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> coating film and then to an axial instability <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front. The undulations that appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front grow into large-amplitude stationary patterns with cusp-like features for some parameter values. At still higher angular velocities and volume fractions, {{a number of different}} inertial instabilities and patterns appear. We present a phase diagram of the various transitions and characterize some of the more prominent instabilities and patterns in detail, along with some possible mechanisms for the observed behaviour. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} (in gerbil, by Brand et al, 2002) {{call into}} question the classical Jeffress [1], place-code, model for low frequency sound lo-calization that assumes paired (ipsi and con-tra) excitatory inputs. However, the interaural time delay (ITD) response curve is strongly in-uenced by inhibition, shifting its peak into the contra-leading region and out of the physiolog-ical range. Meanwhile, the curve's steeply ris-ing ipsi-leading side is positioned near ITD= 0; a slope-code is suggested. A computational model (adapted from Rothman et al, 1993) was shown to agree with the experimental results, when the brief inhibition is delivered just in ad-vance of (	 ms) the contra-excitation. Using this same HH-type model we explore the effect of the timing and strength of brief inhibitory inputs on ITD responses. Some ef-fects can be demonstrated by considering com-binations of individual (subthreshold) inputs: EPSG+IPSG or 2 EPSGs+IPSG. For example, as in Brand et al, the ITD tuning shifts towards the contra-leading side if the IPSG is timed to just precede the contra-EPSG. Surprisingly, a sin-gle subthreshold EPSG may also elicit a spike if the timing of a brief IPSG falls within a crit-ical but more advanced (say ms) brief time window. This enhancement of the EPSP, a transient form of postinhibitory rebound or exaltation (PIE), depends <b>on</b> <b>the</b> model's low-threshold K+ current. Thus, PIE provides yet another mechanism for responsiveness to pre-cisely timed inputs in the auditory pathway. Correspondingly, PIE also inuences the ITD tuning curve for bilateral tone inputs (when conductances are modeled by periodically mod-ulated Poisson spike trains); the suppressive ef-fect of inhibition <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rising</b> <b>side</b> (ipsi-leading) is diminished as A increases while the responses are enhanced <b>on</b> <b>the</b> falling side (contra leading) due to PIE...|$|R

50|$|Drooping brome has {{demonstrated}} a {{quantitative and qualitative}} response to recent and near-term changes in the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

In addition to stimulation of biomass, rising carbon dioxide may also increase the above ground retention of drooping brome biomass by decreasing removal by animals or bacteria. Ongoing increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide may contribute significantly to drooping brome productivity and fuel load with subsequent effects on wildfire frequency and intensity.|$|R

60|$|The true {{explanation}} apparently lies in {{the intimate}} sympathy which exists between the capillary circulation of {{the surface of the}} head and face, and that of <b>the</b> brain. <b>On</b> applying to Dr. J.

When the sympathetic nerve is divided {{on one side of the}} head, <b>the</b> capillaries <b>on</b> this side are relaxed and become filled with blood, causing the skin to redden and to grow hot, and at the same time the temperature within <b>the</b> cranium <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same <b>side</b> <b>rises.</b> Inflammation of <b>the</b> membranes of the brain leads to the engorgement of the face, ears, and eyes with blood. The first stage of an epileptic fit appears to be the contraction of the vessels of the brain, and the first outward manifestation is, an extreme pallor of countenance.

Introduction: The {{questions}} {{have often been}} asked, can the Blue River be used for irrigation purposes and, can this river be profitably used for power purposes? These {{questions have}} been investigated {{and the result of}} the investigation will be found in the following pages. Rocky Ford is situated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Blue River, about four miles north of the city of Manhattan, Kansas, in, approximately, latitude 39 degrees 12 inches north, and longitude 96 degrees 35 inches west. It derives its name from the fact that at this place there is a smooth rock bottom running entirely across the river; which affords a first class foundation for a dam, mills, and other buildings. <b>The</b> river bank <b>on</b> <b>the</b> west <b>side</b> <b>rises</b> forty-five feet to the Blue Valley Railroad track, from which the ground gradually slopes back a quarter of a mile, where it terminates in a bluff, containing an immense amount of the best structural limestone.

5000|$|The waters, {{with their}} high mineral content, are reputed to have healing qualities.The more easily {{accessible}} {{and more often}} visited of the two waterfalls is the [...] "cascada chica," [...] also called the Amphitheatre. This cliff rises over fifty metres above the valley floor, {{where there is a}} natural platform about sixty meters wide. This platform has four springs. The water from three of the four springs is captured by a number of small natural pools and two large artificial pools in which visitors can swim. The lower of the two pools is very close to the cliff edge and was built in 2007. [...] In these pools, the water appears a turquoise green due to the mineral concentration. The fourth spring is located closest to the edge and responsible for most of the waterfall rock formation. Two of <b>the</b> four springs <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Amphitheatre <b>side</b> <b>rise</b> from <b>the</b> level floor and appear to bubble up, which {{is the source of the}} name. The bubbling action of these and some other springs is thought to occur due to construction of underground water currents.

40|$|Investigations of the {{physiological}} mechanisms shaping latitudinal adaptation and seasonal acclimatization to temperature {{are carried out}} to go further into {{the question of how}} marine invertebrates and their ecosystems respond to climate change. While thermal responses can be found at various levels of organisation we expect sensitivity to be highest at the organismal level, the animals balance of oxygen demand and supply. This balance is composed of energy consuming processes like metabolic maintenance, growth, reproduction, muscular exercise and others <b>on</b> <b>the</b> demand side, and of oxygen providing processes like ventilation, blood oxygenation, circulation, tissue oxygenation and cellular respiration <b>on</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>side.</b> <b>Rising</b> temperature leads to a mismatch situation causing an increased oxygen demand. The organism has to react either by increasing the rate of supply processes or by reducing energy consuming processes that are not essential for survival. The capacity of the supply system is limited and when pejus temperatures are reached, it is not able to meet demand any more, blood oxygenation decreases. Long-term warming beyond pejus temperatures thereby leads to reduced performance (e. g. growth, reproduction, muscle exercise) with likely severe ecological consequences (decreased abundance, local extinction, shift in distribution). Performance optima and the width of thermal tolerance windows and their location <b>on</b> <b>the</b> temperature scale were quantified investigating standard metabolism, growth and muscular exercise <b>on</b> <b>the</b> demand side and ventilation, haemoglobin properties and tissue oxygenation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> supply side in populations of the lugworm Arenicola marina.
