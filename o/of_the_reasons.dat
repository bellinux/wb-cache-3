A virus's polymerase enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, {{and this is one}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E

5|$|In 1941 the Soviet Union {{decided to}} cease {{production}} of the 152 mm howitzer M1938 (M-10).
