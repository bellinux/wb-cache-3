50|$|First, {{research}} into illusory superiority is distinct {{in terms of}} the comparison target because an individual compares <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> a hypothetical average peer rather than a tangible person. Alicke et al. (1995) found that the effect of illusory superiority was still present but was significantly reduced when participants compared <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> real people (also participants in the experiment, who were seated in the same room), as opposed to when participants compared <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> an average peer. This suggests that {{research into}} illusory superiority may itself be biasing results and finding a greater effect than would actually occur in real life.|$|R

A sample of 281 {{women between the ages}} of 30 and 80 participated in this study. Significant positive relationships between social comparison behavior and (a) appearance self-discrepancy and (b) the importance placed on achieving ideal appearance were found. A significant inverse relationship between social comparison behavior and body satisfaction was also observed. Participants older in age were found to be less likely to compare <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> fashion models. However, the younger that participants felt they were, the more inclined they were to compare <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> models. Participants who reported a larger difference between their ideal and actual age perceived more discrepancy between their ideal and actual appearance, were generally more dissatisfied with their body and appearance, and were more likely to compare <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> fashion models...|$|R
