5|$|On 22 May 1957 the BBC {{produced}} a live <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> from the railway, during which Wynford Vaughan Thomas and Huw Weldon commentated {{on a trip}} from Dolgoch to Abergynolwyn. The publicity from this broadcast drew substantial numbers of visitors to the railway that summer, with more than 57,500passengers carried, and this increase in revenue in turn enabled the railway to continue to improve its infrastructure and provide tourists with a better experience. The following year locomotive No.1 Talyllyn returned to steam after an extensive overhaul.|$|E

From 8–9 July 1967, an ascent {{featured}} in The Great Climb, a live BBC three-night <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast,</b> which had around 15 million viewers.

5|$|The {{coronation}} of GeorgeVI in 1937 {{was broadcast}} on radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), {{and parts of}} the service were filmed and shown in cinemas. The state procession was shown live on the new BBC Television Service, the first major <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast.</b> At ElizabethII's coronation in 1953, most of the proceedings inside the abbey were also televised by the BBC. Originally, events as far as the choir screen were to be televised live, with the remainder to be filmed and released later after any mishaps were edited out. This would prevent television viewers from seeing most of the highlights of the coronation, including the actual crowning, live; it led to controversy in the press and even questions in parliament. The organising committee subsequently decided that the entire ceremony would be televised, except for the anointing and communion, which had also been excluded from photography at the last coronation. It was revealed 30 years later that the about-face was due to the personal intervention of the queen. It is estimated that over 20million people watched the broadcast in the United Kingdom. The coronation contributed to the increase of public interest in television, which rose significantly.|$|E
25|$|When made redundant, Blackpool Tram No. 166 was commandeered by the BBC, {{along with}} its sister No. 165, as an <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> unit. Many seats were removed, and cameras and {{recording}} gear were mounted, to allow the illuminations to be filmed - the already congested promenade could not take any more traffic, ruling out conventional <b>outside</b> <b>broadcast</b> units.|$|E

It supplied its flagship HDC-1500 cameras {{as well as its}} new HDC-P1 unit, a compact, point-of-view (POV)-type camera with 3, 2/3-inch CCD sensors. The 3D games were produced for FIFA by Host Broadcast Services.|$|E

25|$|The Riordans (1965 to 1979) made by Raidió Teilifís Éireann (then called Telefís Éireann) {{was set in}} {{the fictional}} townland of Leestown in County Kilkenny. Its use of <b>Outside</b> <b>Broadcast</b> Units and its filming of its episodes on {{location}} rather than in studio, broke the mould of broadcasting in the soap opera genre. It was the second Irish soap opera and inspired the creation of its British equivalent, Emmerdale Farm (now called Emmerdale) by Yorkshire Television in 1972.|$|E
