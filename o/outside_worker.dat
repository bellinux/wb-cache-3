5000|$|In 2012, {{several of}} the city's {{contracts}} expired with their unionized staff: inside <b>workers,</b> <b>outside</b> <b>workers,</b> part-time parks and recreation staff, paramedics and library staff. The first union to settle was the <b>outside</b> <b>workers,</b> represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Local 416. Negotiations with the <b>outside</b> <b>workers</b> went to the deadline and a deal was made averting a strike or lockout. One major change was the controversial [...] "jobs for life" [...] clause in the bargaining agreement which stated that all permanent employees with 10 years of service or more were guaranteed a job of equal pay for equal value if theirs was contracted out. CUPE accepted a change to 15 years of service under the same provision. During the 2012 bargaining sessions, Holyday threatened to unilaterally impose the city's offer.|$|R

40|$|Division {{of labor}} is a {{defining}} characteristic of social insects and fundamental to their ecological success. Many of the numerous tasks essential {{for the survival of}} the colony must be performed at a specific location. Consequently, spatial organization is an integral aspect of division of labor. The mechanisms organizing the spatial distribution of workers, separating inside and <b>outside</b> <b>workers</b> without central control, is an essential, but so far neglected aspect of division of labor. In this study, we investigate the behavioral mechanisms governing the spatial distribution of individual workers and its physiological underpinning in the ant Myrmica rubra. By investigating worker personalities we uncover position-associated behavioral syndromes. This context-independent and temporally stable set of correlated behaviors (positive association between movements and attraction towards light) could promote the basic separation between inside (brood tenders) and <b>outside</b> <b>workers</b> (foragers). These position-associated behavior syndromes are coupled with a high probability to perform tasks, located at the defined position, and a characteristic cuticular hydrocarbon profile. We discuss the potentially physiological causes for the observed behavioral syndromes and highlight how the study of animal personalitie...|$|R
