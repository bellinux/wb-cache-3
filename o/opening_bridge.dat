2500|$|The {{river was}} first crossed {{with a wooden}} bridge in the 1850s. This was {{replaced}} with the iron [...] "Jervois Bridge" [...] in 1878; It was named by Sir William Jervois after himself. Jervois Bridge was an <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> first operated by horse power, and later by mechanical means. It was replaced with a fixed bridge {{in the same position}} in 1969, when there was no longer a need for small boats to pass. Birkenhead Bridge, the first bascule bridge in Australia, opened in 1940. In 2004 Premier Mike Rann said the State government would build new rail and road bridges over the Port River at a cost of $178 million. On 3 April [...] 2005 he announced that the 'opening and closing' bridges would be toll-free and would be opened twice a day to minimise disruptions to road traffic. It was opened for traffic on 3 August 2008. It is between Docks 1 and 2 at Port Adelaide and links with Francis Street to the east and Victoria Road to the west.|$|E

This neighbourhood was now forbidden for non-Jews.|$|R
50|$|The {{new line}} {{involved}} constructing a viaduct at Shoreham and an <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> over the River Arun at Ford, West Sussex. The new line was opened in stages between November 1845 and June 1846.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the public panic and indignation caused by the accident, the Connecticut Legislature {{enforced}} a law compelling every train in the state to come to a dead halt before crossing any <b>opening</b> <b>bridge.</b> The engineer was charged with gross negligence and held primarily responsible for the disaster.|$|E
50|$|Completion of the Chepstow {{bridge was}} much delayed, while the easier {{construction}} between its east side and Grange Court was proceeding well. Construction of the Gloucester and Forest of Dean Railway was also going well, although the <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> over the Severn at Gloucester, and the junction arrangements with the GWR at Gloucester station were causing delay.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s traffic {{began to}} fall and low fixed bridges would have {{replaced}} <b>opening</b> <b>bridges</b> but {{for the actions of}} the Inland Waterways Association of Ireland which persuaded the Tánaiste to encourage passenger launches, which kept the bridges high enough for navigation. Since then the leisure trade has steadily increased, becoming a great success story.|$|R

50|$|In 1859 the B&ER {{took over}} from Bridgwater Corporation a short horse tramway between their {{station and the}} wharf. Having {{acquired}} the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal, the B&ER owned the canal dock, and the B&ER then converted the tramway for locomotive operation, and extended it to the dock. It was opened as mixed gauge in November 1867. An <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> across the River Parrett was commissioned in March 1871.|$|E
50|$|For years, debate raged in Port Adelaide {{about the}} need for a third {{crossing}} over the Port River, in addition to the existing Birkenhead Bridge and Jervois Bridge. Ideas for the crossing included an under-river tunnel, closed bridge, causeway and <b>opening</b> <b>bridge.</b> In the early 2000s the State Government announced the Port River Expressway project, a highway linking Port Adelaide to Adelaide's northern suburbs. The project included a closed bridge across the Port River. However the Port Adelaide community were concerned a closed bridge would cut-off the Port River and block larger boats from accessing the Port's inner harbour. After a strong community campaign, the State Government agreed to build a high-level single-leaf bascule <b>opening</b> <b>bridge,</b> instead of a closed bridge. AbiGroup was awarded the tender to build the bridge in 2005 and construction began the following year. The twin bascule bridges were designed by the New York City based engineering firm, Hardesty & Hanover, LLP. The bridge was expected to be complete in December 2007, but due to delays it was opened for vehicles on 3 August 2008.|$|E

50|$|By 1977 {{there were}} 190 boys aged 5 to 17 {{living in the}} {{boarding}} school, with 4 teachers. Then for better integration of the youngsters into the community, the massive boarding school was broken up into more family-like living, beginning in 1984 with Garbinet house and adding San Blas house in 1998 and an apartment in 2000. San Agustín was opened in 2001, <b>Opening</b> <b>Bridge</b> Apartment in 2005, and Florida flats replaced Garbinet house in 2006. These now accommodate 38 minors ages 6 through 18 years. Support staff includes 40 professionals {{in the areas of}} daily life, psychology, social work, and family support. Efforts are made to assist the families and to return the youth to their homes or to avail them of other social services.|$|E
50|$|On 11 March 1872 a short line {{called the}} Bristol Harbour Railway was opened from the {{junction}} of the B&ER and GWR at Temple Meads to the Floating Harbour in Bristol; it was ¾ mile (1 km) long, and included a tunnel, a long viaduct and an <b>opening</b> <b>bridge.</b> It was constructed by the GWR and B&ER jointly, with much work being undertaken at the harbour by the Corporation of Bristol. It was a single line, and mixed gauge, although neither the GWR nor the B&ER had narrow gauge trackage in the area. It was soon decided to extend to Wapping Wharf, where more space was available, and this was authorised in 1873, but the opening took place after the B&ER amalgamated.|$|E
50|$|The line onwards from Haverfordwest to Neyland {{was opened}} on 15 April 1856; the {{terminus}} was known at first as Milford Haven, after the waterway {{on which it}} was located; the name Neyland was adopted in 1859. The extension was a single line; there was an <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> with a lifting span over the River Cleddau at Haverfordwest. Although {{there were a few}} dwellings there, Neyland had no pre-existing commerce whatever, and was created entirely by the SWM. A twice-weekly ferry to Waterford was started soon after the railway opening. As the berthing facilities were expanded, four pontoons were incorporated into the works from the Cornwall Railway, where they had been used for floating the main spans of the Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> {{collapse}} has garnered considerable critical acclaim, {{with many}} stating {{it as being}} on par with the pile-up sequence from Final Destination 2. It has been said to be [...] "one of the single best sequences of any film all year" [...] by Boxoffice Magazine. Uk.real.com stated that the <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> collapse sequence is [...] "beautifully directed and choreographed". Eric D. Snider has stated in his review for Film.com that [...] "The opening premonition is nerve-janglingly effective." [...] The New York Post called the bridge collapse sequence [...] "spectacular", and Daily News deemed it [...] "terrifying". USA Today commented on the sequence, saying [...] "The effect is terrific and reminiscent of the bridge destruction from Mission: Impossible III." [...] Betsy Sharkey, a Los Angeles Times film critic stated in her negative review [...] "I will say, the bus, and the bridge it must cross, does make for a pretty incredible wham-bam opening sequence," [...] and further added [...] "The big crumble is a stunner of an opener." [...] In a review for MSN.com, Kat Murphy said [...] "the fifth chapter starts out with a slambang catastrophe", then stated that the bridge collapse is [...] "skillfully orchestrated", and [...] "this sequence is actually enhanced by 3-D: Holes in the disintegrating bridge seem to pull the gaze down - dizzyingly - to the river below, and jagged camera angles on hanging railings and sliding debris muddle our sense of what's up, what's down." [...] The Hollywood Reporter praised [...] "This film's opening sequence is undeniably spectacular." [...] Aaron Hillis from The Village Voice called the bridge collapse [...] "breathtakingly staged". The Advocate stated that [...] "Director Steve Quale and writer Heisserer stage the bridge’s collapse in swift but exacting detail." [...] The Austin Chronicle said the bridge collapse sequence is [...] "spectacularly gruesome".|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s {{the road}} {{now known as}} the Cobb Highway was proclaimed as part of State Highway 21, which also {{included}} the road north through Wilcannia, White Cliffs and Tibooburra to Warri Gate at the Queensland border. Highway 21 was truncated 18 km south of Wilcannia on 9 February 1945 when the Silver City Highway was proclaimed. The Cobb Highway received its name in 1947 in commemoration of the Cobb & Co. coach company. In 1954, with the institution of the National Route system, the Cobb Highway in New South Wales and the Northern Highway in Victoria were designated to be National Route 75. In May 1969 a bridge over the Edward River at Deniliquin was constructed (replacing a timber bridge built in 1895). In June 1973 a bridge over Murrumbidgee River at Hay was built (replacing the 1874 <b>opening</b> <b>bridge).</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{analysis}} {{video from}} a traffic camera, the police offered a {{reconstruction of the}} event. After the bridge barriers had been lowered and before Viola Beach's car came, two lorries stood in the right lane and two personal cars in the left lane, {{in front of the}} bridge's first barrier. Viola Beach's car came in the left lane, used the brakes then swerved into the narrow shoulder of the road to the left, momentarily used the brake after passing the first car, then drove on. The driver in the front car in the left lane estimated the band's car drove past at 60 km/h. He said the band's car drove without using the brake through the two barriers. The car hit the <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> which had been raised 1.5 m (4.92 ft), then fell 30 m down into the canal; the impact of hitting the bridge may have been enough to kill the car's occupants.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>opening,</b> the <b>bridge</b> {{has seen}} a much higher use than the {{previous}} path and stairwell. The National Bicycle Greenway has used it since 2003 in its Oakland to Berkeley Mayors' Ride.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the route}} of the line was {{relatively}} flat ground, representing an easy route for construction of a railway. The main feature of the line was the wrought iron bridge crossing the River Ouse, the Skelton viaduct; at the time of construction it was amongst the largest <b>opening</b> <b>bridges</b> in the world, with a 250 ft swing span, and total length including fixed spans of 830 ft. The contractors for the bridge were Butler and Pitts of Stanningley (fixed spans), and Pease, Hutchingson and Company (Skerne Ironworks) for the swing span, with hydraulic machinery from William Armstrong (Newcastle upon Tyne).|$|R

50|$|At {{the west}} end, two options for {{crossing}} the River Ness and Caledonian Canal were developed. One involving {{a high level}} vertical <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> which will allow the majority of canal traffic to pass under {{without the need for}} opening. The other involved a bridge over the river and an aqueduct under the canal. Both of these designs are technically complex and were considered in detail along by the key stakeholders involved in the project. Ultimately it was decided that a bridge over the river and a tunnel under the canal were the best option, although more expensive. Following a public consultation, 8 route options were put forward for consideration by Highland Council from which one was chosen,. This route passes through the canal park area of Inverness, and remains highly contentious. An Inverness Courier poll indicated that 85% of residents would choose an alternative route, most popularly one through Torvean Quarry.|$|E
50|$|The show {{begins with}} the Sleezesisters remix of Deeper Shade Of Blue, whilst a mashed up version of the {{official}} video is seen on the stage screen. A large explosion is seen before the group comes into view and lowers {{from the roof of}} the arena onto stage perched upon a rounded platform. Once they reach the stage, each member poses to the beat of the song one by one as a spotlight appears on them. They are wearing soldier styled blue over coats. They then sing the <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> to the song. Once the full song begins, they walk forward and take off the coats to reveal, red, blue and black outfits before performing the song. The Tony Moran remix of One For Sorrow is played next, followed by the group chatting to the audience before singing Say You'll Be Mine. Lee then talks to the audience before the three girls sing a cover of I Know Him So Well.|$|E
5000|$|The Dutch {{government}} is currently {{considering whether to}} replace some of its existing lock and <b>opening</b> <b>bridge</b> combinations with naviducts. Naviducts have a high construction cost compared to standard locks and bridges, but benefit the economy by reducing delays. The former State Secretary for Infrastructure and the Environment, Joop Atsma, issued a statement in 2012 detailing the factors influencing the decision {{to build a new}} naviduct on the Afsluitdijk at Kornwerderzand. Strengthening of the existing locks was costed at €33 million, building new locks at €91 million and a naviduct and new locks at €200-450 million, {{depending on the size of}} locks and size of highway. A naviduct would give waiting time annualised benefits of €3 million to maritime traffic and €13 million to road traffic, based on the bridge opening 7,000 times a year. Cost-benefit analysis of all potential solutions were considered, and for the present time, the locks will be strengthened. However, it is quite possible that a naviduct will be built to replace the locks when they reach the end of their useful life in 2050.|$|E
