5|$|According to Stodart, the fess checquy and buckles, {{prominent}} in 'MacAulay heraldry', {{are derived from}} {{the arms of the}} Stewarts. The basic Stewart coat of arms is blazoned: Or, a fess chequy azure and argent. The buckles used in 'Stewart heraldry' are ultimately derived from the canting arms of Alexander Boncle (d. by 1300), blazoned: gules, three buckles Or. Boncle's daughter (who in time became his heiress) married Sir John Stewart (d. 1298), younger son of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland. Together the couple founded the 'Bonkyl' Stewart branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clan,</b> and their descendants tended to use the 'Bonkyl' buckles as their heraldic differencing. One of the couple's sons, Sir Allan Stewart of Dreghorn (d. 1333), founded the Stewart of Darnley branch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clan,</b> which in time became the earls and dukes of Lennox.|$|E

5|$|Blackrock is a play by Australian playwright Nick Enright {{that was}} first {{performed}} in 1995. It {{was adapted from}} a 1992 play by Enright, entitled A Property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clan,</b> which {{was inspired by the}} murder of Leigh Leigh in Stockton, Australia in 1989. The plays were both well received critically, though they did attract criticism from both Leigh's family and the media due to the fictionalisation of an actual murder. Despite repeated statements from Enright that the plays were a work of fiction, they have both often been considered by viewers to be a factual account. A Property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clan</b> was shortlisted for a New South Wales Premier's Literary Award in 1993, and Blackrock won the AWGIE Award for Best Play in 1996. Blackrock was developed into a feature film of the same name in 1997.|$|E

5|$|After a varying {{amount of}} {{training}} (at {{least a few}} months), apprentices are eventually made warriors. Another naming ceremony is held, this time to mark the cat as being a full member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clan.</b> Warriors are given their own unique suffix that often marks their personality or appearance; for example, ‘Graystripe’ would be named after the grey stripe running down his back, ‘Brokentail’ after the kink in his tail, and ‘Sandstorm’ after her fiery personality. It is extremely rare for warriors to meet another cat with the exact same name, but often a warrior will meet another cat with the same first part of their name, and very often will a warrior meet another cat with the same last part of their name (such as fur, tail, or heart). Once named, warriors hold a vigil at night to protect the clan, while the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clan</b> is sleeping. After the vigil, warriors are free {{to move into the}} warrior’s den, where the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clan</b> sleeps. The duty of a warrior is to protect and uphold their Clan at all costs. They are able to hunt by themselves, and are generally skilled at defending themselves in battle. Warriors can take a mate, and females can give birth to new kits; if this occurs, the expecting mother, known as a 'queen', will avoid warrior duties for six months before returning to them once her kits are made apprentices. The vast majority of warriors are also chosen to later be mentors to new apprentices. Warriors will remain in this position for the remainder of their life, or until they are old enough to retire.|$|E

He is the adoptive son of the former Kurohabaki leader, Terumune, and was previously denied leadership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>clan,</b> despite his striving for approval. Instead, Terumune decided that his blood-related son Yamabiko, born after Masamune's arrival, would become leader.
