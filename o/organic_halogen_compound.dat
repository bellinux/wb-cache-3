40|$|Methyl iodide (CH 3 I) is a {{volatile}} <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compound</b> that contributes {{significantly to the}} transport of iodine from the ocean to the atmosphere, where it {{plays an important role}} in tropospheric chemistry. CH 3 I is naturally produced and occurs in the global ocean. The processes involved in the formation of CH 3 I, however, are not fully understood. In fact, there is an ongoing debate whether production by phytoplankton or photochemical degradation of organic matter is the main source term. Here, both the biological and photochemical production mechanisms are considered in a biogeochemical module that is coupled to a one-dimensional water column model for the eastern tropical Atlantic. The model is able to reproduce observed subsurface maxima of CH 3 I concentrations. But, the dominating source process cannot be clearly identified as subsurface maxima can occur due to both direct biological and photochemical production. However, good agreement between the observed and simulated difference between surface and subsurface methyl iodide concentrations is achieved only when direct biological production is taken into account. Production rates for the biological CH 3 I source that were derived from published laboratory studies are shown to be inappropriate for explaining CH 3 I concentrations in the eastern tropical Atlantic...|$|E
40|$|Harmful gases are {{released}} into the atmosphere through burning of residues which is commonly practiced in Nigeria and {{can be attributed to}} climate change issues. Agricultural residues have the potentials to be used as energy and chemical source and meet its deficit in the country. This paper focuses on utilization of lignocellulosic materials obtained from two agricultural residues through renewable technology to produce bio-energy and chemical feedstock. The lignocellulosic materials were extracted from palm fruit (Elaeis guineensis) fibre and physic nut (Jatropha curcas) shell, and pyrolyzed under low temperature and pressure at various particle sizes. The main properties of solid (lignocellulosic) materials were tested and the bio-oil produced was analyzed using GC-MS. Results show proximate analyses (volatile, ash and fixed carbon contents) and ultimate analysis (carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, magnesium, phosphorus and zinc). The pH value of the bio-oil from both residues increased with increase in temperatures. The density, viscosity and calorific value of the palm and physic residue oil are 831. 99 and 947. 5 kg/m 3, 0. 695 and 1. 58 cPa at room temperature, 22. 33 and 14. 169 kJ/g, respectively. Aromatics and other compounds are major dominant compounds in the palm fruit fibre oil which is characterized for bio-fuel production. Physic nut shell oil contains aromatic ethers, cyclic ethers, secondary amides and <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compound</b> which are important chemical feedstock.

40|$|Production {{pathways}} of {{the prominent}} volatile <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compound</b> methyl iodide (CH 3 I) {{are not fully}} understood. Based on observations, production of CH 3 I via photochemical degradation of organic material or via phytoplankton production has been proposed. Additional insights could not be gained from correlations between observed biological and environmental variables or from biogeochemical modeling to identify unambiguously the source of methyl iodide. In this study, we aim {{to address this question}} of source mechanisms with a three-dimensional global ocean general circulation model including biogeochemistry (MPIOM–HAMOCC (MPIOM – Max Planck Institute Ocean Model HAMOCC – HAMburg Ocean Carbon Cycle model)) by carrying out a series of sensitivity experiments. The simulated fields are compared with a newly available global data set. Simulated distribution patterns and emissions of CH 3 I differ largely for the two different production pathways. The evaluation of our model results with observations shows that, on the global scale, observed surface concentrations of CH 3 I can be best explained by the photochemical production pathway. Our results further emphasize that correlations between CH 3 I and abiotic or biotic factors do not necessarily provide meaningful insights concerning the source of origin. Overall, we find a net global annual CH 3 I air–sea flux that ranges between 70 and 260 Gg yr − 1. On the global scale, the ocean acts as a net source of methyl iodide for the atmosphere, though in some regions in boreal winter, fluxes are of the opposite direction (from the atmosphere to the ocean) ...|$|E

40|$|Materials {{of steam}} water cycles can suffer from {{corrosion}} induced by halide anions in feedwater. <b>Organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds</b> in feedwater can be degraded and release halide anions under high temperature and pressure. Therefore {{it is necessary}} to be able to measure the <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> concentration. Existing measurements including Adsorbable <b>Organic</b> <b>Halogens</b> and Gas Chromatography are either not convenient, affordable, accurate or reproducible enough at these very low concentrations, meaning a new method should be developed. In this research the option of destroying the organic compounds to release the halide anions and measure them with ion chromatography was studied. The question is, which {{is the best way to}} destroy the organic compounds and release the halides anions. Six <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> model <b>compounds</b> were tested: aliphatic and aromatic fluorine, chlorine and bromine containing compounds. Two main methods were studied: UV/vacuumUV (VUV) photolysis and wet chemical oxidation with K 2 S 2 O 8. There are three phases in the research: 1. Study different UV lamps and oxidants on the target compounds and find the optimal combinations. 2. Try different dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8 and find an optimum. 3. Test halide release of target compounds in power plant conditions. In the experiments, three kinds of lamps were applied: VUV, low pressure (LP) lamp and medium pressure (MP) lamp. H 2 O 2 and TiO 2 were used as a catalyst. Last but not least, wet chemical oxidation was tested, with varying dosages of K 2 S 2 O 8. The experiments were executed with both single compounds and mixed compounds. The results show that the organic fluorine is the hardest to degrade while organic bromine is the easiest. Aromatic compounds are easier to degrade than aliphatic compounds. This happens not only in AOP process, but also in power plant conditions. The recovery of bromide and chloride in most methods could reach 95 % while aliphatic fluorine could only reach at most 70 %. It can be concluded that MP/H 2 O 2 is the most effective method for degradation of <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds</b> since it requires less time for the reaction to be completed, but wet chemical oxidation also showed high recoveries for all halide anions. The advantage of wet chemical oxidation is simple equipment and universality. The method with the lowest degradation rate and recovery is UV/TiO 2.

Electrocatalytic activity was evaluated by monitoring the debromination of mono-bromoacetic acid (MBAA). The best operational conditions were a silver loading of 2 mg/cm 2, applied current density of 5. 5 mA/cm 2, and pH 7. 0. After five successive cycles, the Ag/Cu electrode remained stable for the electrocatalytic debromination of MBAA.

Photolysis rates can either be used from LUT or calculated on-line using FAST-TUV which is fully coupled with the aerosol and microphysics modules. The system may be virtually configured with any desired chemical mechanism using a modified version of SPACK (Simplified Preprocessor for Atmospheric Chemical Kinetics). For initial and boundary conditions, the system is able to be nudged by large scale atmospheric-chemistry models analysis using a Newtonian relaxation scheme. Currently the system is able to assimilate MOCAGE (Meteo-France global chemistry model) fields.

50|$|Very violent {{volcanic}} eruptions can inject HCl into the stratosphere, but researchers {{have shown that}} the contribution is not significant compared to that from CFCs.A similar erroneous assertion is that soluble <b>halogen</b> <b>compounds</b> from the volcanic plume of Mount Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica are a major contributor to the Antarctic ozone hole.|$|R
