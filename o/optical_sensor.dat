Some of these {{instruments}} produce a virtual image when applied to the human eye; others produce a real image that can be captured on photographic film or an <b>optical</b> <b>sensor,</b> or can be viewed on a screen. In these devices lenses are sometimes paired up with curved mirrors to make a catadioptric system where the lens's spherical aberration corrects the opposite aberration in the mirror (such as Schmidt and meniscus correctors).|$|E
25|$|The Wii Remote, {{also known}} colloquially as the Wiimote, {{is the primary}} {{controller}} for Nintendo's Wii console. A main feature of the Wii Remote is its motion sensing capability, which allows the user to interact with and manipulate items on screen via gesture recognition and pointing {{through the use of}} accelerometer and <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> technology. Another feature is its expandability through the use of attachments. The attachment bundled with the Wii console is the Nunchuk, which complements the Wii Remote by providing functions similar to those in gamepad controllers. Some other attachments include the Classic Controller, Wii Zapper, and the Wii Wheel, originally used for the Mario Kart Wii racing video game.|$|E

2500|$|The data {{collecting}} part of CRISM {{is called the}} <b>Optical</b> <b>Sensor</b> Unit (OSU) and consists of two spectrographs, one that detects visible light from 400 to 830nm and one that detects infrared light from 830 to 4050nm. [...] The infrared detector is cooled to –173° Celsius (–280° Fahrenheit) by a radiator plate and three cryogenic coolers. [...] While in targeted mode, the instrument gimbals {{in order to continue}} pointing at one area even though the MRO spacecraft is moving. [...] The extra time collecting data over a targeted area increases the signal to noise ratio as well as the spatial and spectral resolution of the image. [...] This scanning ability also allows the instrument to perform emission phase functions, viewing the same surface through variable amounts of atmosphere, which can be used to determine atmospheric properties. [...] The Data Processing Unit (DPU) of CRISM performs in-flight data processing including compressing the data before transmission.|$|E
2500|$|The guitar {{controller}} for Rock Band, {{modeled after}} a Fender Stratocaster, {{is used for}} lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay. It has several features akin to Guitar Heros controller, as it features five colored fret buttons on {{the neck of the}} guitar (which correspond to on-screen notes), a strum bar, and a whammy bar. To use the guitar controller, players must hold the fret button that corresponds to the scrolling colored note on-screen while simultaneously pushing the strum bar. In addition, five smaller fret buttons are located further down on the neck. [...] These buttons can be used to play all notes in guitar solos (denoted by the note track turning blue) as hammer-ons and pull-offs, without the need to strum. The whammy bar can be used to distort the sound of held notes. A special effects switch can be used to toggle between five different guitar effects during solos and Overdrive periods (ranging from wah-wah, flange, chorus, echo, distortion, doubler, slap back echo, medium echo, and long echo), however, this switch was removed from the Rock Band 3 edition of the guitar. Overdrive for guitarists can be deployed by holding the controller in a vertical position or pressing the [...] "Select/Back/-" [...] button. The controller is offered in both wired and wireless versions. Rock Band games allow players to apply a [...] "Lefty Flip" [...] setting, supporting left-handed guitar players. [...] The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter fret buttons, a more reliable strum bar, and <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> and microphone to help the player calibrate the video and audio output from their television/stereo system's setup.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{concentrates on}} the implementation of 16 pairs of <b>optical</b> <b>sensors</b> in a process tomography system. The working principle {{is based on the}} switch and measure principle in electrical capacitance tomography (ECT), but uses fan beam shaped projection from light emitters. The fast settling time of <b>optical</b> <b>sensors</b> and wide coverage of an optical beam forms the interest to be implemented in a tomography system.

The 16 pairs of <b>optical</b> <b>sensors</b> consist of 16 3 -mm PIN photo-diodes and 16 3 -mm LEDs.

The results for concentration profiles and reconstructed images of the original objects show significant agreement for further research...|$|R

Currently, the program is {{in the final stages of}} hardware fabrication and environmental testing of the passive <b>optical</b> <b>sensors</b> and electro-optics.

The benefits of this technology for advanced aircraft include the following: improved reliability and reduced certification cost due to greater immunity to EME (electromagnetic effects); reduced harness volume and weight; elimination of short circuits and sparking in wiring due to insulation deterioration; lower maintenance costs (fewer components); greater flexibility in data bus protocol and architecture; absence of ground loops; and higher operating temperatures for electrically passive <b>optical</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R

50|$|FunctionAn <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> {{converts}} {{light rays}} into electronic signals. It measures the physical {{quantity of light}} and then translates it into a form that is readable by an instrument. An <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> is generally {{part of a larger}} system that integrates a source of light, a measuring device and the <b>optical</b> <b>sensor.</b> This is often connected to an electrical trigger. The trigger reacts to a change in the signal within the light sensor. An <b>optical</b> <b>sensor</b> can measure the changes from one or several light beams. When a change occurs, the light sensor operates as a photoelectric trigger and therefore either increases or decreases the electrical output.An optical switch enables signals in optical fibres or integrated optical circuits to be switched selectively from one circuit to another. An optical switch can operate by mechanical means or by electro-optic effects, magneto-optic effects as well as by other methods. Optical switches are optoelectronic devices which can be integrated with integrated or discrete microelectronic circuits.|$|E
