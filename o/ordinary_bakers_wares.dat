Already the public is put to great and entirely unremunerative expense in inspecting and checking weights and hunting down the grosser instances of adulteration, grubbiness and dirt, and with it all the common bakehouse remains {{for the most part}} a subterranean haunt of rats, mice and cockroaches, and the <b>ordinary</b> <b>baker's</b> bread is so insipid and unnutritious that a great number of more prosperous people now-a-days find it advantageous to health and pocket alike to bake at home. A considerable amount of physical degeneration may be connected with the general poorness of our bread. The plain fact of the case is that our population will never get good wholesome bread from the Private Owner's bakehouse, until it employs one skilled official to watch every half-dozen bakers--and another to watch him; and it seems altogether saner and cheaper to abolish the Private Owner in this business also and do the job cleanly, honestly and straightforwardly in proper buildings with properly paid labour as a public concern.|$|R
500|$|After Parliament was dismissed, Elizabeth and Cecil {{drafted the}} Royal Injunctions. These were {{additions}} to the settlement, and largely stressed continuity with the Catholic past – clergy were ordered to wear the surplice {{and the use of}} the cope was allowed in cathedrals and collegiate chapels. The Ornaments Rubric states that the ornaments of the church and ministers thereof shall remain as they were in the second year of the reign of Edward VI, i.e. in 1548, when Mass was still celebrated (the Oxford Movement in the 19th century interpreted this as permission to wear chasubles, dalmatics and other vestments). Wafers, as opposed to <b>ordinary</b> <b>baker's</b> bread, were to be used as the bread at Communion. There had been opposition to the settlement in rural England, which for the most part was largely Roman Catholic, so the changes aimed for acceptance of the settlement. What succeeded more than anything else was the sheer length of Elizabeth's reign; while Mary had been able to impose her programme for a mere five years, Elizabeth had more than forty. Those who delayed, [...] "looking for a new day" [...] when restoration would again be commanded, were defeated by the passing of years.|$|R
40|$|In the {{bioconversion}} of lignocellulosic {{materials to}} ethanol, pretreatment {{of the material}} prior to enzymatic hydrolysis {{is essential to obtain}} high overall yields of sugar and ethanol. In this study, steam pretreatment of fast-growing Salix impregnated with sulfuric acid has been investigated by varying the temperature (180 - 210 degrees C), the residence time (4, 8 or 12 min), and the acid concentration (0. 25 % or 0. 5 % (w/w) H 2 SO 4). High sugar recoveries were obtained after pretreatment, and the highest yields of glucose and xylose after the subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis step were 92 % and 86 % of the theoretical, respectively, based on the glucan and xylan contents of the raw material. The most favorable pretreatment conditions regarding the overall sugar yield were 200 degrees C for either 4 or 8 min using 0. 5 % sulfuric acid, both resulting in a total of 55. 6 g glucose and xylose per 100 g dry raw material. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation experiments were performed on the pretreated slurries at an initial water-insoluble content of 5 %, using <b>ordinary</b> <b>baker's</b> yeast. An overall theoretical ethanol yield of 79 %, based on the glucan and mannan content in the raw material, was obtained. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{we figured}} out a {{proposition}} {{which seems to be}} as honorable as a gold mine prospectus and as profitable as a church raffle. And inside of thirty days you find us swarming into Kansas with a pair of fluent horses and a red camping wagon on the European plan. John Tom is Chief Wish-Heap-Dough, the famous Indian medicine man and Samaritan Sachem of the Seven Tribes. Mr. Peters is business manager and half owner. We needed a third man, so we looked around and found J. Conyngham Binkly leaning against the want column of a newspaper. This Binkly has a disease for Shakespearian rôles, and an hallucination about a 200 nights' run on the New York stage. But he confesses that he never could earn the butter to spread on his William S. rôles, so he is willing to drop to the <b>ordinary</b> <b>baker's</b> kind, and be satisfied with a 200-mile run behind the medicine ponies. Besides Richard III, he could do twenty-seven coon songs and banjo specialties, and was willing to cook, and curry the horses. We carried a fine line of excuses for taking money. One was a magic soap for removing grease spots and quarters from clothes. One was a Sum-wah-tah, the great Indian Remedy made from a prairie herb revealed by the Great Spirit in a dream to his favorite medicine men, the great chiefs McGarrity and Siberstein, bottlers, Chicago. And the other was a frivolous system of pick-pocketing the Kansasters that had the department stores reduced to a decimal fraction. Look ye! A pair of silk garters, a dream book, one dozen clothespins, a gold tooth, and 'When Knighthood Was in Flower' all wrapped up in a genuine Japanese silkarina handkerchief and handed to the handsome lady by Mr. Peters for the trivial sum of fifty cents, while Professor Binkly entertains us in a three-minute round with the banjo.|$|R

40|$|The maximum {{concentration}} of water-insoluble solids (WIS) in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) is restricted due to inhibition of the enzymes and the yeast, {{as well as}} mass transport problems caused by the viscosity of the pretreated material. However, the higher the {{concentration of}} WIS during SSF the less energy is needed in the subsequent distillation and evaporation steps. In this study, SSF was performed on barley straw sprayed with H 2 SO 4 and steam pretreated at conditions yielding a highly digestible material, aiming to increase the WIS concentration and decrease the enzyme loading and the yeast concentration in SSF, {{in order to reduce}} the production cost. Three concentrations of WIS (5, 7. 5 and 10 %), and three enzyme loadings (5, 10 and 20 FPU/g cellulose) of Celluclast 1. 5 L complemented with Novozym 188 were investigated in terms of ethanol yield. <b>Ordinary</b> cultivated <b>Baker's</b> yeast and Baker's yeast cultivated on barley straw hydrolyzate were also evaluated in terms of ethanol yield. The highest ethanol yield, 82 % of the theoretical based on the glucose content in barley straw, was obtained after SSF with 5 % WIS at an enzyme loading of 20 FPU/g cellulose together with 5 g/L ordinary cultivated yeast. Increased WIS concentration and decreased enzyme loading decreased the ethanol yield. However, by cultivating the yeast in hydrolyzate from pretreated barley straw the WIS concentration in SSF could be increased from 5 % to 7. 5 % and the yeast concentration could be reduced from 5 to 2 g/L, while still attaining a yield of approximately 80 %.

2500|$|In 1969, Schwarzenegger met Barbara Outland (later Barbara Outland Baker), an English teacher {{he lived}} with until 1974. Schwarzenegger talked about Barbara in his memoir in 1977: [...] "Basically {{it came down to}} this: she was a {{well-balanced}} woman who wanted an ordinary, solid life, and I was not a well-balanced man, and hated the very idea of <b>ordinary</b> life." [...] <b>Baker</b> has described Schwarzenegger as [...] " [...] joyful personality, totally charismatic, adventurous, and athletic" [...] but claims {{towards the end of the}} relationship he became [...] "insufferable– classically conceited– the world revolved around him". Baker published her memoir in 2006, entitled Arnold and Me: In the Shadow of the Austrian Oak. Although Baker, at times, painted an unflattering portrait of her former lover, Schwarzenegger actually contributed to the tell-all book with a foreword, and also met with Baker for three hours. Baker claims, for example, that she only learned of his being unfaithful after they split, and talks of a turbulent and passionate love life. Schwarzenegger has made it clear that their respective recollection of events can differ. The couple first met six to eight months after his arrival in the U.S – their first date was watching the first Apollo Moon landing on television. They shared an apartment in Santa Monica for three and a half years, and having little money, would visit the beach all day, or have barbecues in the back yard. Although Baker claims that when she first met him, he had [...] "little understanding of polite society" [...] and she found him a turn-off, she says, [...] "He's as much a self-made man as it's possible to be – he never got encouragement from his parents, his family, his brother. He just had this huge determination to prove himself, and that was very attractive … I'll go to my grave knowing Arnold loved me." ...|$|R
