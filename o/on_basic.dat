40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} are to know effect toward student’s a achivement motivation, emotional quotient <b>on</b> <b>basics</b> accounting between the application of quantum learning model with ekspositori learning model. This research is an experimental research on the students of the Program Studi Ekonomi FKIP UNS. The techinique of sampling was random sampling. The sample of the research consist of 81 students that populaton to representative. The instrument use for collecting the data consisten the test of achievement test, the questionaire of achievement motivation and emotional quotient. To test {{the validity of the}} objective form, the Product moment correlation from Pearson is employed, and to test the reliability, the KR- 20 was used. To evaluate the validity of questionnaire, the Alpha Cronbach formula is employed. To analyze data, researcher apllied the analysis of variance (ANOVA) multiway at significance level 0, 05. The data analysis result that : (1) there is the difference of effect between the application of quantum learning and ekspositori learning models toward student’s achievement <b>on</b> <b>basics</b> accounting (F count 4, 277 > F (0. 05) 3, 97) (2) there is difference of effect toward student’s achievement <b>on</b> <b>basics</b> accounting between students who have high achivement motivation with those students who have low achivement motivation (Fcount 8. 753 > F (0. 05) 3, 97) ((3) there is difference of effect toward student’s achievement <b>on</b> <b>basics</b> accounting between students who have high emotional quotient with those students who have low emotional quotient.

(Fcount 6, 418 > F (0. 05) 3, 97).

5|$|After the {{invasion}} was over, the brigade {{was supposed to}} support the operation with bridging and infrastructure support. During the planning for {{the invasion}}, the engineers of the brigade were told that reconstruction in Iraq would be conducted by Department of Defense contractors and Iraqi civilians. They were not originally prepared to conduct major reconstruction efforts. When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq, much of the invasion force, including the 130th Engineer Brigade, was sent to do jobs {{they had not been}} originally planned for, as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below what was expected. Throughout the rest of 2003 and 2004, the engineers engaged in a large number of initial reconstruction projects <b>on</b> <b>basic</b> utilities, including schools, water treatment plants, waste removal, and the nation's power grid. It was determined that the scale of these projects was much greater than what the US had expected or what had been encountered in previous contingencies. It was also decided that reconstruction was essential to the coalition since it would help win over the Iraqi people. By May 2003, the brigade had been completely repurposed. Though originally tasked with demolishing obstacles, building fortifications, and bridging operations, the brigade was tasked entirely with construction projects. This conversion was a difficult process, as the brigade did not have the equipment and specialist units designed to handle reconstruction on a national scale. As more US military reconstruction units arrived in Iraq, the brigade grew to eight battalions and three groups.|$|E
