500|$|Conversely, {{the episode}} was not {{initially}} well received by many {{fans of the}} show's earlier seasons, {{as it was a}} particularly absurd early example of the show taking a more joke-based cartoon approach to comedy, rather than the more realistic situational style of comedy it had employed in its first few years. In 1995, during the production of the seventh season, Yeardley Smith said of the episode as [...] "truly one of <b>our</b> <b>worst</b> – we [...] all agree".|$|E
500|$|Philosopher Stephen Mulhall has {{remarked that}} the four Alien films {{represent}} an artistic rendering of the difficulties faced by the woman's [...] "voice" [...] to have itself heard in a masculinist society because Ripley continually encounters males who try to silence her and to force her to submit to their desires. Mulhall sees this depicted in several events in Aliens, particularly the inquest scene in which Ripley's explanation for the deaths and destruction of the Nostromo {{as well as her}} attempts to warn the board members of the Alien danger are met with officious disdain. However, Mulhall believes that Ripley's relationship with Hicks illustrates that Aliens [...] "is devoted... to the possibility of modes of masculinity that seek not to stifle but rather to accommodate the female voice, and modes of femininity that can acknowledge and incorporate something more or other of masculinity than <b>our</b> <b>worst</b> nightmares of it." ...|$|E

500|$|Later {{historian}}s, however, took Gibbon's emphases even further. As Marxist historian G.E.M. de Ste. Croix {{put it in}} 1954, [...] "The so-called Great Persecution {{has been}} exaggerated in the Christian tradition to an extent which even Gibbon did not fully appreciate." [...] In 1972, the ecclesiastical Protestant historian Hermann Dörries was embarrassed to admit to his colleagues that his sympathies lay with the Christians rather than their persecutors. W.H.C. Frend guesses that 3,0003,500 Christians {{were killed in the}} persecution. Although the number of verifiably true martyrs' tales has fallen, and estimates of the total casualty rate have been reduced, some modern writers are less skeptical than Gibbon of the severity of the persecution. As the author Stephen Williams [...] wrote in 1985, [...] "even allowing a margin for invention, what remains is terrible enough. Unlike Gibbon, we live in an age which has experienced similar things, and knows how unsound is that civilised smile of incredulity at such reports. Things can be, have been, every bit as bad as <b>our</b> <b>worst</b> imaginings." ...|$|E
500|$|Since his {{appearance}} in Wario Land: Super Mario Land 3, Wario {{has become a}} well-established mascot for Nintendo, and he has received a largely positive reception. Nintendo Power described Wario as a [...] "pretty uncool dude" [...] which they [...] "cannot help but like." [...] They also listed his mustache {{as one of the}} best in Nintendo games. Computer and Video Games found the levity of Wario's games [...] "liberating" [...] compared to big Nintendo franchises such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda. They also mention that, regarding the character, they [...] "empathise more with the hopelessly materialistic Wario than goody brown-shoes Mario. Deep down, we'd all rather chase pounds over princesses." [...] IGN editor Travis Fahs comments that while Wario is not the most likeable character, his strong confidence overshadows his flaws and makes him entertaining. The website later ranked Wario 31st in a list of the [...] "Top 100 Videogame Villains". In the book A Parent's Guide to Nintendo Games: A Comprehensive Look at the Systems and the Games, Craig Wessel described Wario as a [...] "sinister twist" [...] on Mario. In Icons of Horror and the Supernatural: An Encyclopedia of <b>Our</b> <b>Worst</b> Nightmares, Volume 1, S. T.

2500|$|Ten Years {{received}} generally positive reviews locally. Some viewers reportedly {{left the}} cinema in tears. Time Out Hong Kong called the film [...] "powerful, poignant, relevant and brave", {{as well as}} [...] "nightmarish". The Hong Kong Economic Journal called it [...] "well-constructed", and wrote: [...] "Viewers will realize that {{although some of the}} scenes may seem unfamiliar and others way too radical, the stories are always anchored on developments in the past and the present. There’s always something in the movie that viewers can identify with, something believable and within the realm of the possible." [...] Writing in the South China Morning Post, Edmund Lee called the film [...] "a reminder of the power of independent, intelligent filmmaking as a vehicle for social and political critique" [...] and [...] "one of the most thought-provoking local films in years". Alice Wu said: [...] "Provocation is an art form. Perhaps the true value of Ten Years lies in how uncomfortable it is to us all... As a portrayal of <b>our</b> <b>worst</b> fears, it is arguably the quintessential political horror film of our time. It perfectly plays (or should it be 'preys'?) on many Hongkongers’ primal fears..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{critical}} {{response was}} fairly muted. Several reviewers expressed disappointment, comparing the film unfavorably to {{the much more}} bombastic Suspiria. Scott Meek in Time Out said that of the two movies, Inferno was [...] "a much more conventional and unexciting piece of work [...] the meandering narrative confusions are amplified by weak performances." [...] In a review that was later reprinted in McDonagh's critically acclaimed Broken Mirrors/Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento (1994), Variety said Inferno was a [...] "lavish, no-holds-barred witch story whose lack of both logic and technical skill are submerged in the sheer energy of the telling", then complained that the film [...] "fails mainly because it lacks restraint in setting up the terrifying moment, using close-ups and fancy camera angles gratuitously and with no relevance to the story." [...] Reviewing the film during its brief theatrical release in 1986, Nina Darnton of The New York Times noted, [...] "The movie's distinguishing feature is not the number or variety of horrible murders, but {{the length of time}} it takes for the victims to die. This is a technique that may have been borrowed from Italian opera, but without the music, it loses some of its panache. The film [...] is shot in vivid colors, at some striking angles, and the background music is Verdi rather than heavy metal. But the script and acting are largely routine." [...] However, Cinefantastique described the film as [...] "the stuff of all <b>our</b> <b>worst</b> dreams and nightmares and a tour de force from Italian director Dario Argento Inferno brings his personal redefinition of the genre close to perfection." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harvard University {{international}} relations professor Stephen Walt wrote an [...] to his congressman outlining reasons he {{urged him to}} vote against intervention in Syria. [...] Walt's first argument against intervention was that the United States lacks any vital strategic interests in Syria. [...] After acknowledging that Assad government is a [...] "brutal dictatorship," [...] {{he points out that}} this has not bothered previous presidents in the past. [...] Indeed, intervening in Syria could make matters worse and harm US interests by creating a failed state and [...] "igniting a struggle for power among competing sectarian factions," [...] some of which [...] "are deeply hostile to America and sympathetic to al Qaeda... U.S. intervention could help bring some of <b>our</b> <b>worst</b> enemies to power." [...] Walt's second reason is that moral case for intervening in Syria fails to be compelling. [...] Although Syrians are suffering, air strikes would not alter that, but could make things worse. [...] Walt argues that [...] "recent scholarly research on civil wars shows that outside intervention tends to increase civilian killings and doesn't shorten the length of wars." [...] He suggests focusing on helping refugees instead. [...] Third, Walt rebuts the argument {{that it is necessary to}} go to war over Assad's use of chemical weapons, particularly when other regimes that used chemical weapons in the past were not then punished by the United States. [...] Walt argues that [...] "chemical weapons have only been used a handful of times over the past 80 years, mostly because they are less effective than conventional arms in most battlefield situations." [...] Fourth, Walt argues that intervention is not necessary to maintain US credibility because [...] "if we refrain from using force when vital interests are not involved or when doing so would only make things worse, it says nothing about our willingness to use force when it is truly necessary and when it can achieve clear and well-defined objectives." [...] Finally, Walt argues that [...] "wise leaders do not go to war without robust international and domestic support," [...] which President Obama does not have.|$|E
