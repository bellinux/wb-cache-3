5|$|Bamber {{launched}} two legal actions {{while in}} prison {{to secure a}} share of the estate, which the cousins said was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing that he should have inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister—the grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed 17 years' rent from his cousins who lived there. In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him.|$|E
5|$|In May 1916 the Australian Government {{offered the}} British Army Council a sixth {{division}} of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the Australian Army's main expeditionary force during World War I. This offer was an element <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> establish an Australian and New Zealand Army, though the Australian Government acknowledged that forming a sixth division could cause difficulties in providing sufficient reinforcements to replace the AIF's casualties from December 1916. In such an event, the government proposed breaking up the division to reinforce the five others. The Army Council declined this offer as it preferred Australia to raise only as many units as it could reinforce.|$|E

5|$|The {{fighting}} occurred {{following a}} failed landing by Australian forces at Porton Plantation in early June, which was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> outflank {{a series of}} strong points that the Japanese had built across {{the base of the}} Bonis Peninsula. After this, the fighting in the northern sector around Ratsua essentially became a containment action for the Australians as they concentrated their efforts and resources upon driving south towards Buin, which was the main centre of Japanese resistance on the island at the time. As a result, the situation around Ratsua remained largely static until the end of hostilities in mid-August 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included {{a number of significant}} figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> facilitate a Celtic Revival, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom. Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854–1932), the architect and designer Robert Lorimer (1864–1929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875–1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s.|$|E

When Nicolls arrived at Prospect Bluff, Florida in August, the Spanish Governor of Pensacola, Don Mateo González Manrique, aware of the threat the Americans posed to Florida, requested the redeployment of British forces to Pensacola.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a revolt}} in 1028, Harald's brother Olaf {{was forced into}} exile until he {{returned}} to Norway in early 1030. On hearing news of Olaf's planned return, Harald gathered 600 men from the Uplands to meet Olaf and his men upon their arrival in the east of Norway. After a friendly welcome, Olaf went on to gather an army and eventually fight in the Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030, in which Harald took part on his brother's side. The battle was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> restore Olaf to the Norwegian throne, which had been captured by the Danish king Cnut the Great. The battle resulted in defeat for the brothers {{at the hands of}} those Norwegians who were loyal to Cnut, and Olaf was killed while Harald was badly wounded. Harald was nonetheless remarked to have shown considerable military talent during the battle.|$|E

5|$|Fremantle Prison's New Division was {{constructed}} between 1904 and 1907, {{as a response}} to overcrowding. The division continues the façade alignment of the main block. The building, L shaped in plan, is three storeys high of regular coursed pale ashlar limestone blocks with rock-face. Openings are set in brick and freestone and it has a handsome lantern range above the main atrium. The building is visually significant as it complements the main cell block and completes the northern zone of the prison. The interior configuration and cells are significant as an example <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> introduce the separate system to Western Australia, whereby prisoners were completely isolated for {{the first three months of}} their sentence. The division's exercise yard initially used a panopticon to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading its removal within five years.|$|E
5|$|In 1737, Murray {{acted as}} Counsel for the City of Edinburgh in the {{aftermath}} of the death of Captain John Porteous. In Edinburgh, it was traditional for criminals sentenced to death to be allowed to visit a church near the city jail the Sunday before the execution. Two criminals named Wilson and Robertson took this as an opportunity to escape, and although Wilson did not make it out of the church, Robertson escaped completely. Wilson had been a smuggler who supplied his fellow citizens with goods, and because of this and the unpopularity of the city guard, public opinion was firmly on his side. Porteous was the captain of the Edinburgh city guard, and angry with Wilson's attempt to escape and aware of the possibility <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> free him. Porteous ordered a guard of 80 men to be placed around the gallows for Wilson's execution. When a man attempted to cut Wilson's body down after the execution, Porteous ordered his troops to fire on the crowd, and seven people were killed. Porteous was initially sentenced to death for murder, and when the execution was delayed, a mob of citizens rushed the city jail and lynched him.|$|E
5|$|In February, the 390th Rifle Division {{became an}} Armenian {{national}} division as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> overcome the language barrier, {{as the majority}} of its troops still could not speak Russian fluently. As a result of mass desertions of the Caucasian troops during the previous fighting, the Armenian officer Colonel Simon Zakian replaced Vinogradov as commander of the division on 24 February. The 51st Army launched an attack on 16 March, with the 390th and 398th Rifle Divisions in reserve. On the night of 17–18 March, the 390th and 398th were moved up to their jumping-off positions in the area of Korpech village. The attacks of the two divisions began at 10:00 on 18 March, and the 390th, advancing in conjunction with the 55th Tank Brigade, overcame German resistance and captured two trench lines of the German main defensive line. By the end of the day, they had dug in on the new positions. On the morning of 19 March, Zakian committed his reserve, the 784th Rifle Regiment, into the battle. However, the rest of the attacks were unsuccessful. After army commander Vladimir Lvov received reports of a German buildup, the offensive was halted.|$|E

5|$|In early August, {{in order}} to create a {{diversion}} to draw Ottoman reserves away from a major attack at Hill 971, which had been conceived as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> break the stalemate that had developed around the beachhead, the 1st Brigade conducted an attack at Lone Pine. The 2nd Battalion was chosen to take part in the initial assault. After gaining possession of the main enemy line, the Australians were subjected to a series of determined counter-attacks which would last the next three days, which, although successfully repulsed, proved very costly for the Australians. The 2nd Battalion suffered considerably. Having started the action with 22 officers and 560 other ranks, they lost 21 officers and 409 other ranks killed or wounded. Among those killed was its commanding officer, Scobie, who was shot dead while attempting to repulse a counter-attack on 7 August. In Scobie's place, the battalion second-in-command, Major Arthur Stevens, who had been a second lieutenant less than 12 months before, took over as temporary commander.|$|E
5|$|In early January 1943, Lieutenant Colonel Derek Mills-Roberts {{arrived from}} the United Kingdom {{to take over the}} unit, and he was in command when on 26 February 1943 they were {{involved}} in bitter fighting against two battalions of German parachute infantry with armoured support which attacked their position as part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> encircle the 1st Army by cutting the Medjez road. In a fight that lasted over five hours, against an enemy that outnumbered them and had the advantage of heavy armoured support, the commandos, along with elements from the Reconnaissance Regiment, were able to stop the advance long enough for reinforcements to be brought up. In this action, No. 6 Commando incurred 11 killed, 34 wounded and 55 missing in action. This represented over 40 per cent of the unit's strength at the time, although later a number of those that were captured were recovered after the Germans withdrew.|$|E
5|$|In the arts, Romanticism {{manifested}} itself in literature and drama in {{the adoption of the}} mythical bard Ossian, the exploration of national poetry in the work of Robert Burns and in the historical novels of Walter Scott. Scott also had a major impact on the development of a national Scottish drama. Art was heavily influenced by Ossian and a new view of the Highlands as the location of a wild and dramatic landscape. Scott profoundly affected architecture through his re-building of Abbotsford House in the early nineteenth century, which set off the boom in the Scots Baronial revival. In music, Burns was part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>attempt</b> <b>to</b> produce a canon of Scottish song, which resulted in a cross fertilisation of Scottish and continental classical music, with romantic music becoming dominant in Scotland into the twentieth century.|$|E
