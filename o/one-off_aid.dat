In 1985 Black Sabbath re-united with original vocalist Ozzy Osbourne for the <b>one-off</b> Live <b>Aid</b> performance. While waiting for a break in Osbournes' career, Iommi decided to record a solo album and Hughes {{was brought in to}} provide the vocals. Due to the aforementioned contractual obligations with the record company the album was released as Black Sabbath featuring Tony Iommi in 1986, to generally positive critical reviews, with Hughes in particular putting in a fine performance. While touring to promote the new album Glenn was replaced by vocalist Ray Gillen after six shows due to a fight with Black Sabbath's production manager, as the injuries contributed to a degradation in his voice and he was also in no physical shape to complete the tour.|$|R
