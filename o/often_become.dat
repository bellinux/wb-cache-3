5|$|Horses {{finished}} with a racing career that are not suitable for breeding purposes <b>often</b> <b>become</b> riding horses or other equine companions. A number of agencies exist {{to help make the}} transition from the racetrack to another career, or to help find retirement homes for ex-racehorses.|$|E
5|$|Fishing gear is {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They <b>often</b> <b>become</b> {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|E
5|$|Flame robins <b>often</b> <b>become</b> more {{abundant}} in areas recently burnt by bushfires, but move away once the undergrowth regrows. They may also move into logged or cleared areas in forests. However, a field {{study in the}} Boola Boola State Forest in central Gippsland revealed they are not found {{in areas where the}} regrowth after logging is dense.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Margaret MacVicar {{founded the}} Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable {{undergraduates}} to collaborate directly with {{faculty members and}} researchers. Students join or initiate research projects ("UROPs") for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly. A substantial majority of undergraduates participate. Students <b>often</b> <b>become</b> published, file patent applications, and/or launch start-up companies based upon their experience in UROPs.|$|E
5|$|On {{the advice}} of family friend and local Schutzstaffel (SS; {{protection}} squadron) leader Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Eichmann joined the Austrian branch of the NSDAP on 1 April 1932, member number 889,895. His membership in the SS was confirmed seven months later (SS member number 45,326). His regiment was SS-Standarte 37, responsible for guarding the party headquarters in Linz and protecting party speakers at rallies, which would <b>often</b> <b>become</b> violent. Eichmann pursued party activities in Linz on weekends while continuing in his position at Vacuum Oil in Salzburg.|$|E
5|$|At night, {{the shallow}} reef {{platforms}} inhabited by the epaulette shark <b>often</b> <b>become</b> {{isolated from the}} ocean by the receding tide. The amount of dissolved oxygen in the pool can drop 80% or more overnight from the combined respiration of all the organisms within the pool. The epaulette shark has evolved to cope with these hypoxic conditions, being able to survive for over three hours in 5% of the atmospheric O2 level without losing behavioral responsiveness. In the laboratory, epaulette sharks have survived for an hour without any oxygen at 30°C (86°F), which is also unusual in that most animals capable of tolerating oxygen deprivation do so at low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Paint is {{the least}} {{effective}} measure, but forms a basis for other techniques. Military vehicles <b>often</b> <b>become</b> so dirty that pattern-painted camouflage is not visible, and although matt colours reduce shine, a wet vehicle can still be shiny, especially when viewed from above. Patterns are designed {{to make it more}} difficult to interpret shadows and shapes. The British Army adopted a disruptive scheme for vehicles operating in the stony desert of the North African Campaign and Greece, retrospectively known as the Caunter scheme. It used up to six colours applied with straight lines.|$|E
5|$|Performers {{are first}} trained in acrobatics, {{followed}} by singing and gestures. Several performing schools, {{all based on}} the styles of famous performers, are taught. Some examples are the Mei Lanfang school, the Cheng Yanqiu school, the Ma Lianliang school, and the Qi Lintong school. Students previously trained exclusively {{in the art of}} performance, but modern performance schools now include academic studies as well. Teachers assess the qualifications of each student and assign them roles as primary, secondary, or tertiary characters accordingly. Students with little acting talent <b>often</b> <b>become</b> Peking-opera musicians. They may also serve as the supporting cast of foot soldiers, attendants, and servants that is present in every Peking-opera troupe. In Taiwan, the Ministry of National Defense of the Republic of China runs a national Peking-opera training school.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put their children at increased risk of becoming double orphans, or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS <b>often</b> <b>become</b> responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E

5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving its mother and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs <b>often</b> <b>become</b> capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.|$|E
5|$|Because rodents are a {{nuisance}} and endanger public health, human societies often {{attempt to control}} them. Traditionally, this involved poisoning and trapping, methods that were not always safe or effective. More recently, integrated pest management attempts to improve control {{with a combination of}} surveys to determine the size and distribution of the pest population, the establishment of tolerance limits (levels of pest activity at which to intervene), interventions, and evaluation of effectiveness based on repeated surveys. Interventions may include education, making and applying laws and regulations, modifying the habitat, changing farming practices, and biological control using pathogens or predators, as well as poisoning and trapping. The use of pathogens such as Salmonella has the drawback that they can infect man and domestic animals, and rodents <b>often</b> <b>become</b> resistant. The use of predators including ferrets, mongooses and monitor lizards has been found unsatisfactory. Domestic and feral cats are able to control rodents effectively, provided the rodent population is not too large. In the UK, two species in particular, the house mouse and the brown rat, are actively controlled to limit damage in growing crops, loss and contamination of stored crops and structural damage to facilities, as well as to comply with the law.|$|E
5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects <b>often</b> <b>become</b> entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's ground anchor line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E
