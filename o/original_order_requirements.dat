50|$|<b>Original</b> <b>order</b> is {{a concept}} in archival theory {{that a group of}} records should be {{maintained}} in the same order as they were placed by the record's creator. Along with provenance, <b>original</b> <b>order</b> is a core tenet of the archival concept of respect des fonds. By keeping records in their <b>original</b> <b>order,</b> additional contextual information about the record's creator and the environment of their creation is preserved.|$|R
50|$|Each {{procedure}} {{or function}} can {{have its own}} declarations of goto labels, constants, types, variables, and other procedures and functions, which must all be in that order.This <b>ordering</b> <b>requirement</b> was originally intended to allow efficient single-pass compilation.

50|$|Not infrequently, {{practical}} {{considerations of}} storage {{mean that it}} is impossible to maintain the <b>original</b> <b>order</b> of records physically.

50|$|Although <b>original</b> <b>order</b> is a {{generally}} accepted principle, {{there has been}} some debate surrounding this theory in regards to personal archives. It has been argued that <b>original</b> <b>order</b> is not always ideal for personal archives as they are far more complex than organizational archives. However, others prefer to remain loyal to the principle of <b>original</b> <b>order</b> and maintain that personal records are created and maintained for much the same reason as organizational archives and should therefore follow the same principles.|$|R

5000|$|The Society of American Archivists Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology calls <b>original</b> <b>order</b> a [...] "fundamental {{principle}} of archives" [...] and posits two primary purposes: preserving [...] "relationships and evidential significance" [...] of records and facilitating {{use of the}} records by maintaining [...] "the record creator's mechanisms to access.".
