5000|$|When {{the town}} was created, {{one of the first}} {{priorities}} was a church. There was a chapel already available but it would only hold 80 people and it belonged to the military.

The city council answering to popular demand set up a committee to decide where a new church should be constructed. Progress was slow and by 1879 pragmatic decisions needed to be made to create a working place of worship. December of that year saw the church in use as long as it did not rain. The roof was not waterproof and the priest was left to gather funds to complete the roof and <b>other</b> <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|E
