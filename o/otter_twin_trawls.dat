40|$|A {{framework}} {{to assess the}} impact of mobile fishing gear on the seabed and benthic ecosystem is presented. The framework that can be used at regional and local scales provides indicators for both trawling pressure and ecological impact. It builds on high-resolution maps of trawling intensity and considers the physical effects of trawl gears on the seabed, on marine taxa, and on the functioning of the benthic ecosystem. Within the framework, a reductionist approach is applied that breaks down a fishing gear into its components, and a number of biological traits are chosen to determine either the vulnerability of the benthos to the impact of that gear component, or to provide a proxy for their ecological role. The approach considers gear elements, such as <b>otter</b> boards, <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> clump, and groundrope, and sweeps that herd the fish. The physical impact of these elements on the seabed, comprising scraping of the seabed, sediment mobilization, and penetration, is a function of the mass, size, and speed of the individual component. The impact of the elements on the benthic community is quantified using a biological-trait approach that considers the vulnerability of the benthic community to trawl impact (e. g. sediment position, morphology), the recovery rate (e. g. longevity, maturation age, reproductive characteristics, dispersal), and their ecological role. The framework is explored to compare the indicators for pressure and ecological impact of bottom trawling in three main seabed habitat types in the North Sea. Preliminary results show that the Sublittoral mud (EUNIS A 5. 3) is affected the most due to the combined effect of intensive fishing and large proportions of long-lived tax...|$|R
40|$|The Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research {{has been}} {{commissioned}} by the Dutch Fisheries Product Board {{to carry out a}} study on the effects of <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery on the sustainable exploitation of demersal fish stocks. The <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery appears to grow quickly, but there are many uncertainties about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this fishery on fish stocks. Advantages due to the light type of gear are the low use of fuel, the high quality of landings and the relatively low disturbance of the seabed. Negative effects mentioned are the large surface that is fished, which would result in high catches and large numbers of discards. Moreover, under certain conditions, twin trawlers are allowed to use smaller mesh sizes than beam trawlers, which may result in more discards of undersized fish. This study aims at making an objective and quantitative description of the <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery in the Netherlands and consists of three parts: 1) a description of technical and fishery biological aspects; 2) a study on discards (part of the catch returned to the sea) and; 3) an integrated description of the <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery and a comparison with the beam trawl fishery. The present report describes the second part: discarding in the <b>twin</b> <b>trawl</b> fishery.

2500|$|Larger {{airlines}} in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Australia also flew <b>Twin</b> <b>Otters.</b> Alaska Airlines, the original Frontier Airlines (1950-1986) and Wien Air Alaska, {{as well as}} Canada's First Air, were air carriers that flew Boeing 727 jetliners and earlier versions of the Boeing 737 jetliner at the time. All four airlines also operated <b>Twin</b> <b>Otter</b> aircraft. Ozark Air Lines was primarily a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 jetliner operator that flew <b>Twin</b> <b>Otters</b> as well. South Pacific Island Airways flew <b>Twin</b> <b>Otters</b> and Boeing 707 jets. [...] Wardair Canada, which flew Airbus A300, Airbus A310, Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 wide body jets, also operated the <b>Twin</b> <b>Otter</b> at one point. [...] In addition, Canadian air carriers Pacific Western Airlines and Transair, both of which operated Boeing 737-200s, flew <b>Twin</b> <b>Otter</b> aircraft. Other Canadian airlines that flew <b>Twin</b> <b>Otters</b> included Time Air and Norcanair, both of which also operated Fokker F28 Fellowship passenger jets. Aeromexico operated the <b>Twin</b> <b>Otter</b> as well [...] as did Ansett Australia and Trans Australia Airlines (TAA). [...] <b>Twin</b> <b>Otter</b> aircraft were also operated by commuter or regional airlines on behalf of major air carrier partners and were painted in the liveries of such airlines as Continental Airlines, Eastern Air Lines and British Airways, with these aircraft providing connecting feeder service for these respective major {{airlines in}} the past.

25|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>Otters</b> {{could be}} {{delivered}} {{directly from the}} factory with floats, skis, or tricycle landing gear fittings, making them adaptable bush planes for remote and northern areas.

Many <b>Twin</b> <b>Otters</b> still serve in the far north, {{but they can also}} be found in Africa, Australia, Asia, Antarctica, and other regions where bush planes are the optimum means of travel. Their versatility and maneuverability have made them popular in areas with difficult flying environments such as Papua New Guinea.
