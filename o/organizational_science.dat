40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this chapter {{is to examine the}} {{frequency}} of multi-study research packages in the <b>organizational</b> <b>sciences</b> and advocate for their use by detailing strengths and recognizing limitations. Methodology/approach: Philosophy of science research, focusing on multi-study research packages, is discussed followed by a 20 -year review of incidence of these packages in top <b>organizational</b> <b>sciences</b> journals. Findings: The publication of multi-study research packages have increased over the past 10 years, most notably in micro-level journals. Social implications: For reasons of validity and generalizability, society benefits if scholars adopt multi-study approaches to knowledge generation and disseminate. Originality/value of the chapter: This chapter provides the most comprehensive review of multiple-study research packages in the <b>organizational</b> <b>sciences</b> to date, examining publication trends in eight leading micro-and macro-level journals. We also summarize the use of multi-study packages in our own research and offer recommendations for improving the science of replication...|$|R
50|$|As {{a nascent}} field of inquiry, the terminology, methodologies, and {{outcomes}} of SciTS {{are still being}} debated and defined, and new hypotheses regarding the most effective strategies for implementing and sustaining team science are beginning to be tested and the results published. While the SciTS literature base is currently limited, the field is founded on a substantial body of knowledge of team research conducted by scholars in diverse fields such as <b>organizational</b> <b>science,</b> community health promotion, and social psychology, {{as well as from}} groups outside academia, including business and the military. SciTS research findings are starting to be translated into evidence-based tools and support structures that aim to improve the efficiency and success of team science initiatives.|$|E

5000|$|In 2006, {{as part of}} his [...] "f-laws" [...] Russell Ackoff made a {{distinction}} between errors of commission and omission, or, in <b>organizational</b> <b>science</b> jargon, mistakes of commission and omission. A mistake of commission is something that the organization should not have done; a mistake of omission is something that the organization should have done. Ackoff suggested that mistakes of omission are much more serious, because they cannot be corrected or retrieved. Ackoff proposed that accounting systems in the western world only take account of errors of commission. Finally Ackoff proposed that a manager only has to be concerned about doing something that should not have been done in organizations that look down on mistakes and in which only errors of commission are identified. The Ackoff reference is important because it demonstrates applicability of the error typology in social sciences, as opposed to statistics, etc.|$|E

50|$|Temporary {{workers are}} at {{a high risk of}} being injured or killed on the job. In 2015, 829 fatal {{injuries}} (17% of all occupational fatalities) occurred among contract workers. Studies have also shown a higher burden of non-fatal occupational injuries and illnesses among temporary workers compared to those in standard employment arrangements. There are many possible contributing factors to the high rates of injuries and illnesses among temporary workers. They are often inexperienced and assigned to hazardous jobs and tasks, may be reluctant to object to unsafe working conditions or to advocate for safety measures due to fear of job loss or other repercussions, and they may lack basic knowledge and skills to protect themselves from workplace hazards due to insufficient safety training. According to a joint guidance document released by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), both staffing agencies and host employers (i.e., the clients of staffing agencies) are responsible for providing and maintaining a safe and healthy work environment for temporary workers. Collaborative and interdisciplinary (e.g., epidemiology, occupational psychology, <b>organizational</b> <b>science,</b> economics, law, management, sociology, labor health and safety) research and intervention efforts are needed to protect and promote {{the occupational safety and health}} of temporary workers.|$|E

40|$|The <b>organizational</b> <b>science</b> {{literature}} on motivation has for long been polarized into two main positions; the organizational economic position focusing on extrinsic motivation and the organizational behavior position emphasizing intrinsic motivation. With {{the rise of}} the knowledge economy and the increasing levels of complexities it entails, such polarization is not fruitful in the attempt to explain motivation of organizational members. This paper claims that a more nuanced perspective on motivation, acknowledging the co-existence of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, the possible interaction between the two as well as different types of motivations filling in the gap between the two polar types, is urgently needed in the <b>organizational</b> <b>science</b> literature. By drawing on the research on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation conducted in social psychology and combining this with contributions from <b>organizational</b> <b>science,</b> economics, and sociology, this paper attempts to develop an emergent understanding of motivation, which is more facetted than the one dominating <b>organizational</b> <b>science</b> currently. Based on these discussions, eleven implications for future research on motivation in organizations are proposed.
