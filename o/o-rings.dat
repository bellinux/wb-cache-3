5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's <b>O-rings</b> became less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster was caused by the primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.|$|E
25|$|The Presidential Commission on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident—also {{known as}} the Rogers Commission—was formed to {{investigate}} the disaster. It determined that the accident was due to a failure of rubber <b>O-rings</b> made by Morton-Thiokol that provided a pressure seal in the aft field joint of the shuttle's right Solid Rocket Booster. The failure of the <b>O-rings</b> was attributed to a design flaw, as their performance could be too easily compromised by factors that included the low temperature {{on the day of}} launch. The Commission found that O-ring resiliency is directly related to temperature and due to the low temperature at launch—36 degrees Fahrenheit or 15 degrees lower than the next coldest previous launch—it was probable the <b>O-rings</b> had not provided a proper seal.|$|E
25|$|Plugs – Earplugs {{are short}} {{cylindrical}} pieces of jewelry. Some plugs have flared ends {{to hold them}} in place, others require small elastic rubber rings (<b>O-rings)</b> {{to keep them from}} falling out. They are usually used in large-gauge piercings.|$|E

40|$|All {{pressure}} seals for the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) were designed using a minimum 10 percent <b>O-ring</b> squeeze criteria. The {{similarity between the}} current <b>O-ring</b> and its proposed replacement is analyzed. The intent of the analysis is to qualify the new <b>O-ring</b> to replace the current configuration <b>O-ring...</b>|$|R
50|$|Successful <b>O-ring</b> joint design {{requires}} a rigid mechanical mounting that applies a predictable deformation to the <b>O-ring.</b> This introduces a calculated mechanical stress at the <b>O-ring</b> contacting surfaces. As {{long as the}} pressure of the fluid being contained does not exceed the contact stress of the <b>O-ring,</b> leaking cannot occur. Fortunately, {{the pressure of the}} contained fluid transfers through the essentially incompressible <b>O-ring</b> material, and the contact stress rises with increasing pressure. For this reason, an <b>O-ring</b> can easily seal high pressure {{as long as it does}} not fail mechanically. The most common failure is extrusion through the mating parts.|$|R
25|$|A torus {{should not}} be {{confused}} with a solid torus, which is formed by rotating a disc, rather than a circle, around an axis. A solid torus is a torus plus the volume inside the torus. Real-world approximations include doughnuts, many lifebuoys, and <b>O-rings.</b>|$|E
25|$|A similar {{incident}} with an A320 occurred on an America West Airlines flight in February 1999 in Columbus, Ohio (Flight 2811). The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found {{the cause was}} {{a failure of the}} external <b>o-rings</b> in the nose landing gear steering module. That plane also landed safely.|$|E
25|$|Icing {{may prevent}} a warship from {{conducting}} {{any type of}} offensive operations, including restraining the doors of a vertical launch systems, binding gears, shafts, hinges and pedestals. Other effects include sluggish performance of lubricants, increased failure rate of seals, plugs and <b>O-rings,</b> frozen magazine sprinkler systems, excessively long warm-up times for electronics or weapon system electronics, and freeze up of compressed-air-operated components.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop capacitance models of an integral <b>o-ring</b> sensor system. Testing fixtures were machined to place an <b>o-ring</b> in a flange fixture application. Capacitance measurements were recorded while the <b>o-ring</b> was subjected to normal and excessive squeeze. Testing also included hydraulic pressure loading of the <b>o-ring</b> in the lateral direction. The research provided evidence that an <b>o-ring</b> in a flange setting application experienced capacitance responses in both squeeze and pressure testing. ...|$|R
25|$|The X-ring {{chain is}} {{developed}} from <b>O-ring</b> chain {{which in turn}} is developed from non <b>O-ring</b> chain. While the regular <b>O-ring</b> chain has high durability, it also has more friction(compared to other types of roller chain) due to distortion of the <b>O-ring</b> due to pressure from the inner and outer chain plates. This results in loss of power in the transmission. Therefore, X-ring chain was developed by replacing <b>O-ring</b> seal with X-ring seal which increased durability and greatly reduced friction.|$|R
50|$|If {{the second}} <b>O-ring</b> had failed, Boisjoly realized, {{the results would}} almost {{certainly}} have been catastrophic with {{the complete loss of}} the shuttle and crew seemingly the only outcome. His investigation found that the first <b>O-ring</b> failed because the low temperatures on the night before the flight had compromised the flexibility of the <b>O-ring,</b> reducing its ability to form a seal. The temperature at launch had been only 10 °C (50 °F), the coldest on record (until January 28, 1986). The first rubber <b>O-ring</b> had formed a partial seal, but not a complete one, but the second <b>O-ring</b> had held.|$|R
25|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{tank and}} CTN are bolted {{together at the}} main valve bulkhead, which is integrated into the tank. There are <b>O-rings</b> at the interface to prevent leakage; this is the main potential leak path in the engine. The ignition system, main control valve, and injector are mounted on the valve bulkhead, inside the tank. Slosh baffles are also mounted on this bulkhead. Because the oxidizer is stored under pressure, no pump is required.|$|E
25|$|A static {{discharge}} {{in the presence}} of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many elastomers are sensitive to ozone cracking. Exposure to ozone creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and <b>O-rings.</b> Fuel lines are also susceptible to the problem unless preventive action is taken. Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. Fires from cracked fuel lines have been a problem on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where ozone can be produced by electrical equipment.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of ozone, only a few materials may be used like stainless steel (quality 316L), titanium, aluminium (as long as no moisture is present), glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or polyvinylidene fluoride. Viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). Hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water {{come in contact with}} it, except for normal atmospheric levels. Embrittlement or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of elastomers with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like <b>O-rings.</b>|$|E

25|$|In March 2008, GM {{announced}} a recall on all 1997–2003 Grand Prix GTP models (as well as sister car Buick Regal GS) {{due to a}} problem that causes fires in the engine compartment. Over 230 fires were reported. This recall affected over 200,000 vehicles equipped with the supercharged 3800 Series II engine. GM {{sent a letter to}} the owners of these vehicles on March 13, 2008, instructing them not to park in garages or carports until the problem was resolved. The recall for the Supercharged engine involved changing the left (front) valve cover gasket, as oil leaks onto the exhaust manifold may cause engine fires. Some believed this recall did not fix the fire problem, and instead the problem is likely faulty fuel rail quick disconnect <b>o-rings.</b> There have been reports of fires happening after the recall has been performed.|$|E
25|$|The {{agent is}} emptied and {{depressurized}} and the valve is removed. After a thorough {{internal and external}} visual inspection, the cylinder is filled with water, placed inside a safety cage, and pressurized to the specified test pressure (varies with the type, age, and cylinder material) for the specified time period. If no failure, bulges, or leaks are detected, the cylinder passes. The cylinder is then emptied of water and thoroughly dried, and labeled with the test date and company that performed the test. CO2 types have the test information stamped on the cylinder, all other types get a sticker {{on the back of}} the cylinder. Once dry, the units are recharged. Unlike the UK, the US does not rebuild extinguishers and replace valves at specific intervals unless parts are found to be defective, with the exception of halon. Halon types are often given new <b>o-rings</b> and valve stems at every internal maintenance to minimize any leakage potential.|$|E
25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding antiozonants, such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and <b>O-rings,</b> may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|E
50|$|An <b>o-ring</b> boss seal is a {{technique}} for joining two fluid-carrying pipes, hoses, or tubing. In an <b>o-ring</b> boss (abbreviated ORB) system, a male-threaded part is inserted into a female-threaded part, providing a mechanical seal. This system differs from others in that an additional nut is tightened over an <b>o-ring</b> into a chamfered area, creating a fluid-tight seal.|$|R

30|$|Figures  8 and 9 show {{snapshots}} {{of the assembly}} task using the elastic band and the <b>o-ring,</b> respectively. It can be verified that the robot successfully inserted both the elastic band and the <b>o-ring.</b> Here it must be emphasized that although the human demonstration was made using only the elastic band (which is more flexible than the silicon-made <b>o-ring),</b> the same extracted key points were useful to insert both objects. However, as the <b>o-ring’s</b> stiffness is {{higher than that of}} the elastic band, {{it can be seen that}} the ending position/orientation of the robot slightly differs from that of the elastic band (Figs.  8 g, 9 g). Nonetheless the <b>o-ring</b> was inserted on the cylinder as can be observed in Fig.  9 h.|$|R

500|$|In 1986, {{following}} the Space Shuttle Challenger accident, Barbree placed {{a telephone call}} to a friend and retired employee of NASA, who—as a favor to Barbree—went to Kennedy Space Center, looked over the accident information and analysis being done, and later reported the early findings to Barbree. Consequently, Barbree was the first journalist {{to report on the}} source of the destruction of the Space Shuttle Challenger: Faulty <b>O-rings.</b> [...] He was also part of the NBC News Space Unit that won an Emmy award for NBC's coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing. Following the Space Shuttle Columbia accident, Barbree was the first reporter to break the news of an internal NASA memo expressing concerns about foam striking the orbiter's left wing during ascent.|$|E
500|$|In October 2006, Holden {{introduced}} a bi-fuel {{version of the}} Alloytec V6, available to the Omega and Berlina.

The bi-fuel V6 produces [...] and [...] less than the conventional V6 when run on LPG, {{for a total of}} [...] Although LPG prices are lower, the engine uses a large [...] cylindrical gas tank which causes decreased boot space and slightly increased fuel consumption. Holden was {{able to take advantage of}} a loophole in government legislation, allowing an A$2,000 rebate on LPG installation because the unit is fitted post-production by Holden's customisation arm HSVi. Normally, people would only be entitled to a A$1,000 rebate for new cars pre-installed with LPG. Due to the possibility that these bi-fuel Commodores may have been fitted with undersized <b>O-rings</b> in the service valve hand tap, Holden issued a recall affecting the first 981 of these models on 10 April 2007. There were also two VE recalls previous to this. The initial 16 October 2006 recall affecting 1,521 V8 Commodore and WM Statesman/Caprice models involved a faulty fuel hose, causing a fuel smell to enter the cabin. A second 10 November 2006 recall affecting 12,830 Commodores and WM models built prior to 11 September 2006 resulted from defective rear seat belt anchors. On 7 December 2007, another recall was issued for over 86,000 VE and WM V6 models. This was due to the possibility that one of the fuel lines in the engine compartment may have a rub condition with a fuel vapour hose clip, possibly causing a fuel smell to become evident.|$|E
5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the regulator surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output <b>O-ring</b> of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} regulator. The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the <b>O-ring</b> between the surfaces of the regulator and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the <b>O-ring</b> against the outer surface of the <b>O-ring</b> groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the <b>O-ring</b> between the valve and regulator faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the <b>O-ring,</b> is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|R
40|$|An <b>O-ring</b> {{installed}} on ESN: 690 124 {{was sent to}} the laboratory for analysis.

However, the <b>O-ring</b> was found to be enlarged with respect to a new and unused <b>O-ring</b> that was provided for a comparative study. Analysis showed that such enlargement in size on usage under centrifugal force is a natural phenomenon of rubbery material, if used in uncontained condition. However, with the background information made available by Air India, {{it is not possible to}} find out whether or not there was any contribution to the observed size change due to handling, viz., during dis-assembly or during cleaning. Examination of the <b>O-ring</b> surface did not show any deterioration in the material due to interaction with the oil. However, loop-test performed showed that there was permanent set in the <b>O-ring</b> in question and hence, the elastic recovery in comparison to that in the new and unused one was found to be less. This is again not unusual and is expected due to exposure of the material to elevated pressure and temperature...|$|R

2500|$|With Challenger, an O-ring {{that should}} not have eroded at all did erode on earlier shuttle launches. Yet {{managers}} felt that because it had previously eroded {{by no more than}} 30%, this was not a hazard as there was [...] "a factor of three safety margin". Morton-Thiokol designed and manufactured the SRBs, and during a pre-launch conference call with NASA, Roger Boisjoly, the Thiokol engineer most experienced with the <b>O-rings,</b> pleaded with management repeatedly to cancel or reschedule the launch. He raised concerns that the unusually low temperatures would stiffen the <b>O-rings,</b> preventing a complete seal during flexing of the rocket motor segments, which was exactly what happened on the fatal flight. However, Thiokol's senior managers, under pressure from NASA management, overruled him and allowed the launch to proceed. One week prior to the launch, Thiokol's contract to reprocess the solid rocket boosters was also due for review, and cancelling the flight was an action that Thiokol management wanted to avoid. Challengers <b>O-rings</b> eroded completely through as predicted, resulting in the complete destruction of the spacecraft and the loss of all seven astronauts on board.|$|E
2500|$|Gas leaks: [...] Air leaks can {{be caused}} by burst or leaky hoses, {{defective}} <b>o-rings,</b> blown <b>o-rings,</b> particularly in yoke connectors, loose connections, and several of the previously listed malfunctions. Low pressure inflation hoses may fail to connect properly, or the non-return valve may leak. A burst low pressure hose will usually lose gas faster than a burst high pressure hose, as HP hoses usually have a flow restriction orifice in the fitting that screws into the port, as the SPG does not need high flow, and a slower pressure increase in the gauge hose is less likely to overload the gauge, while the hose to a second stage must provide high peak flow rate to minimize work of breathing. A relatively common o-ring failure occurs when the yoke clamp seal extrudes due to insufficient clamp force or elastic deformation of the clamp by impact with the environment.|$|E
