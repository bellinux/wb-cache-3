40|$|Innovation breeds change, {{and with}} {{the current state of}} affairs change is in the pipeline. The tricky part is {{determining}} the right alterations for society— with research playing a huge role. We start with <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> <b>story,</b> introducing a new and innovative way to raise funds for charity while urging altruistic runners to perform better. Dr Franco Curmi and a diverse team (pg. 32) have designed a baton connected to social media that is carried by the jogger. A community of online supporters can contribute to the cause by logging in to the platform and donate to cheer the runner on. Helping children get through tough times is a team led by Prof. Carmel Cefai (pg. 20). Together, they have created manuals for students, teachers, and parents to help build resilience in younger generations. Investing in children means investing in our future. N/...|$|E

40|$|It is {{with great}} {{pleasure}} that we {{welcome you to}} {{the first issue of}} The Nottingham China Reference. The journal is an independent student-run initiative and has been formed to provide a medium through which students from any degree discipline can share their opinion and experiences on matters related to China. As such, we intend to play host to the broad and divergent views of students within the University of Nottingham, but do not formally represent any consensus of beliefs. The name of this journal is derived to reflect this editorial stance. The top officials of the Chinese Communist Party receive a daily news summary called the ‘Reference News’. This is the “real news ”- there is no spin, manipulation or adulteration. Taking this as our lead, we therefore stand as a medium through which unaltered, uncorrupted opinion and argument can be shared, and through which no special interest is advanced. The lead article of our inaugural issue is entitled What can we learn from China?, and is written by Dr Andreas Fulda, lecturer at the School of Contemporary Chinese Studies. We have chosen this article for <b>our</b> <b>cover</b> <b>story</b> as it addresses two very important aspects of China related study: firstly it asks us not just to learn about China, but also to consider how one can combine theory with practice and actively engage with China. In this engagement process, Dr Fulda reminds us of the need to do so ‘both critically and constructively’. Dr Fulda’s article is just one submission of several from the university’s renowned academic staff. We {{would also like to thank}} Dr Zhengxu Wang for his particularly thoughtful contribution on China’s generation of ‘post 1980 -ers’. The journal has also greatl...|$|E
40|$|Investors rely on {{secondary}} information sources, like <b>cover</b> <b>stories,</b> as market indicators due to time, {{information and}} resources constraints. However, {{studies in the}} US market gave mixed results about the potential use of <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> while no publish research {{could be found in}} South Africa related to investors reaction to <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> or whether an understanding of investment periods, company specific characteristics or bounded rational behaviour would yield superior abnormal returns from <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> In total, 1218 <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> related to publicily listed companies were recorded from FinWeek and Financial Mail for the period 1985 to 2008 and categorised based on the Likert scale developed by Arnold et al. (2007). Event study methodology was used in the research. The research found evidence that investors did pay attention to very optimistic <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> Positive an neutral <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> were contrarian indicators, while negative <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> were momentum indicators of future company investment performances and the abnormal returns for an investment portfolio based on these <b>cover</b> <b>story</b> effects were optimised by short-selling <b>cover</b> <b>story</b> companies from healthcare, general retail and general mining industries and buying shares in control companies from the same industries and company sizes.

40|$|If {{you lived}} in a European town or city 600 years ago, {{one of the things}} you did each morning was toss the {{contents}} of your chamber pot out the window. Street gutters were open sewers. Today, the worst that will hit your windshield while driving down a street is a bird dropping, and we call that progress. But when you look down a stream that runs along the backyards of a row of houses, and you see the pipes sticking out of the ground at the water’s edge, lined up like mailboxes sending raw sewage into the stream from each house, you can see that we have quite a way to go yet. <b>Our</b> <b>cover</b> <b>story</b> this issue concerns straight pipes and the danger to public health and the environment they pose. Recognizing that threat and discussing it is one thing, but actually moving to eliminate it is another. The state of North Carolina has created a program to identify and eliminate straight pipes and failing septic systems on a watershed basis statewide (pg. 18). Even with the progress the program has made, it is estimated that it will take 10 to 15 years to get rid of all the straight pipes in the state. Unfortunately, it appears that North Carolina may be the only state that has a comprehensive, community-supported program in place to eliminate straight pipes (and other methods used to dispose of household wastewater without treating it). We are presenting their program as a model for other states. If there are any other programs like it in any other states, we at the NSFC would like to know about them. You can contact the editor of this magazine directly at the address on this page. Another program that we are showcasing in this issue i...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyse the impact of business magazine <b>cover</b> <b>stories,</b> albeit positive, neutral or negative, on the share price of the featured company. Two of the aspects of investment finance are rational behaviour and efficient markets. Both of these concepts were explored to understand why a <b>cover</b> <b>story</b> would have an impact on a company share price. Causal research was conducted to analyse the correlation between a magazine <b>cover</b> <b>story</b> and the featured company’s share price. The <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> were collected form the Financial Mail and Finance Week archives. The holding period returns were calculated and compared to zero to analyse whether there was any momentum or contrarian signals. The holding period returns were also adjusted for that of the average of the resources index (J 258) to ascertain whether the returns were abnormal or not. The results have shown that in some instances, such as with neutral <b>cover</b> <b>stories,</b> the markets show strong signs of efficiency. The results of positive <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> showed these to be momentum indicators, however when the results were adjusted for the resource index, many the positive returns dissipated. Negative <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> had the strongest results, where after the <b>cover</b> <b>story</b> there were clear contrarian signals. Most of the companies stopped showing negative returns.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extension to a Multi-Level Secure (MLS) data model {{that requires the}} classification of data and users into multiple security levels. In MLS systems, <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> allow information provided to users at lower security levels to differ from information provided to users at higher security levels. Previous versions of the MLS model did not permit <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> for key attributes, because the key is used to relate the various <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> for a particular entity. We have extended the MLS model to include non-key related <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> so that key attributes can also have different values at different security levels.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we study {{the use of}} polyinstantiation, {{for the purpose of}} {{implementing}} <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> in multilevel secure relational database systems. We define a particular semantics for polyinstantiation called PCS (i. e., polyinstantiatlon for <b>cover</b> <b>stories).</b> PCS allows two alternatives for each attribute (or attribute group) of a multilevel entity: (i) no polyinstantiation, or (il) polyinstantiation at the explicit request of a user to whom the polyinstantiation is visible. PCS strictly limits the extent of polyinstantlation by requiring that each entity in a multilevel relation has at most one tuple per security class. We demonstrate that PCS provides a natural, intuitive and useful technique for implementing <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> A particularly attractive feature of PCS is its run-time flexibility regarding the use of <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> A particular attribute may have <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> for some entities and not for others.

The interest {{of this study is}} on new products specifically mobile phones presented in “Mobile World” magazine as nowadays, there is a competition in selling mobile phones (Ni’Mah, 2012). Therefore, the study will explain on how linguistic and visual features of <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> could be deciphered as an adverting message through investigating linguistic and visual representation used in magazine <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> The data in this study are taken from a magazine of cellular consumer’s guidance, namely “Mobile World” magazine published by One World Solutions Sdn Bhd. This study attempts to explore <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> {{in the first six months}} of 2013 but only those which focus on Mobile phone rather than Tablet or other devices. To fulfil the aim of this study, first, the linguistic text of the <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> of the magazines was analysed in terms of process, participant and circumstance through utilizing Halliday’s (2004) transitivity system. In the next step, the visual components of <b>cover</b> <b>stories</b> of the magazines were selected to be examined according to Kress and van Leeuwen’s (2006) narrative and conceptual representation analysis to differentiate between the visual elements provided in <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> The findings found out that material and relational processes are commonly used as these emphasise on the capability and functions of the mobile phone advertised. As such, the highlighted features would draw potential buyers to consider buying the new phones. Similarly, visual findings on Action and Reaction processes were extensively seen in the images of the <b>cover</b> <b>stories.</b> With that, the different life experience of the consumers when using or owning is identified and interaction between the participants of the images plays an important role in consumerism marketing...|$|R
