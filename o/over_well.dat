5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go <b>over</b> <b>well</b> with the audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the period, {{there was}} a sharp {{distinction}} between the sober fashions favored by Protestants in England and the Netherlands, which still showed heavy Spanish influence, and the light, revealing fashions of the French and Italian courts.

But six sixes and two fours later, it looked as though West Indies might just win. Sammy had amassed 58 runs, the fifty coming up off just twenty deliveries. It was the fastest fifty ever by a West Indies player, and more importantly, it had brought West Indies within reach of victory.|$|E

The band received £12 per week and were soon packing out the club on a regular basis. It was here they linked {{up with one of}} the regular patrons, Bruce Howard, a classically trained keyboard player. Bruce auditioned at the next rehearsal and joined the band. He and Trevor Wilson became the creative core of the band, writing all their original material.|$|E

25|$|Messier's {{return to}} Canada {{after six years}} with the Rangers was an {{emotional}} and high-profile event, but the bliss was brief. Before the season started, captain Trevor Linden relinquished the captaincy to Messier, a move that did not go <b>over</b> <b>well</b> with Canucks supporters. Amidst a turbulent season, in which {{president and general manager}} Pat Quinn and head coach Tom Renney were fired, Linden was eventually traded by new coach and acting general manager Mike Keenan to the New York Islanders, where he became their captain, replacing Bryan McCabe, for whom Linden was traded along with Todd Bertuzzi. Messier's demand to receive the number No.11, which he had worn throughout his career with the Oilers and Rangers, but which the Canucks had unofficially retired after Wayne Maki's unexpected death in 1974, hurt his image as well.|$|E
25|$|Billy {{gave the}} many fans of Crawford's {{portrayal}} of Frank Spencer {{an opportunity to}} see him in a broadly similar role on the stage, and was a considerable hit (904 West End performances). After the closing of Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em, Crawford continued to perform in plays and musicals, starring in Flowers for Algernon (1979) in the role of Charley Gordon, based on the book of the same title. He pursued another role on a very short-lived ITV sitcom, Chalk and Cheese, as the slovenly, uncouth Dave Finn. The show did not go <b>over</b> <b>well</b> with his fans: the popularity of Crawford's portrayal of Frank Spencer, and the similar Billy Fisher character, had left him somewhat typecast, {{to the extent that they}} could not accept his very different role as Dave Finn. Crawford abandoned the show during its first series and returned to theatre work.|$|E
25|$|Middlesex Crusaders amassed 333 for 4 in 45 overs - that's {{nearly seven}} and a half runs an <b>over,</b> <b>well</b> over the average five in 45-over games - and still lost to Gloucestershire Gladiators. It didn't look as the score would be as big at first,as Paul Weekes with 81, Ed Smith with 53, Owais Shah with 55 and Scott Styris with 42 kept the score ticking at roughly a run a ball. However, Kenyan-born Jamie Dalrymple slashed four sixes and seven fours in an unbeaten 24-ball 60 to up the run rate late on, and Gloucestershire's Jon Lewis, who earlier in the summer had played ODIs for England, conceded 86 runs in nine overs. Gloucestershire always kept up with the run rate, however, as Phil Weston, Craig Spearman and Matt Windows lifted Gloucestershire to 275 for 2, and despite Paul Weekes' late burst of four wickets, Mark Alleyne and Ian Fisher shared a stand of 18 to see Gloucestershire to the target.|$|E

In the episode, Bart convinces Krusty the Clown to appear at a comedy festival organized by Jay Leno, but Krusty's old material does not go <b>over</b> <b>well</b> with the audience and he receives bad reviews. He briefly retires from comedy but returns with a new, more well received gimmick. He soon returns to his old ways, selling out to a motor-vehicle company.|$|E
500|$|The early {{screening}} of the pilot at San Diego Comic-Con International was met with a very positive reaction from the crowd. Critically, the initial {{screening of}} the pilot was met with mostly positive reviews, though The New York Times Brooks Barnes noted that [...] "what goes <b>over</b> <b>well</b> at Comic-Con does not necessarily work in the real world," [...] especially on a network with [...] "Scandal moms and Dancing with the Stars grandparents". Entertainment Weeklys initial reactions were that if everything that made the show appealing its continuity with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, its continuance of The Avengers storyline, and Whedon's return to television, were stripped from it, the show would still work. However, they also questioned whether the show was accessible enough to attract a wider audience.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} week, See It Now ran another episode {{critical of}} McCarthy, this one {{focusing on the}} case of Annie Lee Moss, an African-American army clerk who was the target of one of McCarthy's investigations. The Murrow shows, together with the televised Army–McCarthy hearings of the same year, were the major causes of a nationwide popular opinion backlash against McCarthy, in part because for the first time his statements were being publicly challenged by noteworthy figures. To counter the negative publicity, McCarthy appeared on See It Now on April 6, 1954, and made a number of charges against the popular Murrow, including the accusation that he colluded with VOKS, the [...] "Russian espionage and propaganda organization". This response did not go <b>over</b> <b>well</b> with viewers, and the result was a further decline in McCarthy's popularity.|$|E

Sworn in with Milk were also a single mother (Carol Ruth Silver), a Chinese American (Gordon Lau), and an African American woman (Ella Hill Hutch)—all firsts for the city.

In addition to Portal, the Box also included Half-Life 2 and its two add-on episodes, as well as Team Fortress 2. Portals inclusion within the Box was considered an experiment by Valve; having no idea of the success of Portal, the Box provided it a [...] "safety net" [...] via means of these other games. Portal was kept to a modest length in case the game did not go <b>over</b> <b>well</b> with players. Since then, a standalone version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows users.|$|E

500|$|Although Goldfaden, {{by his own}} account, was {{familiar}} at this time with [...] "practically all of Russian literature", and also had plenty of exposure to Polish theater, and had even seen an African American tragedian, Ira Aldridge, performing Shakespeare, the performance at Grădina Pomul Verde was only {{a bit more of}} a play than Grodner had participated in three years earlier. The songs were strung together with a bit of character and plot and a good bit of improvisation. The performance by Goldfaden, Grodner, Sokher Goldstein, and possibly as many as three other men went <b>over</b> <b>well.</b> The first performance was either Di bobe mitn einikl (Grandmother and Granddaughter) or Dos bintl holts (The Bundle of sticks); sources disagree. (Some reports suggest that Goldfaden himself was a poor singer, or even a non-singer and poor actor; according to Bercovici, these reports stem from Goldfaden's own self-disparaging remarks or from his countenance as an old man in New York, but contemporary reports show him to have been a decent, though not earth-shattering, actor and singer.) ...|$|E
500|$|Mrs. Puff plays a small {{role in the}} 2004 film The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie and its [...] Her lack {{of screen}} time in both movies was criticized.

Sandie Chen of Common Sense Media wrote that the {{decision}} to relegate characters like Mrs. Puff to small roles [...] "won't go <b>over</b> <b>well</b> with some fans". About.com's Nancy Basille considered this the first movie's biggest flaw and asked, [...] "why didn't they use more of Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Gary, Mrs. Puff and all our other favorite secondary characters?"

Data from <b>over</b> 500 <b>wells</b> were utilized to train the models, and another set of data of <b>over</b> 200 <b>wells</b> {{was used to test}} the models. Three mathematical models are created to evaluate the mitigation of lost circulation events—volume loss, ECD, and ROP. Lost circulation events are categorized according to the total volume of fluid lost during the event. The volume of mud losses depends on number of factors, including formation properties, drilling-fluid properties, operational drilling parameters, and formation breakdown pressure.|$|R
