40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focuses on}} the {{relation}} between the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> a <b>disability</b> and employment outcomes. We develop an event-history model that includes accidents as a measure for health shocks and we estimate the model using data from the British National Child Development Study (NCDS). We show that experiencing such a health shock increases the likelihood <b>of</b> an <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> a <b>disability</b> by around 172 %. However, accidents are relatively rare events and therefore the larger part <b>of</b> observed <b>disability</b> rates result from gradual deteriorations in health. The absence of a direct effect of accidents on employment outcomes, allows instrumenting the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> by the occurrences of accidents. We find that <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> a <b>disability</b> at age 25 causally reduces the employment rate at age 40 with around 14 percentage points. The effect is stronger for males and for low educated workers. Our results indicate that about two-third of the association between disability and employment {{can be explained by the}} causal effect <b>of</b> the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> a <b>disability</b> on employment. This fraction is higher for men and for lower educated workers. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> and/or health {{problems}} causes large earning losses for older workers of all racial groups. Although the previous literature has found substantial differences across race {{with respect to}} older worker labor participation, very few studies have investigated differences across race in labor force exits of older workers {{brought about by the}} <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> or {{health problems}}. Using a human capital investment framework, the study assesses dynamic racial differences in the risk of older workers exiting the labor market following the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disabilities</b> or health problems. Using nationally representative longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) 1992 - 2002, discrete survival-time hazard models are developed for older male workers and older female workers (age 50 and over) respectively. The results show that the risk of exiting the labor market is significantly higher for black female workers with any reported work limitations than for white female workers. There is no difference across race with respect to male workers. Females with higher levels of education or with less physically demanding jobs are less likely to exit the labor market following the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> work limitations than those with lower levels of education or with more physically demanding jobs. However, differences in the effect of work limitations on hazard rates across race become weaker after adjusting for th...|$|R

40|$|The early <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> (at birth through young adulthood) {{can affect}} a person's {{employment}} outcomes in myriad ways. In {{addition to the}} direct effect of disability on employment, early <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> likely affects the acquisition of education and job skills (human capital). This reduced "investment" in human capital in turn may reduce the individual's employment and earnings prospects throughout their lifetime. If this is the case, people with early <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> may be doubly disadvantaged {{when it comes to}} later employment prospects. This study analyzes how early <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> (onset prior to age 22) affects employment opportunities both directly {{and as a result of}} reduced investment in human capital (education) for a younger cohort (ages 22 to 35) and older cohort (ages 44 to 54). In our young cohort, we find that people with early <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> have a lower probability of completing high school and a lower probability of being employed than those without disabilities. Lower employment rates result from both lower levels of high school completion and a direct negative impact of disability on work. In the older cohort, we find the employment of those with disability is lower than those without disability, regardless of age of onset. However, those with early <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> have significantly higher employment rates than those with later <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> (after age 22). We hypothesize that this is a result of people with <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> prior to age 22 either choose careers that can be more easily accommodated than the careers people with later disability onset have, or that people with early <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> are more likely to be adept at seeking and using accommodations than those with later disability onset. These results suggest that policies and programs to increase employment of persons with disabilities should focus on ways to increase education levels of those with early <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability.</b> They also suggest that return-to-work efforts focused on older cohorts of persons with disabilities may want to separately target programs to those with early <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background Young {{people with}} disabilities {{are at greater risk}} of having mental health {{problems}} than are their nondisabled peers. Most research about the relationship between disability and mental health has been cross-sectional and unable to identify mental health status prior to <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> or possible mental health pathways following disability. There is a lack of information, therefore, about what happens to young people’s mental health when they become disabled. Objective This study aimed to identify the mental health trajectories for young Australian adults after onset of self-reported disability, taking into account their predisability mental health status. Methods Longitudinal data from waves 1 to 7 (2001 to 2007) of the survey of Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) were analyzed using a growth mixture modeling approach. Results Three distinct mental health trajectories were identified for the 136 young people reporting onset of ongoing disability. The majority (64. 7 %) of respondents experienced positive mental health before and following <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability.</b> However, a significant minority (35. 3 %) experienced either (a) low mental health both prior to and following <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> (19. 1 %) or (b) mental health deterioration following <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> (16. 2 %).

The participants were 113 non-disabled community-dwelling women {{with a mean age}} of 79. 5 years at baseline. The baseline examinations of physical performance were: functional reach, climbing steps and comfortable walking speed. ADL disability was defined as need of personal assistance in at least one of five basic ADL items. The participants were followed for 9 years. Logistic regression models were fitted for each of the physical performance measurements together with the covariates in relation to ADL disability. At follow-up 25. 7 % were disabled in ADL.

Methods. We initially reviewed risk factors for <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> in 35 prospective studies of functional decline in older people published in 1998 – 2001. In the present study, disability was defined as requiring help from another person at least {{several times a week}} and was assessed by dependency in activities of daily living.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if age, gender, level of participation, <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> and sport classification have an impact on participation incentives (ego, fitness, social affective, social integration and task) in skiers with a disability. One hundred seventy-seven individuals between the ages of 4 and 66 years participated. The participants were described according to gender, time of <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> <b>disability</b> (congenital Vs acquired), level of sport involvement (recreation, local competition, provincial competition, national competition and international competition), and sport classification (LW 1 -LW 9, LW 10 -LW 12, blind, deaf and other [i. e. autistic, Down's Syndrome]). All the participants were active members of the Canadian Association of Disabled Skiing (CADS). The reasons for participation were evaluated using the Participation Reasons Scale (Brasile, 1988).

These results indicate that reasons for participation do differ among skiers with a disability and knowledge of these reasons may be important to be better able to design attractive and successful programs for the individual with a disability.

We use medical/demographic factors (arthritis, heart disease, diabetes; age, gender, race/ethnicity, wealth), baseline characteristics (affect, cognition, health behaviors, medical insurance), and time-varying covariates (changes in chronic conditions and baseline characteristics) to predict the onset of activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) disability, individually and in the aggregate, over time. We find the onset of ADL and IADL disability is a complex process, suggesting important roles for medical, demographic, social, psychological, and behavioral triggers, specifically negative affect, higher body weight, and by the lack of vigorous exercise. We also find that individual ADL and IADL impairments are predicted by a variety of different factors, suggesting that summary measures of disability may be masking a wealth of potentially useful interventions.

Currently, forty-five percent of seniors need assistance with activities of daily living. Medicare and Medicaid provide little coverage for these services, leaving the elderly to rely on informal care. While previous research has examined who provides care and {{the process by which}} children and parents arrange care, I use the Study of Assets and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) to examine parents' expectations about future care from children and the implications of those predictions after the <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> a <b>disability.</b> Using a probit framework, I examine who anticipates care from children among non-disabled households and who actually receives care among disabled households. The household characteristics correlated with anticipating future care differ from those correlated with the true probability of receiving care. For example, an additional daughter increases the probability that an elderly household expects future care, however an additional daughter is not statistically significantly related to the true probability of receiving care. Conversely, parents' socioeconomic status is not statistically significantly related to the probability of expecting future care, but lower socioeconomic households are more likely to receive care. I directly evaluate the accuracy of parents' predictions using the panel nature of the data. Among households that expect future care from children, over 60 percent do not receive care after the initial <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> a <b>disability</b> and nearly 50 percent still do not receive care after living with disabilities for five years. Among households that do not anticipate care from children, approximately 25 percent unexpectedly receive care after the initial <b>onset</b> <b>of</b> a <b>disability,</b> while slightly more than 50 percent receive care after needing help for five years.
