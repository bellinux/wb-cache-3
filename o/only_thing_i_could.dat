500|$|Eventually, {{the band}} left their {{independent}} record label Lookout! Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing {{to a major}} label caused many of the band's original fans from the independent music club 924 Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs. The club has banned Green Day from entering since the major label signing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't {{go back to the}} punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure [...] The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was get on my bike and go forward." ...|$|E
500|$|Kerplunks {{underground}} success led to {{a number}} of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo [...] "was the only person we could really talk to and connect with". Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, [...] "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was get on my bike and go forward." [...] After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.|$|E

And only a child, with a child's imagination, can come to know the meaning of things it has been long denied. I early discovered that the <b>only</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have were those I got for myself. My meagre childhood developed meagreness. The first <b>things</b> <b>I</b> had been able to get for myself had been cigarette pictures, cigarette posters, and cigarette albums.

500|$|Pat campaigned at her husband's side in 1946 when {{he entered}} {{politics}} and successfully ran for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives. That same year, she gave birth to a daughter and namesake, Patricia, known as Tricia. In 1948, Pat had her second and last child, Julie. When asked about her husband's career, Pat once stated, [...] "The <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do was help him, but [...] was not a life I would have chosen." [...] Pat participated in the campaign by doing research on his opponent, incumbent Jerry Voorhis. She also wrote and distributed campaign literature. Nixon was elected in his first campaign to represent California's 12th congressional district. During the next six years, Pat saw her husband move from the U.S. House of Representatives to the United States Senate, and then be nominated as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice presidential candidate.|$|E

5000|$|... "The Warmth of the Sun" [...] {{was started}} {{in the early morning}} hours of the same morning that President Kennedy was killed in Dallas. The melody was so haunting, sad, melancholy, that the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of lyrically was the loss of love, when {{interest}} slips and feelings aren't reciprocated…though I wanted to have a silver lining on that cumulus nimbus cloud so I wrote the lyrics from the perspective of, [...] "Yes, things have changed and love is no longer there, but the memory of it lingers like the warmth of the sun."

2500|$|On 29 January 2014, {{following}} a 0–0 draw {{at home to}} West Ham United, Mourinho described the Hammers as playing [...] "19th century football", saying, [...] "This {{is not the best}} league in the world, this is football from the 19th century," [...] and, [...] "The <b>only</b> [...] <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> bring was a Black and Decker to destroy the wall." [...] On 19 April 2014, Mourinho suffered his first ever home league defeat as Chelsea manager in a 2–1 loss to Sunderland at Stamford Bridge. He consistently played down Chelsea's title chances throughout the season and referred to it as a transitional season, slowly moulding his squad and most significantly dropping (and eventually selling) Chelsea's player of the year of the two previous seasons, Juan Mata. Chelsea went on to finish third in the 2013–14 Premier League, four points behind champions Manchester City.|$|R

5000|$|Quintron has {{invented a}} number of {{innovative}} musical devices. His first invention was called the ''''Spit Machine'''' a hand organ which used saliva as a tuning conductor. Describing how the apparatus works, Quintron explains that [...] "You had to spit on a stick, like a paint stir stick, and you had two metal leads that you would touch to {{either end of the}} line of spit and then you would move the leads closer together - higher pitch - and farther apart - lower pitch. The weird thing is that, the way I built the oscillator, spit was the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> use as a conducter (sic). Lemon juice was too conductive, water not enough, etc. You actually had a lot of control over the pitch with spit - it wasn’t too sensitive - and could really play it in tune like a real organ. There was also some resistive quality to human spit that gave the oscillator some weird overtones too." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was a kid, I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity... My hair was my glory. It was the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> change about myself." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{wondered}} how long I had to live. I tried to examine myself. I felt my pulse. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not at first feel any pulse at all. Then, all of a sudden, it seemed to start off. I pulled out my watch and timed it. I made it a hundred and forty-seven to the minute. I tried to feel my heart. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not feel my heart. It had stopped beating. I have since been induced {{to come to the}} opinion that it must have been there all the time, and must have been beating, but I cannot account for it. I patted myself all over my front, from what I call my waist up to my head, and I went a bit round each side, and a little way up the back. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not feel or hear anything. I tried to look at my tongue. I stuck it out as far as ever it would go, and I shut one eye, and tried to examine it with the other. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only see the tip, and the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> gain from that was to feel more certain than before that I had scarlet fever.|$|R

60|$|I do not {{remember}} a time when my mind was in such a state of ungovernable emotion. Not only was I unable to control my feelings, but I did not know what they were. One <b>thing</b> <b>only</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> comprehend: I must remove this impression from the mind of Miss Laniston, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> think of no other way of doing it than to confide to her the business on which I wished to see Mother Anastasia. I reseated myself on the sofa, and without delay or preface I laid before her my plan of collaboration with the sisters of the House of Martha; explaining how much better a man could attend to certain outside business than the sisters could do it, and showing how, in a manner, I proposed to become a brother of the House of Martha. Thus only <b>could</b> <b>I</b> defend myself against her irrational and agitating suppositions.|$|R
6000|$|... "'No,' I {{thought to}} myself, 'faint heart never won fair tusk. I'll risk it, {{and have a}} slap at them. But how?' <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not advance across the open, for they would see me; clearly the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> {{to do was to}} creep round {{in the shadow of the}} bush and try to come upon them so. So I started. Seven or eight minutes of careful {{stalking}} brought me to the mouth of the path down which the third elephant had walked. The other two were now about fifty yards from me, and the nature of the wall of bush was such that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not see how to get nearer to them without being discovered. I hesitated, and peeped down the path which the elephant had followed. About five yards in, it took a turn round a shrub. I thought that I would just have a look behind it, and advanced, expecting that I should be able to catch a sight of the elephant's tail. As it happened, however, I met his trunk coming round the corner. It is very disconcerting to see an elephant's trunk when you expect to see his tail, and for a moment I stood paralyzed almost under the vast brute's head, for he was not five yards from me. He too halted, threw up his trunk and trumpeted preparatory to a charge. I was in for it now, for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not escape either to the right or left, on account of the bush, and I did not dare turn my back. So <b>I</b> did the <b>only</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do--raised the rifle and fired at the black mass of his chest. It was too dark for me to pick a shot; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only brown him, as it were.|$|R
