40|$|Acknowledgement First of all I {{would like}} to thank the Energy Efficiency {{department}} of Tata steel IJmuiden for their continuous support and feedback. Starting with Gerard Jägers, as head of the department he creates a great working atmosphere and including me in some general tasks of the Energy Efficiency group was a very informative experience. I would also like to thank my colleagues Tom van der Velde, André Oudhuis and Nando Leerentveld for including me in the team and helping me with my assignment, giving insight in who to contact and how certain processes work. I would also like to thank the rest of the Energy Efficiency department, including the interns. Especially Salah Moussa and Balaji Sridharan, helping me with some of the technical aspects of this research. Outside of the Energy Efficiency department I {{would like to}} thank the following people which helped me in the different plants of Tata steel IJmuiden: Martijn Wortel, Cierick Goos, Edwin Bleij, Bert Jonker, John Krom, Jaap van den Born, Bert Woestenburg, Marcel Peekel, Ruud Koper, Willem Hooft and Joost Duin. Finally, I want to thank my roommates and girlfriend for their support throughout the internship.     Abstract Tata Steel IJmuiden (TSIJ) is an integrated steel plant, all process steps required in the production of the steel end product are on site. The production of steel is an energy intensive process, which makes TSIJ the biggest single user of fossil fuels in the Netherlands. Most of this energy is used as heat and if this heat is not utilized it is called waste heat. TSIJ has multiple waste heat sources, clearly mapped in previous research. Utilization of these waste heat sources is difficult due to a mismatch in time between the supply of the waste heat source and the demand of the heat. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) could solve this problem. Therefore this research investigates the possibilities of TES at TSIJ. The possibilities for TES are investigated by searching for the most suitable waste heat source and heat demand, matched by a TES system. To investigate the most suitable waste heat source, constraints on fluctuation, location, temperature and extractability are imposed on both the demand and supply. The best possible match between demand and supply under these constraints is further investigated both technically and economically in a case study. In the case study it is investigated if the flue gasses of the Direct Sheet Plant (DSP) can be stored in a TES system provided by EnergyNest. The stored heat can then be reused to pre heat the air used in the burners of the heat coating drying of the DSP and the basic <b>oxygen</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plant</b> (BOS). An additional connection could be made with the 15 bar steam network to Tata Steel Packaging (TSP). Four setups of the TES, with different heat demand connections and TES capacities, will be compared to see what setup will be the most suitable. To determine the setup that would be preferred, the Pay Back Period (PBP) is calculated. The setup in which the TES has a capacity of 5 MWh and no connection is made with the steam network, is preferred based on the PBP. In order to reduce the amount of investment costs, the TES is not coupled to the steam network in the preferred setup. With this setup it is still possible to utilize all of the stored heat in the heat coating drying. Originally this setup resulted in a Pay Back Period (PBP) of 21 years, but with a subsidy this could decrease to 11 years PBP. Total Annual savings with this setup are over € 100 000,- and total investments of the system would amount to just over one million euros. TES shows potential for TSIJ, but at current investment costs and energy prices it proves to be expensive. Further research could give useful insights into the subject, and could give way to cheaper and economically viable solutions in the future...|$|E
