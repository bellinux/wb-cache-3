Ns In {{the past few}} years there has been much research devoted to the nonlinear interaction of superintense laser pulses with plasmas [1]. At intensities where electrons quiver with relativistic velocities, the interaction can be characterized as nonlinear optics in relativistic plasmas, and new regimes, not evident at nonrelativistic intensities, may appear. As was previously shown, superintense electromagnetic radiation can propagate through a classically <b>overdense</b> <b>plasma</b> due to the relativistic correction to the electron mass, the so called induced transparency effect, [2]-[10].

Vlasov simulations revealed a rich variety of new phenomena associated with the trapped particle dynamics, which cannot be described in fluid models. Most notably is the observation, during the penetration phase of the pump electromagnetic wave, of a beat-wave heating scenario induced by the Doppler shift on the reflected wave at the (moving) wave front.
