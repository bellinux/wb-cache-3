5|$|Hurricane Barbara was the easternmost landfalling Pacific {{hurricane}} <b>on</b> <b>record.</b> <b>As</b> {{the first}} hurricane of the 2013 Pacific hurricane season, Barbara developed from a low-pressure area while located southeast of Mexico on May28. It headed slowly north-northeastward and strengthened into {{a tropical storm}} early on the following day. After recurving to the northeast, Barbara intensified into a Category1 hurricane on May29 and made landfall in Chiapas at peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 983mbar (hPa; 29.03inHg). When the hurricane made landfall, {{it was the second}} earliest landfalling hurricane in the basin since reliable records began in 1966. Barbara then moved across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and dissipated within the mountainous terrain of Sierra Madre de Chiapas on May 30.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of June24, Hurricane Celia {{intensified}} into a powerful Category5 storm, further solidifying it as the strongest of the 2010 Pacific hurricane season. At its peak, the cyclone attained winds of 160mph (260km/h) along with a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). This ranks it as the second-strongest June hurricane <b>on</b> <b>record,</b> <b>as</b> well as the eleventh-strongest in the basin, and the second known Category5 to develop during the month on record. The strongest and first known storm of this intensity in June was Hurricane Ava in 1973. Additionally, it also {{marked the first time}} on record that two consecutive seasons featured Category5 hurricanes, with Hurricane Rick in October 2009 reaching this intensity, the second time two consecutive seasons had a category 5 hurricane was when hurricanes Marie and Patricia formed in 2014 and 2015 respectively. In the National Hurricane Center's monthly tropical weather summary for June 2010, it was stated that the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) for the month was the highest on record, most of which is attributed to Hurricane Celia.|$|E
5|$|Mireille was {{the strongest}} typhoon to hit Japan since Typhoon Nancy in 1961, causing heavy damage in 41 of 47 prefectures. It was the third storm to strike Japan in two weeks. Damage was {{heaviest}} on Kyushu where the storm made landfall. Because the storm moved northeastward through the Sea of Japan, the eastern quadrant of the storm crossed {{over much of the}} country, which is where the strongest winds in tropical cyclones are located. The high winds downed trees, damaged roofs, and left record power outages, affecting 7.36million people, or about 13% of total customers. In some areas, the power outages lasted as little as three minutes. The storm damaged over 670,000houses, of which 1,058were destroyed, and another 22,965were flooded. Power outages caused at least five factories to shut down production. Along the coast, the typhoon damaged 930ships, with dozens sunk or blown ashore. Most of the damage was related to agriculture or forests. Sea spray heavily damaged fruit trees and rice paddies. Crop damage amounted to $3billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. Most farms lost 80% of their crop, potentially taking 10years to regrow. Persistent cloudiness and rainfall following the storm diminished sunlight by 50%, furthering crop damage. There were 62deaths in Japan and 2,862injuries, including the deaths on the South Korean freighter, making it the deadliest typhoon there in 10years. About 80% of the deaths were male, and 70% were over 60years old. Most of the deaths were related to wind-blown debris, falling due to the wind, or being trapped or struck by fallen objects. The $6billion in insured losses and $10billion in overall damage made Mireille the costliest typhoon <b>on</b> <b>record</b> <b>as</b> of May 2014, according to Munich Re.|$|E

5|$|The typhoon first {{threatened}} Guam, {{although it}} passed {{well to the}} north of the island, bringing damaging winds to northern Saipan. The first part of Japan affected was Miyako-jima, where heavy rainfall and high winds damaged crops. Mireille lashed Okinawa with strong waves, while strong winds up to 189km/h (118mph) damaged power lines and trees. The typhoon ultimately caused damage in 41 of 47 prefectures of Japan, with overall damage estimated at $10billion (USD), making it the costliest typhoon <b>on</b> <b>record</b> <b>as</b> of 2014. Mireille produced record wind gusts at 26locations, with a peak gust of 218km/h (136mph) in western Honshu. The winds caused record power outages across Japan that affected 7.36million people, or about 13% of total customers. Mireille also left extensive crop damage totaling $3billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. The storm damaged over 670,000houses, of which 1,058 were destroyed, and another 22,965 were flooded. Throughout Japan, Mireille killed 66people and injured another 2,862people, including ten deaths on a capsized freighter. Elsewhere, the typhoon killed two people in South Korea, and its remnants brought strong winds to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Very Intense Tropical Cyclone Hellen of March 2014 {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} tropical cyclones in the Mozambique Channel <b>on</b> <b>record,</b> <b>as</b> well as the most intense of the 2013–14 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. It formed on March26 in the northern portion of the channel, and in its formative stages brought rainfall to coastal Mozambique. While moving southeastward, it developed an organized area of convection over the center. Warm waters allowed Hellen to rapidly intensify while passing south of the Comoros, with a well-defined eye forming in the middle of the thunderstorms. The cyclone attained peak intensity March30, with maximum sustained winds estimated 230km/h (145mph) according to the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center, Météo-France in La Réunion. Subsequently, Hellen weakened quickly due to dry air and interaction with Madagascar, and the eye dissipated. On March31, the storm made landfall in northwestern Madagascar as a weakened cyclone, despite previous forecasts for the center to remain over water. By April1, Hellen was no longer a tropical cyclone after most of the convection dissipated. The remnants turned to the west, moving over Mozambique without redeveloping.|$|E
