40|$|International audienceThe optical code {{division}} multiple access (OCDMA) technique has been investigated for several years as a promising alternative to provide multiple access in high speed optical networks. However, due to the use of binary <b>on</b> <b>off</b> <b>keying</b> (OOK) modulation, an inherent main performance limitation is multiple access interference (MAI), following a specific distribution. In order to reduce errors induced by MAI, it is necessary to take into account this specific statistic when applying forward error correction (FEC) with soft decision decoding. In this paper, we analyse the MAI distribution in order to determine FEC soft decoding calculation rules. The study is performed for a low density parity check (LDPC) code scheme over an OCDMA system using two-dimensional (2 -D) OCDMA spreading codes. The a priori information required for soft decoder initialisation is calculated according to the specific OCDMA channel statistic.

Compared to the radio frequency domain, optical wireless communication offers much higher speeds and bit rates per unit power consumption. As stated by the official infrared standard IrDA optical communication enjoys much lower power consumption than Bluetooth, with an inherent security feature while in Line of Sight (LOS) applications. There are also drawbacks such as the infrared radiation cannot penetrate walls as radio frequencies do and interference from the background contribute to the channel dispersions. Focus on the modulation aspects of the optical wireless communication, this thesis try to improve the channel immunity by utilising optimised modulation to the channel. Modulation schemes such as <b>on</b> <b>off</b> <b>keying</b> (OOK), pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and pulse position modulation (PPM) and pulse position and amplitude modulation PAPM schemes have been validated. The combined power and bandwidth requirements suggest that the adaptive modulation schemes can provide reliability when deployed in a real time channel, resulting in improved system performance. As a result, an adaptive modulation technique is proposed. Extensive simulations of severe noise distraction have been carried out to validate the new scheme. The simulation results indicate that the new scheme can provide increased immunity against channel noise fluctuation at a relatively low complexity. The scheme obtained formed a basis to support reliable mobile optical wireless communication applications. The adaptive scheme also takes the real time channel conditions into account, which is different from existing schemes. Guaranteed system performance can be secured without compromising power and bandwidth efficiency. This is also a new approach to realise reliable optical wireless links.

It is used in various {{applications}} such as sensor networks, short distance telemetry, home automation, biomedicine, remotely controlled systems, etc., because of its simplicity and low power design. In the classical super regenerative receiver, the RF oscillations obtained at {{the output of the}} oscillator is applied to a non-linear detector followed by a low pass filter. Hence the demodulation capabilities of the super regenerative receiver was restricted to amplitude modulation or <b>on</b> <b>off</b> <b>keying</b> (OOK) signals. The challenge is to use the super regenerative architecture to demodulate phase modulated signals which are more robust to interference compared to OOK signals and still maintaining the low power, low cost features of the receiver. The principle of super regenerative receiver is based on the theory of quenching, where a quench oscillator causes repeated build up and decay of oscillations and the oscillations are maximum at the zero crossing where the quench signal goes towards the positive half cycle. Any phase errors in the quench signal directly affects the phase detection performance. Thus {{it is also important to}} maintain synchronization between the quench signal and the carrier. In digital communications, packet arrival instants are generally random and unknown at the receiver. The payload of the packet can be successfully demodulated if the start time of the payload is known at the receiver. Thus the objective of this thesis is threefold.

40|$|Product {{accumulate}} (PA) codes were {{proposed as}} a class of high-rate low-complexity, capacity-approaching codes on additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels. In this paper, we investigate {{the performance of the}} PA codes on intensity modulated optical fiber channels where the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise dominates all other noise sources. We consider binary <b>ON</b> [...] <b>OFF</b> <b>keying</b> (OOK) modulation and iterative soft-decision message-passing decoding for the PA codes. Three channel models for the ASE noise dominated channel are investigated: asymmetric chi-square, asymmetric Gaussian, and symmetric Gaussian channels (i. e., AWGN). At low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), {{due to the lack of}} tight bounds, code performance is evaluated using simulations of typical PA coding schemes. For high SNRs that are beyond simulation capabilities, we derive the pairwise error probability of the three channels and explore an average upper bound on the bit-error rate over the ensemble of PA codes. We show that AWGN channels, although fundamentally different from chi-square channels, can serve as a reference to approximate the performance of high-rate PA codes...|$|R
