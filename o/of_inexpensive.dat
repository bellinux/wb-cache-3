5|$|Interest in mermaid costuming {{has grown}} {{alongside}} {{the popularity of}} fantasy cosplay {{as well as the}} availability <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive</b> monofins used in the construction of mermaid costumes. These costumes are typically designed to be used while swimming, in an activity known as mermaiding. Mermaid fandom conventions have also been held.|$|E
5|$|In 1709, Abraham Darby I {{established}} a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast iron, replacing charcoal, although continuing to use blast furnaces. The ensuing availability <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive</b> iron {{was one of}} the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. Toward the end of the 18th century, cast iron began to replace wrought iron for certain purposes, because it was cheaper. Carbon content in iron was not implicated as the reason for the differences in properties of wrought iron, cast iron, and steel until the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The Ripper murders mark an {{important}} watershed {{in the treatment}} of crime by journalists. Jack the Ripper was not the first serial killer, but his case was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy. Tax reforms in the 1850s had enabled the publication <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive</b> newspapers with wider circulation. These mushroomed in the later Victorian era to include mass-circulation newspapers as cheap as a halfpenny, along with popular magazines such as The Illustrated Police News which made the Ripper the beneficiary of previously unparalleled publicity.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by heat at high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive</b> diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The Welcome to the Universe Tour was {{a concert}} tour by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars, {{in support of}} their second studio album A Beautiful Lie (2005). Presenting a series <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive</b> concerts for music fans, the concert tour was {{announced}} in August 2006 {{as a part of}} the MTV2 $2Bill tour. The Welcome to the Universe Tour began on October 17, 2006 in Minneapolis, Minnesota and ended on November 25, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. The setlist encompassed songs from their first two studio albums, 30 Seconds to Mars and A Beautiful Lie.|$|E
5|$|This species {{grows in}} at least 2 {{distinct}} sub-populations, {{both of which are}} well protected by Sabah National Parks Authority. One of the populations grows in an area public access to which is strictly prohibited without permit. However, there has been a decline in population of mature individuals in the better known and less patrolled site. This is largely due to damage to habitat and plants by careless visitors rather than organised collection of plants. Nepenthes rajah has become common in cultivation in recent years {{as a result of the}} availability <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive</b> clones from tissue culture. I believe that these days commercial collection of this species from the wild is negligible.|$|E

5|$|To {{varying degrees}} {{throughout}} Roman history, {{the existence of}} a pool <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive</b> labor in the form of slaves was an important factor in the economy. Slaves were acquired for the Roman workforce through a variety of means, including purchase from foreign merchants and the enslavement of foreign populations through military conquest. With Rome's heavy involvement in wars of conquest in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, tens if not hundreds of thousands of slaves at a time were imported into the Roman economy from various European and Mediterranean acquisitions. While there was limited use for slaves as servants, craftsmen, and personal attendants, vast numbers of slaves worked in mines and on the agricultural lands of Sicily and southern Italy.|$|E
5|$|Early synth-pop pioneers {{included}} Japanese group Yellow Magic Orchestra, and British bands Ultravox, the Human League and Berlin Blondes; the Human League used monophonic synthesizers {{to produce}} {{music with a}} simple and austere sound. After the breakthrough of Gary Numan in the UK Singles Chart in 1979, large numbers of artists began to enjoy success with a synthesizer-based sound in the early 1980s, including late-1970s debutants like Japan and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, and newcomers such as Depeche Mode and Eurythmics. In Japan, Yellow Magic Orchestra's success {{opened the way for}} synth-pop bands such as P-Model, Plastics, and Hikashu. The development <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive</b> polyphonic synthesizers, the definition of MIDI and the use of dance beats, led to a more commercial and accessible sound for synth-pop. This, its adoption by the style-conscious acts from the New Romantic movement, together with the rise of MTV, led to success for large numbers of British synth-pop acts (including Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet) in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Following the United States gaining {{independence}} {{after their}} American Revolutionary War, in 1784, about 10,000 United Empire Loyalists settled in Upper Canada (what is now southern Ontario), chiefly in Niagara, around the Bay of Quinte, {{and along the}} St. Lawrence River between Lake Ontario and Montreal. The Crown granted them land in these areas {{in order to develop}} Upper Canada and to compensate them for losses in the United States. With former First Nations lands available for purchase, these new settlers were soon followed by many more Americans, attracted by the availability <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive,</b> arable land. At the same time, large numbers of Iroquois who had been allied with Britain arrived from the United States and were settled on reserves west of Lake Ontario as compensation for lands they lost in what was now the United States.|$|E

5|$|Houston pioneered American car {{culture in}} the early 1900s thanks to the ready {{availability}} <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive</b> gasoline. By the 1920s traffic congestion had become so serious that the city became {{the first in the}} nation to install interconnected traffic lights. Visitors to the city were often astonished at the lack of pedestrian access to shopping venues and the importance of the automobile within the city. Though mass transit had been successful in Houston's earlier years, later efforts aimed at promoting mass transit and urban planning were largely defeated in Houston because of opposition by the public, which favored public investment in roads over mass transit. Urban concepts pioneered in Houston, like establishing shopping centers outside the city's core and encouraging suburban sprawl, became major trends adopted in many cities, both within the state and around the country.|$|E
5|$|The final {{decades of}} this era saw a {{worsening}} economic situation for many Plebeians. The long military campaigns had forced citizens {{to leave their}} farms, which often caused those farms to fall {{into a state of}} disrepair. This situation was made worse during the Second Punic War, when Hannibal fought the Romans throughout Italy, and the Romans adopted a strategy of attrition and guerrilla warfare in response. When the soldiers returned from the battlefield, they often had to sell their farms to pay their debts, and the landed aristocracy quickly bought these farms at discounted prices. The wars had also brought to Rome a great surplus <b>of</b> <b>inexpensive</b> slave labor, which the landed aristocrats used to staff their new farms. Soon the masses of unemployed Plebeians began to flood into Rome, and into the ranks of the legislative assemblies.|$|E
