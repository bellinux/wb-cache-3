50|$|<b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duikers</b> live {{mainly in}} high-altitude rainforests, where they feed mainly on fallen fruit.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus ogilbyi) {{is a small}} {{antelope}} {{found in}} Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, southeastern Nigeria, Bioko Island and possibly Gabon. No subspecies are recognized.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duikers</b> weigh up to 20 kg {{and have}} a {{shoulder}} height of up to 56 cm. They vary in color from chestnut to mahogany to deep brown, and have massive hindquarters typical of duikers.|$|R
50|$|The {{bay duiker}} {{is similar to}} several other duikers. The red duiker can not be readily {{distinguished}} from the bay <b>duiker.</b> Though <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker</b> resembles the bay duiker in size and pelage colour, the ventral side is paler and the dorsal stripe starts from the shoulders instead {{of the back of}} the head. Additionally, the body posture and horn characteristics of the two species differ to a large extent. The bay duiker as well as the <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker</b> are remarkably similar to the black duiker, except for the pelage colouration. The dorsal stripe of Peters's duiker also begins at the shoulders but widens to cover the whole of the rump, as does the fainter stripe on the white-bellied duiker. The bay duiker can be easily told apart from the black-fronted duiker and Weyns's duiker, that lack stripes.|$|R
50|$|The three disputed {{species in}} Cephalophus are Brooke's duiker (C. brookei), Ruwenzori duiker (C. rubidis) and the white-legged duiker (C. crusalbum). Considered to be a {{subspecies}} of <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker</b> (C. nigrifrons), Brooke's duiker was elevated to species status by British ecologist Peter Grubb in 1998. Its {{status as a}} species was further seconded in a 2002 publication by Grubb and colleague Colin Groves. However, zoologists such as Jonathan Kingdon continue to treat it as a subspecies. Ruwenzori duiker is {{generally considered to be}} a subspecies of the black-fronted duiker (C. nigrifrons). However, significant differences from another race of the same species, C. n. kivuensis, with which it is sympatric on the Ruwenzori mountain range, led Kingdon to suggest that it might be a different species altogether. Grubb treated the white-legged duiker as a subspecies of <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker</b> in 1978, but regarded as an independent species by him and Groves after a revision in 2011. This was supported by a 2003 study.|$|R
50|$|The white-legged duiker (Cephalophus crusalbum) is a {{medium-sized}} antelope species from the subfamily of duikers (Cephalophinae) {{within the family}} of bovids (Bovidae). It is native to Gabon and the Republic of the Congo. It was described as subspecies of the <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus ogilbyi) by Peter Grubb in 1978. After a revision of the ungulates in 2011 by Colin Groves, it is now regarded as distinct species.|$|R
50|$|A 2001 phylogenetic study divided Cephalophus {{into three}} {{distinct}} lineages: the giant duikers, east African red duikers and west African red duikers. Abbott's duiker (C. spadix), the bay duiker (C. dorsalis), Jentink's duiker (C. jentinki) and the yellow-backed duiker (C. silvicultor) {{were classified as}} the giant duikers. The east African red duikers include the black-fronted duiker (C. nigrifrons), Harvey's duiker (C. harveyi), red-flanked duiker (C. rufilatus), red forest duiker (C. natalensis), Ruwenzori duiker and white-bellied duiker (C. leucogaster). The third group, the west African red duikers, comprises the black <b>duiker</b> (C. niger), <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker,</b> Peters's duiker (C. callipygus) and Weyns's duiker (C. weynsi). However, the status of two species, Aders' duiker and Zebra duiker, remained dubious.|$|R
50|$|The Guinean moist {{forests are}} much {{affected}} by winds {{from the hot}} dry area {{to the north and}} the cool Atlantic currents. This gives the region a very seasonal climate with over 80 in of rain falling in some areas in the wet season. Over 2000 species of vascular plant have been recorded in the ecoregion, and mammals found here include the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), leopard (Panthera pardus), pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis), <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus ogilbyi), Nimba otter shrew (Micropotamogale lamottei) and the African golden cat (Profelis aurata).|$|R
50|$|Taï National Park, with {{an area of}} 5,400 km, is {{the last}} great forest blocks of primary {{tropical}} forest of West Africa. It is extended to the north by the N'Zo Wildlife reserve. Classified as a Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and as World Heritage Site in 1981 by UNESCO, Taï National Park has {{a high rate of}} endemism at both plants and animals level. More than 200 species of plants in the park are endemic for West Africa as well as important mammals such as pygmy hippopotamus, Jentink and <b>Ogilby</b> <b>duikers,</b> several species of monkeys unique for the region and nearly 24 species of birds. Taï National Park is also home to one of the largest population of chimpanzees, in West Africa (Pan troglodytes verus) famous for their unique behaviour that make them a special population interesting scientifically and valuable for conservation.|$|R
50|$|The Gran Caldera de Luba {{has much}} the highest density of fauna {{on the island}} due to its inaccessibility to hunters, who must walk for two days to reach the crater.A 2001 report said that 120 species of birds had been {{identified}} so far, including 36 that are endemic races on Bioko. Fernando Po batis is an endemic species found only in the lowland forest. Larger hunted species such as black-casqued wattled hornbill and hadada ibis are only found {{in this part of}} Bioko.The reserve is home to <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker,</b> whose long-term survival may depend on enforcement of protection in the Gran Caldera de Luba reserve.Endangered green sea turtles lay their eggs in nests on the beaches.Other threatened turtle species that nest on the beaches are the hawksbill sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle and leatherback sea turtle.|$|R
50|$|Also found are two bats, Buettikofer's epauletted {{fruit bat}} (Epomops buettikoferi) and Aellen's roundleaf bat (Hipposideros marisae), Pel's flying {{squirrel}} (Anomalurus peli), giant pangolin (Manis gigantea), tree pangolin (Manis tricuspis) and long-tailed pangolin (Manis tetradactyla), Liberian mongoose (Liberiictus kuhni), African golden cat (Profelis aurata), leopard (Panthera pardus), African forest elephant (Loxodonta africana cyclotis), which in 2001 numbered only about 100 {{individuals in the}} south of the park compared to some 1,800 in 1979, red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), giant forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni ivoriensis), dwarf or pygmy hippopotamus (Hexaprotodon liberiensis) numbered at around 500 in 1996 {{is one of the few}} viable populations remaining, water chevrotain (Hyemoschus aquaticus), bongo (Tragelaphus euryceros), African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus) and an exceptional variety of forest duikers including Jentink's duiker (Cephalophus jentinki), banded or zebra duiker (Cephalophus zebra), Maxwell's <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus maxwelii), <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker</b> (Cephalophus ogilbyi), black duiker (Cephalophus niger), bay duiker (Cephalophus dorsalis), yellow-backed duiker (Cephalophus sylvicultor) and the royal antelope (Neotragus pygmaeus). Forest rodents include the rusty-bellied brush-furred rat (Lophuromys sikapusi), the Edward's swamp rat (Malacomys edwardsi) and the woodland dormouse (Graphiurus murinus). Also recorded in the park is Stochomys defua, which is characteristic of secondary forest.|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{from the}} National University of Equatorial Guinea (UNGE) and Arcadia University have alerted the {{international}} conservation {{community to the}} threat of imminent extinction of the seven primate sub-species on the island of Bioko, Equatorial Guinea. These seven species include the drill, red colobus, black colobus, Preuss' guenon, crowned guenon, russeteared guenon and putty-nosed guenon. Similarly, researchers have pointed out the possibility of shortterm disappearance of the island's other large-bodied game animal, <b>Ogilby's</b> <b>duiker.</b> In October 2002, Conservation Strategy Fund joined UNGE,Arcadia University and Conservation International to analyze the economics of wild meat on Bioko and determine what market and/or policy interventions would have the best chance of saving endangered wildlife on this island. The CSF/Arcadia/UNGE/CI team relied on extensive data and local knowledge on bushmeat gathered by Arcadia and UNGE over the last five years, as well as a new survey of the island's hunters. New information was collected in all of the island's hunting camps. The study discovered that the economic importance of monkey hunting was very limited. Around 20 percent of hunting income for around 120 families was derived from the endangered primates. That means that the cost of providing alternative income opportunities would be extremely low, 41, 400 per year to ensure survival of all seven species. In 2007, Equatorial Guinea's president, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, banned monkey hunting, one of the study's lead recommendation...|$|R
