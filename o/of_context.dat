5|$|As {{with most}} undeciphered scripts, {{there are many}} fanciful interpretations and claimed {{translations}} of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which {{has been shown to}} have to do with a lunar Rapa Nui calendar, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: the small number of remaining texts, the lack <b>of</b> <b>context</b> such as illustrations in which to interpret them, and the poor attestation of the Old Rapanui language, since modern Rapanui is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.|$|E
5|$|The only extant {{pieces of}} the Consolatio are fragments, of which seven were {{preserved}} by the early Christian author Lactantius in his work Divinarum Institutionum (The Divine Institutes). In the work, Lactantius used the excerpt from the Consolatio both {{to point out the}} futility of paganism, as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of Christianity, without them even realizing it. Lactantius criticized what Cicero wrote, but also applauded Cicero for paralleling—albeit coincidentally—what the Bible says at times. However, the quotes preserved by Lactantius have been criticized due to their lack <b>of</b> <b>context.</b> MacKendrick notes that Lactantius was using partial quotations in order to frame what Cicero wrote so that Lactantius could more easily refute his ideas. Other excerpts from the Consolatio were preserved by Cicero himself, of which two sections were quoted by him in his Tusculanae Disputationes.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} attempts to decipher the rongorongo script of Easter Island since its discovery {{in the late nineteenth}} century. As with most undeciphered scripts, many of the proposals have been fanciful. Apart from a portion of one tablet which has been shown to deal with a lunar calendar, none of the texts are understood, and even the calendar cannot actually be read. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment: the small number of remaining texts, comprising only 15,000 legible glyphs; the lack <b>of</b> <b>context</b> in which to interpret the texts, such as illustrations or parallels to texts which can be read; {{and the fact that the}} modern Rapanui language is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets—especially if they record a specialized register such as incantations—while the few remaining examples of the old language are heavily restricted in genre and may not correspond well to the tablets either.|$|E
5|$|To {{accomplish}} just-in-time weaving, {{a change}} to the virtual machine that executes the compiled bytecode is necessary. A proposed solution for AspectJ uses a layered approach which builds upon the existing Java Virtual Machine to add support for join point management and callbacks to a Dynamic Aspect-Oriented Programming Engine. An alternative implementation uses a weaving engine that uses breakpoints to halt execution at the pointcut, select an appropriate method, embed it into the application, and continue. The use of breakpoints in this manner {{has been shown to}} reduce performance due to a very large number <b>of</b> <b>context</b> switches.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} at modeling context in robots. However, either these attempts assume a fixed number <b>of</b> <b>contexts</b> or use a rule-based approach to determine when to increment the number <b>of</b> <b>contexts.</b> In this paper, we propose to pose the task of incrementing as a learning problem, which we solve using a Recurrent Neural Network. We show that the network successfully (with 98 % testing accuracy) learns to predict when to increment, and demonstrate, in a scene modeling problem (where the correct number <b>of</b> <b>contexts</b> is not known), that the robot increments the number <b>of</b> <b>contexts</b> in an expected manner (i. e., the entropy {{of the system is}} reduced). We also present how the incremental model can be used for various scene reasoning tasks. Comment: The first two authors have contributed equally, 6 pages, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 201...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} now {{on-going}} discussions, not to say endless discussions, about the intrinsic definition <b>of</b> <b>contexts</b> {{have been at the}} center stage of every single meeting of the conceptual graph community. It is our opinion that this lack <b>of</b> consensus about <b>contexts</b> is in direct relation to its lack of a formal definition. As a matter of fact, no formal definition <b>of</b> <b>contexts</b> was given up to this moment, not even in John Sowa's original book. Being a vital issue in conceptual graph theory, this paper addresses the problem of providing formal semantics to the definition <b>of</b> <b>contexts,</b> when used for information packaging. It proposes a definitional framework for contexts, based on formal concept analysis [17], bridging these two research areas. It also presents how querying a knowledge base structured as a lattice <b>of</b> <b>contexts</b> can be done.

30|$|Schlenker (2004) uses FID as {{the basis}} for proposing a {{distinction}} between two types <b>of</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>of</b> evaluation, <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought and <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance, and two corresponding types of indexicality: (a) ‘Referential’ indexicals and demonstratives, which receive their denotation from the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought; (b) pronouns and tenses, which depend on the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance. Schlenker further suggests {{that there may be a}} principled reason for the proposed distinction. The meaning of ‘referential’ indexicals and demonstratives is lexically specified and depends on the intentions of the speaker/thinker; such expressions are hence evaluated relatively to the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> thought. On the other hand, pronouns and tenses are assumed to be variables whose domain of reference is restricted by grammatical features, such as gender, person, and tense; such features “serve as a system of classification whose referential domain is the utterance itself” (Schlenker 2004, p. 280); hence, their dependency on the <b>context</b> <b>of</b> utterance.|$|R
