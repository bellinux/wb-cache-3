50|$|The Flaris LAR01 {{project was}} started by Sylwia and Rafał Ładzińscy with the {{assistance}} of the Instytut Lotnictwa, Instytut Techniczny Wojsk Lotniczych, Politechnika Warszawska, Politechnika Wrocławska and Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna. According to Ładziński, the aircraft had emerged from an ambition to produce an affordable aircraft that would be well-suited to short-haul point-to-point routes and operated by a variety of commercial, corporate, and private owners that sought to progress from <b>operating</b> <b>piston</b> engine and turboprop-powered aircraft. Rafał Ładziński, who had co-originated the aircraft's design with Sylwia Ładziński, serves as the head of the FLARIS project and the chief of Research and Development. The chief designer is Andrzej Frydrychewicz. Significant work on the aircraft's aerodynamics was perofrmed by Krzysztof Kubryński.|$|E
5000|$|The {{town has}} a small airport , used only by light aircraft, but until the 1970s when they stopped <b>operating</b> <b>piston</b> engined airliners such as the Douglas DC-3, it was a {{refueling}} stop for South African Airways between Cape Town and destinations to the north.By 1931, the Victoria West Airport was already established and was used by Imperial Airways as a stop over to Cape Town. This lead to {{the first of three}} of the modern Air Control Towers, being built here; the other two was built in George and Cape Town. Shortly afterwards, a waiting room was built for passengers, and a new building was built in 1953. The are no longer large planes that land here, but small and private planes are still used. In February 1985, the agreement of 66 years between Victoria West and the Shell Oil Company to supply avgas came to an end.|$|E

50|$|In 1989 sixty wagons of {{the class}} were {{modified}} at Ballarat North Workshops; they were fitted with air <b>operated</b> <b>pistons</b> to <b>operate</b> the sliding discharge doors {{at the bottom of}} the hopper; and flow plates were fitted to the inside sloped walls to allow aerating of the cement powder to facilitate better discharge.|$|R
50|$|The Han Dynasty Chinese {{mechanical}} engineer Du Shi (d. 38) {{is credited with}} being the first to apply hydraulic power, through a waterwheel, to operate bellows in metallurgy. His invention was used to <b>operate</b> <b>piston</b> bellows of blast furnaces in order to forge cast iron. The ancient Greeks, ancient Romans, and other civilizations used bellows in bloomery furnaces producing wrought iron. Bellows are also used to send pressurized air {{in a controlled manner}} in a fired heater.|$|R
50|$|The PUMPMAN series pumps {{invented in}} INDIA in 2015-16 are however {{completely}} different from the presently available hydraulically <b>operated</b> <b>piston</b> pumps. The PUMPMAN series Pumps have been recently invented which do not use a hydraulic pump and complex hydraulic circuits for their operation. However they use a very simple mechanism which multiplies the reciprocating force several times without using a hydraulic system. These Pumps are protected under multiple patent applications, {{some of them are}} already published by the Indian Patent office. They have been invented by Amit & Anand Gokhale.|$|R

50|$|Air <b>operated</b> <b>piston</b> type supply pumps can put {{out as much}} as 27 gpm. Like the Graco Bulldog 10:1 {{at about}} 9 gpm and the Lincoln Pile driver 5:1 at about 27 gpm. These flow-rates are {{calculated}} at a maximum of 120 cfm air supply. Material supply hoses are medium pressure at about 600 psi. These pumps are material supply pumps only and additional air is required at the spray gun to propel the material to the surface. These guns are usually an internal mixture type guns where the material and air exits the gun together.|$|R

50|$|In a gas-operated mechanism, {{a portion}} of the gases {{propelling}} the bullet from the barrel are extracted and used to <b>operate</b> a <b>piston.</b> The motion of this piston in turn unlocks and operates the bolt, which performs extraction of the spent cartridge and via spring action readies the next round. Almost all modern military rifles use mechanisms of this type.|$|R
25|$|The G36 uses a short-stroke piston {{system from}} which HK later {{developed}} the HK-416's impingement system. Unlike direct impingement, this system takes gas trailing the bullet to <b>operate</b> a <b>piston</b> instead of pushing {{directly on the}} bolt. The G36's bolt is operated by a cam that guides the bolt carrier by its respective cutout. Then when fully pushed forward 7 radial locking lugs fully enclose the chamber.|$|R

50|$|A liquid {{nitrogen}} vehicle {{is powered by}} {{liquid nitrogen}}, which is stored in a tank. Traditional nitrogen engine designs work by heating the liquid nitrogen in a heat exchanger, extracting heat from the ambient air and using the resulting pressurized gas to <b>operate</b> a <b>piston</b> or rotary motor. Vehicles propelled by liquid nitrogen have been demonstrated, but are not used commercially. One such vehicle, Liquid Air was demonstrated in 1902.|$|R
40|$|Micro Mirror Arrays (MMAs) are {{proposed}} as an applicable technology for adaptive optics applications, allowing correction of distorted wavefronts, for example coming from non-perfect optical systems. This paper details current work, {{being carried out}} for ESA, to investigate {{the use of such}} MMAs by testing them in a breadboard. Two MMA actuator types are under examination; binary operated tilt mirrors and analogue <b>operated</b> <b>piston</b> mirrors. A deformable membrane mirror will simulate continuous wavefront distortions, such as those that could be expected off a typical 3 m class, lightweight, primary mirror of a space telescope. Step functions will also be introduced, as could be expected from a segmented mirror. The amount of correction that the two types of MMA can provide to reduce the aberrations will be examined. The breadboard will incorporate components to test different methods for measuring the wavefront error and feeding back to control the MMA. Coupling of the free space beam into a mono-mode optical fibre will be demonstrated and will allow comparison of the results for different MMA types and wavefront error detection and control regimes...|$|R

5000|$|PenAir {{was among}} the very last {{airlines}} {{in the world to}} operate the venerable Grumman G-21A Goose seaplane on scheduled flights. This piston powered amphibious aircraft was used to resupply remote coastal locations where no land-based airstrip existed. On December 21, 2012, the last Grumman Goose made its last flight from Unalaska to Anchorage and was officially retired from the fleet. [...] PenAir also previously <b>operated</b> another <b>piston</b> powered amphibious aircraft type being the Grumman G-44 Widgeon.|$|R
50|$|The {{electro-pneumatic}} {{action is}} a control system for pipe organs, whereby air pressure, controlled by an electric current and operated by the keys of an organ console, opens and closes valves within wind chests, allowing the pipes to speak. This system also allows the console to be physically detached from the organ itself. The only connection was via an electrical cable from the console to the relay, with some early organ consoles utilizing a separate wind supply to <b>operate</b> combination <b>pistons.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{airport is}} mainly {{operated}} by general aviation aircraft, Flight Training Organizations and flying clubs. Due to the runway length and surrounding buildings {{it is only}} possible to <b>operate</b> helicopters, <b>piston</b> engine aircraft, medium size turbo-props and small business jets. Also, {{due to the lack}} of IFR facilities, but an old NDB (CVT), it is only possible to operate VFR flights. Nevertheless, it is the headquarters airport of several FTOs, including some of the major Spanish ones as Gestair Flying Academy, Aerotec, Aerofan and others.|$|R
40|$|For delivery, dosing and {{pressure}} control of fluids in mobile and stationary applications electromagnetically <b>operated</b> <b>piston</b> pumps are an established solution. The volume per stroke is exactly {{defined by the}} geometry. Nevertheless cavitation, more likely with the new fuel blends containing {{a high proportion of}} ethanol / 1 /, deteriorates the dosing precision of the liquid portion. One important criterion of precise metering is the transport of the liquids through the reciprocating piston pump without transferring bubbles. Especially, pumping in the range of vapour pressure of gasoline fuels implies challenges for precision. The objective of this work is revealing potential sources of reduced cavitation by optimising the design. For doing so, optical investigations have been applied. In addition to this, cavitation can be diminished controlling the piston’s travel externally. The second important item covers pumping of degenerated fluids even without negative effects on the pump’s performance. Up to now, wide, inefficient gaps or high force surplus are necessary. A new helix-design / 2 / has been investigated and built up {{in order to reduce the}} described effort. The effects coming with the helix allow a permanent rinsing of the stressed surfaces, leading to lubrication and lower temperature loads. The results are shown in simulation, fundamental tests and is validated in practical pump operation...|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "split cycle engine" [...] {{invented by}} New Zealander, Rick Mayne that used a {{multitude}} of small cylinders arranged in a radial arrangement with <b>pistons</b> <b>operated</b> by a Geneva mechanism. This engine was never successfully run in a meaningful demonstration, but significant capital was raised through a share plan.|$|R
5000|$|The Quadrajet is a [...] "spread bore" [...] carburetor; {{the primary}} {{venturis}} are {{much smaller than}} the secondary venturis. By comparison, a [...] "square bore" [...] carburetor has primary and secondary venturis of similar size. Most Quadrajets were capable of 750 ft3 L/min (cfm) maximum, but some rare Buick and Pontiac models were capable of 800 ft3 L/min for use on high performance engines, and most 1984-1987 pickup trucks were also equipped with the 800-cfm carb. Most Quadrajets use a vacuum <b>operated</b> <b>piston</b> to move the primary metering rods to control the air-fuel ratio, allowing the mixture to be lean under low load conditions and rich during high load conditions. A less-common version uses a linkage driven off the primary throttle shaft to mechanically move the power piston. [...] "E" [...] (electronic control module controlled) series of Quadrajets use a computer controlled mixture control solenoid that responds to electronic signals from the throttle position and oxygen sensors via the computer, ideal for precise fuel metering and allowing additional fuel under load. The solenoid-controlled metering rods allow the fuel mixture to be very close to optimum, then the solenoid is pulse width modulated at about 6 Hz to fine-tune the air fuel ratio under closed loop conditions. The electronic versions have a throttle position sensor that is mounted inside the carburetor body, actuated by the accelerator pump lever.|$|R
5000|$|Variable-Venturi: {{in which}} the fuel jet opening is varied by the slide (which {{simultaneously}} alters air flow). In [...] "constant depression" [...] carburetors, this is done by a vacuum <b>operated</b> <b>piston</b> connected to a tapered needle which slides inside the fuel jet. A simpler version exists, most commonly found on small motorcycles and dirt bikes, where the slide and needle is directly controlled by the throttle position. The most common variable Venturi (constant depression) type carburetor is the sidedraft SU carburetor and similar models from Hitachi, Zenith-Stromberg and other makers. The UK location of the SU and Zenith-Stromberg companies helped these carburetors rise {{to a position of}} domination in the UK car market, though such carburetors were also very widely used on Volvos and other non-UK makes. Other similar designs have been used on some European and a few Japanese automobiles. These carburetors are also referred to as [...] "constant velocity" [...] or [...] "constant vacuum" [...] carburetors. An interesting variation was Ford's VV (Variable Venturi) carburetor, which was essentially a fixed Venturi carburetor with one side of the Venturi hinged and movable to give a narrow throat at low rpm and a wider throat at high rpm. This was designed to provide good mixing and airflow over a range of engine speeds, though the VV carburetor proved problematic in service.|$|R
50|$|An {{array of}} {{firearms}} accessory makers have offered gas piston conversion kits for the M4. The claimed benefits include less needed lubrication for the bolt carrier group to run reliably and reduced fouling. The argument against it is increased weight and reduced accuracy.

5000|$|One {{exception}} {{to the use of}} a special lightweight bolt was the Colt Service Ace, offered as a complete pistol or as a conversion kit for the M1911. While still nominally a blowback conversion, the Service Ace used a special [...] "floating" [...] chamber in the barrel that acted like a gas <b>operated</b> firearm's <b>piston,</b> helping push the bolt back with more force than a typical [...]22 Long Rifle blowback action. This additional force allowed the small [...]22 Long Rifle cartridge to cycle a standard weight slide, which made the pistol handle more like the standard [...]45 ACP version.|$|R
