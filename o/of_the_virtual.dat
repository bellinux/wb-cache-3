Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock has a cast of thirteen characters, which the player can further customize with alternate guitar skins and stage outfits using in-game money earned from successful performances. The player can access the game's three boss characters—Tom Morello, Slash, and Lou the Devil—as playable characters once they have completed their respective Boss Battles in Career mode. Although Bret Michaels appears in the game and sings specific songs, he is not a playable character in the game.|$|E
5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session on Friday was held {{before the two}} races. The session was held on a dirty track with lap times gradually improving over the 45-minute period when the cars cleaned the circuit. Nato set the fastest lap {{with a time of}} 1:55.392, ahead of Giovinazzi in second and Sirotkin third. Gasly was fourth-fastest; Rowland was fifth and Luca Ghiotto sixth. King, Arthur Pic, Marciello, and Sergio Canamasas rounded out the session's top-ten drivers. The session was disrupted when King went onto the turn 15 run-off area and was required to swerve to avoid hitting a van parked at the corner. It prompted the activation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virtual</b> safety car (VSC) to allow the vehicle to be moved. Two further VSC periods were necessitated late in the session when Marciello and Gustav Malja slid off the track at the same corner, ending their sessions prematurely.|$|E

5|$|By 1960, Quwatli had quarreled with Nasser {{and criticized}} his {{policies}} in Syria. In particular, he condemned {{the institution of}} land distribution and industrial nationalization in July 1961, stating it would harm the economy severely. He was also personally affronted that his son-in-law Fayez al-Ujl had much of his property seized by the government {{as part of the}} socialist measures. Resentment towards the union across the spectrum of Syria's political class, social elite and officer corps was on the rise, with these key groups chafing at the centralization of authority into Nasser's hands, domination by a vastly larger Egypt at the political, social and economic levels and the sidelining of these groups in the governance of Syria. The Syrian public also grew wary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virtual</b> police state set up in the country by Sarraj. A coup by secessionist officers was undertaken in Syria on 28 September, effectively breaking up the UAR. Quwatli lent his support toward the coup, aligning himself with the secessionist officers.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Kinect was {{released}} by Microsoft as a 3D scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection of Xbox 360 players and hands-free control of the user interfaces of video games and other software on the console. This was later modified by Oliver Kreylos of University of California, Davis {{in a series of}} YouTube videos which showed him combining the Kinect with a PC-based virtual camera. Because the Kinect is capable of detecting a full range of depth (through computer stereo vision and Structured light) within a captured scene, Kreylos demonstrated the capacity of the Kinect and the virtual camera to allow free-viewpoint navigation of the range of depth, although the camera could only allow a video capture of the scene as shown {{to the front of the}} Kinect, resulting in fields of black, empty space where the camera was unable to capture video within the field of depth. Later, Kreylos demonstrated a further elaboration on the modification by combining the video streams of two Kinects in order to further enhance the video capture within the view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virtual</b> camera. Kreylos' developments using the Kinect were covered among the works of others in the Kinect hacking and homebrew community in a New York Times article.|$|E

5|$|Rossi held a one-second {{lead over}} Vandoorne who pushed {{hard to keep}} him within {{distance}} of Rossi. Evans attempted to overtake Yelloly leaving the tunnel at the chicane but Yellowly steered into Evans, who was forced to retire from the event on lap 18. The incident necessitated the activation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>virtual</b> safety car (VSC) to allow track officials to clean the circuit. Rossi and Vandoorne elected to make pit stops for super soft tyres during the VSC with Vandoorne emerging in the lead. Leal moved into third despite making contact with Sirotkin. At the race's restart, Vandoorne extended his advantage over Rossi by 3.4 seconds {{in the course of}} one lap. This was the case until Rossi drove two seconds faster on the following lap and was half a second behind Vandoorne by the 23rd lap. Yelloly set the feature race's fastest time on the same lap, completing a circuit in one minute and 22.314 seconds. Vandoorne's and Rossi's releases from their pit stall were investigated by the stewards but chose not to take any further action. A brief second VSC period was deployed when debris was located in the run up to Rascasse corner. Canamasas overtook Pic at Sainte Dévote to move into fourth {{at the beginning of the}} 28th lap.|$|E
