5|$|Roark's modernist {{approach}} to architecture is contrasted {{with that of}} most of the other architects in the novel. In the opening chapter, the dean of his architecture school tells Roark that the best architecture must copy the past rather than innovate or improve. Roark repeatedly loses jobs with architectural firms and commissions from clients because he is unwilling to copy conventional architectural styles. In contrast, Keating's mimicry of convention brings him top honors in school and an immediate job <b>offer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>same</b> conflict between innovation and tradition is reflected in the career of Roark's mentor, Henry Cameron.|$|E
5|$|After {{overseeing}} {{the transfer of}} Richmond, Breckinridge joined Lee's forces at Farmville, Virginia, {{on the night of}} April 5 and remained there until April 7. He continued on to Danville, arriving on April 11 to discover that Lee had surrendered on April 9 and the Confederate cabinet had already fled to Greensboro, North Carolina. Arriving in Greensboro on April 13, he advised the cabinet that the remaining Confederate armies should be surrendered; only Davis and Secretary of State Judah P. Benjamin disagreed. At Bennett Place, he assisted Joseph E. Johnston in his surrender negotiations with Major General William Tecumseh Sherman. Sherman later praised Breckinridge's negotiating skills, and the surrender terms agreed to were later rejected by Washington as too generous, forcing Sherman to <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> terms as Grant had at Appomattox, which were accepted.|$|E

5|$|The UK {{government}} established several {{incentives for}} E85 flex-fuel vehicles.

In 2005 the Ford Focus Flexi-Fuel became the first flexible-fuel car sold in the UK, though E85 pumps were not opened until 2006. Volvo now offers its flexifuel models S80, S40, C30, V50 and V70. Other models available in the UK are the Ford C-Max Flexi-Fuel, and the Saab models 9-5 and 9-3 Flex-Fuel Biopower, and the new Saab Aero X BioPower E100 bioethanol.|$|E

25|$|Ersatzschulen are {{ordinary}} {{primary or}} secondary schools which {{are run by}} private individuals, private organizations or religious groups. These schools <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> types of diplomas as in public schools. However, Ersatzschulen, like their state-run counterparts, are subjected to basic government standards, such as the minimum required qualifications of teachers and pay grades. An Ersatzschule must have at least the same academic standards as those of a state school and Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz, allows to forbid the segregation of pupils according to socioeconomic status (the so-called Sonderungsverbot). Therefore, most Ersatzschulen have very low tuition fees compared to those in most other Western European countries; scholarships are also often available. However, {{it is not possible}} to finance these schools with such low tuition fees: accordingly all German Ersatzschulen are subsidised with public funds.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, speech-language {{pathology}} is a Master's entry-level professional degree field. Clinicians {{must hold}} a master's degree in Communicative Disorders/Speech-Language Pathology (e.g. M.A., M.S., or M.Ed.) that {{is from a}} university that holds regional accreditation and from a communicative sciences and disorders program that is accredited by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA), the profession's national governing body {{as well as individual}} state's governing board. Programs that offer the M.Ed. degree are often housed within a university's College of education, but <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> education and training as programs with a M.A. or M.S. degree. Beyond the master's degree, some SLPs may choose to earn a clinical doctorate in Speech-Language Pathology (e.g. CScD or SLPD), or a doctoral degree that has a research and/or professional focus (e.g., Ph.D., or Ed.D.). All degrees must be from a university that holds regional accreditation, but only the master's degree is accredited by the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA).|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{possible}} explanations for why newcomers earn less than native Canadians in the same jobs with the same skills. Lower hourly wages might be an indication that the labour productivity of immigrants is lower, and employers thus have reason to pay them less. New workers are also less familiar with the Canadian labour market and will thus not be able to maximize their salaries. Employers will also be less familiar with an immigrant's background and thus less willing to <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> salary as to a native. Immigrants, especially visible minorities have different values than native-born Canadians as they tend to favour living in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver as opposed to other places much more than native-born Canadians. Due to lower mobility, they do not access better paying jobs, such as in Alberta and Saskatchewan. This has been changing with Calgary already surpassing Montreal in terms of percentage of visible minorities. Visible minorities in Saskatchewan earn higher wages than native-born Canadians.|$|E

500|$|Ethologists {{expressed}} concern about the adequacy of some research on which attachment theory was based, particularly the generalization to humans from animal studies. Schur, discussing Bowlby's use of ethological concepts (pre-1960) commented that concepts used in attachment theory had not kept up with changes in ethology itself. Ethologists and others writing in the 1960s and 1970s questioned and expanded the types of behaviour used as indications of attachment. Observational studies of young children in natural settings provided other behaviours that might indicate attachment; for example, staying within a predictable distance of the mother without effort on her part and picking up small objects, bringing them to the mother but not to others. Although ethologists tended to be in agreement with Bowlby, they pressed for more data, objecting to psychologists writing as if there were an [...] "entity which is 'attachment', existing over and above the observable measures." [...] Robert Hinde considered [...] "attachment behaviour system" [...] to be an appropriate term which did not <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> problems [...] "because it refers to postulated control systems that determine the relations between different kinds of behaviour." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the release}} ranged from mixed to positive. Monica S.

She went on to name the [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"Amor Fati" [...] arc the [...] "best" [...] of the set. Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk, was more critical, however. He wrote that, although the story was [...] "interesting, intriguing, and entertaining", the selection of episodes [...] "does not <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> level of excitement" [...] {{when compared to the}} previous two volumes. He concluded by commenting that there is [...] "enough entertainment value for you to enjoy". Keith Uhlich from Slant Magazine awarded the box set three-and-a-half stars out of five. He commented on the conclusion of many of the show's long-running arcs, and noted that Mulder was often only a witness to these events, such as the destruction of the Syndicate and the death of his sister. Of the latter, Uhlich wrote that he [...] "waver back and forth on how emotionally effective it is". He did, however, award the image quality of the DVDs four stars out of five and refer to their presentation as [...] "excellent".|$|E

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{gave the}} soundtrack {{three out of}} five stars, commenting that [...] "some {{of this stuff is}} quite good". Slant Magazine's Eric Henderson {{provided}} a mixed review, writing that the soundtrack [...] "seems to indicate her efforts are coming from a similarly era-straddling psychological place". Jim Farber from New York Daily News criticized Aguilera for her [...] "vocals <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> distracting loop-de-loops and showy tics", but complimented Cher that she [...] "balances both aspects ideally". A reviewer from Blogcritics labelled the album a [...] "grab bag of tracks that don't really add up to cohesive album". Leah Greanblatt from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B" [...] score, naming it a [...] "shamelessly diva-fied mix of balladry, Broadway cabaret, and backroom boogie-woogie" [...] and complimented on its musical departure from Aguilera's previous studio album Bionic. In a positive review, Billboard editor Kerri Mason praised Burlesque as [...] "a campy celebration of diva-dom and an over-the-top, triple-threat performance". James Wigney of The Advertiser praised Aguilera's [...] "vocal gymnastics", but was mixed towards Cher's numbers on the soundtrack. Maura Johnston from The Village Voice named [...] "The Beautiful People (from Burlesque)" [...] as the thirteenth worst song of 2010, calling it [...] "an interesting failure." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{basis of}} the discussions between Venezuela and the United Kingdom lay in Britain's {{advocacy}} of a particular division of the territory deriving from a mid-nineteenth-century survey it commissioned. This survey originated with German naturalist Robert Schomburgk's four-year expedition for the Royal Geographical Society in 1835 to 1839, {{which resulted in a}} sketch of the territory with a line marking what he believed to be the western boundary claimed by the Dutch. As a result of this he was commissioned by the British government to carry out a survey of Guiana's boundaries. The result was the [...] "Schomburgk Line", which he established partly following natural divisions and partly to distinguish territory of Spanish or Venezuelan occupation from that which had been occupied by the Dutch. The Line went well beyond the area of British occupation, and gave British Guiana control of the mouth of the Orinoco River. In 1844 Venezuela declared the Essequibo River the dividing line; a British <b>offer</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> year, to make major alterations to the Line and cede the mouth of the Orinoco and much associated territory, was ignored. No treaty between Britain and Venezuela was reached, and after an 1850 agreement not to encroach on disputed territory, the matter largely rested until 1876, when diplomatic exchanges resumed. Schomburgk's initial sketch, which had been published in 1840, was the only version of the [...] "Schomburgk Line" [...] published until 1886. This led to accusations by US President Grover Cleveland that the line had been extended [...] "in some mysterious way".|$|E
