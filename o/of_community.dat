40|$|Despite {{increased}} academic {{focus on}} knowledge management, {{the creation and}} management of knowledge within organisations has received limited attention. Whilst a considerable body of international literature exists on the role <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice in managing knowledge in organisations, the South African literature is largely silent on <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice {{as a means of}} managing knowledge and thus represents a gap for further research. The objective of the research is to assess which critical success factors identified in the academic literature are rated as being most relevant to members <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice in a single organisational context, being Multichoice. Further, the research assesses whether critical success factors vary by type and life cycle phase <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice at Multichoice. A deductive, quantitative approach within the positivist paradigm is employed. Specifically, the descriptive survey questionnaire approach is adopted. The research reveals a strong resemblance between the critical success factors identified in the literature and those rated by members <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice at Multichoice. In addition, the research demonstrates that critical success factors vary – albeit marginally - with both the type, and stage in the life cycle, <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice at Multichoice. All the factors identified, with the exception of two factors, are rated as `critical’ to the success <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice at Multichoice.

30|$|One {{potential}} confounder in {{this latter}} analysis {{is that the}} number <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> detected varies for each network type. The median number <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> for fixed-threshold networks is 10 (range 4 – 20), for adaptive-threshold networks 9 (range 3 – 20), and for episode-based networks 14 (range 7 – 21). The larger number <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> in episode-based networks could potentially inflate the observed entropy values because there are more communities in which to be assigned. To investigate this, we regressed normalized entropy against the number <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> for each <b>of</b> the three network types using linear models, resulting in three separate models. We estimated the value of entropy by setting the predictor, the number <b>of</b> <b>communities,</b> to the mean number <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> observed in the adaptive-threshold networks (9.7), which resulted in entropy values of 0.12 (95 % CI: 0.10 – 0.14) for fixed-threshold networks, 0.12 (CI: 0.10 – 0.14) for adaptive-threshold networks, and 0.17 (CI: 0.14 – 0.20) for episode-based networks. We also estimated these numbers at the mean number <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> observed in the episode-based networks (13.7), which resulted in entropy values of 0.15 (95 % CI: 0.13 – 0.18) for fixed-threshold networks, 0.15 (CI: 0.11 – 0.18) for adaptive-threshold networks, and 0.19 (CI: 0.17 – 0.21) for episode-based networks. Therefore, the episode-based approach results in greater values for entropy whether we compute the expected entropy at the mean number <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> in the adaptive-threshold networks or at the mean number <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> in the episode-based networks. This suggests that increased entropy is a characteristic of networks constructed using only patient-physician encounters within shared episodes of care.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationships}} between a multidimensional model <b>of</b> school <b>community</b> and civic engagement were examined using survey data collected for the 1999 IEA Civic Education Study from large, nationally representative samples of adolescents in Australia and the United States. This study extends previous research {{by considering the}} extent to which multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice influence the development of various civic capacities, and by utilizing multilevel regression techniques. The investigation also examined {{the extent to which}} the various dimensions <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice are related to more equitable civic outcomes, and how these associations vary in Australia compared to the United States. All schools have some form of social and cultural context that influences learning. This study examined the influence of three specific dimensions <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice in school, the discourse community, the collaborative community, and the participatory community on three capacities for civic engagement (civic knowledge, norms of democracy, and expectations for informed voting). Other measures of school structure, including individual socioeconomic background and school size and composition were also used in the analyses. The results of the analyses suggest that important, yet subtle, distinctions exist between the association of the various dimensions <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice and civic capacities in Australia and the United States. The findings from the fully conditional models, for example, indicate that both student level and school level perceptions <b>of</b> the <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice can help to shape adolescent civic capacities, although the patterns of relationships vary by dimension <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice and measure of civic engagement. This study offers support for the role <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice in the development of student civic outcomes. Individual student participation in and supportive school contexts for positive <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice influences the development of adolescent civic engagement. Learning more about <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice and its influence on a broader range of civic capacities, especially in terms of the quality and the extent that <b>communities</b> <b>of</b> practice exist in schools, will help educators and schools to strengthen these connections...|$|R
