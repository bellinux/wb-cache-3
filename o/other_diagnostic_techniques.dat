50|$|Rather, it is {{typically}} used {{in concert with}} <b>other</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques.</b> In general, the clinical reasons for a CMR examination fall into {{one or more of}} the following categories: 1) when echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound) cannot provide sufficient diagnostic information, 2) as an alternative to diagnostic cardiac catheterization which involve risks including x-ray radiation exposure, 3) to obtain diagnostic information for which CMR offers unique advantages such as blood flow measurement or identification of cardiac masses, and 4) when clinical assessment and other diagnostic tests are inconsistent. Examples of conditions in which CMR is often used include tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of the great arteries, coarctation of the aorta, single ventricle heart disease, abnormalities of the pulmonary veins, atrial septal defect, connective tissue diseases such as Marfan syndrome, vascular rings, abnormal origins of the coronary arteries, and cardiac tumors.|$|E

40|$|A MATLAB {{code for}} calculating neutron energy spectra from JET {{discharges}} was developed. The code uses the fuel ion distribution calculated {{by the computer}} code SELFO to generate the spectrum through a Monte-Carlo simulation. The calculated spectra were then compared against experimental results from the neutron spectrometer TOFOR. In the calculations, the exact orbits of the fuel ions are taken into account, in order to investigate what effects this has on the spectrum. The reason for this is that, for certain plasma heating scenarios, large populations of fast fuel ions are formed. These fast ions may have Larmor radii of the order of decimeters, which {{is comparable to the}} width of the sight line of TOFOR, and may therefore affect the recorded neutron spectrum. A JET discharge with both NBI and  3 rd harmonic ICRF heating was analyzed. The results show that the details of the line of sight of the detector indeed affects the neutron spectrum. This effect is probably important for <b>other</b> <b>diagnostics</b> <b>techniques,</b> such as gamma-ray spectroscopy and neutral particle analysis, as well. Good agreement with TOFOR data is observed, but not for the exact same time slice of the discharge, which leaves some questions yet to be investigated...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Industrial Technologies (OIT) Industries of the Future (IOF) Forest Products {{research}} program, {{two different}} laser <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> have been implemented in pulp mill recovery boilers to provide important information on entrained particles. One technique, based on single-particle scattering of a low-power, continuous-wave (cw) laser source, measures the velocity, concentration, and size distribution of particles within the furnace flow, over a predetermined {{range of particle sizes}}. For application to recovery boilers, this technique was designed to measure the range of particle sizes known as intermediate size particles (ISPs), roughly from 2 - 100 {micro}m in diameter. The <b>other</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>technique,</b> known as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), uses a pulsed, high-power laser beam to create a localized plasma spark in the flow, allowing the measurement of the elemental composition of the entrained particles. This technique is most sensitive for particles less than 10 {micro}m in diameter. Implementing these laser <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> in recovery boilers proved to be challenging. For the particle scattering measurement, the use of a narrow aperture for measurement of the forward scattered light was postulated and later confirmed to be effective in minimizing background signals associated with the dense sodium fume in the boilers. For the LIBS measurement, a new water-jacketed optics probe was implemented to allow for measurements with an insertion depth of up to two meters in the furnace. Fume particle deposition on the exposed optics {{at the end of the}} LIBS probe was problematic but improved with a redesign of the probe geometry and purge flow. Both <b>diagnostic</b> <b>techniques</b> were employed at two representative recovery boilers. The particle scattering diagnostic demonstrated similar trends in mean ISP concentration, ISP size distribution, and temporal variation of ISP concentration at the two boilers. The LIBS measurements showed the presence of a number of major chemical components as well as trace metal elements in the entrained particles...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the value of positron emission tomography using fluorine- 18 fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) and conventional diagnostic modalities (CT and/or MRI, panendoscopy) in detecting unknown primary tumours and distant metastases in patients suffering from such a cervical metastasis. Fifty patients (37 men and 13 women) with cervical metastases of an unknown primary tumour were included. All patients underwent FDG-PET. In addition, CT and/or MRI was obtained and panendoscopy was performed. All clinically known metastases were detected by FDG-PET. The primary tumour could be diagnosed in 16 patients (four primary tumours were detected exclusively by FDG-PET). Seven patients had multiple distant metastases, that in six cases were detected exclusively by FDG-PET. The sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for detection of unknown primary tumours were 100 % and 94 %, respectively. For the conventional diagnostic modalities these values were 92 % and 76 %. FDG-PET had an exclusive effect on the applied therapy in 20 % of the patients referred for diagnosis of an unknown primary tumour. The data obtained in this study strongly support the diagnostic strategy of performing FDG-PET in patients suffering from cervical metastases of an unknown primary tumour before any <b>other</b> <b>diagnostic</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of mutations {{that are responsible}} for human genetic diseases is important, and several molecular biology techniques based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (1), have been specially developed for this purpose (2 - 8).

In order to discriminate between wild-type and mutant alleles, the analytical PCR requires specific and adapted PCR conditions for each mutation studied (concentration of each PCR primers set, temperature of hybridization, concentration of MgClJ.
