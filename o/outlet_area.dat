40|$|The micro viscous pump is an {{important}} type of fluidic device. Optimizing the working performance of the pump is crucial for its wider application. A micro viscous pump design with unequal inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>areas</b> is proposed in this paper. The flow field of the viscous pump is investigated using 2 D laminar simulations. The mass flow rate and driving power are studied with different opening angles. The effects of the Reynolds number and the pressure load on the working performance are discussed in detail. Flow structures and vortex evolution are analyzed. With larger inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>areas,</b> a higher mass flow rate is obtained and less driving power is achieved. A high pressure load results in a reduction in mass flow rate {{and an increase in}} driving power. Pumps with large opening angles are more susceptive to the Reynolds number and the pressure load. The adverse impact of the pressure load can be reduced by increasing the rotor speed. The vortex structure is affected by the geometric and operating parameters in the flow field.

Results of analysis of wear on industrial dies were combined with results obtained in laboratory wear tests. The main influential parameters in this study refer to contact pressure, die design, length of bearing surface, quality of nitrided layer, surface preparation prior coating and maintenance. It was found that lower quality of nitrided layer in combination with short bearing surface and occurrence of increased contact pressure close to exit edge of bearing surface can considerably decrease die service time and that appropriate shaping of die contours around inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>areas</b> of bearing surface has decisive influence on die service time...|$|R

40|$|Roof solar chimney is {{one type}} of solar chimney to enhance the natural {{ventilation}} in buildings. Under the factor that previous studies numerically modelled and validated their results by single test rig, experimental data from all the possible test rigs in the literature were collected and analysed in this study to develop an empirical model for general use. This empirical model was validated by experimental data from various test rigs, with an average error of 14 % and up to 144. 6 % error. Based on the experi- mental data from different test rigs, the influences of several factors, such as calculated inclination angle (q 0, shown in Eq. (6)), cavity gap (d), width (w), height (H), height/cavity gap ratio (H/d), inlet area (Ain), <b>outlet</b> <b>area</b> (Aout) and radiation heat (q), on solar chimney performance were addressed. The volumetric flow rate of roof solar chimney showed a linear relationship with w(sinq 0) 1 / 3 q 1 / 2 d 0. 7 H 2 / 3. The slope of this linear relationship can be determined by test environment, cavity material, glazing, and insulation conditions. Those experimental data within a H/d range of 2. 5 e 103. 5 showed that the air velocity in- creases with a larger H/d, but the volumetric flow rate behaves in an opposite way.

40|$|The {{discharged}} {{oil from}} hydraulic cylinder, during its operation, is highly restricted {{by the small}} sized outlets. As a result, a back pressure builds up and the piston motion, therefore, is slowed down; the system pump has to do additional work to overcome this hydraulic resistance so as to preserve the required speed.

A three-dimensional numerical study of natural convection heat transfer from multiple protruding heat sources simulating electronic components is conducted. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software, FLUENT is used in this analysis. A 4 by 5 array of heat sources are embedded in the bottom wall of an adiabatic square enclosure. The heat sources with a constant heat flux source at the bottom are of square cross-section and arranged in an in-line manner. Each heat source is attached with one thermocouple, which is connected to a data acquisition system and a computer. The steady state temperatures of heat sources, air inlet, outlet and enclosure walls are measured. The analysis is carried out by varying the heat fluxes and <b>outlet</b> <b>areas.</b> The heat transfer coefficient, Nusselt number and Grashof number are obtained.

The cavitation region, air volume fraction distribution, velocity distribution, and pressure distribution were obtained. Experimental flow visualization {{was conducted to}} catch cavitation images near the orifice of the poppet valve and the ball valve from two perpendicular directions, using a pair of industrial fibrescopes and high-speed video cameras-integrated visualization system. Besides, the vibrations {{of the valve body}} and the poppet induced by the cavitating flow are detected using a vortex displacement transducer, a laser displacement meter, and a digital strain device. The cavitation inception location and the cavitation cloud shape from both exper-iment and numerical simulations are in a good agreement qualitatively. Furthermore, the effects of <b>outlet</b> <b>area,</b> inlet velocity, and outlet pressure on cavitation were numerically investigated. The reduction of the <b>outlet</b> <b>area</b> by around 50 per cent is effective in reducing the cavitation near the orifice of the valve and suppressing the generation of cavitation. The cavitation region and the air volume fraction in the poppet valve increase greatly with an increased inlet velocity by 69 per cent on a certain condition.

The Inlet and outlet waters of Gajah Mungkur reservoir have different biotic and abiotic factors which are considered affecting the diversity of species of fish. Thus, this research was conducted in order to determine the diversity of fish species of fish on the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>area</b> of Gajah Mungkur reservoir Wonogiri. Sampling was conducted in January-February 2013.

Fish species was identified by using Kottelat (1993). Fish species diversity calculated by Shannon Wiener diversity index. Relative abundance is used to look at the density of fish at each location. The relationship between the abiotic factors and species diversity of the fish's body morphological characters were analyzed with correlation test. The results showed that the diversity of fish species in Gajah Mungkur reservoir in the outlet is higher (1. 87) than the inlet locations I, II, III (1. 02, 0. 71 and 1. 23).
