60|$|Though {{exceedingly}} tired, he was yet {{loath to}} yield to lassitude, but this night it was not from listening, watchful vigilance; it was from a desire to realize his position. The details of his wild environment seemed the only substance of a strange dream. He saw the darkening rims, the gray <b>oval</b> <b>turning</b> black, the undulating surface of forest, like a rippling lake, and the spear-pointed spruces. He heard the flutter of aspen leaves and the soft, continuous splash of falling water. The melancholy note of a canyon bird broke clear and lonely from the high cliffs. Venters had no name for this night singer, {{and he had never}} seen one, but the few notes, always pealing out just at darkness, were as familiar to him as the canyon silence. Then they ceased, and the rustle of leaves and the murmur of water hushed in a growing sound that Venters fancied was not of earth. Neither had he a name for this, only it was inexpressibly wild and sweet. The thought came that it might be a moan of the girl in her last outcry of life, and he felt a tremor shake him. But no! This sound was not human, though it was like despair. He began to doubt his sensitive perceptions, to believe that he half-dreamed what he thought he heard. Then the sound swelled with the strengthening of the breeze, and he realized it was the singing of the wind in the cliffs.|$|E

50|$|The {{race was}} officially {{announced}} on October 1, 2013. The track's road course was formerly used by Formula One for the United States Grand Prix. The track featured various modifications: the track runs clockwise, with turn 1 entering the <b>oval's</b> <b>turn</b> 4 {{onto the road}} course. Turns 2 to 4 remain the same, while turn 5 and 6 became a chicane, and entered the Hulman Blvd. straight. Turn 7 is a 90-degree left turn into turns 8 and 9, leading into the <b>oval's</b> <b>turn</b> 2, which serves as the road course's turns 10 and 11. The <b>oval's</b> <b>turn</b> 1 is not entered, as the track follows the MotoGP format, with turns 12 to 14 leading into the front straight. The cars were also modified to fit the track's specifications, with fueling plugs on the opposite side.|$|R

5000|$|The circuit {{used was}} a {{modified}} version of the combined road course used for the Formula One United States Grand Prix from 2000-2007. The circuit was reversed to a counterclockwise orientation, and a new complex of corners was added inside the infield of <b>oval</b> <b>turn</b> one. The new [...] "Snake Pit" [...] section, as it became known, was nicknamed for its location where notorious revelry once took place during the 1970s. The new series of corners precluded the bikes from using any of the banked oval corners. The double-hairpin at the Hulman Straight was replaced with more traditional esses. Furthermore, the motorcycles stayed low in the south short chute (approaching the Snake Pit section) between <b>oval</b> <b>turn</b> 1 and 2, using the pavement of the warm-up lane rather than the oval track's short chute.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, the chicane was {{modified}} once again. The middle leg was repaved and widened, and now cars would enter {{through the first}} leg, and exit out of the second leg. The existing third leg was abandoned. This allowed cars a cleaner entry into <b>oval</b> <b>turn</b> three. After favorable results, in 2010 the third leg was dug up, and removed permanently.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2013, a {{construction}} project began to reconfigure the road course layout {{in order to}} the make the circuit more competitive, better for fans, and more suited for Indy cars. The entire road course portion was repaved, while several segments were modified. The road course turn one was changed to a 90-degree turn with a raised curb on the inside. The road course portion inside <b>oval</b> <b>turn</b> four was revised to bypass two slow turns, and effectively lengthened the Hulman Boulevard backstretch. At {{the end of the}} Hulman Blvd. backstretch, a new 90-degree left turn leads to a new series of faster turns behind the Museum. Rather than follow original <b>turn</b> 13 (<b>oval</b> <b>turn</b> 1) like the U.S. Grand Prix did, the IndyCar circuit mimics the motorcycle course, and utilized the [...] "snake pit" [...] infield complex. Two of the, tighter, sharper, corners (utilized by the motorcycles) were bypassed and replaced with a single 90-degree right turn. The new course distance measures 2.439 miles (3.925 km).|$|R
2500|$|Modifications {{approved}} by the FIA and FIM {{were made to the}} combined road course, bringing the new layout to a total of 16 turns. The motorcycle course was designed to run counter-clockwise, the same direction as the oval events. The banking of <b>oval</b> <b>turn</b> one was bypassed by a new infield section, dubbed the [...] "Snake Pit Complex". In addition, the double-hairpin after the Hulman Straight was replaced with traditional esses.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, {{a second}} infield road course {{configuration}} was constructed, primarily for motorcycles.

On the bouncy pace {{friendly}} WACA Ground, where the Western Australians played their home matches, only one spinner was required, and left arm orthodox spinner Tony Lock, the former English Test player blocked Mallett's path. Along with young leg spinner Terry Jenner, Mallett transferred to South Australia in the winter 1967, and immediately became regular members of the state team, which often fielded two spinners on the Adelaide <b>Oval's</b> <b>turning</b> surface.

50|$|After {{a recent}} {{insurance}} {{investigation of the}} pit out opening for the road course, which is located along the left lane wall of the drag strip, the insurance carrier has demanded the pit out be closed off with a permanent concrete wall. This effectively means closing the road course for competition purposes as well, {{as there is no}} other area on the current track layout suitable to relocate a viable pit lane. However, club racing has used a section of track that runs parallel to the backstretch of the <b>oval</b> (<b>Turns</b> 6-8) as a makeshift pit for club racing, although enough section of the return road for the drag strip could also be used if realigned.|$|R

Unser pulled out to a large lead. The battle of the race was for second, with Felton all over the back bumper of Johnny Rutherford. On the final lap, Rutherford had a small bobble in the dog-leg section, and Felton {{was able to get}} his nose underneath. Felton nudged Rutherford and the two cars went {{side-by-side}} coming out of the dog-leg. Rutherford took him into the next turn, the two cars came together, and Felton spun a complete 360 in <b>oval</b> <b>turn</b> two.

25|$|Despite {{heavy rain}} early Friday morning, the track was dry {{for the first}} {{practice}} and remained that way all weekend. On his first lap, Barrichello became the first Formula 1 driver in three years of running at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to hit the concrete wall in the oval section of the track. As {{he was about to}} finish his first lap, his left rear tire lost pressure and the car was flung into the outer wall {{at the top of the}} main straight, ripping off the left rear corner and front wing. Barrichello's car missed the energy-absorbing Steel And Foam Energy Reduction (SAFER) barrier that had been installed in front of the concrete wall in all of the <b>oval</b> <b>turns</b> the previous May.

50|$|Oval track {{racing is}} a form of closed-circuit {{automobile}} racing that is contested on an oval-shaped track. An oval track differs from a road course in that the layout resembles an <b>oval</b> with <b>turns</b> in only one direction, almost universally left (counter-clockwise orientation). Oval tracks are dedicated motorsport circuits, used predominantly in the United States. They often have banked turns and some, despite the name, are not precisely oval, and can have unique variances in shape.|$|R

5000|$|Why <b>Oval</b> BA <b>turned</b> red is not understood. According to a 2008 {{study by}} Dr. Santiago Pérez-Hoyos of the University of the Basque Country, {{the most likely}} {{mechanism}} is [...] "an upward and inward diffusion of either a colored compound or a coating vapor that may interact later with high energy solar photons at the upper levels of Oval BA." [...] Some believe that small storms (and their corresponding white spots) on Jupiter turn red when the winds become powerful enough to draw certain gases from deeper within the atmosphere which change color when those gases are exposed to sunlight.|$|R

50|$|Alonso and Renault had {{to contend}} with the pace of the resurgent McLaren team with lead driver Kimi Räikkönen outshining {{teammate}} Juan Pablo Montoya, who came highly regarded from his time at Williams. Räikkönen won seven races like Alonso, but would have won more if not for a remarkable string of reliability issues, resulting in qualifying engine change penalties and retirements from the lead on three occasions. Nevertheless, Räikkönen grabbed the headlines winning from near the back of the grid in Japan, passing Alonso's Renault teammate Giancarlo Fisichella on the final lap. Reigning champions Michael Schumacher and Ferrari had a poor season by their standards, with Bridgestone unable to compete with Michelin after the tyre-change ban that only affected the 2005 season. Their only win came when Michelin deemed their own tyres unsafe after several incidents in the <b>oval</b> <b>turn</b> at Indianapolis. As a result, only the six Bridgestone cars took part, which, if other drivers' non-starts does not count as participating, is the lowest attended starting field of a Formula One Grand Prix. Schumacher just held on for third in the Drivers' Championship, in spite of the superior pace of McLaren, underlying the disappointing season Montoya had. The Colombian missed two races early on due to an injury allegedly having occurred when playing tennis. He then won three races, showing glimpses of pace, but was distanced by teammate Räikkönen in the championship.|$|R
