50|$|Current <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage <b>media,</b> {{such as the}} CD and DVD {{store data}} {{as a series of}} {{reflective}} marks on an internal surface of a disc. In order to increase storage capacity, it is possible for discs to hold two or even more of these data layers, but their number is severely limited since the addressing laser interacts with every layer that it passes through on the way to and from the addressed layer. These interactions cause noise that limits the technology to approximately 10 layers. 3D <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage methods circumvent this issue by using addressing methods where only the specifically addressed voxel (volumetric pixel) interacts substantially with the addressing light. This necessarily involves nonlinear data reading and writing methods, in particular nonlinear optics.|$|R

Here we explore ultrafast structural transformation in a photoexcited GST superlattice, where GeTe and Sb 2 Te 3 are spatially separated, using coherent phonon spectroscopy with pump–pump–probe sequences. By analysing the coherent phonon spectra in different time regions, complex structural dynamics upon excitation are observed in the GST superlattice (but not in GST alloys), which can be described as the mixing of Ge sites from two different coordination environments.

40|$|Photonics is an {{emerging}} technology, slated for {{rapid growth in}} communications systems, sensors, imagers, and computers. Its growth {{is driven by the}} need for speed, reliability, and low cost. New nonlinear polymeric materials will be a key technology in the new wave of photonics devices. Electron-conjubated polymeric materials offer large electro-optic figures of merit, ease of processing into films and fibers, ruggedness, low cost, and a plethora of design options. Several new broad classes of second-order nonlinear optical polymers were developed at the Navy's Michelson Laboratory at China Lake, California. Polar alignment in thin film waveguides was achieved by electric-field poling and Langmuir-Blodgett processing. Our polymers have high softening temperatures and good aging properties. While most of the films can be photobleached with ultraviolet (UV) light, some have excellent stability in the 500 - 1600 nm range, and UV stability in the 290 - 310 nm range.

40|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>data</b> storage <b>media</b> In this paper, {{we review}} {{many of the}} {{technical}} issues {{that must be addressed}} in developing high-quality optical disk recording media. The geometric design of tracking grooves and embossed data on the disk substrate must be optimized to the characteristics of the optical drive to support robust data seeking, track following, and data addressing. To ensure adequate recording performance and drive compatibility, we have used modeling to optimize the media thin-film structure for proper optical, thermal, and magnetic characteristics. Because low substrate birefringence is a necessary media characteristic for high recording densities, we discuss measurements which assess whether birefringence has been adequately controlled in disk production. Testing is used throughout media development and manufacture to measure that the quality goals of the design are achieved. The mechanical integrity of the disk and its cartridge, particularly for autoload libraries, is confirmed by load/unload stress testing. <b>Media</b> life and <b>data</b> archivability are established by a combination of time-zero and accelerated life stress tests of media mechanical and recording Performance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} measurement of optical phase {{in the media and}} systems of <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage, polarization dependence of signals from periodic one-dimensional arrays of magnetic domains in magneto-optical media and crystalline domains in amorphous phase-change media, and optical characterization of multilayer stacks used as <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage <b>media.</b> Digital signals in <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage systems can be encoded in the intensity, polarization or phase of the carrier beam. Both surface structure and material property variations can create a phase modulation at the exit pupil. Current <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage systems do not make use of this phase modulation and its recovery could increase the strength of the generated signal. We experimentally describe a variant of Zernike's phase-contrast microscope to measure the small phase object, an interferometer to measure the relative optical phase on reflection between amorphous and crystalline regions of the phase-change <b>media</b> of <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage, and a method to measure optical phase information in disk system. In order to increase the <b>data</b> density in <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage, the wavelength becomes shorter and the numerical aperture of the objective lens becomes higher. In the interaction of the focused beam with a grooved, multilayer disk, the different response to s- and p-polarized light upon reflection from the disk results in different complex-amplitudes and has strong impact on readout and servo signals for the two fundamental components of polarization. Polarization dependence of signals from periodic one-dimensional arrays of magnetic domains in magneto-optical (MO) media and crystalline domains in amorphous phase change (PC) media are studied by theoretical calculation and experiment. Currently, many different multilayer stacks are designed to enhance the contrast of readout signal, reduce noise, increase the storage density and speed, or improve media reliability. A good understanding of the range of values of the optical constants should help to improve the accuracy of optical and thermal design of the storage media. The refractive index n and the absorption coefficient k of these materials vary to some extent with the film thickness and with the film deposition environment. We report the observed variations of optical constants among samples of differing structure and among samples fabricated in different laboratories...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} parameters {{associated with}} <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage {{in a variety}} of amorphous side-chain azobenzene-containing polyesters denoted as E 1 aX. The polyesters possess a common cyanosubstituted azobenzene chromophore as a side chain, but differ in their main-chain polyester composition. Seventeen different polymers from the E 1 aX family divided into four classes, {{depending on the type of}} the main-chain substituent (one-, two-, and three-ring aromatic or alicyclic) have been thoroughly investigated. Various parameters characterizing the photoinduced birefringence in these materials, such as the response time, thermal and light stability, and long-term stability under ambient light at room temperature have been measured. Each of these parameters is quantitatively represented and therefore it is possible to make a clear comparison between the properties of the polymers. The results indicate that the long-term stability at ambient temperature is closely related to the thermal stability of the photoinduced birefringence. A strong correlation has also been found between the response time and the stability of the induced anisotropy toward illumination with unpolarized white light. One of the classes of E 1 aX polymers characterized by two-ring aromatic substituent in the main chain is a good candidate for <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage <b>media.</b> A recording energy of approximately 2 J/cm 2 is sufficient to induce high refractive-index modulations of Δn= 0. 13 in these materials, which is retained even at elevated temperatures (> 130 °C).

40|$|Increasing {{the number}} of layers used in <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage <b>media</b> is a {{promising}} technique to address increasing capacity demands. However, heavy optical losses are experienced by light on transit through multilayered optical recording media, requiring prohibitively high readout powers for deep layers. Here, gold nanorods are used as the <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage medium, and the polarization response of their surface plasmon resonance is exploited to control the optical extinction imposed by the nanorods. A polarization response is imposed onto the initially randomly oriented nanorod films by photothermal depletion technique. The influence of increasing the depletion fluence on the polarization response of nanorod films is investigated. This technique is extended into multilayer films, imposing alignment through 12 -layer nanorod films. Successful optical patterning is carried out {{on each of the}} layers following depletion, with a 20 x decrease observed in the readout power required to resolve a pattern from layer 12. The proposed angular depletion method will be highly beneficial in reducing optical losses multilayered optical storage applications, enabling storage capacities to be efficiently increased, as well as applications using a continuous medium with high concentrations of plasmonic nanoparticles, where optical losses are significant. The polarization response of surface plasmon resonance in aligned gold nanorods is used as a way to control the optical extinction imposed by the nanorods in a multilayer setting. This can be applied to high-density multilayered optical storage, where heavy beam extinction in each layer is the inhibiting factor to stacking more layers...|$|R

40|$|Data archivists expect {{information}} storage media {{to have a}} lifetime greater than ten years. Furthermore they desire the ability to predict when the media will fail in order to plan for its replacement. Archival lifetime predictions are based on accelerated aging studies, where the media are subjected to conditions of high temperature and high humidity. The rate of failure is measured and the data extrapolated to obtain rates of failure under ambient conditions. This extrapolation is reasonable provided the degradation process is activated and the Arrhenius relationship holds. However {{this may not be}} the case for the complicated materials packages in <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage <b>media.</b> A primary concern for the polymeric materials is any phase transition, such a glass transition or a beta relaxation, that may occur at temperatures between ambient and the accelerated aging conditions. It is not clear how one extrapolates through those transitions. These phase transitions can give rise to large changes in the rates of diffusion for water, oxygen and other agents of degradation. Furthermore, for polymers, such as polycarbonate, the mode of failure is often hydrolysis and the degradation products can catalyze further hydrolysis, an autocatalytic degradation. The polymer degradation will change the phase transition temperatures. The degradation products may also plasticize the polymer, causing further changes in diffusion rates. We provide here a simple analysis of accelerated aging techniques and discuss other factors that may be involved...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the processing behavior of complex polymeric materials, {{it is imperative}} that we {{understand the}} distinct underlying molecular and microstructural contributions to macroscopic mechanical response. We have developed rheo-optical methods to isolate the dynamics at such length scales, by combining conventional mechanical testing with polarimetry. The rheology and flow-induced alignment in side-group liquid-crystalline polymers (SG-LCPs) and lamellar diblock copolymers (BCPs) have been investigated using the rheo-optical apparatus. The rheology of SG-LCPs arises from a combination of the polymeric nature of the backbone, the ordering tendency of the mesogens, and the coupling between the two introduced by the spacer. Contrary to previous studies, we find that the nematic order can significantly affects the macroscopic viscoelastic response in SG-LCP melts. In the nematic state, we have discovered that oscillatory shear is effective in inducing macroscopic orientation of the sample. Shear flow may prove to be an economical, efficient way to obtain macroscopically aligned SGLCPs, which have potential as <b>optical</b> <b>data</b> storage <b>media</b> and nonlinear optical materials. In contrast to magnetic field induced alignment, the mechanism of shear induced alignment appears to bedriven by the distortion of the polymer backbone. We study the mechanisms of flow-induced alignment in a poly(ethylenepropylene) -poly(ethylethylene) lamellar diblock copolymer, which produce macroscopic alignment with lamellae normal along the shear gradient direction ('parallel' alignment), or along the vorticity direction ('perpendicular' alignment). We accomplish this by monitoring the evolution of the microstructure and viscoelasticity in situ during the alignment process. Our results suggest that 'parallel' alignment occurs due to irreversible 'rocking' of grains which tends to align the grains along the shear direction, whereas 'perpendicular' alignment occurs at conditions where the microscale deformation is nearly homogeneous...|$|R
