5|$|While Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{is having}} a meeting with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) in his office, Robert California (James Spader) appears {{at the window and}} frantically says that his wife Susan (Maura Tierney) is looking for a job in the office, and that Andy must not give her one. When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> berate him for hiring Susan. Andy asks everyone in the office to treat her poorly to drive her out, which makes everyone uncomfortable as they like her, but end up doing so nevertheless. When Susan notices their behavior, she complains to Robert, who asks Andy to discuss the issues with Susan in the conference room and leaves. Susan eventually realizes it was Robert's idea to drive her away. When they call Robert out, he vehemently denies it. Andy tells them Jim also heard him say he did not want her working at the office, which Jim overhears, prompting him to flee the office. Robert orders security to close the gate, preventing him from leaving. Jim then runs all over the building, but Andy and Robert find him and take him back to the office. After trying unsuccessfully to deflect their questions about what Robert told Andy, Jim blurts out that he is baffled at Robert's attitude, since Jim enjoys working in the same place as his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and misses her while she is on maternity leave. Andy and Jim leave the conference room and after a short while, Robert and Susan leave. In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} band, {{determined}} to continue, soon announced Nick Tart as his replacement. Tart had previously worked with many midlands based bands. Robin George recruited Tart after seeing him perform live at JBs in Dudley with Alabama Bombshell, a new project was underway to re-record some of Robin's songs that artists such as, Glenn Hughes, Ruby Turner, Robert Plant and coincidentally Sean Harris had previously recorded. Between 1992 -1996 they toured the UK, performed a live TV appearance on The James Whale show, and Radio 1 sessions with Tommy Vance under the name Life before releasing an album entitled Cocoon. Nick left the music business in 1997 but joined a new band in 2003. After a few weeks Diamond Head drummer Karl Wilcox dropped in on a rehearsal (as {{he was a friend}} of their drummer) and after hearing Nick sing, Karl immediately got <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> Brian saying he had heard a great singer and passed on his phone number. After introductions Tart agreed to join.|$|E
25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will continue to talk through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would wear a hat with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to ramble through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also use this as a prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> discuss a Twitter beef with Dwyane Wade, and cut him off at the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the show just so they could cut him off.|$|E

25|$|Michelle (now {{played by}} Jenna Russell) returns to Walford on Christmas Eve and reunites with Sharon, staying with Martin (now played by James Bye) {{and his second}} wife Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner). Sharon {{suspects}} something is wrong as Michelle has left Mark and Tim behind, but Michelle refuses to talk about it. Michelle and Martin reminisce about their family but Stacey is annoyed by Michelle's presence. Michelle announces she {{is going back to}} Florida but Stacey overhears her breaking down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> Tim. Michelle confides in Sharon that Mark has left home with his girlfriend and that she and Tim have not had sex for almost two years. She then tells Sharon that back in Florida she had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student, Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor). Sharon allows Michelle to stay with her and Michelle starts drinking alcohol on her own. Sharon and Phil go on holiday, leaving Michelle to look after the home and their children Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) and Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau). On Valentine's Day, Preston turns up and he and Michelle kiss passionately. Michelle goes for a job interview at a teaching agency, but fails to get the job as they find out from her references about her relationship with Preston. Michelle insists that he should go home but he tries to win her back, though she is adamant their relationship is over. Michelle then sees Preston with her niece, Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), and Preston manipulates Michelle into catching him in bed with Bex, and she realises he is using Bex to make her jealous. The plan apparently works as Michelle and Preston have sex again. Dennis then discovers Michelle and Preston's relationship and starts blackmailing Michelle into buying him trainers and allowing him time off school.|$|E
25|$|Limousine driver Allan Park {{testified that}} he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, {{he did not see}} Simpson's white Bronco parked at the curb. Park {{testified that he}} had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the {{prosecution}} presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). According to Simpson's version of events, the Bronco had been parked in that position for several hours. Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham street gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limousine and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the pager of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin {{hung up the phone and}} ventured outside to investigate the noises but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property where he saw Park's limousine outside the Ashford gate.|$|E

The footage shows that the Met's initial claim {{that there had been}} a barrage of missiles from protesters while police tried to save Tomlinson was inaccurate.

Throughout the video, Knowles is seen crying, with mascara running down her cheeks while talking <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> her love interest, drinking a dry martini and smoking a cigarette. This projects an image of Beyoncé paying homage to Bettie Page just as she did in the music videos for [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Video Phone", where she collaborated with Lady Gaga. In this scene, Knowles impersonates Betty Draper. According to Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard magazine, Knowles contends to her deadbeat lover while sipping a cocktail and French-inhaling a cigarette in the music video. The fantasy-laden imagery hardly ends there though, as it is followed by shots of sequences of Beyoncé gardening, washing dishes, scrubbing floors, and baking cookies. Rap-Up commented on {{what happens in the}} video, saying that she is also reading during some scenes, in which she sings [...] "Keep my head in them books, I'm sharp..." [...] In the middle of the video, Knowles dusts off her mantlepiece, which is covered by her 16 Grammy awards she earned when she was with Destiny's Child and after the debut of her solo career.
