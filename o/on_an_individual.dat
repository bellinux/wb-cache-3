The empirical results suggest that the average performance by other agents has a significant negative effect <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> performance. In branches that have more “agents” or have a “team compensation scheme”, the effect of other agents’ average performance <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual’s</b> performance is significantly higher than that for the branches with fewer “agents” or without a “team compensation scheme”. These findings are consistent with theoretical expectations...|$|R

5|$|Andreacarus voalavo {{was named}} in 2007 by Ashley Dowling, Andre Bochkov, and Barry OConnor {{on the basis}} of 15specimens found <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> of the rodent Voalavo gymnocaudus that was {{collected}} in 1994 in the Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve in northern Madagascar. The specific name, voalavo, is taken from the generic name of the type host. Voalavo gymnocaudus, the only known host, is only found in the Anjanaharibe-Sud and Marojejy massifs of the Malagasy Northern Highlands. A.voalavo is closely related to Andreacarus gymnuromys and Andreacarus eliurus, found on other Malagasy rodents. They are members of the genus Andreacarus, which currently includes 11 species found on rodents and other small mammals in Madagascar and mainland Africa.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs was {{appointed}} club captain {{at the start}} of the 1992–93 season. The team started the season with three First Division defeats in their opening six games, keeping just one clean sheet. However, <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> level the season was to get even worse for Gibbs. He sustained a knee injury against Notts County on 7 September 1992, putting him out of first team contention for six weeks. During his comeback, at home to Tranmere Rovers, Gibbs aggravated the previous injury, putting him out of action for more than two years. Concern over the injury, coupled with the good form of Gerard Lavin, restricted Gibbs' opportunities under Glenn Roeder in 1994–95.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} the Utah Line, 27th Brigade was {{withdrawn from the}} front on 17 April, handing over its positions to the South Korean 6th Division. Burke subsequently ordered his battalions into reserve positions north of the previously destroyed village of Kapyong, {{on the main road}} from Seoul to the east coast. Intelligence indicated that a new Chinese offensive was imminent, and while the brigade settled in to rest it remained on three hours notice to move to support IX Corps. Having been on operations continuously for the past seven months, the British intended to relieve the bulk of the brigade during its period in reserve. The two British battalions—the Argylls and the Middlesex—would be replaced by two fresh battalions from Hong Kong, while Burke and the headquarters of 27th Brigade would be replaced by Brigadier George Taylor and the headquarters of 28th Brigade in late-April. The Canadians were scheduled to transfer to the newly raised 25th Canadian Brigade in May as part of Canada's increased commitment to the war. Advance parties from Brigade Headquarters and the Argylls departed for Seoul en route for Hong Kong on 19 April, while the remaining British battalions were scheduled to depart two weeks later. 3 RAR would not be rotated and remained a part of the brigade for the entire war, operating <b>on</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> reinforcement system instead.|$|E
