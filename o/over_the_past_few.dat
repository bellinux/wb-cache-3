40|$|The {{application}} of perfluorocarbon liquids {{has been well}} acclaimed in vitreoretinal surgery. Its unique physical properties make it an ideal intraoperative tool to improve the efficiency and safety of surgical procedures in complicated cases.

The related clinical applications include retinal detachment with severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy, giant tear, diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and posterior dislocated crystalline and intraocular lenses.

5|$|After {{returning}} from Cornell, Chamberlin {{was hired by}} the University of Utah, where he worked from 1904 to 1908, as an assistant professor (19041905) then full professor.

He was the first dean of University of Utah School of Medicine, serving from 1905 to 1907. During the summer of 1906, his plans to teach a summer course in embryology at the University of Chicago were cancelled when he suffered a serious accident in a fall, breaking two leg bones and severing an artery in his leg. In 1907, University officials decided to merge the medical school into an existing department, which made Chamberlin's deanship obsolete.

30|$|As another example, {{continuous}} time Markov chains {{have become}} an important modeling approach <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> a <b>few</b> decades. Because it well describes the systems that undergoes transitions from one state to another, it was used extensively in modeling ion channels in cell membranes [5, 6]. However, when the collaborative behavior of a cluster of these ion channels are of interest, the state space of the cluster model increases exponentially {{as the number of}} channels increases. This combinatorial state-space explosion causes some modeling approaches to become intractable. In this paper, we present a novel approach to reduce large Markov chain models that shares the spirit of coarse-graining methods: the state-space of the Markov chain model is partitioned into groups, then each group is represented by a “mega-state” so that the full model is compressed into a tractable size. The partition scheme is selected by a genetic algorithm-based approach to preserve selected features of the full model.|$|R
