During his tenure, {{the park system}} {{increased}} from 1810 acres (7.3km²) in 57 properties to 5421 acres (21.9km²) in 144 properties. The park system, <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> the Minneapolis chain of lakes (including Cedar Lake, Lake of the Isles, Lake Calhoun, Lake Harriet, Lake Hiawatha, and Lake Nokomis) became a model for park planners around the world.

5|$|Late on September 12, while {{approaching}} the northern Lesser Antilles, convection increased and became better <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> {{an area of}} increased cyclonic turning. Environmental conditions became more favorable, allowing {{for the development of}} a low pressure area and for banding features to increase. Late on September 13, with the formation of a broad low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Eleven about 70mi (110km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|On August 22, a {{tropical}} wave moved {{off the coast}} of Africa, and it moved westward across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without developing significantly. On September 1 the wave axis entered the Gulf of Mexico, and upon doing so convection steadily <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> a low-level center of circulation. The system moved northward and developed into Tropical Depression Twelve on September 3 while located about 300miles (480kilometers) west of Tampa, Florida. Embedded within a slow mid-latitude trough, the depression moved eastward and strengthened into Tropical Storm Henri on September 5.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{administration}} in the entire kingdom was based on counties <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> royal fortresses.

5|$|Since the Middle Ages, most {{dwellings}} were log {{houses with}} notched corners, carefully crafted to ensure {{protection against the}} elements. Centrally placed open-hearth fires with smoke vents in the roofs gave way to stone stoves and chimneys in early modern times. Specialized buildings became commonplace, <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> farmyards or gårdstun. The introduction of exterior boarding (weatherboarding) in the 18th century improved housing standards considerably and gave rise to larger houses.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{established}} {{at least one}} archbishopric, six bishoprics and three Benedictine monasteries; thus the Church in Hungary developed independently of the archbishops of the Holy Roman Empire. He encouraged the spread of Christianity with severe punishments for ignoring Christian customs. His system of local administration was based on counties <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> fortresses and administered by royal officials. Hungary, which enjoyed a lasting period of peace during his reign, became a preferred route for pilgrims and merchants traveling between Western Europe and the Holy Land or Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{set up a}} territory-based {{administrative}} system, establishing counties. Each county, {{headed by}} a royal official known as a count or ispán, was an administrative unit <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> a royal fortress. Most fortresses were earthworks in this period, but the castles at Esztergom, Székesfehérvár and Veszprém were built of stone. Forts serving as county seats also became the nuclei of Church organization. The settlements developing around them, where markets were held on each Sunday, were important local economic centers.|$|E

5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed over the western Caribbean Sea on October 8, and it persisted until October 11, when a tropical wave reached {{the area and}} caused the convection to organize, resulting {{in the development of a}} low-level circulation. Convection increased and <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> the circulation's center late on October 12, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 13 off the north coast of Honduras. The depression continued to organize over the favorable conditions present in the Caribbean Sea, and attained tropical storm status later on October 13, when it was assigned the name Irene. Operationally, the system remained a tropical wave until it already reached tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group {{dates back to the}} beginning of the Cottage School.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance was observed on November19 about 800km (500mi) southeast of Colombo, Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The disturbance tracked westward, gradually organizing and prompting the JTWC {{to issue a}} Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on November22. After passing south of Sri Lanka, it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone. The circulation associated with the system continued westward, reorganizing on November26 in the Arabian Sea. Despite being located unusually close to the equator, the disturbance maintained convection, or thunderstorms, which was becoming <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> the weak low-level circulation. With low wind shear and diffluence aloft, the JTWC remarked the system had a fair chance of developing.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 31, 2006. It moved westward without development, and entered the eastern Pacific Ocean on September 10. An area of convection developed along the wave axis, several hundred miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. It moved slowly westward and steadily organized. Convection and banding features <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> a developing center, and the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen-E on September 13. The system continued to organize and strengthened into Tropical Storm Lane early on September 14 about 90miles (145km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico. Based on a potentially developing anticyclone over the storm and a track over warm water temperatures, the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model issued a 46percent probability for rapid intensification of the storm.|$|E
5|$|Around May6, {{the monsoon}} trough {{extended}} across the southern Bay of Bengal, producing a vast field of thunderstorm activity. A broad low-pressure area {{formed by the}} next day and remained nearly stationary. Over the next few days, the convection varied in intensity until becoming more <b>organized</b> <b>around</b> the nascent surface low on May10. At 03:00UTC on May10, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported the formation of a depression about 535km (330mi) west of Banda Aceh, Indonesia. Within nine hours, the depression further intensified into a deep depression. Around the same time, the system was classified as Tropical Cyclone 01B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
