The best argument for this hypothesis is that the division of two parallel lines by straight lines intersecting {{each other at the}} vanishing point (geometrical method) is equivalent to the division of those parallel lines in proportional parts (arithmetical method). If arithmetical method had been used, then the vanishing points exhibited ex post should be purely fortuitous. But the lack of multiples and submultiples of measurement units, the absence of proportionality ratios, the length of the <b>operating</b> <b>series,</b> and the correspondence of vanishing points to visible loci of the picture offer sound objections for this hypothesis. The use of optics and geometrical method is more probative—though {{it does not mean that}} painters were using concepts of linear perspective, which would be an anachronism...|$|E
40|$|A {{problem of}} {{interest}} in the power industry is the mitigation of severe torsional oscillations induced in turbine-generator shaft systems due to Subsynchronous Resonance (SSR). SSR occurs when a natural frequency of a series compensated transmission system coincides with the complement of one of the torsional modes of the turbine-generator shaft system. Under such circumstances, the turbine-generator shaft system oscillates at a frequency corresponding to the torsional mode frequency and unless corrective action is taken, the torsional oscillations can grow and may result in shaft damage in a few seconds. This thesis reports the use of a supplementary controller along with the Voltage Source Converter (VSC) HVDC back-to-back active power controller to damp all SSR torsional oscillations. In this context, investigations are conducted on a typical HVAC/DC system incorporating a large turbine-generator and a VSC HVDC back-to-back system. The generator speed deviation is used as the stabilizing signal for the supplementary controller. The results of the investigations conducted in this thesis show that the achieved control design is effective in damping all the shaft torsional torques over a wide range of compensation levels. The results and discussion presented in this thesis should provide valuable information to electric power utilities engaged in planning and <b>operating</b> <b>series</b> capacitor compensated transmission lines and VSC HVDC back-to-back systems...|$|E
