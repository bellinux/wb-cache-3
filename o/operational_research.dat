5|$|The {{need for}} the second crewman was an obvious problem with the Mk. XII, {{especially}} as few bombers of the era had enough room for the operator. Working with Henry Braddick, Blackett developed {{a new version of}} the calculator that included aircraft instruments inside the computor, eliminating the {{need for the}} needle-on-needle matching and completely automating the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with RAF Coastal Command, where he continued development of his theories of <b>operational</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} reports {{in the summer of}} 1944 {{produced}} by Bomber Command's <b>operational</b> <b>research</b> division attempted to explain these differences, starting with problems in the bombsight itself. However, almost all of the reasons ultimately offered were purely operational in nature. These included the fact that the target indicator flares used as a reference covered an area of , that the bombers were dropping salvos of bombs, not a single test bomb, and that the Master Bomber would change the marking point during the process of the raid, making it very difficult to correlate the bomb craters to the marking.|$|E

5|$|Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System – ARIES, a NASA {{platform}} for air safety and <b>operational</b> <b>research,</b> {{was created in}} 1999 using the second production 757. The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines. After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737-100 testbed, it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar flow control system, avionics systems for the proposed Northrop YF-23 jet fighter, and the 777's fly-by-wire control system. Equipped with a flight deck research station, on-board laboratories, and two experimental flight decks, ARIES was used for evaluating weather information and landing approach systems, as well as runway friction tests. ARIES went into storage in 2006.|$|E
5|$|There are no exact figures {{regarding}} German tank {{losses in}} Normandy. Approximately 2,300 tanks and assault guns {{were committed to}} the battle, of which only 100 to 120 crossed the Seine {{at the end of}} the campaign. While German forces reported only 481 tanks destroyed between D-day and 31 July, research conducted by No. 2 <b>Operational</b> <b>Research</b> Section of 21st Army Group indicates that the Allies destroyed around 550 tanks in June and July and another 500 in August, for a total of 1,050 tanks destroyed by enemy action, including 100 destroyed by aircraft. Luftwaffe losses amounted to 2,127 aircraft. By the end of the Normandy campaign, 55 German divisions (42 infantry and 13 panzer) had been rendered combat ineffective; seven of these were disbanded. By September, OB West had only 13 infantry divisions, 3 panzer divisions, and 2 panzer brigades rated as combat effective.|$|E

40|$|A {{gap between}} <b>operational</b> and <b>research</b> meteorologists has existed since the infancy of weather {{forecasting}} and represents {{an obstacle to}} progress in meteorology. This gap {{is related to the}} profoundly different perspectives and professional expectations of <b>operational</b> and <b>research</b> meteorologists. For the knowledge, observations, tools, and models described in this monograph to reach their full potential, the mountain meteorology community must work more effectively to bridge this gap. Essential to this effort are advocates who are capable of interacting, communicating, and commanding respect with both the <b>operational</b> and <b>research</b> communities. As a result, the mountain meteorology community should provide the attention and resources needed to ensure that future advocates are created from our pool of young scientists and forecasters. The community should also ensure that knowledge and technological advances from field programs and other research efforts are effectively transferred into operations and, at least in North America, explore the development of an integrated research and forecast center to tackle challenges in mountain hydrometeorology and fire–atmosphere prediction. Although the existence of a modest gap reflects a healthy scientific and forecasting enterprise, these and other gap-bridging activities and incentives described in this chapter should benefit the entire mountain weather community, its <b>operational</b> and <b>research</b> sectors, and, via improved forecasts, society at large...|$|R

The Flight used six Sikorsky R-6A Hoverfly 2 (an improved version of the Hoverfly I) helicopters, and Auster AOP.6 aircraft to train British Army and Royal Air Force pilots and carry out operational trials. The Hoverfly 2s had little effective operational capability, but gave the Army valuable experience in the helicopter's potential use. In addition to artillery direction, the Flight's experimental activities included photography, radar trials, air/ground communications, and fighter evasion. In January 1948, the Flight moved to Middle Wallop. It still exists today as 1 Flight, Army Air Corps.|$|E

500|$|Analysis by <b>Operational</b> <b>Research</b> Section Number 2 (ORS2) {{concluded}} that {{the bombing of the}} first aiming point north-west of Caen was accurate, finding that the centre of the 90 percent zone (the area where 90 percent of the bombs fell) was [...] east of the aiming point, with some spillage to the south and west. Examination of the area after its capture, indicated some destruction of German equipment, including the wreckage of ten of the forty trucks believed to be in the area {{at the time of the}} raid. The 48 hours that elapsed between the bombing and the Allied occupation of the area, allowed the Germans time to recover from any shock and disorientation and to salvage some damaged equipment. Examination of the second aiming point, [...] "Northern Caen", failed to reveal a 90 percent zone but it was noted that the obstructive effect of bombing a suburb was significant and had caused substantial delays to vehicles of both sides, by cratering and blocking roads. ORS2 {{concluded that}} the success of Charnwood owed little to the bombing and made recommendations including changing to instantly fused bombs, dropping larger numbers of smaller anti-personnel bombs and rapidly following-up a bombardment with ground forces to take advantage of its main effect, which was the temporary suppression of German will to resist.
