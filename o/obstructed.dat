5|$|Han-era astronomers {{adopted a}} geocentric {{model of the}} universe, theorizing that it was shaped like a sphere {{surrounding}} the earth in the center. They assumed that the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical and not disc-shaped. They also thought that the illumination of the Moon and planets was caused by sunlight, that lunar eclipses occurred when the Earth <b>obstructed</b> sunlight falling onto the Moon, and that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon <b>obstructed</b> sunlight from reaching the Earth. Although others disagreed with his model, Wang Chong accurately described the water cycle of the evaporation of water into clouds.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely <b>obstructed,</b> atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely <b>obstructed</b> bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially <b>obstructed</b> bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|Ascending cholangitis, {{also known}} as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is an {{infection}} of the bile duct (cholangitis), usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially <b>obstructed</b> by gallstones.|$|E

5|$|Several {{treatments}} can {{be administered}} via bronchoscopy {{for the management}} of airway obstruction or bleeding. If an airway becomes <b>obstructed</b> by cancer growth, options include rigid bronchoscopy, balloon bronchoplasty, stenting, and microdebridement. Laser photosection involves the delivery of laser light inside the airway via a bronchoscope to remove the obstructing tumor.|$|E
5|$|The gold {{standard}} for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been <b>obstructed.</b> Because of its cost, invasiveness, availability, and other limitations, this test is rarely performed.|$|E

5|$|After {{her husband}} died in 1841, a series of {{complications}} <b>obstructed</b> Hańska's marriage to Balzac.

About the same time, Hańska gave Balzac the idea for his 1844 novel Modeste Mignon. In 1850 they finally married, and moved to Paris, but he died five months later. Though she never remarried, she took several lovers, and died in 1882.|$|E

The features of density estimation of the <b>obstructing</b> NS by specialized system of preliminary nonlinear probing (SPNP) are observed. The expediency of usage an additive mixture of the second component of phase-modulated (FM) signal and the "white" Gaussian noise as a probe signal for SPNP is shown. It is proved that the noise, which was re-emitted by <b>obstructing</b> NS, loses the characteristic of "white" noise, i. e. its spectrum becomes not uniform, but decreasing with frequency increasing. The "skirts" are appeared around the first, third and fifth harmonics of the re-emitted signal as a result of nonlinear interaction of initial components of signal and noise. If the component of the FM signal and the "white" Gaussian noise during the direct action on the <b>obstructing</b> NS are statistically independent, and therefore they are not correlated, then after re-emission by <b>obstructing</b> NS they becomes statistically dependent, and therefore they are mutually correlated, because the part of the energy of input signal transformed into a noise energy. It is also pointed out that the expression of these features of transforming the probing signal by <b>obstructing</b> NS SPNP allows to estimate the density of the <b>obstructing</b> nonlinear scatterers in the nonlinear radar space which is under study of nonlinear radars?????? ????????? ?????????? ?? ??????????? ???? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ?? ????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????
