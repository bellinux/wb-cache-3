5|$|Applications {{are often}} {{classified}} {{according to how}} <b>often</b> <b>their</b> subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism {{if they do not}} communicate many times per second, and it exhibits embarrassing parallelism if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.|$|E
5|$|Class distinction, however, became linked as {{the fashion}} of female homoeroticism passed. Tribades were {{simultaneously}} considered members of the lower class trying to ruin virtuous women, and representatives of an aristocracy corrupt with debauchery. Satirical writers began to suggest that political rivals (or more <b>often,</b> <b>their</b> wives) engaged in tribadism in order to harm their reputations. Queen Anne was rumored to have a passionate relationship with Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, her closest adviser and confidante. When Churchill was ousted as the queen's favorite, she purportedly spread allegations of the queen having affairs with her bedchamberwomen. Marie Antoinette was also the subject of such speculation for some months between 1795 and 1796.|$|E

The attacks are severe enough to disrupt daily activities, but hospitalization is not necessary for most patients.|$|R
5|$|Scott and {{his brother}} were inseparable {{when they were younger}} and often played hockey together. While their father was <b>often</b> <b>their</b> team doctor, their mother taught them to skate. She {{enrolled}} them in figure skating to aid their skills development and taught power skating classes in Cranbrook in exchange for ice time for her sons. An offensive defenceman, Scott led his Cranbrook midget team in scoring with 55 goals and 92 points in 1988–89.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the death}} of the monarch {{required}} fresh elections and, in the general election of 1830, Wellington's Tories lost ground to the Whigs under Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, though the Tories still had the largest number of seats. With the Tories bitterly divided, Wellington was defeated in the House of Commons in November, and Lord Grey formed a government. Grey pledged to reform the electoral system, which had seen few changes since the fifteenth century. The inequities in the system were great; for example, large towns such as Manchester and Birmingham elected no members (though they were part of county constituencies), while small boroughs, known as rotten or pocket boroughs—such as Old Sarum with just seven voters—elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the rotten boroughs were controlled by great aristocrats, whose nominees were invariably elected by the constituents—who were, most <b>often,</b> <b>their</b> tenants—especially since the secret ballot was not yet used in Parliamentary elections. Landowners who controlled seats were even able to sell them to prospective candidates.|$|E
5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too <b>often,</b> <b>their</b> life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a full description of the ritual.|$|E

5|$|Rajab {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the first migrant workers {{protection}} committee in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the Migrant Workers Protection Group (in 2003). On 28 April 2007, the Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. BCHR issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards migrant workers. Rajab, then BCHR vice president, said: It is appalling that Bahrain is willing to rest on the benefits of these people’s hard work, and <b>often</b> <b>their</b> suffering, but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity. The solution is not to force migrant workers into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them.|$|E
5|$|The Iroquois {{signed the}} Fort Stanwix Treaty of 1768, ceding the lands {{south of the}} Ohio to the British. European {{expansion}} into the upper Ohio valley increased. An estimated 4,000 to 5,000 families settled in western Pennsylvania between 1768 and 1770. Of these settlers, about a third were English, a third were Scotch-Irish, and the rest were Welsh, German and others. These groups tended to settle together in small farming communities, but <b>often</b> <b>their</b> households were not within hailing distance. The life of a settler family was one of relentless hard work: clearing the forest, stumping the fields, building cabins and barns, planting, weeding, and harvesting. In addition, almost everything was manufactured by hand, including furniture, tools, candles, buttons, and needles. Settlers {{had to deal with}} harsh winters, and with snakes, black bears, mountain lions, and timber wolves. Because of the fear of raids by Native Americans, the settlers often built their cabins near, or even on top of, springs, to ensure access to water. They also built blockhouses, where neighbors would rally during conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} of churches were often more elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, {{like the ones}} surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, created in the mid-fifteenth century, elaborately depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, are considered {{some of the finest}} in the Gothic style. Monumental effigies began to appear in churches from the thirteenth century and they were usually fully coloured and gilded. Many were founders and patrons of churches and chapels, including members of the clergy, knights and <b>often</b> <b>their</b> wives. In contrast to England, where the fashion for stone-carved monuments gave way to brass etchings, they continued to be produced {{until the end of the}} Medieval period, with the largest group dating from the fifteenth century, including the very elaborate Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas. Sometimes the best continental artists were employed, as for Robert I's elaborate tomb in Dunfermline Abbey, which was made in his lifetime by the Parisian sculptor Thomas of Chartres, but of which only fragments now survive. The greatest group of surviving sculpture from this period are from the West Highlands, beginning in the fourteenth century on Iona under the patronage of the Lordship of the Isles and continuing until the Reformation. Common motifs were ships, swords, harps and Romanesque vine leaf tracery with Celtic elements.|$|E

25|$|Libyan {{concepts}} of rule {{allowed for the}} parallel existence of leaders who were related by marriage and blood. Shoshenq and his immediate successors used that practice to consolidate their grasp on all of Egypt. Shoshenq terminated the hereditary succession of the high priesthood of Amun. Instead he and his successors appointed men to the position, most <b>often</b> <b>their</b> own sons, a practice that lasted for a century.|$|E
25|$|During the American Revolution, Middlesex Parish was {{controlled}} by Patriots but frequently raided by local Tories who had fled to British-controlled Lloyd's Neck on Long Island. <b>Often,</b> <b>their</b> property had been confiscated and the raids offered them vengeance, recompense or both. They would row across the Sound on whaleboats to steal food and clothes for their families. The raids could be deadly, and on foggy or moonless nights Patriots had to keep especially wary.|$|E

25|$|After {{slavery was}} abolished, segregationist attitudes {{in both the}} North and the South {{discouraged}} and even prevented African Americans from worshiping in the same churches as whites. Freed blacks most often established congregations and church facilities separate from their white neighbors, who were <b>often</b> <b>their</b> former masters. These new churches created communities and worship practices that were culturally distinct from other churches, including unique and empowering forms of Christianity that creolized African spiritual traditions.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{characters}} of the Old Testament, through particular incidents in their lives, are seen to prefigure Jesus in different ways. <b>Often</b> <b>their</b> actions or temperament is set in contrast to that of Jesus. For example, according to the Bible, Adam, created in purity and innocence by God, fell to temptation and led humankind into sin. Jesus, on the other hand, lived a blameless life and died for the redemption of the sin of Adam and all his descendants.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally devadasis had a {{high status}} in society. After marrying wealthy patrons, they spent their time honing their skills instead of {{becoming}} a housewife.

Some of the eminent personalities hailed from this community are Bharat Ratna M S Subbulakshmi, Lata Mangeshkar, Kishori Amonkar, this Padma Vibhushan Ms T Balasaraswati and Dr. Muthulaksmi Reddi.|$|E

25|$|The early {{flight of}} Soviet {{officials}} {{who were supposed}} to manage the evacuation was roundly condemned by Soviet leaders, but <b>often</b> <b>their</b> retreat resulted from a realisation that evacuation procedures had started too late, {{and that there was no}} way to effectively execute it. Additionally, Soviet officials who remained in a city captured by German forces feared execution by Nazis on the hunt for communists. Avoiding that, the officials knew that they would be subject to intense interrogation as to what happened by suspicious Soviets upon returning to the fold.|$|E
25|$|Special Agents and Special Officers of the Secret Service wear attire that is {{appropriate}} for their surroundings, in order to blend {{in as much as}} possible. In most circumstances, the attire of a close protection shift is a conservative suit, but it can range from a tuxedo to casual clothing as required by the environment. Stereotypically Secret Service agents are often portrayed wearing reflective sunglasses and a communication earpiece. <b>Often</b> <b>their</b> attire is customized to conceal the wide array of equipment worn in service. Agents wear a distinctive lapel pin that identifies them to other agents.|$|E
25|$|Most {{congenital}} {{patients are}} now in their forties and fifties and their health is deteriorating. Their parents, who are <b>often</b> <b>their</b> only source of care, are into their seventies or eighties or already deceased. Often these patients find themselves tied to their own homes and the care of their family, effectively isolated from the local community. Some welfare facilities for patients do exist. One notable example is , a vocational training centre for congenital patients {{as well as other}} disabled people in the Minamata area. Hot House members are also involved in raising awareness of Minamata disease, often attending conferences and seminars as well as making regular visits to elementary schools throughout Kumamoto Prefecture.|$|E
