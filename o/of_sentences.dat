5|$|Parts of New Labour's {{political}} philosophy linked crime with social exclusion and pursued policies to encourage partnerships between social and police authorities to lower crime rates. Other areas of New Labour's policy maintained a traditional approach to crime; {{the prison population}} in 2005 rose to over 76,000, mostly owing to the increasing length <b>of</b> <b>sentences.</b> Following the September 11 attacks, the Labour government attempted to emphasise counter-terrorism measures. From 2002, the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour; in the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, Labour introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs).|$|E
5|$|Despite a large {{expansion}} of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative {{to the rest of}} Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, but still a minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and <b>of</b> <b>sentences</b> for drug-related offences.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August, the Governor Murray {{constituted}} a general court-martial, {{presided over by}} Lt.-Col. Stephen Arthur Goodman. Despite the initial revolt passing largely peacefully with slave masters locked in their homes, those who were considered ringleaders were tried at set up at different estates along the coast and executed by shooting; their heads were cut off and nailed to posts. A variety <b>of</b> <b>sentences</b> were handed out, including solitary confinement, lashing, and death. Bryant (1824) records 72 slaves having been sentenced by court-martial {{at the time of}} publication. He noted that 19 of the 45 death sentences had been carried out; a further 18 slaves had been reprieved. Quamina was among those executed; their bodies were hung up in chains by the side of a public road in front of their respective plantations and left to rot for months afterwards. Jack Gladstone was sold and deported to St Lucia; Da Costa suggests that a letter Sir John had sent on his behalf resulted in clemency.|$|E

5|$|Prison life at Fremantle was {{extremely}} regulated. Meals were {{an important part}} of the day, eaten in the cells throughout the operational life of the prison. Convict or prisoner labour was used on public infrastructure works until around 1911; subsequently, only work inside the prison was allowed, though there was never enough to fully occupy the inmates. Punishments varied over the years, with flogging and time in irons eventually replaced by lengthening <b>of</b> <b>sentences</b> and deprivation of visitors or entertainment. More than 40 hangings were carried out at Fremantle Prison, which was Western Australia's only lawful place of execution, between 1888 and 1984. Prominent escapees included Moondyne Joe, as well as John Boyle O'Reilly and six other Fenians in the 19th century, and Brenden Abbott in 1989. There have been various riots and other disturbances, with major riots causing damage in 1968 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|Some {{proponents of}} Saussure's view of {{language}} have advocated a formal approach which studies language structure by identifying its basic elements {{and then by}} presenting a formal account of the rules according to which the elements combine in order to form words and sentences. The main proponent of such a theory is Noam Chomsky, the originator of the generative theory of grammar, who has defined language as the construction <b>of</b> <b>sentences</b> that can be generated using transformational grammars. Chomsky considers these rules to be an innate feature {{of the human mind}} and to constitute the rudiments of what language is. By way of contrast, such transformational grammars are also commonly used to provide formal definitions of language are commonly used in formal logic, in formal theories of grammar, and in applied computational linguistics. In the philosophy of language, the view of linguistic meaning as residing in the logical relations between propositions and reality was developed by philosophers such as Alfred Tarski, Bertrand Russell, and other formal logicians.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{neurolinguistics}} {{involved the}} study of language in people with brain lesions, to see how lesions in specific areas affect language and speech. In this way, neuroscientists in the 19th century discovered that two areas in the brain are crucially implicated in language processing. The first area is Wernicke's area, which {{is located in the}} posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus in the dominant cerebral hemisphere. People with a lesion in this area of the brain develop receptive aphasia, a condition {{in which there is a}} major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal sentence structure. The second area is Broca's area, located in the posterior inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere. People with a lesion to this area develop expressive aphasia, meaning that they know what they want to say, they just cannot get it out. They are typically able to understand what is being said to them, but unable to speak fluently. Other symptoms that may be present in expressive aphasia include problems with fluency, articulation, word-finding, word repetition, and producing and comprehending complex grammatical sentences, both orally and in writing. Those with this aphasia also exhibit ungrammatical speech and show inability to use syntactic information to determine the meaning <b>of</b> <b>sentences.</b> Both expressive and receptive aphasia also affect the use of sign language, in analogous ways to how they affect speech, with expressive aphasia causing signers to sign slowly and with incorrect grammar, whereas a signer with receptive aphasia will sign fluently, but make little sense to others and have difficulties comprehending others' signs. This shows that the impairment is specific to the ability to use language, not to the physiology used for speech production.|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} whether sentencing influences subsequent reoffending. IntroductionAn {{important aspect}} <b>of</b> the <b>Sentencing</b> Advisory Council’s work is examining the effects <b>of</b> <b>sentencing</b> on an offender’s subsequent behaviour. This is {{one element of}} the more general question of whether, and to what extent, sentencing can achieve its various purposes. Information about the effects <b>of</b> <b>sentencing</b> should inform decision-making in relation to sentencing policy and practice. In order to provide this information, the Council has developed a database to examine {{the nature and extent}} <b>of</b> reoffending following <b>sentencing</b> in Victoria. This report uses statistical techniques to estimate the effect of each of a number of variables on the likelihood of reoffending. The variables include the type <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> imposed for the initial offence as well as factors such as the offender’s age, gender and criminal history. These techniques enable an examination <b>of</b> whether <b>sentencing</b> has an effect on reoffending in Victoria and if it does:how the effect <b>of</b> <b>sentencing</b> compares with the effects of other factors; {{and the extent to which}} this varies according to the type <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> imposed...|$|R

This thesis used descriptive research design. Besides, the thesis writer used a documentary analysis and selected one short story “When Biruni Remembers It” in “Reform” magazine No (19, 2001) as the object of the study. In analyzing the data, the writer investigated the kinds <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> types based on structure and the kinds <b>of</b> errors in <b>sentence</b> types that are found in the object of the study by taking some steps: (1) Classifying the kinds <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> types based on structure that are used in short story in “Reform” magazine No (19, 2001), (2) Classifying the kinds <b>of</b> errors in <b>sentence</b> types that are found in short story, (3) Describing the kinds <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> types based on structure that are found in short story, (4) Describing the kinds <b>of</b> errors in <b>sentence</b> types based on their classification, and (5) Describing the most dominant error in sentence types that is found in short story. From the research findings and discussions, it can be concluded that all the types <b>of</b> <b>sentence</b> based on structure are used in the short story. They are: two simple sentences, nine compound sentences, seven complex sentences, and third teen compound complex <b>sentences.</b> All <b>of</b> them are 31 sentences.
