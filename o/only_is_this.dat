Mutations in the Ras family of proto-oncogenes (comprising H-Ras, N-Ras and K-Ras) are very common, being found in 20% to 30% of all human tumours. Ras was originally identified in the Harvey sarcoma virus genome, and researchers were surprised that not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> gene present in the human genome but also, when ligated to a stimulating control element, it could induce cancers in cell line cultures.|$|E
25|$|Because offsets {{provide a}} revenue stream for the {{reduction}} of some types of emissions, they can in some cases provide incentives to emit more, so that emitting entities can later get credit for reducing emissions from an artificially high baseline. This is especially the case for offsets with a high profit margin. For example, one Chinese company generated $500 million in carbon offsets by installing a $5million incinerator to burn the HFCs produced by the manufacture of refrigerants. The huge profits provided incentive to create new factories or expand existing factories solely {{for the purpose of}} increasing production of HFCs and then destroying the resultant pollutants to generate offsets. Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> outcome environmentally undesirable, it undermines other offset projects by causing offset prices to collapse. The practice had become so common that offset credits are now no longer awarded for new plants to destroy HFC-23.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the summer, {{the various}} kids are {{preparing}} to move on with their lives. Liam comes back from his job on the fishing boat and asks Annie twice to marry him; she says no both times. Liam drunkenly buys a beach bar and starts to develop feelings for a widow he met over the summer. Silver and Navid are living together as Navid manages his business, but are forced to take in his rebellious teenage sister, Leila (Summer Bishil), when she refuses to go to boarding school. His life is complicated by Leila's rebellious nature and by the discovery that his uncle has been running a stolen car ring out of Shirazi Studios. Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> tough on Navid, but also on Silver who is doing most of the babysitting of Leila. Ivy finds herself dealing with the emotional toll from Raj's deteriorating health. Naomi, attempting to make a big impression at CU buys a large house, coming into conflict with the owner's son Austin (Justin Deeley), who had been growing marijuana on the property. Austin is a very rich, down-to-earth country man. He is very different than Naomi's ex-boyfriend Max, who was the complete opposite. Naomi throws a big elaborate beginning of school party for CU students, but this backfires when the party is raided by the police and Naomi disposes of Austin's marijuana plants by tossing them on a bonfire, causing CU's star quarterback to later test positive for drug use. The disastrous party causes Naomi to enter CU as the most unpopular girl in school, a situation she attempts to rectify by pledging a popular sorority. Initially, things appear to be going well as Naomi is taken under the wing of the sorority President, Holly (Megalyn Echikunwoke). But after performing a series of humiliating hazing rituals, Naomi discovers that Holly never intended to let her into the sorority and that this was all done to humiliate Naomi. Vowing revenge, Naomi buys her way into the only sorority that will have her: one made up of nerds and social rejects, and becomes their president. Naomi has sex with Austin after he agrees to help her new sorority humiliate Holly. However, she later learns that Austin was using her to break up with Holly, whom he had been dating. When Holly invites Max to a campus event to unsettle Naomi, she rekindles her romance with him, but still finds herself attracted to Austin. Naomi later ends up with Austin and she and Holly become short-lived friends. After Naomi gets the internship that Holly wanted, Holly retaliates by attempting to sleep with Austin. Ironically the internship that Naomi received was given to her by Holly's mom, which causes family tension between Holly and her mom. Naomi hits Holly where it really hurts; she wins over Holly's mom.|$|E

Game Informer staff writer Matt Helgeson said, [...] "not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> new 'adult' interpretation of Sonic painfully dumb, it’s also ill-advised and almost feels like a betrayal to longtime fans." [...] Eurogamer staff writer Tom Bramwell felt that [...] "the game's other selling point– its darker edge– [...] not really meant for us." [...] G4's X-Play and GameSpy staff writer Patrick Klepek thought similarly. In contrast, Nintendo Power staff writer Steve Thomason rated the game 8.0 out of 10, stating, [...] "this darker take on the Sonic universe succeeds for the most part, giving the series {{a bit of an}} edge without going overboard on violence." [...] In addition, Official Xbox Magazine reassured readers, [...] "Don't worry, Shadow the Hedgehog isn't half as 'urban' or quite as 'gangsta' as it first seems."

500|$|Some of {{the most}} vocal critics of end-time {{conspiracy}} theories come from within Christianity. In 1993, historian Bruce Barron wrote a stern rebuke of apocalyptic Christian conspiracism in the Christian Research Journal, when reviewing Robertson's 1991 book The New World Order. Another critique {{can be found in}} historian Gregory S. Camp's 1997 book Selling Fear: Conspiracy Theories and End-Times Paranoia. Religious studies scholar Richard T. Hughes argues that [...] "New World Order" [...] rhetoric libels the Christian faith, since the [...] "New World Order" [...] as defined by Christian conspiracy theorists has no basis in the Bible whatsoever. [...] Furthermore, he argues that not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> idea unbiblical, it is positively anti-biblical and fundamentally anti-Christian, because by misinterpreting key passages in the Book of Revelation, it turns a comforting message about the coming kingdom of God into one of fear, panic and despair {{in the face of an}} allegedly approaching one-world government. Progressive Christians, such as preacher-theologian Peter J. Gomes, caution Christian fundamentalists that a [...] "spirit of fear" [...] can distort scripture and history through dangerously combining biblical literalism, apocalyptic timetables, demonization and oppressive prejudices, while Camp warns of the [...] "very real danger that Christians could pick up some extra spiritual baggage" [...] by credulously embracing conspiracy theories. They therefore call on Christians who indulge in conspiracism to repent.|$|E

[...] Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> shocking for the audience in comparison to episodes and series past, but even the fictional Voyager crew are stunned.

500|$|The {{critical}} {{reception of}} the character has been generally negative. Robert A.

George called Terri's hysterical pregnancy [...] "Freudian" [...] and wrote: [...] "The Terri-Quinn plot sends {{the message that the}} devious gender will use every trick to lure and trap its mate — including lying about pregnancy." [...] Varietys Brian Lowry commented: [...] "Perhaps to foster a rooting interest (or at least sympathy) for a Will-Emma pairing, [...] (Jessalyn Gilsig) is initially presented as a ditsy shrew." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Maureen Ryan has called Terri [...] "the worst thing about Glee", and opined: [...] "As written by Murphy and played by Gilsig, the character is screechy, unfunny and deeply unpleasant. It's as if Ryan didn't trust that the audience would get behind Will and the saga of his ragtag glee club and so saw fit to give the teacher the shrewish, nagging wife from hell." [...] Ryan later deemed Terri the [...] "one big flaw in Glee, commenting that she: [...] "manages to drain all the fun out of Glee every time she appears. Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> shrill character intensely annoying, but she makes you wonder whether Will has brain damage.
