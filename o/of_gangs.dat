5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number <b>of</b> <b>gangs</b> in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African teenagers in the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E

25|$|Neither Nicaragua nor {{the city}} of Managua have major gang problems, in {{comparison}} to some of its regional neighbors. The number of gang members was estimated at 4,500 throughout the country, lower than all of its Northern neighbors in the region except Belize.

In 1991, there were 110 gangs in Managua, in 2001 the number <b>of</b> <b>gangs</b> reduced to 96 gangs {{with a total of}} 1,725 members.

25|$|Scholars claim {{politics}} also drives {{rural-urban migration}} and subsequent settlement patterns. Pre-existing patronage networks, {{sometimes in the}} form <b>of</b> <b>gangs</b> and other times {{in the form of}} political parties or social activists, inside slums seek to maintain their economic, social and political power. These social and political groups have vested interests to encourage migration by ethnic groups that will help maintain the slums, and reject alternate housing options even if the alternate options are better in every aspect than the slums they seek to replace.|$|E
25|$|Social {{security}} was seriously {{threatened by the}} periodic disbandment of the military forces, a common situation {{at the conclusion of}} wars that led to hundreds of soldiers and sailors rambling around the streets of London without an occupation or a decent living arrangement. Periods of peace were commonly marked by an increase of violent crimes. In a post-war London competition for a job was fierce and the criminality rate for robbery and property crime rose alarmingly. Although sailors could eventually sign on some merchant ships, soldiers had not such prospects. Moreover, at the moment of their dismissal, cavalrymen had the possibility to keep their horses, having paid for them with their allowances. Adding their experience with weapons and their acquaintance with accomplices in a similar position, there were all the perfect premises for the rising <b>of</b> <b>gangs</b> of robbers and criminal alliances.|$|E
25|$|A large {{percentage}} of pimps in the United States are also documented gang members, which causes concerns for police agencies in jurisdictions where prostitution is a significant problem. Pimping rivals narcotic sales as {{a major source of}} funding for many gangs; this is particularly true with African-American gangs. Gangs need money to survive, and money equates to power and respect. While selling drugs may be lucrative for a gang, this activity often carries significant risk as stiff legal penalties and harsh mandatory minimum sentencing laws exist. However, with pimping, gang members still make money while the prostitutes themselves bear the majority of the risk. Pimping has several benefits to the gang that the pimp belongs to. These benefits include helping the gang recruit new members because the gang has women available for sex and the money brought in by prostitution allows gang members to buy cars, clothes and weapons, all of which help to recruit younger members into the gang by increasing the reputation of the gang in the local gang subculture. The presence <b>of</b> <b>gangs</b> (and weapons and drugs) is a virtual guarantee when prostitutes are present, which is why many law-enforcement agencies advocate taking an aggressive stance against prostitutes. Many vice units work to ascertain if the prostitute they have arrested has a pimp, and if so, they pressure them to provide information about their pimp and the gang involved. This information can then be used to go after the more serious and violent offenders.|$|E

40|$|A {{limited amount}} of {{research}} examines the short-term consequences <b>of</b> <b>gang</b> membership.
