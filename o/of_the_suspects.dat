5|$|Montague John Druitt (15 August 1857– early December 1888) was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> in the Jack the Ripper murders {{that took}} place in London between August and November 1888.|$|E
5|$|On 8 March 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II issued summonses {{to appear}} for all six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> {{in the two}} cases. As with the {{decision}} to authorise the investigation by the Prosecutor, Judge Hans-Peter Kaul dissented and opposed the issuance of summonses.|$|E
5|$|Rubber {{bullets and}} stun grenades were used on 9 May to {{disperse}} a violent protest by 300 to 400 people demanding the release <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> arrested the previous day.

40|$|An assault {{occurred}} during which a bite was inflicted on <b>the</b> left ear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victim, producing a laceration and severing a portion <b>of</b> tissue from <b>the</b> ear. During <b>the</b> course <b>of</b> their investigation police recovered a lacerated fragment of tissue {{thought to be}} of a person's left ear. Impressions of a suspect's dentition were made and cast in dental stone. Positive replicas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occlusal surfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition were subsequently made using acrylic resin. The ear fragment displayed a lacerated border and a surface which exhibited indentations. When compared with <b>the</b> details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> lower anterior teeth, correspondence was visible between <b>the</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indentations and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> transparent acrylic replicas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition facilitated <b>the</b> interpretation and comparison between the marks retained in the ear fragment and <b>the</b> features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect's</b> dentition...|$|R

50|$|This {{is clearly}} very {{difficult}} and requires the lie catcher to have previous background knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect,</b> and <b>the</b> emotions they convey under different types <b>of</b> duress. <b>The</b> lie catcher needs to know <b>the</b> emotional characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> {{so that they are}} aware of what emotions they convey when they are suspected of wrongdoing, versus when they actually have done wrong. Not everybody is likely to feel afraid, guilty, angry, and so on when they know they are suspected of wrongdoing or lying. It depends in part upon <b>the</b> personality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect.</b>|$|R
5|$|Mumbai police {{department}} originally identified 37 suspects—including two army officers—for their alleged {{involvement in the}} plot. All but two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects,</b> {{many of whom are}} identified only through aliases, are Pakistani. Two more suspects arrested in the United States in October 2009 for other attacks were also found to have been involved in planning the Mumbai attacks. One of these men, Pakistani American David Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani), was found to have made several trips to India before the attacks and gathered video and GPS information on behalf of the plotters.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the {{foundation}} of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting Libya in an economic pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new Pan-Arab union. Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-Western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated $900 million financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the West when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the U.S. off the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticizing them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela.|$|E
5|$|Sivanandam interrogates Usha, {{who tells}} him {{how she and}} Rajan fell in love. Sivanandam tricks Usha into using a leaky {{fountain}} pen in order to collect her fingerprints. That evening, he and Naidu meet all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspects</b> at Rajan's house. Sivanandam carries out an exercise in which the suspectsincluding Ushamust pretend he is Rajan and shoot him using revolvers loaded with fake bullets. All the suspects shoot him except Usha, who bursts into tears. Sivanandam then demands to have Pattabi and Hema arrested, until Usha reveals the truth: Rajan was a radio engineer who wanted to sell radios to the poor at an affordable price. Unable to get any support from the government, he went to Japan where his work was appreciated. He became a spy selling India's military secrets to Japan. Usha learnt about this and tried unsuccessfully to reform him. She could not stop him and attempted to shoot him. She changed her mind but pulled the trigger accidentally, killing him. After revealing the truth, Usha commits suicide.|$|E

40|$|During a crime event, {{witnesses}} {{may have}} to judge <b>the</b> veracity <b>of</b> a <b>suspect.</b> I hypothesized that, because performing this task is cognitively demanding, (a) it would impair subsequent memory for details about <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> and (b) judging veracity while motivated to do so as accurately as possible would exaggerate this effect. These predictions were supported. Additionally, witnesses who judged veracity reported increased certainty about <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> their description and message and their identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> compared to control witnesses, and they also said they had a better view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspect</b> and {{paid more attention to}} him.

500|$|An example <b>of</b> this is <b>the</b> {{assertion}} {{that at least}} six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspected</b> hijackers named in <b>the</b> aftermath <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attacks turned up alive, the so-called [...] "zombie hijackers" [...] claim. Der Spiegel offers an explanation for this apparent mystery: BBC News used as a source the Arab News, an English-language Saudi newspaper, which in turn had compiled reports from Arabic newspapers, of people who obviously {{had nothing to do}} with the attacks but happened to share the same names with some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspected</b> hijackers. No photographs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>suspected</b> hijackers had been released at this point in time, and thus a few cases of mistaken identity occurred. In one instance, a man with <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Said al-Ghamdi had given an interview to Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper in Tunis, outraged that he had been portrayed by CNN as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hijackers. CNN had broadcast his photograph after doing research on their own and finding a Saudi [...] "Said al-Ghamdi" [...] who had received flight training in the United States.
