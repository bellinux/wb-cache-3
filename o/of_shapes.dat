40|$|Size and shape, {{although}} intuitively simple concepts, {{are difficult}} to define mathematically in a biologically meaningful way. Darroch and Mosimann (1985, Biometrika, 72 : 241 - 252) have proposed definitions <b>of</b> size and <b>shape</b> that incorporate the concept of geometric similarity, and have developed principal components <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> and total variability in shape based on these definitions. We adopt these definitions <b>of</b> size and <b>shape.</b> Using a related definition of the principal components <b>of</b> <b>shape,</b> we characterize the dependence on the size variable of the principal components <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> and total variability in shape. We derive the minimum amount <b>of</b> variability in <b>shape</b> and the corresponding size variable. The practical implications of these results are explored using data on strongylid eggs; for each of several plausible size variables, we determine the variability in shape and the principal components <b>of</b> <b>shape.</b> The amount <b>of</b> variability in <b>shape</b> and the principal components <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> are seen {{to be sensitive to}} the choice of size variable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: What are shapes? The ancient Greek {{geometer}} {{is perhaps}} the most familiar with these entities, but shape is general enough to transcend domains of inquiry. In this communication I present a broad examination <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> and related notions, such as form, boundary and surface. I aim to explore this question and describe the category <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> by identifying some of its most general features. I contrast geometric (or perfect) shapes with physical or organic <b>shapes</b> (the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> objects), discuss granularity, artifactuality, the cognitive aspect <b>of</b> <b>shape</b> and introduce a preliminary ontological hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>shape...</b>|$|R
5|$|Among constant-width shapes with a given width, the Reuleaux {{triangle}} has {{the minimum}} {{area and the}} sharpest (smallest) possible angle (120°) at its corners. By several numerical measures it is the farthest from being centrally symmetric. It provides the largest constant-width shape avoiding the points of an integer lattice, and {{is closely related to}} the shape of the quadrilateral maximizing the ratio of perimeter to diameter. It can perform a complete rotation within a square while at all times touching all four sides of the square, and has the smallest possible area <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> with this property. However, although it covers most of the square in this rotation process, it fails to cover {{a small fraction of the}} square's area, near its corners. Because of this property of rotating within a square, the Reuleaux triangle is also sometimes known as the Reuleaux rotor.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers <b>of</b> <b>shapes,</b> and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E
5|$|Hope shows {{its central}} {{character}} alone, {{with no other}} human figures visible and without her traditional fellow virtues, Love (also known as Charity) and Faith. She is dressed in classical costume, based on the Elgin Marbles; Nicholas Tromans of Kingston University speculated that her Greek style of clothing was intentionally chosen to evoke the ambivalent nature of hope in Greek mythology over the certainties of Christian tradition. Her pose is based on that of Michelangelo's Night, in an intentionally strained position. She sits on a small, imperfect orange globe with wisps of cloud around its circumference, against an almost blank mottled blue background. The figure is illuminated faintly from behind, as if by starlight, and also directly from the front as if the observer {{is the source of}} light. Watts's use of light and tone avoids the clear definition <b>of</b> <b>shapes,</b> creating a shimmering and dissolving effect more typically associated with pastel work than with oil painting.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bacterial}} {{species are}} either spherical, called cocci (sing. coccus, from Greek kókkos, grain, seed), or rod-shaped, called bacilli (sing. bacillus, from Latin baculus, stick). Elongation {{is associated with}} swimming. Some bacteria, called vibrio, are shaped like slightly curved rods or comma-shaped; others can be spiral-shaped, called spirilla, or tightly coiled, called spirochaetes. A small number of species even have tetrahedral or cuboidal shapes. More recently, some bacteria were discovered deep under Earth's crust that grow as branching filamentous types with a star-shaped cross-section. The large surface {{area to volume ratio}} of this morphology may give these bacteria an advantage in nutrient-poor environments. This wide variety <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> is determined by the bacterial cell wall and cytoskeleton, and is important because it can influence the ability of bacteria to acquire nutrients, attach to surfaces, swim through liquids and escape predators.|$|E
5|$|Penrose tilings {{are simple}} {{examples}} of aperiodic tilings {{of the plane}}. A tiling is a covering of the plane by tiles with no overlaps or gaps; the tiles normally have a finite number <b>of</b> <b>shapes,</b> called prototiles, {{and a set of}} prototiles is said to admit a tiling or tile the plane if there is a tiling of the plane using only tiles congruent to these prototiles. The most familiar tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are periodic: a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by translating all of the tiles by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a period of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals. If a tiling has no periods it is said to be non-periodic. A set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if it tiles the plane but every such tiling is non-periodic; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{refers to}} forms of ice {{crystals}} that precipitate {{from the atmosphere}} (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. It pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety <b>of</b> <b>shapes,</b> basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.|$|E

5|$|The {{collaboration}} between Disney and Square {{resulted in a}} mixture of familiar Disney and Square characters, as well as several new characters created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura. The primary protagonist of the game is Sora, a 14-year-old boy chosen to wield the Keyblade—a weapon which is a cross between a key and a sword—for battling darkness. The game also features two friends from his home world, Riku and Kairi. For most of the game, Sora is joined by Donald Duck and Goofy. Donald, the court wizard, and Goofy, captain of the royal guard, are sent from Disney Castle to find the Keyblade. The three join forces to search for King Mickey Mouse, Kairi, and Riku. The primary antagonist is Ansem, who seeks power and knowledge by using dark beings called the Heartless. The Heartless, hearts corrupted by darkness, serve as most of the enemies encountered in the game and come in a variety <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> and sizes. Maleficent, from the 1959 film Sleeping Beauty, leads a group of Disney villains that seeks to use the Heartless for their own gain.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} (EDM) or spark erosion process has become widely used in mould making. As well as allowing the formation <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E

5|$|Historical {{accounts}} suggest narcissi {{have been}} cultivated {{from the earliest}} times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily on the Netherlands. Today narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, narcissi are classified into divisions, covering a wide range <b>of</b> <b>shapes</b> and colours. Like other members of their family, narcissi produce {{a number of different}} alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring. The daffodil is the national flower of Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of most frogs {{are located}} {{on either side of}} the head near the top and project {{outwards}} as hemispherical bulges. They provide binocular vision over a field of 100° to the front and a total visual field of almost 360°. They may be the only part of an otherwise submerged frog to protrude from the water. Each eye has closable upper and lower lids and a nictitating membrane which provides further protection, especially when the frog is swimming. Members of the aquatic family Pipidae have the eyes located at the top of the head, a position better suited for detecting prey in the water above. The irises come in a range of colours and the pupils in a range <b>of</b> <b>shapes.</b> The common toad (Bufo bufo) has golden irises and horizontal slit-like pupils, the red-eyed tree frog (Agalychnis callidryas) has vertical slit pupils, the poison dart frog has dark irises, the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.) has triangular pupils and the tomato frog (Dyscophus spp.) has circular ones. The irises of the southern toad (Anaxyrus terrestris) are patterned so as to blend in with the surrounding camouflaged skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{last chapter}} {{of the body of}} the book – if Chapter 10 is {{considered}} more or less an epilogue – covers towns seen as part of the English landscape. Hoskins justifies this on the grounds that understanding towns brings pleasure. He describes in turn planned towns, the open-field town, and the market town. Towns were planned as early as Norman times, Abbot Baldwin planning Bury St Edmunds between 1066 and 1086; Stratford-on-Avon was laid out in 1196. Another burst of town planning came with the spa towns in the late 18th century, and of new industrial towns like Middlesbrough and Barrow-in-Furness in the mid 19th century. Open-field towns like Nottingham, Leicester, and Stamford grew naturally in their own open fields, but were trapped by pasture rights from growing in the 19th century, giving Nottingham slums, and Leicester a problem that it just managed to solve, growing across its fields: while Stamford stopped growing entirely, becoming fossilised as what Hoskins calls a museum piece of a beautiful 17th and 18th century town. Finally, the market towns like Marlborough grew up around their often large and handsome market places, which are however of any number <b>of</b> <b>shapes.</b>|$|E
