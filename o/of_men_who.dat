5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated {{the image}} of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued to dress like an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had gone out of style, and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.|$|E
5|$|After its {{founding}} in 1915, a large source of the Avery Brundage Company's business was wartime government contracts.

5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E
5|$|At least 150 {{black women}} were lynched between 1880 and 1965 in the American South. Historian Kerry Segrave {{highlights}} 115 recorded cases between 1851 and 1946.

Women were usually not lynched alone, but {{tended to be}} treated as accomplices <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were being lynched.

5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, {{ordered all}} life rafts and boats launched.

At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> {{had been unable to}} escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E

5|$|Osbert fitzHervey (died 1206) was an Anglo-Norman royal judge. Brother of Hubert Walter and Theobald Walter, Osbert served three {{kings of}} England {{and may have}} contributed to the legal {{treatise}} attributed to his uncle, Ranulf de Glanvill. Ralph of Coggeshall, a medieval writer, praised Osbert's knowledge of law, but condemned his acceptance of gifts from plaintiffs and defendants in legal cases. Osbert was one of a group <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> are considered the first signs of a professional judiciary in England.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{nature of}} the Mycenaean Greeks {{is evident from the}} numerous weapons unearthed, the use of warrior and combat representations in contemporary art, and the preserved Greek Linear B records. The Mycenaeans invested in the development of military infrastructure, with military production and logistics being supervised directly from the palatial centers. According to the Linear B records in the palace of Pylos, every rural community (the damos) was obliged to supply a certain number <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> had to serve in the army. Similar service was also performed by the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|There {{were over}} 13,000 Royal Military Police (“redcaps”). They were unpopular, {{at a time}} when the police were often unpopular with young men from big cities. Besides policing, a large part of their job was {{maintaining}} discipline on the march and keeping roads running smoothly, and collecting stragglers from a battle. During the March 1918 retreat 25,000 stragglers were rounded up and sent back to fighting units. Royal Military Police also fought on occasion if headquarters areas were threatened by an enemy advance. Although soldiers sometimes told lurid tales <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> refused to fight being shot by Military Police, no reliable first-hand accounts exist of this happening.|$|E

5|$|When the Civil War {{broke out}} in 1861, Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory was an early enthusiast for the {{advantages}} of armor. As he looked upon it, the Confederacy could not match the industrial North in numbers of ships at sea, so {{they would have to}} compete by building vessels that individually outclassed those of the Union. Armor would provide the edge. Mallory gathered about himself a group <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> could put his vision into practice, among them John M. Brooke, John L. Porter, and William P.

5|$|Castelli {{was born}} in Buenos Aires in 1764. He {{was the first of}} eight {{children}} born to a Venetian doctor, Ángel Castelli Salomón, and Josefa Villarino, who was a relative of Manuel Belgrano. He was trained by the Jesuits shortly before their expulsion, and attended the Real Colegio de San Carlos in Buenos Aires. As was customary, one of the children of the Castelli family was ordained into the priesthood, and Juan José was chosen for this. He was sent to study at the Colegio Monserrat, part of the University of Córdoba. He was influenced by the works of Voltaire and Diderot, and especially by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Social Contract. He was a fellow student <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> would later have influence in the public life of South America, including Saturnino Rodríguez Peña, Juan José Paso, Manuel Alberti, Pedro Medrano, and Juan Martínez de Rozas, among others. He focused on studying philosophy and theology, but when his father died in 1785, he abandoned his career in the priesthood, for which he felt no strong vocation.|$|E
5|$|February saw the issuing of {{equipment}} and the commencement of training, however, this was punctuated by medical inspections and dental treatment as well as ceremonial duties surrounding the commemoration of the Treaty of Waitangi. A lack of previous experience in technical trades also hampered the training of the battalion, as the unit was short <b>of</b> <b>men</b> <b>who</b> were able to serve in roles such as clerks, drivers and signallers {{because the majority of}} personnel were drawn from mainly rural backgrounds. Consequently, men for these roles had to be trained from scratch. The organisation of the battalion was finally completed in March, when the men were allocated to their respective companies, and on 13 March 1940 the 28th (Māori) Battalion was declared on active service. After 14 days leave, the battalion conducted a five-week concentration period before embarking on 1 May 1940. The battalion's strength at this time was 39 officers and 642 other ranks.|$|E
