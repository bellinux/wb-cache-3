5|$|Early on, Banff {{was popular}} with wealthy European and American tourists, the former of which arrived in Canada via trans-Atlantic luxury liner and {{continued}} westward <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad.</b> Some visitors participated in mountaineering activities, often hiring local guides. Guides Jim and Bill Brewster founded {{one of the}} first outfitters in Banff. From 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada organized climbs, hikes and camps in the park.|$|E

5|$|The Disneyland Railroad today {{operates}} {{four sets}} of train cars, {{as well as a}} parlor car. The combine car from the railroad's former Retlaw 1 passenger train, one of the DRR's two original train sets, was Walt Disney's favorite train car <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad,</b> as it brought back memories from his youth working as a news butcher on the Missouri Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Alaska Railroad was completed in 1922, but by the 1930s, due to effects of the Great Depression, freight traffic declined <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad.</b> In 1935, the Alaska Road Commission tried to force shippers to use the railroad, and raised the toll at the Tanana ferry crossing to almost 10 dollars a ton. The truckers rebelled at this, with some violent skirmishes. Pirate ferry operations were started, lasting until the start of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Although most Chinese {{workers in}} 1880 were {{employed}} in the coal mines around Wyoming and Sweetwater County, the Chinese in Rock Springs worked mostly in occupations outside of mining. In addition to Chinese laborers and miners, a professional gambler, a priest, a cook, and a barber resided in the city. In Green River, Wyoming, there was a Chinese doctor. Chinese servants and waiters found work in Green River and in Fort Washakie. In Atlantic City, Miner's Delight, and Red Canyon, Wyoming, Chinese gold miners were employed. However, {{the majority of the}} 193 Chinese residing in Sweetwater County by 1880 worked in the coal mines or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad.</b>|$|E

5|$|In May 1905, {{after two}} years of negotiations, American-Hawaiian signed a {{contract}} with the Tehuantepec National Railway of Mexico, abandoning the Straits of Magellan route in favor of the Tehuantepec Route. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route would arrive at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, for westbound cargo—and would traverse the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico's narrowest point, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad.</b> Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were more general in nature.|$|E
5|$|The Macdonald family {{obtained}} complete {{ownership of}} the park in 1951. After leaving Idlewild, the Mellon family also abandoned the Ligonier Valley Railroad, in decline after the closing of area coal mines and decreased passenger traffic. The railroad ceased operations in 1952. Although the park originally depended <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad,</b> its closing had no effect. In 1913, the Lincoln Highway had been established as the first cross-country auto route, stretching from Times Square, New York City, to Lincoln Park, San Francisco. It passed directly by Idlewild on what is now U.S. Route 30. As automobile traffic to the park increased, several parking lots and a Gulf Oil gas station, a Mellon company, were added in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The town of Siliguri, {{the start}} of the railway route, was {{connected}} with Calcutta (now Kolkata) via railway in 1878, while the additional journey to Darjeeling required the use of tongas (horse-driven carts) along a dust track. On the recommendations of a committee appointed by Sir Ashley Eden, work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> began in 1879 and was completed by July 1881. The line underwent several improvements such as making gradients more gradual over the years to increase manoeuvrability. By 1909–1910, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway was carrying roughly 174,000 passengers and 47,000 tons of goods annually.|$|E

5|$|Berkshire Division service {{began to}} decline before World War II, when {{increased}} automobile availability reduced the appeal of travel by train. The line had always used the oldest equipment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad,</b> and all trains except one weekly round trip lost their parlor cars in 1940 and 1942. In January 1960, profitable railway post office service was ended due to unsuitable schedules, and starting in March 1960 all trains except two weekend through round trips were run by single Budd RDCs and truncated to Danbury where passengers could change for local trains to New York. In November 1960, the New Haven moved its station services from Union Station to a converted freight house slightly to the east to save money, leaving the B alone in the station. In March 1964, the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized the NYNH to cut all Berkshire Division services except the weekend trips.|$|E
5|$|From 26 to 29 March, the division's 789th Regiment and the 143rd Rifle Brigade, with tank support, {{attacked}} the German strongpoint of Koy-Asan. The 789th advanced two kilometers, entered Koy-Asan, {{and opened fire}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> bridge. However, the Soviet troops were unable to completely take the strong point. On 31 March, Lvov ordered the army to transition to echeloned defense, and the 390th {{was placed in the}} rear echelon. Around this time, Zakian was mortally wounded by a shell fragment at his command post, and died on 2 April. Colonel Ivan Lyudnikov took command on 1 April, and seventeen days later was replaced by Colonel Hmayak Babayan. In late April the Chairman of the Presidium of the Armenian SSR Supreme Soviet, Matsak Papian, presented the division with a battle flag. Around this time, at the insistence of the Crimean Front commissar Lev Mekhlis, all troops were concentrated into one single defensive line with few reserves.|$|E
5|$|The Altoona & Wopsononock {{initially}} owned two engines. #1 was a National 2-6-0, and #2 a Baldwin 4-4-0, both {{of which}} were purchased used from the Pittsburgh and Western Railroad. In 1892, the Altoona, Clearfield & Northern bought #3, a Baldwin 4-6-0. However, due to the depleted state of the railroad's finances, it was unable to pay for #3. Samuel Langdon forestalled legal proceedings by having the locomotive transferred to his United Collieries Co., which paid Baldwin in coal. Nothing is known of #4, if it ever existed. The Altoona & Beech Creek bought #5 and #6, both Baldwin 2-6-0s, in 1901, while still under Pittsburg, Johnstown, Ebensburg & Eastern control. After the PJE lost its lease <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad,</b> litigation ensued over the ownership of #3; by the time the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania declared in favor of the A in 1903, United Collieries had sold it to the Surry, Sussex and Southampton Railroad. #5 and #6 were sold to the Ohio River and Western Railroad and the Tacajo Sugar Company, respectively, when the railroad was converted to standard gauge in 1916.|$|E

5|$|Waller {{was also}} {{involved}} in matters related the local railroads. On October 3, 1877, he sold some of his land in Bloomsburg to the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{for the purpose of}} a new railroad station. He was {{also involved in}} the building of the North and West Branch Railway between 1880 and 1881. He started raising money for this railroad in 1872 and broke the ground for the railroad in March 1872. Waller put most of his money into the building of the North and West Branch Railway. The work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>railroad</b> stopped during the Panic of 1873 but resumed in 1880. The North and West Branch Railway Company was sold in 1881 but he managed to regain much of the company. The company was leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad on November 23, 1881, but remained its own company for approximately 20 years. He was president of the North and West Branch Railway in the 1880s. In 1888, he sold a piece of land to the town of Bloomsburg for the purpose of building the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad through it. It was he who initially conceived the idea of the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad. Waller also successfully convinced the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad to move its Bloomsburg station to his land on Market Street.|$|E
