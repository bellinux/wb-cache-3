5|$|Beginning around September10, heavy {{rainfall}} occurred sporadically in southern Mexico and into Central America, {{influenced by a}} broader storm system related to Hurricane Floyd. Toward the end of September, {{heavy rainfall}} occurred in the mountains <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Mexico, which prompted officials to open flood gates. The rains occurred throughout Mexico {{for about two weeks}} before the worst of the precipitation began, and saturated soils before the heaviest rainfall in October.|$|E
5|$|In 729, after a mixed {{performance}} {{against the}} Khazars, Maslamah was replaced yet again {{as governor of}} Armenia and Adharbayjan by al-Jarrah. For all his energy, Maslamah's campaigning failed to produce the desired results: {{by the time of}} his dismissal, the Arabs had lost control <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Transcaucasia and been thrust once more into the defensive, with al-Jarrah again having to defend Adharbayjan against a Khazar invasion.|$|E

5|$|Labrador is the easternmost {{part of the}} Canadian Shield, a vast area {{of ancient}} {{metamorphic}} rock comprising much <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> North America. Colliding tectonic plates have shaped much of the geology of Newfoundland. Gros Morne National Park has a reputation of being an outstanding example of tectonics at work, and as such has been designated a World Heritage Site. The Long Range Mountains on Newfoundland's west coast are the northeasternmost extension of the Appalachian Mountains.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1861, {{just days}} before the end of their 90-day term of service, the 5th Massachusetts took part in the First Battle of Bull Run, the first major {{engagement}} of Civil War. Before their departure from Alexandria, Major General Irvin McDowell, commanding the Union Army <b>of</b> <b>Northeastern</b> Virginia, addressed the 5th Massachusetts and, in light of their term of service being nearly at an end, offered them the option of foregoing the campaign. The 5th Massachusetts voted unanimously to go with McDowell's army. Assigned to the First Brigade (Franklin’s), Third Division (Heintzelman’s) of the Army <b>of</b> <b>Northeastern</b> Virginia, the 5th Massachusetts was among those units sent to probe the Confederate right flank on July 18 resulting in the Battle of Blackburn's Ford. When this maneuver failed, McDowell opted to send a large portion of his forces on a wide flanking maneuver across Sudley Springs Ford, hoping to get around the Confederate left flank. On July 21, precisely three months after they departed Boston, the 5th Massachusetts crossed Sudley Springs Ford and participated in pitched combat on Henry House Hill.|$|E
5|$|The Anthracite regions <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Pennsylvania, {{including}} {{the cities of}} Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, and Hazleton, had an influx of miners to {{the area in the}} 1800s and brought the pasty with them. To this day, pasties are still a local favourite. In 1981, a Pennsylvania entrepreneur started marketing pasties under the brand name Mr. Pastie.|$|E

5|$|The Glover's pika {{species is}} endemic to China. It {{is found in}} high altitudes <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Tibet, southwestern Qinghai, western Sichuan, and northwestern Yunnan. The {{nominate}} subspecies O. g. gloveri is found in western Sichuan, O. g. brookei is found in southwestern Qinghai and northeastern Tibet, and O. g. calloceps is found in northwestern Yunnan and eastern Tibet.|$|E
5|$|As {{its name}} implies, Parasaurolophus was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} closely related to Saurolophus because of its superficially similar crest. However, it was soon reassessed {{as a member of}} the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids—Saurolophus is an hadrosaurine. It is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of the lambeosaurines, distinct from the helmet-crested Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, and Lambeosaurus. Its closest known relative appears to be Charonosaurus, a lambeosaurine with a similar skull (but no complete crest yet) from the Amur region <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> China, and the two may form a clade Parasaurolophini. P. cyrtocristatus, with its short, rounder crest, may be the most basal of the three known Parasaurolophus species, or it may represent subadult or female specimens of P. tubicen.|$|E
5|$|Fort Runyon {{was named}} for Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon, a native of New Jersey who {{commanded}} {{one of the first}} brigades of volunteers from that state. Later named commander of the Fourth Division of the Army <b>of</b> <b>Northeastern</b> Virginia, he led that force into the First Battle of Bull Run, and served as commander for {{the first three years of}} the war. In 1864, he was elected mayor of Newark, New Jersey, and was later named the U.S. Ambassador to Germany.|$|E

5|$|Glover's pika (Ochotona gloveri) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Ochotonidae. It was first {{described}} in 1922, by Michael Rogers Oldfield Thomas. The summer dorsal pelage is grayish rufous, grayish brown, or tea brown in colour. The winter pelage {{is similar to the}} summer pelage, but is lighter in tone. Endemic to China, it is found in high altitudes <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Tibet, southwestern Qinghai, western Sichuan, and northwestern Yunnan. It is a generalist herbivore, and is known to construct haypiles. It is rated as {{a species of}}least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature. It is also regionally red listed as least concern in China.|$|E
5|$|In May 2014, remote {{cameras in}} the Rogue River – Siskiyou National Forest {{captured}} photographs of OR-7 along with a female wolf who might have mated with him. A month later, biologists from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the ODFW returned to southwest Oregon, photographed two wolf pups, and took fecal samples for DNA testing to determine {{the relationship of the}} pups to OR-7. By September, tests run at the University of Idaho confirmed that OR-7's mate is a wolf, that the two pups are their offspring, and that the mate is related to the wolves in the Minam and Snake River packs <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Oregon.|$|E
5|$|In the Canadian {{portion of}} the Columbia Basin, almost half of {{which is part of}} the Kootenay River basin, there are 447 species of {{terrestrial}} vertebrates. Most of the Kootenay basin lies within the Columbia Glaciated ecoregion which encompasses much <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Washington, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana and southern British Columbia. Fish fauna in the region are largely shared with those of the Columbia Unglaciated ecoregion to the south, which has about fifty species of fish and only one endemic species. There are no endemic fish within the Columbia Glaciated region itself.|$|E

5|$|Members of the {{nuthatch}} family live {{in most of}} North America and Europe {{and throughout}} Asia down to the Wallace Line. Nuthatches are sparsely represented in Africa; one species lives in a small area <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Algeria and a population of the Eurasian nuthatch subspecies, S. e. hispaniensis, lives {{in the mountains of}} Morocco. Most species are resident year-round. The only significant migrant is the red-breasted nuthatch, which winters widely across North America, deserting the northernmost parts of its breeding range in Canada; it has been recorded as a vagrant in Bermuda, Iceland and England.|$|E
5|$|NY268 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY5 in the hamlet of Clarence {{in the town}} of the same name. It headed north, following Salt Road out of the hamlet and into a mostly rural area <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Erie County. Here, the route intersected with several east–west highways of local importance and passed by Beeman Creek Park before meeting Tonawanda Creek Road at a junction on the southern bank of Tonawanda Creek. The highway turned west at this junction, following Tonawanda Creek Road {{along the edge of the}} creek to the Clarence–Amherst town line, where NY268 ended at a junction with NY78 in the hamlet of Millersport.|$|E
5|$|Runyon {{was built}} {{immediately}} after the entry of Union forces into Virginia on May 24, 1861, on the land of James Roach, a Washington building contractor. Fort Runyon was the largest fort in the ring of defenses that protected Washington during the Civil War and was named after Brigadier General Theodore Runyon, commander of the Fourth Division of the Army <b>of</b> <b>Northeastern</b> Virginia during the First Battle of Bull Run. Union soldiers garrisoned the fort until its dismantling {{following the end of}} the Civil War in 1865. Today, no trace of the fort remains on the site, which is now exit 9 on Interstate 395, though a historical marker has been constructed by the Arlington Historical Society.|$|E

5|$|Termite populations can be {{substantially}} impacted by environmental changes including those caused by human intervention. A Brazilian {{study investigated the}} termite assemblages of three sites of Caatinga under different levels of anthropogenic disturbance in the semi-arid region <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Brazil were sampled using 65 x 2 m transects. A total of 26 species of termites {{were present in the}} three sites, and 196 encounters were recorded in the transects. The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundaries}} of most counties in Arizona {{do not follow}} the northern boundary of the Gadsden Purchase, but six counties in Arizona do have most of their populations within {{the land of the}} Gadsden Purchase. Four of these also contain areas north of the Gadsden Purchase, but these areas do have low population densities, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Pinal County, Arizona, including the towns of Apache Junction and Florence. Maricopa County also extends south into the area of the Gadsden Purchase, but this area is also thinly populated. Tucson is the largest city in the Gadsden Purchase.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} tornado, later named the Lone Grove Tornado, first touched down in southeast Jefferson County, Oklahoma at 6:48pm CST (00:48UTC) near the Red River. The tornado crossed through {{rural areas as}} it moved to the northeast into Love County, before going into Carter County at 7:10pm CST (01:10UTC). The tornado continued moving to the northeast for the next 15 minutes before striking Lone Grove, Oklahoma. The tornado then crossed Interstate 35 {{just north of the}} Prairie Valley Road exit ramp and tracked through rural areas <b>of</b> <b>northeastern</b> Carter County to the east of Springer, ending at 7:43pm CST (01:43UTC).|$|E
