5|$|Feminist {{jurisprudence}} signifies {{a reaction}} to the philosophical approach of modern legal scholars, who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals.

5|$|Hell money: Hell {{money is}} a form of joss paper printed to {{resemble}} fake legal tender bank notes. The notes are not an official form of recognized currency <b>or</b> <b>legal</b> tender since their sole intended purpose is to be offered as burnt offerings to the deceased as a superstitious solution to resolve their ancestors financial problems. This custom has been practiced by the modern Chinese and across East Asia since the late 19th century.|$|E

5|$|Items 77–81 in {{the code}} have been {{interpreted}} as {{a description of a}} woman's financial rights after a divorce <b>or</b> <b>legal</b> separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 2015, the PMDT {{announced}} it would cease further development of Project M, effective immediately, in favor of beginning development on an original project. The development team denied allegations that legal threats from Nintendo were {{the cause of the}} project's termination. According to the team's attorney and business consultant, Ryan Morrison, the decision was not made {{as a result of a}} cease-and-desist notice <b>or</b> <b>legal</b> action by Nintendo. One member of the development team stated that the mod's cancellation was to prevent future legal issues.|$|E

In November 2012 the High Court turned down Bamber's application for a judicial review of that decision.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{terms for}} classifying individuals of low intelligence were medical <b>or</b> <b>legal</b> terms {{that preceded the}} development of IQ testing. The legal system recognized a concept of some individuals being so cognitively impaired {{that they were not}} responsible for criminal behavior. Medical doctors sometimes encountered adult patients who could not live independently, being unable {{to take care of their}} own daily living needs. Various terms were used to attempt to classify individuals with varying degrees of intellectual disability. Many of the earliest terms are now considered very offensive.|$|E
5|$|In 1625, James VI {{died and}} was succeeded {{by his son}} Charles I. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from his {{northern}} kingdom, with his first visit being for his Scottish coronation in 1633, when he was crowned in St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh with full Anglican rites. Charles had relatively few important Scots in his circle and relied heavily in Scottish matters on the generally mistrusted and often indecisive James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton and the bishops, particularly John Spottiswood, Archbishop of St. Andrews, eventually making him chancellor. At {{the beginning of his}} reign, Charles' revocation of alienated lands since 1542 helped secure the finances of the kirk, but it threatened the holdings of the nobility who had gained from the Reformation settlement. His pushing through of legislation and refusal to hear (<b>or</b> <b>legal</b> pursuit of) those raising objections, created further resentment among the nobility. In England his religious policies caused similar resentment and he ruled without calling a parliament from 1629.|$|E
5|$|Seats are {{allocated}} on {{a regional}} basis, {{each of the}} four major regions receives 24seats, and the remainder of the available seats being assigned to smaller regions. The four major regions are Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island), and the Western provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan). The seats for Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Yukon, and Nunavut are assigned apart from these regional divisions. The province of Quebec has 24 Senate divisions that are constitutionally mandated. In all other provinces, a Senate division is strictly an optional designation of the senator's own choosing, and has no real constitutional <b>or</b> <b>legal</b> standing. A senator who does not choose a special senate division is considered a senator for the province at large. The distribution of seats has been criticized for not being proportional per region. For example, Ontario has 40 percent of Canada's population but only 24seats, while the smaller Atlantic provinces have a combined 30, and British Columbia, the third most populous province, only has six seats.|$|E

5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political <b>or</b> <b>legal</b> change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries. This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, the beneficiaries are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, {{historian}} Enrique Ramírez Brau {{speculated that}} Cofresí {{may have had}} Jewish ancestry. A theory, held by David Cuesta and historian Úrsula Acosta (a member of the Puerto Rican Genealogy Society), held that the name Kupferstein ("copper stone") may have been chosen by his family when the 18th-century European Jewish population adopted surnames. The theory was later discarded when their research uncovered a complete family tree prepared by Cofresí's cousin, Luigi de Jenner, indicating that their name was spelled Kupferschein (not Kupferstein). Originally from Prague, Cofresí paternal patriarch Cristoforo Kupferschein received a recognition and coat of arms from Ferdinand I of Austria in December 1549 and eventually moved to Trieste. His last name was probably adapted {{from the town of}} Kufstein. After its arrival, the family became one of Trieste's early settlers. Cristoforo's son Felice was recognized as a noble in 1620, becoming Edler von Kupferschein. The family gained prestige and became one of the city's wealthiest, with the next generation receiving the best possible education and marrying into other influential families. Cofresí's grandfather, Giovanni Stanislao Kupferschein, held several offices in the police, military and municipal administration. According to Acosta, Cofresí's father Francesco received a lateinschule education and left at age 19 for Frankfurt (probably in search of a university <b>or</b> <b>legal</b> practice). In Frankfurt he mingled with influential figures such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, returning to Trieste two years later.|$|E
5|$|More than 40years {{before the}} {{creation}} of the National Park Service, Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872, as the world's first national park. Between 1872 and 1886, the park was administered by the Interior Department and was managed by a civilian superintendent with limited resources <b>or</b> <b>legal</b> authority to maintain and protect the park's natural features and wildlife, or to deal with poaching, vandalism and other destructive activities. Over the next decade, special interest groups such as concessionaires, railroad and mining interests attempted to commercialize and privatize park lands. The poorly funded Interior Department was unable to prevent degradation of the park and in some circumstances, was complicit with special interest groups. Senator George Vest led efforts to prevent railroads and other special interests from misusing the resource, and along with other members of Congress believed that only the military could effectively protect the park. A study of the situation and amendments to the Yellowstone Park Act proposed by Senator Vest resulted in the Sundry Civil Appropriations Bill of 1883 which allowed the Interior Department to transfer control of the park to the War Department, thereby protecting Yellowstone from schemes to commercialize the park.|$|E
