5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> while trying to walk, causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E

5|$|Maggie is the {{youngest}} child of Homer and Marge, and sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking on her red pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> (this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she cannot talk. She is a counterpart to Lisa Simpson. However, she did appear to talk in the first Tracey Ullman Show short.|$|E
5|$|To {{the right}} of the painting, daemons drag terrified women away. The woman in the lower right hand corner turns to see flames {{reflected}} {{in the eyes of the}} daemon who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Colfax's gaze rested languidly <b>on</b> <b>her</b> niece's <b>faces</b> which {{glowed with}} indignation.|$|R
5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby {{character}} that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted to show any emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1999, Kouao took Climbié to Cameron's house, {{asking her}} to take Climbié {{permanently}} because Manning did not want her. Cameron refused but agreed to take her for the night. Cameron, her son Patrick, and her daughter Avril, observed that Climbié had numerous injuries—including a burn <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and a loose piece of skin hanging from her right eyelid—which Kouao said was self-inflicted. Manning's account in the subsequent inquiry differed {{and he said that}} he hit Climbié because of her incontinence, beginning with slaps, but progressing to using his fist by the end of July. It was highly likely that at least some of the injuries were the result of deliberate physical harm.|$|E
5|$|The Sugababes {{are shown}} {{standing}} {{together in the}} next scene, where they are presented in a dark environment and covered in glitter. Range is represented as the season of autumn, and is decorated with a leaf motif <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> as well as hair that resembles tree branches. The subsequent clip depicts Berrabah in a winter environment. The group is shown together for a second time, although in a natural environment. The next scenes depict Buchanan in the centre of a large purple flower, and leaves blowing past Range. Towards {{the end of the}} video, the Sugababes are shown in the same dark environment and eventually in their solo settings. Mickey McMonagle from the Sunday Mail praised the group's seasonal outfits in the video.|$|E

60|$|Geraldine's embarrassment {{was obvious}} {{and there were}} signs of {{amusement}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> father's <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|Martin looked {{with admiration}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> glowing <b>face,</b> {{and pressed his}} lips to hers.|$|R
5|$|The first chorus has Koda {{walking through}} the land, and scenes of her singing. She grabs a compass, {{but it does not}} {{function}} properly. She grabs a drinking bottle, but only filled with little droplets; she tries to drink it, but falls all <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> instead. As she sings the song; {{by the end of the}} second chorus, black projectile smoke is scene falling from the sky in the distance and hits parts of the abandoned city. As more smoke falls and black leaves con-stellate, Koda collapses and sings the bridge on the ground. When the bridge section ends, rocks start levitating and the smoke rises, forming a black Dust devil in the distance. As more dust devil's form, they become large and closely devour Koda.|$|E
5|$|The {{limestone}} {{sculpture of}} Seneb {{and his family}} {{is part of the}} collection of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. It depicts Seneb and his wife sitting next to each other with their children in the lower register. Seneb is depicted sitting cross-legged on a block of stone with his arms folded in a position characteristic of a scribe. His wife Senet sits alongside him, wearing a long robe with long sleeves and a wig covering her natural hair, which can be glimpsed on her forehead. She encircles him with her arms in a gesture of affection and support. She is shown with a slight smile <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> to signify her contentment and happiness.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that holes in the skulls of several {{specimens}} that were previously explained by intraspecific attacks might {{have been caused by}} Trichomonas-like parasites that commonly infect avians. Further evidence of intraspecific attack were found by Joseph Peterson and his colleagues in the juvenile Tyrannosaurus nicknamed Jane. Peterson and his team found that Jane's skull showed healed puncture wounds on the upper jaw and snout which they believe came from another juvenile Tyrannosaurus. Subsequent CT scans of Jane's skull would further confirm the team's hypothesis, showing that the puncture wounds came from a traumatic injury and that there was subsequent healing. The team would also state that Jane's injuries were structurally different from the parasite-induced lesions found in Sue and that Jane's injuries were <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> whereas the parasite that infected Sue caused lesions to the lower jaw.|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise {{turned to}} the speaker with an earnest look <b>on</b> <b>her</b> sweet <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was {{wonderful}} to stand and <b>face</b> <b>her</b> there, and see her real and living with the warm sunlight <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> and <b>her</b> <b>face</b> one glowing tenderness. We clasped hands; all the warm life of our hands met and clung and parted.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} {{turned and looked}} <b>on</b> <b>her</b> happy <b>face</b> {{with a sort of}} {{twilight}} smile.|$|R
5|$|It {{begins with}} a young girl playing in the {{backyard}} as snow falls on the ground. The scene shifts {{to that of a}} bedside, where a young woman who has died, lies. Her husband covers her with a white sheet as a priest prays. Madonna, wearing a long, black coat, sings the song underneath a snow-covered, dead tree, as the young girl plays with her dead mother's jewelry. The husband comes and shouts at the girl, tearing away the woman's pearl necklace which drop at the little girl's feet. The adult Madonna is shown lying beside another man singing the song as the little girl visits her mother's grave. The man gets up and slaps Madonna in the face, as the little girl cries in front of the grave. She is taken away from the graveyard by her father, as interspersed scenes show the girl being kissed by her mother, her trying to reach the knob of a door, and Madonna powdering the bruise mark <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E

In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes.

5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E
