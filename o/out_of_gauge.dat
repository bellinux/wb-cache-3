40|$|The {{deformations}} of higher-spin symmetries {{induced by}} cubic interactions of symmetric massless bosonic fields are analyzed within the metric-like formalism. Our analysis amends the existing classification according to gauge-algebra deformations {{taking into account}} also gauge-transformation deformations. In particular, we identify a class of couplings which leave the gauge algebra Abelian but deform one (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> three) <b>gauge</b> transformation, and another class of couplings which deform all three gauge transformations in (A) dS but only two in the flat-space limit. The former class is related to higher-spin algebra multiplets (representations of the global algebra) together with the massless-massive-massive couplings which we also briefly discuss. The latter class is what makes (A) dS a distinguished background for higher-spin interactions and includes in particular the gravitational interactions of higher-spin fields, retrospectively accounting for the Fradkin-Vasiliev solution to the Aragone-Deser problem.
