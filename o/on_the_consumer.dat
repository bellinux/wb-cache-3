5|$|Nokian Tyres {{concentrates}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> car and vehicle tyre replacement and premium {{snow tyre}} markets; {{they do not}} supply automobile manufacturers tyres for new car production. The greater prices consistently found in those markets result in higher profitability compared {{to the rest of}} the tyre industry. The company also produces retreading materials and tyre pressure monitors. It also previously manufactured bicycle tyres but currently licenses the Nokian name on bicycles tyres to another Finnish company. The Vianor retail tyre store chain, which services cars in addition to selling tyres, is owned by Nokian Tyres PLC.|$|E
5|$|PTC {{was founded}} in 1995 by {{longtime}} political activist L. Brent Bozell III. Bozell is a prominent conservative activist who has, among other things, served as Executive Director of the Conservative Victory Committee, a political action committee that has supported the election of dozens of conservative candidates {{over the past ten}} years. He was also National Finance Chairman for Pat Buchanan's 1992 presidential campaign, and later president of the National Conservative Political Action Committee. Bozell was succeeded as PTC President by Timothy F. Winter. Winter served as Executive Director of the PTC for three years prior to becoming president. Prior to joining the PTC, Mr. Winter's 20-year career as a media executive included positions with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and NBC. Until 2015 when his position was terminated, Dan Isett, Director of Corporate and Government Affairs of the PTC, represented the PTC <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> Advisory Committee of the Federal Communications Commission.|$|E

5|$|Warren was {{an early}} {{advocate}} {{for the creation of}} a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bureau was established by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, President Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> Financial Protection Bureau to set up the new agency. While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups pushed for Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, Warren was strongly opposed by financial institutions and by Republican members of Congress who believed Warren would be an overly zealous regulator. Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director, Obama turned to former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray and in January 2012, over the objections of Republican senators, appointed Cordray to the post in a recess appointment.|$|E

50|$|The {{perceived}} {{richness of}} an online store {{must be considered}} when analyzing online buying content. <b>The</b> <b>consumer's</b> web experience, income and trust in the online store have a significant positive effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer's</b> intent of making online purchases. A consumer's Web experience has a significant positive effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> perceived richness of the online store, whereas the perceived risk related {{to the use of}} the online store has a significant negative effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer's</b> trust in an attitude towards the online store. According to media richness theory, an online store will be more efficient for analyzable tasks and a bricks-and-mortar store for unanalyzable tasks.|$|R

25|$|Expanding {{intermittent}} electrical {{sources such}} as wind power, creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental super grids costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, {{there are a variety}} of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittentcy, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a smart grid.|$|E

Greenpeace also claims that Coca-Cola has actively lobbied against recycling and deposit return schemes in several European countries, {{while at the same}} time maintaining a green marketing facade with vague promises and false-solutions such as sizable donations to schemes that put the emphasis of anti-littering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer,</b> instead of the producer of the litter itself.|$|E

25|$|Marshall's idea {{of solving}} the {{controversy}} was that the demand curve could be derived by aggregating individual consumer demand curves, which were themselves based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> problem of maximizing utility. The supply curve could be derived by superimposing a representative firm supply curves for the factors of production and then market equilibrium would be given by the intersection of demand and supply curves. He also introduced the notion of different market periods: mainly Long run and short run. This set of ideas gave way to what economists call perfect competition, now found in the standard microeconomics texts, even though Marshall himself was highly skeptical {{it could be used}} as general model of all markets.|$|E
500|$|The Committee is {{responsible}} for formulating the United Kingdom's monetary policy, most commonly via {{the setting of the}} rate at it which it lends to banks (officially the Bank of England Base Rate or BOEBR for short). As laid out in law, decisions are made with a primary aim of price stability, defined by the government's inflation target (2% per year <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> Price Index as of 2016). The target {{takes the form of a}} [...] "point", rather than the [...] "band" [...] used by the Treasury prior to 1997. The secondary aim of the Committee is to support the government's economic policies, and help it meet its targets for growth and employment. That secondary aim was reinforced by then Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in his March 2013 budget, with the MPC given more discretion to more openly [...] "trade off" [...] above-rate inflation in the medium run to boost other economic indicators. The MPC is not responsible for fiscal policy, which is handled by the Treasury itself, but is briefed by the Treasury about fiscal policy developments at meetings.|$|E
2500|$|A {{payday loan}} (also called a payday advance, salary loan, payroll loan, small dollar loan, short term, or cash advance loan) is a small, {{short-term}} unsecured loan, [...] "regardless of whether repayment of loans {{is linked to}} a borrower's payday." [...] The loans are also {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "cash advances," [...] though that term can also refer to cash provided against a prearranged line of credit such as a credit card. Payday advance loans rely <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> having previous payroll and employment records. Legislation regarding payday loans varies widely between different countries, and in federal systems, between different states or provinces.|$|E

50|$|In the T-Cash model, {{the mobile}} phone {{and the phone}} carrier is the {{front-end}} interface to <b>the</b> <b>consumers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>consumer</b> can purchase goods, transfer money to a peer, cash out, and cash in. A 'mini wallet' account can be opened as simply as entering *700# <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mobile phone, presumably by depositing money at a participating local merchant and the mobile phone number. Presumably, other transactions are similarly accomplished by entering special codes and the phone number of <b>the</b> other party <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer's</b> mobile phone.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the figure}} 2 to the left, B1, B2 and B3 are the {{different}} budget lines and I1, I2 and I3 are the indifference curves {{that are available}} to the consumer. As shown earlier, as the income of the consumer rises, the budget line moves outwards parallel to itself. In this case, from initial bundle X*, with an increase in the income of the consumer the budget line moves from B1 to B2 and the consumer would choose X' bundle and subsequently, with a further rise in consumer's income the budget line moves from B2 to B3 and the consumer would choose X" [...] bundle and so <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> <b>consumer</b> would thus maximize his utility at the points X*, X' and X", and by joining these points, the income-consumption curve can be obtained.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the behest}} of American {{newspaper}} publisher William Randolph Hearst, whose media empire was the major commercial backer of the project with four staffers among the flight's nine passengers, the Grafs [...] "Round-the-World" [...] (Weltrundfahrt 1929) flight in August 1929 officially began and ended at Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey. As {{with many of the}} airship's other flights, however, its expenses were also heavily offset by the carriage of souvenir mail to and/or from [...] Lakehurst, Friedrichshafen, Tokyo, and Los Angeles. A U.S. franked letter flown on the whole trip from Lakehurst to Lakehurst, for instance, required US$3.55 in postage or the equivalent of roughly $45 in current dollars if based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Consumer</b> price index. The $200,000 Hearst paid for exclusive media rights would currently be the equivalent of $2.5 million if figured on the same basis.|$|E
2500|$|One {{issue with}} the consumer's {{relationship}} with CSR {{is that it is}} much more complex than it first appears. In their paper <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> and CSR, Janssen and Vanhamme [...] looked into a phenomenon that they termed the [...] "CSR-Consumer Paradox". This describes the mismatch that occurs where consumers report that they would only buy from companies with good social responsibility. For instance, a survey by Cohn & Wolfe found that globally over 60% of consumers want to buy from responsible companies. However, Janssen and Vanhamme reported that less than 4% of average household expenditure in the UK in 2010 was ethical. This indicates that there is a clear discrepancy between consumer beliefs and intentions, and actual consumer behaviour, so that {{when it comes down to}} their actual purchase behaviour, CSR has a much lesser impact than consumers initially say it does.|$|E
