25|$|Yeah sure, we see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, {{the whole}} area {{set out for the}} great {{discussion}} of open-mind and concept innovation, to develop along the River, to run markets along road and develop industry in town. This has played {{an active role in the}} development of the agricultural industry, market construction and township industries. From 1994 to 1995, the area set out for further discussion of the <b>open</b> <b>mind,</b> by exploring the idea of the satisfaction of primary achievement, fixing the problem of poverty, trying to fix environmental issues, enhance the awareness of various crises, competitiveness, promotion, foreign development and pragmatism.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{scientific}} method as conceived in the 17th century, natural and artificial circumstances were set aside as a research tradition of systematic experimentation was slowly accepted by {{the scientific}} community. The philosophy of using an inductive approach to obtain knowledge — to abandon assumption and to attempt to observe with an <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> — was {{in contrast with the}} earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction, by which analysis of known facts produced further understanding. In practice, many scientists and philosophers believed that a healthy mix of both was needed — the willingness to question assumptions, yet also to interpret observations assumed to have some degree of validity.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} a court {{descending}} into the arena and depriving a party {{of the right to}} a fair trial was also distinguished from that of prejudgment, as in Roseli bin Amat v. Public Prosecutor (1989). When a judge is found to have prejudged, he will not have an <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> and is likely to have determined issues adversely against a party before the presentation of a case. However, when he descends into the arena, he may not necessarily have taken sides before the hearing. The difference may lie in how actively the judge pursues this position and how he comes to be persuaded.|$|E
25|$|On January 24, his {{nomination}} was voted {{out of the}} Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Democratic Senators characterized Alito as a hard right conservative in the mold of a Clarence Thomas or Robert Bork. Alito professed reluctance to commit to any type of ideology, stating he would act as an impartial referee. On the abortion issue, he stated that he would look at that with an <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> but would not state how he would rule on Roe v. Wade if that issue were to come up before the court. Some pro-life activists, however, claim Alito's confirmation as a victory for their cause.|$|E

In March 2007, Netball Australia chief executive Kate Palmer said the preferred model was for one team each from New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. In April this was confirmed as {{the composition of}} the league's Australian teams. Netball New South Wales boss Caroline Campbell said that she was disappointed that the Sydney Swifts and the Hunter Jaegers would have to merge. Netball Victoria president Jenny Sanchez said that she had an <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> about whether Victoria would enter one of the two existing teams or a new franchise, but by May 2007, the organisation had chosen to enter a single merged team. Netball ACT also bid for a franchise, but were unsuccessful.|$|E

25|$|Kala (Susanne Blakeslee) - If his woes {{become too}} great or his {{thoughts}} too burdensome, Tarzan seeks seclusion and the calm council of his gorilla mother, Kala. A sympathetic ear when Tarzan needs someone wise to talk to, Kala {{acts as the}} voice of the apes, always reminding Tarzan of his unique obligations to the family. She is also Jane's closest confidant. The two share a warm, strong bond, and Jane regards her mother-in-law as her only kindred spirit in the jungle. From Kala's point of view, Jane is the human daughter she never had. Kala was Kerchak's mate, and perhaps the only one besides Tarzan that ever openly defied him without repercussions. Her <b>open</b> <b>mind</b> is a well of great wisdom and she is almost always right. Even though Kerchak is gone, she is still highly respected. Although kind and motherly to Tarzan, Jane, and all the gorillas, Kala is almost undoubtedly the bravest gorilla in the family. When the family was trapped in a cave by Tublat, Kala bravely stood up to the villain, and encouraged all the other gorillas to be brave as well. Her presence and support keeps the family together and ensures that they are always there for each other even in the most dire situations.|$|E
