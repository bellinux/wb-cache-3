5|$|Appendages: Two pairs <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> {{normally}} present. The forewings are modified into short smooth, veinless tegmina. Hindwings are membranous and semicircular with veins radiating outwards.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
5|$|Wings: Two pairs <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> {{are present}} in almost all taxa. The wings have very few cross-veins.|$|E

5|$|Immature {{insects that}} go through {{incomplete}} metamorphosis are called nymphs {{or in the}} case of dragonflies and damselflies, also naiads. Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the presence <b>of</b> <b>wings,</b> which are not developed until adulthood. With each molt, nymphs grow larger and become more similar in appearance to adult insects.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets <b>of</b> <b>wings,</b> direct flight muscles, and no ability to fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> or two pairs functioning as a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|The Givaudan Fragrances Corporation Creative Fragrances Centre, a {{division}} of Givaudan, was constructed in 1972 from a design by Der Scutt, architect of the Trump Tower. Givaudan Roure vacated the building in 2009 and the facility was acquired by World <b>of</b> <b>Wings,</b> which renovated the building {{for use as a}} butterfly exhibition aimed at families.|$|E
40|$|An {{optimization}} method {{consisting of}} genetic and evolution optimization algorithm and a solver using nonlinear aerodynamics was applied on design <b>of</b> low-speed <b>wing.</b> Geometric parameterization <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> uses standard geometric quantities commonly {{used for the}} description <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> geomtery.

5000|$|Telescoping wing: {{the outer}} section <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> telescopes over or within the inner section <b>of</b> <b>wing,</b> varying span, aspect ratio and wing area, as {{used on the}} FS-29 TF glider. The Makhonine Mak-123 was an early example.|$|R
5|$|When {{taking off}} from the ground the flight is ungainly, with much {{flapping}} <b>of</b> <b>wings.</b> The bird's black wingtips are visible while {{it is in the}} air and once it gathers speed, its flight is much more graceful and it often ascends to great heights. Here it may be barely discernible as it wheels in great circles, sometimes emitting its hoarse cry.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge <b>of</b> <b>wings,</b> engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal to attach wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached to a set <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, {{and would have been}} unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E

5|$|According to 20th-century folklore, {{the laws}} of {{aerodynamics}} prove the bumblebee should be incapable of flight, as {{it does not have}} the capacity (in terms <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> size or beats per second) to achieve flight with the degree <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> loading necessary.|$|R
5|$|As the {{original}} negatives are lost, {{the closest to}} an original print is a spare negative stored in Paramount's vaults. Suffering from decay and defects, the negative was fully restored with modern technology. For the restored version <b>of</b> <b>Wings,</b> {{the original}} music score was re-orchestrated. The sound effects were recreated at Skywalker Sound using archived audio tracks. The scenes using the Handschiegl color process were also recreated for the restored version.|$|E
5|$|At {{the last}} minute, Thumbelina escapes the {{situation}} by fleeing to a far land with a swallow she nursed back to health during the winter. In a sunny field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just her size and to her liking, and they wed. She receives a pair <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> to accompany her husband on his travels from flower to flower, and a new name, Maia.|$|E
5|$|In the Diptera (true flies), {{there is}} only one pair of {{functional}} wings, with the posterior pair <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> are reduced to halteres, which help the fly to sense its orientation and movement, as well as to improve balance by acting similar to gyroscopes. In Calyptratae, the very hindmost portion of the wings are modified into somewhat thickened flaps called calypters which cover the halteres.|$|E
40|$|The forces {{generated}} during {{flapping flight}} depend {{on both the}} motion <b>of</b> a <b>wing</b> and its three-dimensional shape. Flying vertebrates, such as birds and bats, can control many aspects <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> shape by muscular contractions that alter the alignment <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> bones, the position of feathers or the tautness <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> membranes (Kent, 1992). Flying insects have far less active control over the three-dimensional shape <b>of</b> their <b>wings,</b> as insect flight muscles are restricted to the wing base. Insect wings are largely passive structures, in which muscular forces transmitted by the wing base interact with aerodynamic and inertial forces generated by the wing’s motions. The architecture <b>of</b> the <b>wing</b> (vein arrangement, three-dimensional relief, flexion lines, etc.) and the material properties of its elements determine how the wing will change shape {{in response to these}} forces (Wootton, 1992) ...|$|R

5|$|Like {{those of}} all passerines, the chicks are altricial; {{they are born}} blind and covered only by sparse tufts of brown down on their backs, {{shoulders}} and parts <b>of</b> <b>wings.</b> By four days they open their eyes, and pin feathers emerge from their wings on day six, {{and the rest of}} the body on days seven and eight. Both parents feed the young, and are sometimes assisted by helper birds. The Pacific koel and pallid cuckoo (Cuculus pallidus) have been recorded as brood parasites of the blue-faced honeyeater, and the laughing kookaburra recorded as preying on broods.|$|E
5|$|One {{important}} piece of advice Yamamoto gave Kurosawa was that a good director needed to master screenwriting. Kurosawa soon realized that the potential earnings from his scripts were much higher than what he was paid as an assistant director. Kurosawa would later write or co-write all of his own films. He also frequently wrote screenplays for other directors such as for the antiwar film director Satsuo Yamamoto's film, A Triumph <b>of</b> <b>Wings</b> (Tsubasa no gaika, 1942). This outside scriptwriting would serve Kurosawa as a lucrative sideline lasting well into the 1960s, long after he became world-famous.|$|E
5|$|The body {{is divided}} into a thorax of three {{segments}} and a ten-segmented abdomen. The external surface has a tough exoskeleton which contains calcium carbonate and protects the inner organs and provides attachment to muscles. It is coated with wax to repel water. The wings {{are attached to the}} second and third thoracic segments. The tegmina, or first pair <b>of</b> <b>wings,</b> are tough and protective, lying as a shield on top of the membranous hind wings, which are used in flight. All four wings have branching longitudinal veins, and multiple cross-veins.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Air {{follows a}} branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, {{and focuses on}} {{the appeal of the}} three female main characters by the player character. The game is divided into three segments—Dream, Summer, and Air—which serve as different phases in the overall story. The title of the game reflects the prominent themes of the air, skies, and use <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> throughout gameplay. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Air has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.|$|E
5|$|While the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>wings</b> in insects is clearly defined {{in those who}} are members of Endopterygota, which undergo complete metamorphosis; in these species, the wing develops while in the pupal stage of the insects life cycle. However, insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis do not have a pupal stage, therefore they must have a different wing morphogenesis. Insects such as those that are hemimetabolic have wings that start out as buds, which are found underneath the exoskeleton, and do not become exposed until the last instar of the nymph.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} and design <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> tips for fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft still remains part art, part science. Although {{the design of}} airfoil sections and basic planform geometry is well developed, the tip regions require more detailed consideration. This is important because of the strong impact <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> tip flow on wing drag; although the tip region constitutes a small portion <b>of</b> the <b>wing,</b> {{its effect on the}} drag can be significant. The induced drag <b>of</b> a <b>wing</b> is, for a given lift and speed, inversely proportional to the square <b>of</b> the <b>wing</b> span. Concepts are proposed as a means of reducing drag. Modern computational methods provide a tool for studying these issues in greater detail. The purpose of the current research program is to improve the understanding of the fundamental issues involved in the design <b>of</b> <b>wing</b> tips and to develop the range of computational and experimental tools needed for further study of these ideas...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{flexibility}} <b>of</b> flapping <b>wing</b> on their aerodynamic characteristics are studied using numerical method, where the incompressible N-S equations coupled with a structural dynamic equation modeling the motion <b>of</b> the <b>wing</b> are solved. The flow structure around the wing, the aerodynamic forces and the energy consumption <b>of</b> the <b>wing</b> are examined for different flexibilities <b>of</b> the <b>wing.</b> It is found that the flexibility <b>of</b> the <b>wing</b> can influence its aerodynamic characteristics significantly and if the flexibility is at an appropriate level, it can increase the thrust and the energy efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>wing</b> while keep the mean lift force almost unchanged. The present results provide useful information for the development <b>of</b> flapping <b>wing</b> MAV...|$|R
