This was the combined result of a merger of two institutes with KARI and the loosening of a general recruitment freeze that had been in place under the conditions of the structural adjustment programs. • The <b>overall</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>structure</b> of agricultural R&D in Kenya changed to some extent, including the establishment of a few new government and higher education agencies. • Government contributions remain the main funding source for KARI; donor funding averaged one-third of total funding during 2001 - 08; a smaller share than in the 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|North American {{workers have}} {{increasingly}} turned to self-employment since the 1970 's. Analysts who have primarily focused {{on changes in}} technology, industrial restructuring and in the demographic composition {{of the work force}} as explanations for the rise in self- employment have had limited success. At the same time, international statistics suggest that country- or region- specific factors, rather than widely-shared trends may play central roles in the evolution of self-employment rates. In this paper I assess the importance of two less commonly analyzed factors which do vary across regions and countries [...] macroeconomic conditions and the tax environment [...] in explaining the trends in male self-employment in North America. I use microdata for the period 1983 - 1994 from Canada and the United States, which are perhaps more similar in <b>overall</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>structure</b> than any other two countries, but which differ substantially in their income tax policy, macroeconomic conditions, and self-employment trends. My findings suggest that higher income tax and unemployment rates are associated with an increase in the rate of male self-employment in the two countries. Changes in the tax environment account for a considerable amount of the secular trends in male self-employment over this period, while changing economic conditions played a smaller role in determining these trends. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper draws {{insights}} from theories of institutional change {{to analyze the}} interface between indigenous and contemporary socio-political institutions of governance in Sub-Saharan Africa. It shows that, although critical junctures {{are assumed to be}} path-departing moments, they can result in fundamental divisions in <b>overall</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> by grafting new institutions onto existing ones {{while at the same time}} re-enforcing the reproduction of existing institutional logics. Tracing the politics of institutional development and change in SSA over time, the paper shows that colonial rule left an unintended legacy of institutional dualism—the formal and the informal—which the recent processes of structural adjustment and democratizations have re-enforced. Thus, the development of governance institutions in SSA is far from over as actors and interests associated with both formal and informal institutional settings compete for legitimacy and sovereignty, while at the same time introducing new goals to enhance their efficiencies, and combining existing elements within the <b>overall</b> <b>institutional</b> repertoire in a process of change within and beyond path dependence...|$|R
40|$|How do {{individuals}} conceptualise {{the nature}} and timing of their work-retirement transitions Do they exercise choice or are decisions bound by <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> and societal expectations? Rational choice and deterministic theories provide divergent answers, however, we suggest that an interplay of agency and structure influences decision-making processes. Employing life-course theory, we explore factors in individuals’ national institutional, organisational and private-life context, and assess how these interact with and influence choice. Using a qualitative multi-level case study design and a thematic analysis approach, we analyse 20 biographical interviews with school teachers aged 50 + as well as 26 semi-structured interviews with HR managers and head teachers in two school districts in Germany and the United Kingdom. We found that teachers´ work-retirement transitions are influenced by individually-specific though overall similar factors, including stress and financial background. However, British and German teachers use divergent strategies to approach work-retirement transitions, mirroring their respective institutional contexts. British teachers were mostly able to employ agency within an <b>overall</b> enabling <b>institutional</b> <b>structure</b> to adapt career transitions to individual needs. German teachers had fewer opportunities to choose due to a more restricting <b>institutional</b> <b>structure.</b> Limitations include the qualitative nature of this study, which prevents us from generalising our findings. The findings suggest that career decisions are shaped by a complex agency-structure interplay, yet appear to be path-dependent. The study has practical relevance in light of national policies to extend individuals’ working lives. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study that explores the agency-structure interplay in teachers’ work-retirement decision-making...|$|R

40|$|With a {{population}} of 82. 5 million, the German market is {{the largest in the}} EU and therefore of special interest for the trade partners. Despite an unsatisfying economic development in the last years (lowest GDP growth in the EU and rising unemployment, see Table 9 in the annex) Germany is still a very attractive market with well funded consumers. Although agriculture has a small and declining contribution to the country?s gross domestic product, in the wider definition of the agribusiness, it {{is still one of the}} most important sectors with regard to turnover and employment. Taking consumers? expenditure for food as a proxy for the total turnover of the agribusiness yields a figure of 240 billion – in 2003, nearly as much as the turnover of the car industry in Germany. In total, 4. 5 million people are employed in the agribusiness, which is 11. 6 % of Germany?s total labour force. Among agricultural markets, the market of fruit and vegetables is of special interest for the trade with Mediterranean countries and also of special importance for the food industry and the food consumption. In 2003 consumers? expenditure for fresh fruit and vegetables were more than 10 billion ?. The processing industry of fruit and vegetables generated another 6. 5 billion – turnover, demonstrating the importance of fruit and vegetables in Germany. Bearing in mind that the self sufficiency ratios for fruit and vegetables in Germany are low (13 % respectively 50 %), the extent of market opportunities for the Mediterranean countries become obvious. Against this background it is the objective of this report to analyse the supply chain of fresh fruit and vegetables in Germany. In the second chapter the current market situation is briefly presented with regard to production, consumption and trade in Germany. Other aspects covered in this chapter are the demographic structure in Germany, important consumer trends and food quality issues. The third chapter is devoted in depth to the analysis of the supply chains for both fruit and vegetables. In this chapter the different actors and market channels are described with regard to their task and importance in the supply chain. In the fourth chapter the <b>overall</b> <b>institutional</b> <b>structure</b> is analysed. After the conclusions in the fifth chapter extensive tables and figures can be found in the annex.

40|$|For decades {{there has}} been a concern that {{citizens}} in Britain and other western democracies are disengaging from political processes. Furthermore, Robert Putnam (2000) argues that the decline in engagement is connected to a decline in social capital. Recent citizenship philosophies from authors such as Etzioni (2000) and Blond (2009) attempt to address this concern by arguing for the development of mutual and associative communities. Although Etzioni (2000) and Putnam (2000) argue that the state can help develop social capital and thus mutual and associative communities through government policy, other such as Field (2003) discussion some potential problems for this and argue that government policy focused on increasing social capital can be counterproductive. This project explores this problem using qualitative research methods conducting semi-structured interviews lasting between 30 - 70 minutes each. 16 people were interviewed from three different engagement groups categorised as formal, semi-formal and informal which allowed for comparing the affects of government policy, or <b>institutional</b> <b>structures,</b> on the respective engagement groups. This project concludes that whilst <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> do not necessarily impede social capital and thus engagement; <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> that dictate homogeneous engagement or <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> that only support bureaucratic normative structures were found to have negative consequences for social capital and political engagement. However, it is also argued that within the specific groups studied, <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> can also have positive effects on social capital and engagement when they do not crowd out individual exploration within communal and/or associative structures in the community. Finally, this project argues that the conclusions cannot be fully generalised throughout British society {{because of the nature of}} the qualitative methods used, and because social capital is a context specific social phenomenon. As a result, it is argued that the conclusions can and should be used as hypotheses for future studies into the effects of <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> on political engagement...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach- The paper uses a conceptual framework which explores the connections between <b>institutional</b> <b>structures</b> of U.

Findings - The narrative themes clearly illustrate the intersection of gender, ethnicity and identity across the <b>institutional</b> <b>structures.</b> Varying degrees of inclusion and exclusion are visible in the accountancy workplace. Research Limitations - The oral history approach has its inherent limitations and many of the respondents were ‘snowball’ contacts rather than drawn from a large randomly chosen selection.

Although research in this area of accountancy is emergent, it argues that the voice of the individual needs to be listened to by the institutions which form U.
