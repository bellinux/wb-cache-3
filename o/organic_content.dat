5|$|The kukersite {{oil shale}} of Ordovician age in Estonia {{is part of}} the Baltic oil shale basin and was {{deposited}} in shallow marine basins. The deposit is one of the world’s highest-grade deposits with more than 40% <b>organic</b> <b>content</b> and 66% conversion ratio into shale oil and gas. The oil shale is located in a single calcareous layer 2.5–3meters in thickness and is buried at depths from 7 to 100m. The total area of the basin is about 3,000km2. Oil yield from Kukersite is 30 to 47%. Most of the organic matter is derived from the fossil green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca, which has affinities to the modern cyanobacterium, Entophysalis major, an extant species that forms algal mats in inter-tidal to very shallow subtidal waters. Matrix minerals include low-magnesium calcite, dolomite, and siliciclastic minerals. It is not enriched in heavy metals.|$|E

25|$|The solid, fibrous {{component}} of the digested material {{can be used as}} a soil conditioner to increase the <b>organic</b> <b>content</b> of soils. Digester liquor {{can be used as a}} fertiliser to supply vital nutrients to soils instead of chemical fertilisers that require large amounts of energy to produce and transport. The use of manufactured fertilisers is, therefore, more carbon-intensive than the use of anaerobic digester liquor fertiliser. In countries such as Spain, where many soils are organically depleted, the markets for the digested solids can be equally as important as the biogas.|$|E
25|$|The process {{involves}} air or oxygen {{being introduced}} into {{a mixture of}} screened, and primary treated sewage or industrial wastewater (wastewater) combined with organisms to develop a biological floc which reduces the <b>organic</b> <b>content</b> of the sewage. This material, which in healthy sludge is a brown floc, is largely composed of saprotrophic bacteria but also has an important protozoan flora component mainly composed of amoebae, Spirotrichs, Peritrichs including Vorticellids {{and a range of}} other filter-feeding species. Other important constituents include motile and sedentary Rotifers. In poorly managed activated sludge, a range of mucilaginous filamentous bacteria can develop including Sphaerotilus natans which produces a sludge that is difficult to settle and can result in the sludge blanket decanting over the weirs in the settlement tank to severely contaminate the final effluent quality. This material is often described as sewage fungus but true fungal communities are relatively uncommon.|$|E
40|$|Analyses of <b>organic</b> matter <b>content,</b> <b>organic</b> carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and granulometric {{variables}} {{were performed on}} 101 surface sediment samples from Ubatuba Bay in order to investigate the spatial distribution of organic matter, its origin and the relationships among its components.

Pearson correlation, regression and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) statistical methods were {{used to analyze the}} data. Strong correlations between organic matter and fine sediment fractions were obtained. The PCA revealed at least two main sample groups that reflect the different environmental conditions prevalent in the bay.

25|$|In older {{plants and}} those {{receiving}} variable loadings, trickling filter beds are used where the settled sewage liquor is spread {{onto the surface}} of a bed made up of coke (carbonized coal), limestone chips or specially fabricated plastic media. Such media must have large surface areas to support the biofilms that form. The liquor is typically distributed through perforated spray arms. The distributed liquor trickles through the bed and is collected in drains at the base. These drains also provide a source of air which percolates up through the bed, keeping it aerobic. Biofilms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi form on the media’s surfaces and eat or otherwise reduce the <b>organic</b> <b>content.</b> The filter removes {{a small percentage of the}} suspended organic matter, while the majority of the organic matter supports microorganism reproduction and cell growth from the biological oxidation and nitrification taking place in the filter. With this aerobic oxidation and nitrification, the organic solids are converted into biofilm grazed by insect larvae, snails, and worms which help maintain an optimal thickness. Overloading of beds may increase biofilm thickness leading to anaerobic conditions and possible bioclogging of the filter media and ponding on the surface.|$|E
25|$|The {{sedimentary}} sequence {{drilled in}} the basin starts with the La Quinta Formation, that is found in a widespread area across northern Colombia and Venezuela. The formation of sandstones, basalts, conglomerates and volcanic ash was deposited in a lacustrine depositional environment in a rift basin setting related to the break-up of Pangea and has been dated to the Late Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous, 160 to 140 Ma. The formation is time-equivalent with the Girón Formation of the Eastern Ranges. The Early Cretaceous Río Negro Formation, a unit composed of sandstones, conglomerates and siltstones, is very variable in thickness {{in the basin}} and associated with continental sedimentation on rift shoulders to a post-rift setting. The formation is time-equivalent with the Tibasosa Formation of the Eastern Ranges and the Tambor Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley. The fossiliferous limestones and shales of the Lagunitas Formation, lower member of the Cogollo Group, contain beds of dolomite and are indicative of a shallow, saline environment. The formation is correlated with the Rosablanca Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley and western Eastern Ranges and the Tibú Formation of the Maracaibo Basin. The unit is the deepest source rock for the oils in the Cesar-Ranchería Basin. The upper member of the Cogollo Group, the Aguas Blancas Formation, presents a large lateral variability in lithologies. Black biomicrites and fossiliferous limestones are indicative of a middle to outer platform environment, while sandy shales and glauconitic sandstones indicate a shallow marine environment. The variation in lithologies and <b>organic</b> <b>content</b> of this source rock formation is associated with basinal relative sea level changes and the organic-rich strata to the Aptian anoxic event, dated to approximately 120 million years ago.|$|E

The experiment was carried out in the three-course crop rotation, potato, rye, rye in randomized split-plot design. The experimental treatments were four levels of N fertilizers in 0, 47, 93, and 140 kg*ha- 1 *yr- 1 (N 0, N 1, N 2, N 3) as a 1 st factor of experiment, and the same doses of N fertilizers with farmyard manure application (30 t*ha- 1) as a 2 nd factor.
