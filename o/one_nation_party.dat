50|$|Since the 2003 state election, <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> New South Wales kept a {{very low}} profile. The party did not {{maintain}} a website and drew very little media attention.

Having created the <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>party</b> after her election to parliament, Hanson decided to contest Blair at the next federal election in 1998 but, despite winning a plurality (36%) of the primary vote, the distribution of preferences led to her losing to the Liberal candidate.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1996 {{election}} Pauline Hanson {{was elected}} to the federal seat of Oxley. In her maiden speech to the House of Representatives, which instantly made headlines and television news bulletins across Australia, she expressed her concern that Australia [...] "was in danger of being swamped by Asians". This message exposed a population deeply divided on the issue of immigration. Hanson went on to form the <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>Party,</b> which subsequently won nearly one quarter of the vote in Queensland state elections. The name [...] "One Nation" [...] was meant to signify national unity, in contrast to what Hanson claimed to see as an increasing division in Australian society caused by government policies favoring migrants (multiculturalism) and indigenous Australians. Political ineptitude and infighting led to One Nation's demise, but the issue of immigration remains highly sensitive in Australia.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Tony Abbott had {{established}} a trust fund called [...] "Australians for Honest Politics Trust" [...] to help bankroll civil court cases against the <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>Party</b> and Hanson herself.

However, Howard defended the honesty of Abbott in this matter. Abbott conceded that the political threat One Nation posed to the Howard Government was [...] "a very big factor" [...] in his decision to pursue the legal attack, but he also said he was acting [...] "in Australia's national interest". Howard also defended Abbott's actions saying [...] "It's the job of the Liberal Party to politically attack other parties – there's nothing wrong with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 Peretz {{resigned}} from the Labor Party to form his own <b>party,</b> <b>One</b> <b>Nation.</b> The <b>party</b> won two seats in the Knesset in the 1999 elections, and three in 2003. As Labor's fortunes changed with the Likud Party in government, and Israel's social programmes being dismantled by the market-oriented reforms of finance minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Peretz became increasingly popular with Israel's working-class. By the start of 2004 he was being talked of as a [...] "white knight who will rescue Labor from oblivion".

2500|$|In 2003, {{following}} her release from prison, Hanson unsuccessfully contested the New South Wales state election, {{running for a}} seat in the upper house. In January 2004, Hanson announced that she did not intend to return to politics. but then stood as an independent candidate for one of Queensland's seats in the Senate in the 2004 federal election. At the time Hanson declared, [...] "I don't want all the hangers on. I don't want the advisers and everyone else. I want it to be this time Pauline Hanson." [...] She was unsuccessful, receiving only 31.77% of the required quota of primary votes, and did not pick up enough additional support through preferences. However, she attracted more votes than the <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>party</b> (4.54% compared to 3.14%) and, unlike her former party, recovered her deposit from the Australian Electoral Commission and secured $150,000 of public electoral funding. Hanson claimed to have been vilified over campaign funding.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after her}} {{election}} to Parliament, Hanson's book, Pauline Hanson – the truth : on Asian immigration, the Aboriginal question, the gun debate {{and the future}} of Australia, was published. In it she makes claims of Aboriginal cannibalism, in particular that Aboriginal women ate their babies and tribes cannibalised their members. Hanson told the media that the reason for these claims of cannibalism was to [...] "demonstrate the savagery of Aboriginal society". David Ettridge, the <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>party</b> director, said that the book's claims were intended to correct [...] "misconceptions" [...] about Aboriginal history. These alleged misconceptions were said to be relevant to modern-day Aboriginal welfare funding. He asserted that [...] "the suggestion that we should be feeling some concern for modern day Aborigines for suffering in the past is balanced a bit by the alternative view of whether you can feel sympathy for people who eat their babies". The book predicted that in 2050 Australia would have a lesbian president of Chinese-Indian background called Poona Li Hung who would be a cyborg. In 2004, Hanson said that the book was [...] "written by some other people who actually put my name to it" [...] and that while she held the copyright over The Truth, she was unaware that much of the material was being published under her name.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 November 2003, {{delivering}} judgment the {{day after}} hearing the appeal, the Queensland Court of Appeal quashed all of Hanson and Ettridge's convictions. Hanson, having spent 11 weeks in jail, was immediately released along with Ettridge. The court's unanimous decision was that the evidence did not support a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that {{the people on the}} list were not members of the Pauline Hanson's <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> <b>party</b> and that Hanson and Ettridge knew this when the application to register the party was submitted. Accordingly, the convictions regarding registration were quashed. The convictions regarding funding, which depended on the same facts, were also quashed. This decision did not specifically follow the Sharples case, where the trial judge's finding of such fraud had not been overturned in the appeal by Hanson and Ettridge. That case was distinguished as a civil suit – in administrative law, as to the validity of the decision by Electoral Commissioner O'Shea to register the party – in which proof had been only on the balance of probabilities. Chief Justice Paul de Jersey, with whom the other two judges agreed overall, suggested that if Hanson, Ettridge and especially the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions had used better lawyers from the start, the whole matter might not have taken so long up to the appeal hearing, or might even have been avoided altogether. The Court of Appeal president, Margaret McMurdo, rebuked many politicians, including John Howard and Bronwyn Bishop MHR. Their observations, she said, demonstrated at least [...] "a lack of understanding of the Rule of Law" [...] and [...] "an attempt to influence the judicial appellate process and to interfere with the independence of the judiciary for cynical political motives", although she praised other leading Coalition politicians for accepting the District Court's decision.|$|E

40|$|To {{what extent}} do {{writings}} about Pauline Hanson or <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> contruct her or her party as a phenomenon of the Right, the Centre or the Left? To what sorts of values - Left or Right - did her major speeches mostly appeal? And where did electors, both those who voted for <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> {{and those who did}} not, place the party ideologically? This article shows how Hanson's politics were frequently characterised as a politics of the Right, though what sort of Right - extreme Right, populist Right, plain Right, and so on - was a matter on which there was no agreement. It demonstrates that while her maiden speech in 1996 and the speech she gave to launch her party in 1997 focused on issues of race and ethnicity - Aborigines, migrants, and multiculturalism - in ways that have come {{to be associated with the}} Right, the speech she gave to launch her party's 1998 federal election campaign focused on jobs, an issue more often associated with the Left. The study also uses survey evidence to show that while <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> was less likely than the Liberal or National Party to be seen as a party of the Right, respondents were more likely to see <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> as a <b>party</b> of the extreme Right. Yet more than any other party, including the Greens, <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> was also seen as a party of the extreme Left. The least commonly held view - except by <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> respondents - was that <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> was a <b>party</b> of the Centre. 19 page(s...|$|R
