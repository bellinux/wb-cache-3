It might be our last {{full-length}} record for a little while, but we've got a lot of things lined up that we want to record, so I think that will happen pretty soon." [...] In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; [...] "I don’t know if there’s a point to releasing records if they’re not physical releases, if we're going to release a lot of things digitally then I don’t see why we couldn’t release a song a week or a song a month or just put <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> like from whenever we record." [...] Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, [...] "We’re talking about recording another album but we don’t know whether it’s going to come out on a label or whether we just release songs in batches." ...|$|E
500|$|The film premiered on May 20, in {{competition}} at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival. At its first showing to the media, the film received abundant praise, and garnered [...] "some of the best responses of the festival," [...] but Xan Brooks of The Guardian, who gave it a positive review, said it [...] "can't win, won't win" [...] Cannes's top prize. Brooks explained that [...] "t's too self-consciously retro, too much a series of cool, blank surfaces {{as opposed to a}} rounded, textured drama," [...] but said that it was his [...] "guilty pleasure" [...] of the 2011 competition, labeling it an enjoyable affair. He said, [...] "Over the past 10 days we've witnessed great art and potent social commentary; the birth of the cosmos {{and the end of the}} world. Turns <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> really wanted all along was a scene in which a man gets his head stomped in a lift. They welcome it in like a long-lost relation." [...] The film was greeted with hoots and howls of joy from the media, with viewers cheering on some of the scenes featuring extreme violence. Drive also received a 15-minute standing ovation from the crowd. The festival named Refn best director for Drive.|$|E

500|$|After {{some time}} {{developing}} demos, the musicians returned to Henson in March 2012, recording seven songs before the band {{decided to take}} a break, as according to guitarist Mike McCready [...] "we had to take some time to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do." [...] Guitarist Stone Gossard added that despite the bandmembers thinking that after the productive sessions the album was nearing completion, eventually they considered the tracks [...] "didn’t feel strong enough for a record. Work on the album resumed only in March 2013 as the bandmembers regrouped with new compositions, mostly done separatedly in each member's home studio—though McCready at times worked along with drummer Matt Cameron—before the group reunited to finish the songs together. O'Brien attributed the long break to the band's busy schedule, as the musicians got into side projects after putting the Pearl Jam album on hold: singer Eddie Vedder started a solo tour, drummer Matt Cameron returned to Soundgarden, guitarist Stone Gossard rejoined side project Brad, Ament recorded solo album While My Heart Beats and started the project RNDM, and McCready formed the group Walking Papers while also taking part in a partial reunion of Mad Season. Vedder still considered that all the diversions helped Pearl Jam to have [...] "more importance placed on the records" [...] and focusing on making the best album possible. Like with previous records the songs had their first recordings with all the musicians playing together, though O'Brien added that with Lightning Bolt [...] "we don’t keep as much of [...] as we used to." [...] Guest musicians include O'Brien himself at the keyboards, long time keyboardist Boom Gaspar, and violinist Ann Marie Calhoun. After six weeks of new recording sessions, the album was mixed in Seattle at the band's desire, with the process taking place in Studio X.|$|E
500|$|Since {{moving to}} digital {{multichannel}} Eleven, Neighbours has traditionally rated between 250,000 and 350,000 viewers. The show attracted 254,000 viewers {{for its first}} episode broadcast on 11 January 2011. This was half the number of viewers that watched it on Network Ten; the Herald Sun reported {{that it was a}} good result as [...] "bosses were only expecting 133,000." [...] Neighbours became Eleven's most-watched show and the third highest rating show on digital multichannels that night. Programming chief, David Mott stated [...] "Last night's strong result for Neighbours already suggests the audience will follow the folks from Ramsay Street to their brand new neighbourhood on Eleven." [...] On 24 January 2011, Neighbours achieved 330,000 viewers and three days later 355,000 viewers tuned in, becoming the show's highest rating yet on Eleven at the time.

Neighbours began going through a ratings decline in 2016, with episodes now averaging below 200,000 viewers. Executive producer Jason Herbison told TV Tonight, [...] "We know that our show is performing really solidly in the UK. We're not sure why it's not here [...] but we're taking a real look at it."

Trowers notes {{the making of the}} mini-games to be [...] "quite an organic process": [...] "Sometimes we'd have a movie and we'd say OK, we want the player to do this in the scene, which is the action we want, so try to think of a game idea for this. But other times we'd be thinking, [...] "Oh, you know what, we got this great idea for a game and these are the essential actions we can get out of it, {{how are we going to}} use it in movies?" [...] So it was really a three-way process, trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> could get people to do, what would be fun, how it would fit in the movie—it wasn't just one process of doing it, it had to go both ways."

On November 21, 2012, the band's performance in Vegas was taped in 3D, and was screened across theaters in 2014 before being released as Appetite for Democracy 3D on July 1, 2014.

2500|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} named Cloverfield. This changed several times throughout production {{before it was}} decided that the original title would be used. Matt Reeves explained that the title was changed frequently due to the hype caused by the teaser trailer. [...] "That excitement spread {{to such a degree that}} we suddenly couldn't use the name anymore. So we started using all these names like Slusho and Cheese. And people always found <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> were doing!" [...] The director said that [...] "Cloverfield" [...] was the government's case designation for the events caused by the monster, comparing the titling to that of the Manhattan Project. [...] "And it's not a project per se. It's the way that this case has been designated. That's why that is on the trailer, and it becomes clearer in the film. It's how they refer to this phenomenon [...] this case", said the director. The film's final title, Cloverfield, is the name of the exit Abrams takes to his Santa Monica office. In turn, the road used to lead to the Santa Monica Airport, which originally bore the name Clover Field.|$|E
2500|$|A {{majority}} of the band's previous material was written by former guitarist Ryan Ross. For Vices & Virtues, Urie had [...] "to step up and take the reins lyrically," [...] which he regarded as having not much experience in prior. The biggest inspiration for lyricism was keeping busy and going out, instead of locking themselves in and writing. Urie has regarded the lyrics as very honest and straightforward, as well as very fantastical with elements of storytelling. Urie explained [...] "We were so self-conscious about everything, hyper-aware of what we’re doing, that when we’re writing I go, [...] "Okay, I don’t {{want this to be}} Barry Manilow’s [...] "Mandy", but I want it to be as romantic and cute ...’ There’s a lot of that fighting within yourself. But it ended up being great, and I’m glad {{that we were able to}} figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to write about." [...] The lyrics also reflect the confusion after the departure of Ross and Walker. The sessions with Feldmann at his home studio led to experimentation with new sounds. [...] "We really loved Paul Simon and got into using marimbas and string instruments," [...] explains Urie. [...] "We ended up buying some synths and messing around with them. It was two kids in a candy store… and we listened to Arcade Fire's The Suburbs on repeat for me for the past… well, since it came out [...]" ...|$|E

5000|$|According to Jason Scott, [...] "Archive Team {{was started}} out {{of anger and}} a feeling of powerlessness, this feeling that we were letting {{companies}} decide for us what was going to survive and what was going to die."Scott continues, [...] "it's not our job to figure <b>out</b> <b>what's</b> valuable, to figure <b>out</b> <b>what's</b> meaningful. <b>We</b> work by three virtues: rage, paranoia and kleptomania." ...|$|R

2500|$|The album {{features}} {{a variety of}} different musical styles in its tracks. As a testament to the amount of time of production, each song [...] "sounds different from the next," [...] according to Urie. In the beginning, the band had no direction for music or lyrics. However, after returning to the studio and restarting production, the band became excited to start [...] with a second chance. [...] "We've been working on music for {{about a year and a}} half, so I think that partly adds to why some of the songs have some varying styles," [...] Smith said. [...] "Part of it was us, at the beginning, trying to figure <b>out</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> wanted to do – we had a new opportunity with just the two of us – and as we sort of got a better hold on what that was, just kind of went from there." [...] The duo picked the best songs out of 30 written as time went on. Urie said the most exciting part of the recording process was [...] "...You get all the work done, record the song, arrange it and then you can add the fun little stuff, little pieces of voices and talking and weird instruments you hadn’t used before." [...] The band's musical experimentation stretched as far as employing an iPad to record synthesizers on the record. The band got to work with French band The Plastiscines, and a children's choir on the track [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" ...|$|E
