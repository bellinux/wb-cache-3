Mark Jansen and Simone Simons said about the track: “The title comes from the ancient Greek for phantom or image, and it’s where the word ‘idol’ comes from.

After I had written the music for Eidola, I felt there was {{something}} missing so <b>our</b> <b>keyboard</b> player Coen (Janssen) rebuilt it with many new parts and it became massive.

On a personal digital assistant (PDA), text entry methods traditionally support input through the motion of a stylus held in the user's dominant hand.

We compare <b>our</b> chorded <b>keyboard</b> design to other stylus-based text entry methods in an evaluation that studies user input in both stationary and mobile settings. Our study shows that users type fastest using the miniqwerty keyboard, and most accurately using <b>our</b> two-handed <b>keyboard.</b> We also discovered a difference in input performance with the mini-qwerty keyboard between stationary and mobile settings. As a user walks, text input speed decreases while error rates and mental workload increases; however, these metrics remain relatively stable in our two-handed technique despite user mobility...|$|R

40|$|National audienceInternet of Things (IoT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} fast-growing field in high {{technologies}} nowadays. Therefore, lots of electronic devices include wireless connections with several communication protocols (WiFi, ZigBee, Sigfox, LoRa and so on). Nevertheless, designers of such components do not take care of security features most of the time while focusing on communication reliability (speed, throughput and low power consumption). As a consequence, several wireless IoT devices transmit data in plaintext creating lots of security breaches for both eavesdropping and data injection attacks. This work introduces KeyJack, a preliminary proof-of-concept of a solution aiming to eavesdrop wireless devices and hopefully perform injection attacks afterwards. KeyJack operates on widely-used devices: <b>our</b> <b>keyboards!</b> This solution is based on low-cost embedded electronics and gives an attacker or a white hat hacker the possibility to retrieve data from John Doe's computer.

40|$|The {{object of}} this thesis is design and {{construction}} of a device that can replace a standard keyboard and mouse. The history of the standard keyboard is presented and the most known alternative the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard is described. The basic principals that August Dvorak used in designing his keyboard are also used in our design. In other to achieve this {{the knowledge of the}} characteristics of Slovenian language are required. The characteristics that we require to design <b>our</b> <b>keyboard</b> are presented in this work. This keyboard does not employ a full set of keys, it is a cording keyboard because characters are derived from combinations of keys. The procedure used to design <b>our</b> <b>keyboard</b> is also given in this thesis. The development of a keyboard requires knowledge of the USB protocol and the standard HID that defines a class of devices named Human Interface Devices. The requirements that the device has to meet to successfully communicate over the Universal Serial Bus. The descriptors that help the host learn about the device are also briefly explained. A full design of the keyboard and mouse based around the Microchip's PIC 18 F 4550 microcontroler serves as an example for the realization of the device. The circuits needed to build a functional device connected to the USB are listed and the basic program is outlined as are the specific parts and code that are used in this project. ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis and Sanders first {{approached}} Larry Sherman of Trax - a {{label that}} had a capital {{role in the development}} of house music - in 1984 or 1985, as the genre was beginning to take off. As titles in his catalogue were beginning to chart and the duo were unknown in the club scene, Sherman shrugged their demos off. State Street Records were also uninterested. At that time, the duo started attending the Art Institute of Chicago, and began to produce new music in its sound room. When they came back to Sherman in 1988 with additional material, he agreed to put it out. Sanders and Lewis produced the album at Rax Trax, where they met Rick Barnes (who ran the studio) and Derek Brand, members of the Nicholas Tremulis Band. Although Lidell Townsell was enlisted to help the duo with production, they ended up doing it themselves. Regarding the recording, Sanders stated: [...] "Most of our stuff we played live except for the drum machine. Everything else we got so used to just playing, I guess just from the repetition, we didn't use a sequencer at all. We showed up at the studio, had <b>our</b> <b>keyboards,</b> hit [...] "Record."

40|$|Figure 1 : The 1 Line Keyboard. It {{consists}} of only eight character keys, flick gestures, and {{a novel approach}} for integrating the spacebar into the bezel. It is 140 px tall (26. 9 mm) and 39. 8 % {{of the size of}} the native landscape iPad keyboard. Current soft QWERTY keyboards often consume a large portion of the screen space on portable touchscreens. This space consumption can diminish the overall user experience on these devices. In this paper, we present the 1 Line keyboard, a soft QWERTY keyboard that is 140 pixels tall (in landscape mode) and 40 % of the height of the native iPad QWERTY keyboard. <b>Our</b> <b>keyboard</b> condenses the three rows of keys in the normal QWERTY layout into a single line with eight keys. The sizing of the eight keys is based on users ’ mental layout of a QWERTY keyboard on an iPad. The system disambiguates the word the user types based on the sequence of keys pressed. The user can use flick gestures to perform backspace and enter, and tap on the bezel below the keyboard to input a space. Through an evaluation, we show that participants are able to quickly learn how to use the 1 Line keyboard and type at a rate of over 30 WPM after just five 20 -minute typing sessions. Using a keystroke level model, we predict the peak expert text entry rate with the 1 Line keyboard to be 66 - 68 WPM.
