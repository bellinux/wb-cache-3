2500|$|The roughly painted {{style and}} {{photographic}} lighting in Manet's paintings {{was seen as}} specifically modern, and {{as a challenge to}} the Renaissance works he copied or used as source material. He rejected the technique he had learned in the studio of Thomas Couture – in which a painting was constructed using successive layers of paint on a dark-toned ground – in favor of a direct, alla prima method using <b>opaque</b> <b>paint</b> on a light ground. Novel at the time, this method made possible the completion of a painting in a single sitting. It was adopted by the Impressionists, and became the prevalent method of painting in oils for generations that followed. Manet's work is considered [...] "early modern", partially because of the opaque flatness of his surfaces, the frequent sketchlike passages, and the black outlining of figures, all of which draw attention {{to the surface of the}} picture plane and the material quality of paint.|$|E
50|$|James Duffield Harding (1798 - 4 December 1863), was an English {{landscape}} painter, lithographer {{and author}} of drawing manuals. His use of tinted papers and <b>opaque</b> <b>paints</b> in watercolour proved influential.|$|R
25|$|Claiming {{herself a}} self-taught painter, Ellis {{combined}} traditional watercolor techniques with <b>opaque</b> <b>paints</b> {{that she used}} to illustrate detail.

50|$|Gouache is a {{water-based}} paint consisting of pigment {{and other materials}} designed {{to be used in}} an <b>opaque</b> <b>painting</b> method. Gouache differs from watercolor in that the particles are larger, the ratio of pigment to water is much higher, and an additional, inert, white pigment such as chalk is also present. This makes gouache heavier and more opaque, with greater reflective qualities. Like all watermedia, it is diluted with water.|$|R

50|$|The use of gouache is not {{restricted}} to the basic <b>opaque</b> <b>painting</b> techniques using a brush and watercolor paper. It is often applied with an airbrush. As with all types of paint, gouache has been used on unusual surfaces from Braille paper to cardboard. A variation of traditional application is the method used in the gouaches découpées (cut collages) created by Henri Matisse. His Blue Nudes series {{is a good example}} of the technique.|$|R
5000|$|The {{visual art}} academy {{provides}} {{a number of}} classes including an Art History course {{designed to provide a}} complete overview of all visual arts through history. Painting Technique mainly emphasizes the use of color and other processes, including <b>opaque</b> <b>painting.</b> 3D Art & Sculpture is a one-year course designated to introduce students to the skill of creating three-dimensional works of art. Fashion and Interior Design is a one-year class that focuses on fashion design, interior design, color themes, and portfolio creation.|$|R
50|$|Gouache has a {{considerable}} history going back over 600 years. It {{is similar to}} watercolor {{because it can be}} rewet and the paint can become infused with its paper support. It can also form a superficial layer like acrylic or oil paint. Also like watercolor, gouache dries to a matte finish. It is similar to acrylic or oil paints in that it is normally used in an <b>opaque</b> <b>painting</b> style. Many manufacturers of watercolor paints also produce gouache and the two can easily be used together.|$|R
50|$|Cabinets may be {{finished}} with <b>opaque</b> <b>paint,</b> opaque lacquer and transparent finishes such as lacquer or varnish. Decorative finishes include distressing, glazing, and toning.

50|$|The queen {{is painted}} with {{alabaster}} {{skin and a}} rouged face; small and almost doll-like under her hair and the very wide head-dress. Her bust is tightly encased in the bodice, her stiff farthingale shows her interest in fashion.

50|$|Handschiegl {{described}} the invention thus: A separate, black-and-white print for each color {{to be applied}} was made. Using an <b>opaque</b> <b>paint,</b> portions of the image where color was to be applied were blocked out. A duplicate negative was made from the painted print and developed in a tanning developer, which hardened the gelatin layer {{where it had been}} exposed and developed. Those areas corresponding to the blocked out areas on the print remained relatively soft and capable of taking up dye. This dyed matrix film was brought into contact, in accurate register, with a positive print, to which the dye transferred in the appropriate areas. The print made several passes through the dye transfer machines, in contact with a separate matrix for each color. Usually, three colors were applied at the most.|$|E

50|$|William Shayer, senior was a {{competent}} landscape artist, {{but he is}} best known as a figure painter. His work is reminiscent in some respects to the paintings of George Morland, another very popular figure painter. Shayer's work though has a depth and brightness to it missing from the paintings of many of his contemporaries, due to his skillful application of glaze (i.e., spreading a thin, oily, transparent layer of paint over a dry <b>opaque</b> <b>paint).</b> He exhibited at the Royal Academy (6 works), the British Institution (82 works), and at the Suffolk Street Gallery of the Society of British Artists (338 works). He also exhibited in many of the lesser-known Victorian art venues as well. His works are on display at many museums including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate Gallery, the Glasgow Art Gallery, and the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|E
50|$|Latex is {{a natural}} {{ingredient}} that comes from rubber trees {{in the form of}} a milky liquid. There are thousands of species of plants that produce different types of latex, including the Chicle tree that yields the raw material for producing the rubbery material in chewing gum. Unlike some rubber compounds, rubber tree latex is non-toxic in both its liquid and solid states, and because of this it can be found in many products such as surgical gloves, condoms and body paint. Liquid latex is naturally clear and then dries into a translucent amber color. Manufacturers add pigments to the product to provide <b>opaque</b> <b>paint</b> choices of multiple colors. The color of the paint in the jar may initially look chalky, but as it dries it develops into a rich color (grey becomes black for example). Additional acrylic paints can be mixed with the liquid latex solution for custom colors but may not be suitable for use a cosmetic application.|$|E

50|$|Most early seekers used {{so-called}} spin-scan, chopper or reticle seekers. These {{consisted of}} a transparent plate with a sequence of <b>opaque</b> segments <b>painted</b> on them that was {{placed in front of}} the IR detector. The plate spins at a fixed rate, which causes the image of the target to be periodically interrupted, or chopped.|$|R

[...] Covered with a transparent plastic sheeting and with the interior structure and <b>opaque</b> parts <b>painted</b> silver, the PS {{was found to be}} very difficult to see at first, but accumulation of dirt and the sheeting turning opaque diminished the effect fairly rapidly.|$|R
50|$|Hiding pigments, {{in making}} <b>paint</b> <b>opaque,</b> also protect the {{substrate}} from {{the harmful effects}} of ultraviolet light. Hiding pigments include titanium dioxide, phthalo blue, red iron oxide, and many others.|$|R
50|$|Coatings are {{sometimes}} applied to copper. Clear coatings preserve the natural color, warmth, and metallic tone of copper alloys. Oils exclude moisture from copper roofs and flashings and simultaneously enhance their appearance by bringing out a rich luster {{and depth of}} color. The most popular oils are lemon oil, U.S.P., lemongrass oil, Native E.I., paraffin oils, linseed oil, and castor oil. On copper roofing or flashing, reapplication once every three years can effectively retard patina formation. In arid climates, the maximum span between oilings may be extended up to five years. <b>Opaque</b> <b>paint</b> coatings are primarily applied over copper when substrate integrity and longevity are desired but a specific color other than the naturally occurring copper hues is required. Lead-coated copper coatings are used when the appearance of exposed lead is desired or where water runoff from uncoated copper alloys would ordinarily stain lighter-colored building materials, such as marble, limestone, stucco, mortar, or concrete. Zinc-tin coatings are an alternative to lead coatings since they have approximately the same appearance and workability.|$|E
40|$|A new, non-intrusive {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to measure the}} solid-liquid contact temperature duringdropwise evaporative cooling. The droplets are deposited onto a material which is transparentin the infrared spectral band. The interface temperature can thus be measured through the solidmaterial by a thermographic camera. The transparent tile is coated with a very thin layer ofhigh-emissivity, <b>opaque</b> <b>paint</b> on its upper side, {{so that it can}} effectively respond to the infraredcamera below...|$|E
30|$|Thus, {{this method}} is well adapted to study the {{temporal}} evolution of the stratigraphy in test specimens and offers an alternative to destructive sampling of original works of art. In a fashion {{very similar to that}} used with high magnification optical microscopes, the laminographic technique allows to obtain detailed morphological images at any depth in an (optically <b>opaque)</b> <b>paint</b> layer stack [31, 32]. CXL thus presents a non-invasive and non-destructive alternative to sampling and polishing where such fine structure needs to be preserved. The technique has a high potential in studying conservation problems on test specimens or original works of art, where the microstructure of carrier, ground or paint is of importance but sample removal is to be avoided.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, in {{particular}} after {{a trip to}} Italy, LeWitt started using gouache, an <b>opaque</b> water-based <b>paint,</b> to produce free-flowing abstract works in contrasting colors. These represented {{a significant departure from}} the rest of his practice, as he created these works with his own hands. LeWitt’s gouaches are often created in series based on a specific motif. Past series have included Irregular Forms, Parallel Curves, Squiggly Brushstrokes and Web-like Grids.|$|R
50|$|One of Jochen Gerz’s most {{important}} installations was featured at the 37th Venice Biennale alongside Joseph Beuys and Reiner Ruthenbeck in the German Pavillon. The nine-metre-high and seven-metre-long Centaur, a wood structure covered in <b>opaque</b> photographic <b>paint,</b> was divided {{by a wall}} between two spaces. The larger section had a flap near the floor through which the artist could enter the sculpture, where he spent several days. The eponymous original manuscript on the work, in mirror writing, was displayed on six desks.|$|R
30|$|Besides {{being able}} to adjust the {{particle}} size and pigment to binder ratio to his own preference, there was another reason why Van Gogh preferred freshly ground paints. Some paints, among others paints based on lake pigments, grow ‘fat’ during storage {{which means that they}} thicken and become tough. This problem was probably also encountered by Van Gogh: in a letter from 5 April 1888 he ordered several paints and wrote that the geranium lake, ordinary lake and carmine should be ‘freshly ground, if they’re greasy, I’ll send them back’. 13 Interestingly, the same phenomenon was encountered when we reconstructed the cochineal paint. The cochineal pigment was easily ground in linseed oil which resulted in a very dark red, <b>opaque</b> <b>paint.</b> After the cochineal paint was kept in an aluminum tube {{for a couple of months}} however, it became very viscous and couldn’t be used as such anymore.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is aimed}} at {{analyzing}} the cooling of hot solid surfaces induced by liquid droplets. In particular, the study {{is focused on the}} comparison between the cooling effects obtained with multiple droplets and sparse spray configurations. A new, non-intrusive measurement of the transient contact temperature between impinging droplets and hot solid surfaces is used and described. An experimental apparatus was built and set up in order to approach the non-trivial problem of the measurement of a solid-liquid interface temperature after droplet impingement. The solid-liquid interface temperature was monitored from below through a transparent-to-infrared material. That material had been coated with a very thin layer of high-emissivity, <b>opaque</b> <b>paint</b> on its upper side, so that it could effectively respond to the infrared camera located below. The paper reports the main results that have been collected to date, with particular regard to the approaches used to coat the transparent solid. Some considerations are also expressed about the effectiveness of the proposed method and about the improvements that are currently being implemented to get new and more accurate interface temperature measurement...|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} quarter of the twelfth century artists in the scriptoria of English monastic houses began using a {{painting}} technique with a more extensive range of colours than had been usual, and used with thicker and more <b>opaque</b> <b>paint.</b> Later, the use of gold leaf increased and gesso grounds were introduced. Such materials were reserved mainly for prestigious liturgical manuscripts such as Bibles and psalters, and also for illustrated saints ’ lives. The prefatory miniatures in the St Albans Psalter and the illustrations in the Bury and Winchester Bibles are examples. This study provides a visual and physical examination of many important illuminations—their paint, gold and colour—and explores their relationship with the texts they illustrate. Original contributions to the scholarship can be found in the chapter on colour, which provides a focus for discussion not available in the previous literature; this includes a survey of colour words used in the Vulgate, and an analysis of the symbolic use of colours by the Alexis Master which reflected centuries of biblical exegesis; in the new analysis and interpretation of the ‘Elkanah’s Gift ’ miniature in the Bury Bible; in...|$|E

[...] Bryson Burroughs, a onetime curator at the Metropolitan Museum, noted that it [...] "assumes the proportion of a great allegory if one chooses". Its drama is of a romantic and heroic vein, the man stoically resigned to fate, surrounded by anecdotal detail reminiscent of Homer's early illustrative works.|$|R
40|$|Wood coating {{research}} {{almost exclusively}} focuses on softwood as substrate {{despite the fact}} that coatings applied on tropical hardwoods show a different weathering behaviour. The objective {{of this study was to}} quantify the impact of wood substrate and coating type on the weathering behaviour of finished wooden joinery in outdoor exposure using a set of statistical methods. Therefore, a broad range of white <b>opaque</b> <b>paints</b> and mid-oak semi-transparent stains were used. The coatings were industrially applied on window frames made of frequently used commercial tropical hardwood species. The general appearance of the wood/coating systems was assessed visually using a rating scale that takes into account the anatomical characteristics of hardwood. For the evaluation, a required minimum exposure time of 2. 5 years outdoor weathering for joinery in vertical position and facing south-west was determined. At 30 months best performances were recorded for waterborne alkyd primers with an acrylic topcoat when dry coating film was sufficiently thick. The dry layer thickness also affected the impact of the hiding power on the performance of the wood/coating system. Within hardwood species the degradation rate of coatings on species with a fine texture was the lowest. The significant influence of the substrate's texture on the weathering behaviour of coated hardwood stressed the need to evaluate the wood/coating system in total...|$|R
