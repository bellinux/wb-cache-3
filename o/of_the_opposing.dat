5|$|An {{additional}} {{cause of}} delay, according to Professor Williams, was the long pause after the debacle of the Battle of Curupayty when the Allies overestimated the strength both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> army and of Humaitá: they allowed López {{almost a year}} to rebuild his forces, devastated at the Battle of Tuyutí.|$|E
5|$|Chance was a disciplinarian. He preached {{moderation}} in socializing, including avoiding alcohol, to {{his players}}. Chance fined his players for {{shaking hands with}} members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> team and forced Solly Hofman to delay his wedding until after the baseball season, lest marriage impair his abilities on the playing field. In August 1911, Chance suspended Tinker {{for the remainder of}} the season for using profanity, though he reinstated Tinker two days later.|$|E
5|$|During the pre-series period, two {{observers}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> {{team were}} allowed to scout the teams. Toronto Maple Leafs' coach John McLellan and Bob Davidson, the Leafs' head scout went to the Soviet Union to observe the Soviets in the Sovietsky Sport tournament. McLellan and Davidson observed two games, while Kulagin, along with Arkadi Chernyshev, a former assistant to Tarasov, observed all of the Canadians' practices in Toronto.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies tied a {{franchise}} record by scoring ten {{runs in the}} first inning, and set season highs in hits (21) and runs scored (22). The 22 runs was the fifth-most in franchise history and was the biggest defeat in the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> Cincinnati Reds franchise.|$|E
5|$|The Queen Elizabeth-class {{ships were}} {{designed}} to form a fast squadron for the fleet that was intended to operate against the leading ships <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> battleline. This required maximum offensive power and a speed several knots faster than any other battleship {{to allow them to}} defeat any type of ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{touchdown}} (TD), worth six points, is {{the most}} valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught in, or recovered {{in the end zone}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> team. The scoring team then attempts a try or conversion, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT), which is a single scoring opportunity.|$|E
50|$|Some {{variations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposed</b> piston or OP designs use {{a single}} crankshaft. The Gobron-Brillié, and Doxford ship engines used a crankshaft {{at one end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinders and a crosshead for <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> piston. <b>The</b> crank throws for each end were often unequal giving a shorter motion for the end having the higher reciprocating weight {{in order to help}} balance.|$|R
40|$|AbstractImplementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{adiabatic}} steady PPDF flamelet model {{involves a}} lot of variations including different scalar dissipation rate calculation methods and different mass diffusion models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposed</b> jet flame. Four different look-up tables have been generated with <b>the</b> combinations <b>of</b> two different scalar dissipation rate calculation methods and two different mass diffusion models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposed</b> jet flame. Simulation of a turbulent non-premixed H 2 jet flame is used to discriminate <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> different implementation methods by comparison with experimental data. It is observed that the turbulent flamelets {{are very close to}} their equilibrium states and the simulation result is not sensitive to <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> dissipation rate calculation method. However, <b>the</b> choice <b>of</b> mass diffusion model has significant influence on the simulation result and excluding the Lewis number effect should be enforced for <b>the</b> <b>opposed</b> jet flame simulation...|$|R

5|$|While {{incurring}} significant casualties {{fighting the}} Black Legion, the Chetnik movement in eastern Bosnia {{benefited from the}} mass desertion of Partisans and the many pro-Chetnik coups in Partisan and volunteer detachments. Despite their lack of unity, the Chetnik movement thrived in eastern Bosnia for the reminder of 1942 because some Chetnik leaders made accommodations with the Ustaše regime and as many Chetniks and Partisans were unwilling to kill fellow Bosnian Serbs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> faction.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prevalent}} skills are his speed and wrist shot, {{the latter of}} which has improved alongside his recent years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, he is an efficient shot blocker, using his body {{to get in the}} way of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size and strength to maintain position in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E
5|$|Blitzball is a minigame that {{requires}} strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is {{played in a}} large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay {{is similar to that}} of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.|$|E

5|$|Niedermayer missed several games {{early in}} the 2001–02 season due to back pain, and his 33 points on the season was his lowest in six seasons. Niedermayer and the Devils reached their fourth Stanley Cup Final in 2002–03. The series was a family affair, as Scott's brother Rob was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. When asked, their mother {{admitted}} she was hoping Rob's Mighty Ducks would win as Scott already had two championships to his name. Scott dashed his brother and mother's hopes, recording two assists in the deciding seventh game to lead the Devils to a 3–0 victory, and win his third Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} reasons for fighting, the {{foremost}} is retaliation. When players engage in play that members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> team consider unscrupulous, a fight can ensue. The fight may be between the assailant and the victim, between the assailant and an enforcer from the victim's team, or between opposing enforcers. Fights that occur for retaliation purposes can be in immediate response to an on-ice incident, to incidents from earlier in the game, or to actions from past games. Enforcers who intend to start a fight have to consider their timing due to the Instigator rule. For example, putting the opposing team on a power play due to penalties incurred from fighting is less advisable when the game is close.|$|E
5|$|On 3March 1779, Nauendorf {{raided the}} Berbersdorf again, {{this time with}} a larger force of {{infantry}} and hussars, and took the entire Prussian garrison as prisoner. Following this action, Joseph, now Emperor, awarded him the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa (19May 1779). This kind of action characterized the entire war; there were no major battles. The armies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> sides conducted series of raids and counter-raids from which they lived off the country-side and tried to deny each other access to supplies and fodder.|$|E

5|$|The VRS {{leadership}} {{estimated the}} total strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> forces at 25,500 troops. In their estimate they included the 110th and 111th Brigades of the HVO from Usora and Žepče, {{as well as}} three brigades of the ARBiH from Gradačac, Maglaj and Tešanj. Although these units {{were not involved in}} the fighting in Posavina, they tied a part of the VRS forces on their own positions. Besides manpower, the VRS also held an advantage in armaments. While the Croat forces had 47 combat vehicles, 35 of which were tanks (9 T-34s, 22 T-55s and 4 M-84s), the VRS had 163 combat vehicles, including three PT-76s, 18 T-34s, 71 T-55s and 24 M-84s. The VRS held an advantage in artillery pieces as well.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match to}} {{take place on the}} event's card was the Six Man Tag Team Tables match pitting the team of Johnny Devine and Team 3D against the team of Jay Lethal and MCMG. The match lasted {{fourteen}} minutes and fifty-nine seconds. The objective of a Six Man Tag Team Tables match is to drive one of the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> team through a table. During the contest, Lethal drove Devine through a table with a driving elbow drop. However, as the referee was scripted to appear unconscious, this allowed Team 3D to knockout MCMG and Lethal with the X Division Championship belt. They followed by draping Devine over Lethal, making it appear as though Devine had drove Lethal through the table, thus winning the match for his team.|$|E
5|$|Two-level utilitarianism is {{virtually}} a synthesis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> doctrines of act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. Act utilitarianism states {{that in all}} cases the morally right action is the one which produces the most pleasure, whereas rule utilitarianism states that the morally right action {{is the one that}} is in accordance with a moral rule whose general observance would create the most happiness. In terms of two-level utilitarianism, act utilitarianism can be likened to the 'critical' level of moral thinking, and rule utilitarianism to the 'intuitive' level.|$|E

5|$|Although the Igor Gouzenko and Elizabeth Bentley affairs {{had raised}} the issue of Soviet espionage as far back as 1945, events in 1949 and 1950 sharply {{increased}} the sense of threat from Communism in the United States. The Soviet Union tested an atomic bomb in 1949, earlier than many analysts had expected. That same year, Mao Zedong's Communist army gained control of mainland China despite heavy American financial support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> Kuomintang. In 1950, the Korean War began, pitting U.S., U.N., and South Korean forces against Communists from North Korea and China. The following year also saw several significant developments regarding Soviet Cold War espionage activities. In January 1950, Alger Hiss, a high-level State Department official, was convicted of perjury. Hiss was in effect found guilty of espionage; the statute of limitations had run out for that crime, but he was convicted of having perjured himself when he denied that charge in earlier testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. In Great Britain, Klaus Fuchs confessed to committing espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union while working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory during the War. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were arrested in 1950 on charges of stealing atomic bomb secrets for the Soviets and were executed in 1953.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, a discontinuous front line ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of crofters and tenant farmers. The White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few, or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> forces existed {{on both sides of the}} front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of Varkaus, Kuopio, Oulu, Raahe, Kemi and Tornio; within the Red area lay Porvoo, Kirkkonummi and Uusikaupunki. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of manpower, the US Eighth Army had three and half times the {{firepower}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposing</b> Chinese forces. The US Fifth Air Force, which {{was responsible for the}} air support, also had little opposition due to {{the lack of}} anti-aircraft weapons by the Chinese. Boosted by a Thanksgiving feast with roasted turkeys on the eve of the advance, the morale was high among the UN ranks, and home by Christmas and Germany by spring was in everyone's mind. The high morale, however, caused a degradation of troop discipline, and most of the soldiers had discarded their equipment and ammunition supply before the battle. A rifle company from the US IX Corps, for example, started its advance with most of the helmets and bayonets thrown away, and there were on average less than one grenade and 50 rounds of ammunition carried per man. Because the UN planners did not foresee that the war would be dragged into a winter campaign, all elements of the Eighth Army started the offensive with a shortage of winter clothing.|$|E
