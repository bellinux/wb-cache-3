5|$|MS is not {{considered}} a hereditary disease; however, a number of genetic variations {{have been shown to}} increase the risk. Some of these genes appear to have higher levels of expression in microglial cells than expected by chance. The probability of developing the disease is higher in relatives of an affected person, with a greater risk among those more closely related. In identical twins both are affected about 30% of the time, while around 5% for non-identical twins and 2.5% <b>of</b> <b>siblings</b> are affected with a lower percentage of half-siblings. If both parents are affected the risk in their children is 10 times that of the general population. MS is also more common in some ethnic groups than others.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{was born}} at Elm House in Walthamstow, Essex, on 24 March 1834. Raised into a wealthy middle-class family, he was named after his father, a {{financier}} {{who worked as a}} partner in the Sanderson & Co. firm, bill brokers in the City of London. His mother was Emma Morris (née Shelton), who descended from a wealthy bourgeois family from Worcester. Morris was the third of his parents' surviving children; their first child, Charles, had been born in 1827 but died four days later. Charles had been followed by the birth of two girls, Emma in 1829 and Henrietta in 1833, before William's birth. These children were followed by the birth <b>of</b> <b>siblings</b> Stanley in 1837, Rendall in 1839, Arthur in 1840, Isabella in 1842, Edgar in 1844, and Alice in 1846. The Morris family were followers of the evangelical Protestant form of Christianity, and William was baptised four months after his birth at St. Mary's Church, Walthamstow.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} clinical, genetic, and epidemiologic factors among 512 probands with nonsyndromal neural tube defects (NTDs). Data {{were analyzed}} after grouping the probands in four different ways {{with respect to}} pathological features and putative pathogenic mechanisms. Apparently unrelated congenital anomalies occurred more frequently among probands with craniorachischisis (62 %), encephalocele (30 %), or multiple NTDs (25 %) than among probands with anencephaly (14. 7 %) or spina bifida (10. 1 %) (P much less than. 0001). Unrelated congenital anomalies occurred less often among probands with low spina bifida (6. 7 %) than among probands with high spina bifida (19. 5 %). NTDs were seen in 7. 8 % <b>of</b> the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> probands with high spina bifida but in only 0. 7 % <b>of</b> the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> probands with low spina bifida, in 2. 2 % <b>of</b> the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> anencephalic probands, and in none <b>of</b> the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> probands with craniorachischisis, encephalocele, or multiple NTDS (P less than. 001). In all 16 families in which two siblings had NTDs, both had either defects of the type associated with abnormal primary neurulation or defects of the type associated with abnormal canalization. High spina bifida and multiple NTDs were found more frequently than expected among the Sikh probands (P less than. 02). The frequency of non-NTD congenital anomalies was higher among <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> Sikh probands (8. 8 %) than among <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> other probands (2. 4 %) (P less than. 05). This excess {{was due to the}} occurrence of hydrocephalus without spina bifida in four <b>of</b> 68 <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> Sikh probands...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundAbdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are {{frequently}} familial. The {{aim of this}} study was to compare the prevalence of AAA among the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> AAA patients with that in the spouses’ <b>siblings.</b> MethodsThe <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> 375 AAA patients and the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> the spouses of the AAA patients were included in this study and offered ultrasonography screening for AAA. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to collect demographic and general health information. Statistical analysis was done with Fisher’s exact test. Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were also calculated. ResultsAbdominal ultrasonography examinations were done for 309 individuals. The results indicated that 11 (11. 2 %) of 98 brothers of AAA patients, 4 (2. 7 %) of 147 sisters, and none <b>of</b> the 64 <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> the spouses of the AAA patients were found to have an AAA. Combining the information from the ultrasonography screening and medical records on already known cases of AAA in these families, altogether 29. 0 % (44 / 152) of the brothers of AAA patients, 11. 1 % (20 / 181) of the sisters of AAA patients, and 2. 3 % (2 / 88) <b>of</b> the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> the spouses had an AAA. ConclusionThere was a significant difference between the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> the AAA patients and those of the spouses both in the frequency of AAA detected by ultrasonography screening and in the overall prevalence of AAA. The overall prevalence of AAA in the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> AAA patients was about eight times that observed among the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> their spouses (19. 2 % vs 2. 3 %). These findings confirmed previous reports on high prevalence <b>of</b> AAA among <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> AAA patients and emphasized the importance of an ultrasonography screening program for <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> AAA patients...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{consistent}} epidemiological findings in schizophrenia research is the small excess of late winter/early spring births. There is also evidence that schizophrenia is associated with urban birth and with later birth order. One interpretation of these three findings is that respiratory viral infections brought into the household by children in crowded areas could disrupt foetal brain development and predispose to schizophrenia in later life. To further explore this hypothesis, case register data {{were used to assess}} if schizophrenics with a greater number <b>of</b> older <b>siblings</b> {{are more likely to be}} born in urban areas and during late winter/early spring months. Data from the Dublin and Three County Case Register were compiled relating to 2969 patients with schizophrenia and 5904 patients with neurosis. We used logistic regression analysis to determine if the number <b>of</b> older <b>siblings</b> differentiated schizophrenia from neurosis after controlling for the effects of gender, urban/rural birth, season of birth and sibship size, and to examine whether any interactions existed. The number <b>of</b> older <b>siblings</b> did not predict a diagnosis of schizophrenia over neurosis. There was no interaction between number <b>of</b> older <b>siblings</b> and urban birth, between number <b>of</b> older <b>siblings</b> and spring birth, or between number <b>of</b> older <b>siblings,</b> season <b>of</b> birth and urban birth. These data do not support the hypothesis that schizophrenia, by comparison with neurosis, is associated with an increased number <b>of</b> older <b>siblings</b> or that there is an interaction between number <b>of</b> older <b>siblings,</b> urban birth or season of birth. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the schooling of girls on the education <b>of</b> their younger <b>siblings.</b> In order to examine the causal impact of the education of older children on their younger siblings, we take advantage of a stipend program targeted towards girls, but not boys of the same cohort. The program causes exogenous variation in schooling of girls which enable us to estimate {{the effects of the}}ir education on the education <b>of</b> their younger <b>siblings.</b> We find that the education <b>of</b> older <b>siblings</b> has a significant positive effect on the schooling <b>of</b> their younger <b>siblings.</b> The results suggest that an additional year of schooling <b>of</b> older <b>siblings</b> increases the schooling <b>of</b> their younger <b>siblings</b> by about 0. 13 years. The stipend program can account about a 10 per cent increase in the schooling <b>of</b> younger <b>siblings.</b> The results suggest that such programs could bring both short- and long-term gains, not only via direct benefits to the affected children, but also via indirect benefits to their siblings...|$|R

25|$|The {{presence}} of mega-telomeres varies between species. For example, human chromosomes {{do not have}} mega-telomeres while mice and many species of birds do. There is also variation in their structure and location within the same species.

Analysis <b>of</b> <b>siblings</b> from highly inbred chicken-lines have suggested that these ultra-long telomeric sequences are extremely heterogenous.

40|$|In France {{as in the}} US, the {{participation}} of a mother in the labour market {{is influenced by the}} sex <b>of</b> her oldest <b>siblings.</b> Same-sex mothers tend to have more children and to work significantly less than the other mothers. In contast, the sex <b>of</b> the oldest <b>siblings</b> does not have any perceptible influence on neighbourhood choices. There is no correlation between the sex <b>of</b> the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> a mother and the sex <b>of</b> the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> the other mothers living in the same close neighbourhood. Given these facts, the distribution of the sex <b>of</b> the <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> the other mothers provides us with a plausible instrumental variable to identify the influence of other mothers' participation on a mother's participation in the labour market. Reduced-form analysis reveals that a mother's participation in the labour market is significantly affected by the sex <b>of</b> the oldest <b>siblings</b> <b>of</b> the other mothers living in the same neighbourhood. IV estimates suggest a strong impact of close neighbours' participation in the labour market on individual participation. We compare this result to estimates produced using the distribution of children's quarters of birth to generate instruments. Mothers whose children were born {{at the end of the}} year cannot send their children to pre-elementary school as early as the other mothers and participate less in the labour market. Interestingly enough, estimates using the distribution of quarters of birth in the neighbourhood as instruments are as strong as estimates using the sex-mix instruments.
