2500|$|Queries about AET's {{commitment}} to Diversity {{have been raised}} concerning a number of incidents. For example a review of diversity and equal opportunities amongst Academy chains found that AET's board listed 8 trustees in Spring 2016, {{all of whom were}} white and male. When challenged about how this fitted with the trusts claims to promote diversity, AET accepted that improvement was needed and stated â€œWe are taking steps to increase the diversity of <b>our</b> <b>board</b> of trustees. We hope to make an announcement about new appointments in the near future." [...] Furthermore, the AET appointment of CEO Ian Comfort took place without the advertisement or appointment process recommended in AET's own Equal Opportunities policy for staff appointments A further issue which aroused considerable opposition was the closing of Western Primary school as it seemed to fly in the face of parents religious sensibilities, compelling some students to attend a faith school, against the wishes of their parents. The National Secular Society raised serious concerns about AET's approach to the sensitive issues. (Western Primary school joined AET as a 'good' school but then became [...] "inadequate" [...] when it was inspected by OFSTED after 2 years as an AET school, in January 2015. AET faced fierce criticism from locals who wrote a 1500 handwritten and 600 electronic strong petition [...] AET was asked to reconsider closure, accused of manipulating predicted intake figures to the DfE, accused of giving out misleading press releases and of making major decisions inquorate") ...|$|E
