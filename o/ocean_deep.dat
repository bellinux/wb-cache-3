5|$|On September30, a {{well-developed}} tropical wave {{moved off}} the eastern coast of Africa {{and entered the}} Atlantic <b>Ocean.</b> <b>Deep</b> convection formed around a prominent mid-level circulation as it moved towards the west. However, the convection diminished on October2 before entering the Caribbean Sea a week later. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the low. Continued development followed and the low was designated as Tropical Depression Fifteen at 0600UTC on October13 while located about 190miles (305kilometres) south of the southeastern tip of the Dominican Republic. The previous steady westward motion that the system took across the Atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another day or two. As {{the structure of the}} storm improved, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave it the name Omar.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>ocean</b> water (DOW) is {{the name}} for cold, salty water found deep {{below the surface of}} Earth's oceans. Ocean water differs in {{temperature}} and salinity. Warm surface water is generally saltier than the cooler deep or polar waters; in polar regions, the upper layers of ocean water are cold and fresh. [...] <b>Deep</b> <b>ocean</b> water makes up about 90% of the volume of the <b>oceans.</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>ocean</b> water has a very uniform temperature, around 0-3 °C, and a salinity of about 3.5% or as oceanographers state as 35 ppt (parts per thousand).|$|R

The Arctic <b>Ocean</b> <b>Deep</b> Water is approximately 34.92 psu. This water mass has a higher salinity due to brine rejection in the Arctic Seas. The depth is around 1500 and 2000 meters. The Norwegian Sea Deep Water {{is a combination of}} the Arctic <b>Ocean</b> <b>Deep</b> Water and the Greenland Sea Deep Water. This water mass is found below 2000 meters. Because of the warmer temperatures from the North Atlantic Current, this water mass is ice-free during the year.|$|E

50|$|The {{atmosphere}} is heated from below, {{which leads to}} convection, the largest expression {{of which is the}} Hadley circulation.
