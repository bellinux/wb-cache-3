60|$|The correspondent, in {{the world}} of the senses, to the {{magnetic}} axis, exists in the series of metals. The metalleity, as the universal base of the planet, is a necessary deduction from the principles of the system. From the infusible, though evaporable, diamond to nitrogen itself, the metallic nature of which has been long suspected by chemists, though still under the mistaken notion of an <b>oxyde,</b> we trace a series of metals from the maximum of coherence to positive fluidity, in all ordinary temperatures, we mean. Though, in point of fact, cold itself is but a superinduction of the one pole, or, what amounts to the same thing, the subtraction of the other, under the modifications afore described; and therefore are the metals indecomposible, because they are themselves the decompositions of the metallic axis, in all its degrees of longitude and latitude. Thus the substance of the planet from which it is, is metallic; while that which is ever becoming, is in like manner produced through the perpetual modification of the first by the opposite forces of the second; that is, by the principle of contraction and difference at the eastern extreme—the element of fire, or the oxygen of the chemists; and by the elementary power of dilatation, or universality at its western extreme—the ὑδωρ ἐν ὑδατι of the ancients, and the hydrogen of the laboratory.|$|E

40|$|The {{study has}} been carried out on eleven soils using both soil {{analysis}} and a greenhouse pot experiment. Soil boron has been determined according to the hot water method and fractioned in five distinct fractions. The greenhouse experiment was carried out according to the Neubauer technic using barley as the plant test. Hot water boron represents 0. 81 % of total boron. The > and > fractions are negligible and represent together 1. 18 % of total boron. The residual fraction constitutes the most important fraction and represents 78. 75 %.

The soil characteristics that most influenced the different forms of soil boron are cation exchange capacity, texture, organic matter and pH. Highly significant correlations have been observed between these soil characteristics and some forms of soil boron.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn {{this report}} an {{overview}} is presented {{of the operating}} results of the automatic measuring equipment and of the data acquisition system of the Netherlands National Air Quality Monitoring Network in the years 1987 and 1988. The measuring equipment for sulphur dioxyde including a new monitor scored a number of failures of 0, 92 a year only. As {{a result of a}} modification of one of the monitor's electrodes the equipment for carbon monxyde showed less defects. The mean number of failures in the equipment for ozone is higher than in the old network. This score is attributed tot the poor quality of the Rhodamine B discs used in the monitors. The high failures's number for the equipment for nitrogen <b>oxydes</b> is related to service and maintenance. The results for the equipment for wind velocity and for wind direction are good. During 1987 and 1988 the failure's number for the data acquisition combination modem and stationprocessor are 0, 97 and 0, 81 respectively. In general, the performance of the network can be described by two parameters the net effieciency of the equipment and the gross efficiency. Net effieciencies are higher than in previous years for sulphur dioxyde, carbon monoxyde and for nitrogen <b>oxydes.</b> Net effieciency of the ozone equipment is about the same in the new network and in the old one.

30|$|The Satsuma-Iwojima volcano {{has been}} {{emitting}} continuously high temperature (600 ° to 900 °C) gases {{for at least}} 800 years. We identified the minerals that form in response to closed-system cooling of these gases and from air-mixing reactions. Major differences compared with the sublimates observed at other volcanoes are the occurrence of wulfenite (PbMoO 4) and several mixed chlorides. This is the first report of wulfenite in fumarolic deposits. Thermochemical modeling shows that wulfenite precipitates between 540 ° and 490 °C from a gas with lower sulfur content and/or higher fO 2, and a higher Mo content (log fSO 2 = − 2.1, log fH 2 S = − 5, log ffO 2 = − 18.6, log fH 2 MoO 4 = − 4.5, T = 500 °C) than the previously reported gas composition. The occurrence of abundant K, Pb, Fe, Zn, Rb and Cs mixed chlorides may be promoted by the low S/Cl of the Satsuma-Iwojima high temperature gases. Natural sublimates of metallic elements (molybdenite, wulfenite, anglesite, Tl-Pb and Tl-Bi sulfides, Mo <b>oxydes</b> and Pb oxides) are deposited along the fumarolic conduit {{and on the ground}} under conditions of variable temperatures and fO 2. The increase in fO 2 due to the mixing of the gases with the atmosphere reduces the volatility of several elements (As, Sn, Na, K and Pb) by promoting their condensation at higher temperatures. As air mixes with volcanic gas in the fumarolic plume, we can expect to find these metals as aerosols.|$|R

Therefore in area strongly dependent from groundwater exploitation {{such as in}} warm climate contexts, the understanding of geological, geochemical and anthropogenic processes involved in U mobility is strongly required. This study aims at characterizing U concentrations and mobility in the Recife´s groundwater (Pernambuco state, NE Brazil.), exploited from a multi-layered sedimentary aquifer system. Due to population increases and climate change impacts, groundwater resources are highly strategic for the coming decades and their quality needs to be evaluated. In this perspective, chemical analyses of major and traces elements, including U, were performed within the superficial and deep aquifers. The results show a high variability in mobile U, implying heterogeneity of sources and processes. Coupled with a lithological description of the area, geochemical modeling was carried out, aiming at evaluate possible speciation processes. It appears that the different lithologies, inherited from plutonic, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks may primarily explain the presence of U. In addition,immobilization by hydroxyferrous <b>oxydes</b> may occur, controlled by pH and pE and amount of iron present in the system. When these parameters are affected, U may be mobile {{in the form of}} Uranyl ions (low pH) or associated to free carbonate complexes (high pH). As these preliminary conclusions are still based on hypothesis about the abundance of iron, this study highlights the importance of a detailed knowledge of aquifer mineralogy to better understand U mobility constraints in groundwater.

For this purpose, the IEK-model previously developed by the group (Zelano et al., submitted) was applied, on the basis of IEK experiments performed on pure typical Ni scavengers (serpentines, chlorite, smectite and iron <b>oxydes)</b> from ultramafic systems. For each typical scavenger, this model describes the percentage of Ni associated to exchangeable pool(s) as well as their corresponding kinetic constant(s) of exchange. The mineralogical composition of soil and ore samples and Ni solid speciation were first determined, and the IEK-model was applied on these bases. In almost all samples, an important contribution of serpentine to Ni exchangeable pool was highlighted, ranging between 10 % and 45 %. The important amount of organic matter (OM) in one of the studied soil samples, allowed to extrapolate generic OM ENi and k parameters, which were introduced in the IEK-model to improve its predictive capability. Obtained results provided evidences of how even a small content (3 wt%) of organic carbon (OC), can represent an important contribution of OM to the total ENi pool (60 %). In the investigated ore samples, up to the 60 % of ENi was attribute to smectite, responsible for fast ENi pool kinetic evolution. In addition, the model highlighted the role of the Fine Black Ash (FBA), by-products of the pyrometallurgical activity, detected into a soil sample, that is responsible for the 15 % of ENi. This approach allowed to determine, for the first time, the relative contribution of each Ni bearing phase to the total exchangeable pool, in terms of concentration and kinetics...|$|R
