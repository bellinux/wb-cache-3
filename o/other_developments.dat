In Britain, thickwalled and partly underground World War II pillboxes have been converted to make roosts for bats, and purpose-built bat houses are occasionally built to mitigate damage to habitat from road or <b>other</b> <b>developments.</b>|$|E
5|$|On January 29, 1913, Calvin Shelverton {{applied for}} a {{building}} permit to construct the Piedmont Park Apartments. The apartments were designed by Leila Ross Wilburn and were decidedly middle-class unlike some of the <b>other</b> <b>developments</b> in the area. The apartments remained middle-class up until about 1960, and residents included such prominent Atlantans as accounting company president T. C. Dunlap and lawyer J. B. Stewart. In 1913, seven clay courts were built where the 1895 Cotton States and International Exposition's Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building once was. Eight more courts were added in 1914 to accommodate the overwhelming demand.|$|E

5|$|The Trans-Canada Highway, {{passing through}} Banff, has been problematic, posing hazards for {{wildlife}} due to vehicle traffic {{and as an}} impediment to wildlife migration. Grizzly bears are among the species impacted by the highway, which together with <b>other</b> <b>developments</b> in Banff, has caused fragmentation of the landscape. Grizzly bears prefer the montane habitat, which has been most impacted by development. Wildlife crossings, including a series of underpasses, and six wildlife overpasses, have been constructed {{at a number of}} points along the Trans-Canada Highway to help alleviate this problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} <b>other</b> <b>developments.</b> Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E

Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among many <b>other</b> <b>developments.</b> Most recently, themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.|$|E

5|$|A {{communications}} variant designated Tu-142MR ("Bear J") was {{the last}} production version of the Tu-142. It was tasked with long-range communications duties with Soviet ballistic missile submarines, a role {{similar to that of}} the Boeing E-6 Mercury. The Tu-142MR differed from the ASW Tu-142s in having less-sophisticated avionics, but had a long trailing wire radio aerial to relay messages to submerged Soviet submarines in times of nuclear war. This was amongst the many distinctive features of the Tu-142MR that allows it to communicate with satellites, airborne and ground-based command posts, and submarines. The aircraft replaced the Ilyushin Il-80 in the airborne command and control role. Tu-142s are currently operated by the 76th Naval Aviation Regiment from Kipelovo. <b>Other</b> <b>developments</b> of the Tu-142 include the one-off Tu-142MRT maritime reconnaissance variant, and the unbuilt Tu-142MS missile-carrying variant.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of Hilton Head as a resort started in 1956 with Charles E. Fraser developing Sea Pines Resort. Soon, <b>other</b> <b>developments</b> followed, such as Hilton Head Plantation, Palmetto Dunes Plantation, Shipyard Plantation, and Port Royal Plantation, imitating Sea Pines' architecture and landscape. Sea Pines however continued {{to stand out}} by creating a unique locality within the plantation called Harbour Town, anchored by a recognizable lighthouse. Fraser was a committed environmentalist who changed the whole configuration of the marina at Harbour Town to save an ancient live oak. It {{came to be known}} as the Liberty Oak, known to generations of children who watched singer and songwriter Gregg Russell perform under the tree for over 25 years. Fraser was buried next to the tree when he died in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Urbanization {{can result}} in the {{fragmentation}} of contiguous natural landscapes into patchy habitat within an urban area. Animals that live in these fragmented areas often have reduced movement between the habitat patches, {{which can lead to}} reduced gene flow and pathogen transmission between patches. Animals such as the bobcat are particularly sensitive to fragmentation because of their large home ranges. A study in coastal Southern California has shown bobcat populations are affected by urbanization, creation of roads, and <b>other</b> <b>developments.</b> The populations may not be declining as much as predicted, but instead the connectivity of different populations is affected. This leads to a decrease in natural genetic diversity among bobcat populations. For bobcats, preserving open space in sufficient quantities and quality is necessary for population viability. Educating local residents about the animals is critical, as well, for conservation in urban areas.|$|E

5|$|Walters Cultural Arts Center was {{designed}} to be a bookend, along with the Hillsboro Civic Center, to increased downtown development. The center is the cityâ€™s first dedicated arts facility. City officials hoped to create a magnet for artists and aficionados in the downtown area with the center and <b>other</b> <b>developments</b> that include a renovated Venetian Theatre. The goal was to have the center encourage art studios to open and for art related festivals to develop to attract people to downtown after most businesses closed. Traditionally, shops and businesses closed by 6:00p.m. as workers in the county seat left for the day. The center also is rented out to groups for private functions.|$|E
5|$|Leet's group reached Manila in July 1945, {{where they}} met with the {{intelligence}} staff of General of the Army Douglas MacArthur's Army Forces, Pacific. Following the surrender of Japan the mission traveled to Japan and visited various research establishments including Tokyo Imperial University, Waseda University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, the Institute for Materials Research, Tokyo Shibaura Denki (Toshiba), the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, the National Research Council, and the Board of Technology. The mission, which included Karl Compton, interviewed over 300 Japanese scientists and produced reports on Japanese research into radar, rockets, and <b>other</b> <b>developments,</b> including chemical and biological warfare. The Manhattan Project Intelligence Group, {{under the command of}} Philip Morrison, arrived in Japan in September 1945 and examined Japan's wartime nuclear weapons program. The group concluded that lack of uranium ore and low priority had doomed the Japanese effort. They reported that, contrary to American belief, Japan's nuclear physicists were competent.|$|E
