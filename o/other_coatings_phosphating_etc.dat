The physical and chemical properties of calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> formed by RF-magnetron sputtering of calcium phosphate tribasic, hydroxyapatite, calcium phosphate monobasic, calcium phosphate dibasic dihydrate and calcium pyrophosphate powders were characterized. Cell adhesion and cell viability were examined on calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> using mesenchymal stem cells. The results of cytotoxicity measurements of the calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> revealed that only the coating obtained by RF-magnetron sputtering of the calcium phosphate dibasic dihydrate and calcium phosphate tribasic powders possessed lower cell viability than the zirconia substrate. The coating formed by sputtering of the calcium phosphate tribasic powder demonstrated more cells adhered onto its surface compared with <b>other</b> calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Phosphate induced {{stabilisation}} {{has been}} used to create passive iron <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> on pyrite and pyrrhotite. The formation of solid <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> on sulfide grains thereby inhibits sulfide oxidation. The aims of the study were to determine whether phosphate induced stabilisation could control sulfide oxidation and metal mobility in partly oxidised, polymineralic, sulfidic mine wastes. Waste materials were obtained from the acid mine drainage generating, abandoned Montalbion silver mine site, far north Queensland, Australia. The waste consists of quartz, kaolinite/illite, sulfide minerals (galena, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, sphalerite, pyrite, arsenopyrite), and pre- and post-mining oxidation products (hydrated Fe, Cu, Pb and alkali mineral salts). SEM observations of waste material treated with potassium orthophosphate showed that metal, metal-alkali and alkali <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> developed on all sulfides (with the exception of tetrahedrite). The abundance of phosphate phases was dependant on the availability of cations in solution for complexation with the phosphate anion. In turn, the release of cations was dependent on sulfide oxidation or the dissolution of efflorescent mineral salts. Experiments aiming to dissolve these <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> – using a strongly oxidising solution – showed that the <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> remained stable, preventing acid generation and metal release. The results of this study demonstrate that liquid phosphate stabilisers can suppress sulfide oxidation and immobilise metals in partly oxidised, polymineralic mine wastes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Biomimetic calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} for bone regeneration and repair because of their biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, and easy preparation. They can be rendered osteoinductive by incorporating an osteogenic agent, such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2), into the crystalline lattice work in physiological situations. The biomimetic calcium phosphate coating enables a controlled, slow and local release of BMP- 2 when it undergoes cell mediated coating degradation induced by multinuclear cells, such as osteoclasts and foreign body giant cells, which mimics a physiologically similar release mode, to achieve sustained ectopic or orthotopic bone formation. Therefore, biomimetic calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> are considered to be a promising delivery vehicle for osteogenic agents. In this review, we present an overview of biomimetic calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> including their preparation techniques, physico-chemical properties, potential as drug carrier, and their pre-clinical application both in ectopic and orthotopic animal models. We briefly review some features of hydroxyapatite coatings and their clinical applications to gain insight into the clinical applications of biomimetic calcium <b>phosphate</b> <b>coatings</b> in the near future...|$|R

30|$|The Dupli-color {{specimen}} {{shows the}} most irregular deposit after ageing. The calcareous encrustation only partially covers the substrate. Due to its limited thickness, the bronze remains still partly visible underneath (Fig.  4, specimens labelled PA). This corresponds to more limited {{variation of the}} colorimetric characteristics {{with respect to the}} <b>other</b> <b>coatings.</b> The average lightness increase is almost negligible (Fig.  5, green dots), although with much larger standard deviation than the <b>other</b> <b>coatings,</b> due to the discontinuous presence of the deposit. The main effect is the reduction of the average red component (∆a = − 5) also in this case. The overall results indicate that the presence of Dupli-color is associated with a reduced formation of the calcareous deposit over the bronze surface, compared to the other treatments.|$|R
