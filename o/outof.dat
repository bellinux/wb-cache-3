It is perhaps best described as a [...] "space-frameconstruction set". Its elements consist of small connector nodesand struts of various colors. The overall shape of a connector node isthat of a non-uniform small rhombicosidodecahedron, except that each faceis replaced by a small hole. The ends of the struts are designed tofit in the holes of the connector nodes, allowing for syntheses ofa variety of structures. The idea of shape-coding {{the three types of}} struts was developed by Marc Pelletier and Paul Hildebrandt. To create the [...] "balls," [...] or nodes, Pelletier and Hildebrandt invented a system of 62 hydraulic pins that came together to form a mold. The first connector node emerged from their mold perfectly on April 1, 1992. These parts are made from state-of-the-art ABS plastic injection-mold technology. [...] In the years since 1992, Zometool has widened and enriched its line of products. Much of the development has focused on improving the style or the variety of struts available. Since 1992, the basic design of the connector node has not changed, and hence the various parts released have remained universally compatible. From 1992 until 2000, Zometool produced many kits which included connector nodes and blue, yellow, and red struts. In 2000, Zometool introduced green lines, which were designed to allow the user to build, among other things, models of the regular tetrahedron and octahedron. In 2003, Zometool changed the style of the struts slightly. The struts [...] "with clicks" [...] have a different surface texture and they also have longer nibs which allow for a more robust connection between connector node and strut.|$|E

Access decoupling is a latency hiding technique that partitions a program into two separate instruction streams to aggressively prefetch data. Superscalar architectures can support data prefetching through <b>outof</b> -order execution, non-blocking loads and lock-up free caches.
