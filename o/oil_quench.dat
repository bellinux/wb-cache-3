5000|$|Honyaki (literally true-fired) is {{the name}} for the Japanese {{traditional}} method of construction most often seen in kitchen knives (but also other tools) of forging a blade in technique most similar to the tradition of nihonto from {{a single piece of}} high-carbon steel covered with clay to yield upon quench a soft, resilient spine, a hamon (or temper line), and hard, sharp edge. Honyaki as a term alone can refer to either mizu honyaki (water-quench) or abura honyaki (<b>oil</b> <b>quench).</b> The goal is to produce a sharper, longer lasting edge than is usually achievable with the lamination method. The term has been adapted to describe high-end mono-stainless in Japan and carbon blades by non-Japanese bladesmiths that have a hamon but are made with Western steel, heat treat, equipment, finishing (etching and polishing), and design.|$|E
5000|$|A forge {{is a type}} of hearth {{used for}} heating metals, or the {{workplace}} (smithy) where such a hearth is located. The forge is used by the smith to heat a piece of metal to a temperature where it becomes easier to shape by forging, or to the point where work hardening no longer occurs. The metal (known as the [...] "workpiece") is transported to and from the forge using tongs, which are also used to hold the workpiece on the smithy's anvil while the smith works it with a hammer. Sometimes such as when hardening steel or cooling the work so that it may be handled with bare hands; the workpiece is transported to the slack tub, which rapidly cools the workpiece in a large body of water, however depending upon the metal type eg [...] "steel", it may require an <b>oil</b> <b>quench,</b> having said that, a salt brine may be in order, many metals require more than just plain water hardening. The slack tub also provides water to control the fire in the forge.|$|E
5000|$|Steel Qualities and Quenchant: Blacksmith skill {{aside and}} {{specific}} heat treatment aside, the 1 versions (higher carbon) are harder, more wear resistant, more fragile {{and harder to}} forge, harder to sharpen, and harder to straighten.. The 3 versions (lower carbon, at the eutectoid point) are not necessarily softer, but often tougher, easier to sharpen, and easier to make. Blue steel {{is more difficult to}} forge, sharpen, and straighten (because the [...] "soft" [...] steel covered by clay still hardens). To perform traditional water quench on this steel can exacerbate the formation of cracks because of its deeper hardening. White steel 1 is difficult to forge and to quench from its higher carbon and can become harder and more brittle than White 2. A water quench with these traditional steels and processes will result in a blade that is harder, stiffer, sharper with longer lasting sharpness but that is harder to sharpen and relatively less tough. An <b>oil</b> <b>quench</b> with the same steels will result in a blade that is marginally less hard, stiff, sharp with less lasting sharpness but that is easier to sharpen and more tough. The choice of quenchant depends on user preference of blade qualities.|$|E

The results showed that palm kernel oil cools faster at 200 °C and 250 °C, while palm oil and shea butter <b>oil</b> <b>quench</b> faster at 300 °C and 350 °C, respectively. Palm kernel oil offers the highest elongation at 200 °C, while at 350 °C shea butter oil gave the best result.

Highest hardness values were obtained from samples quenched in melon oil between 200 °C- 300 °C. However, these values decreased with increased heating temperature probably due to density and viscosity variation with temperature rise.

A particular focus {{of the project was}} understanding how the strength and electrical conductivity of the composite are related to its microstructure in the hope that a conducting material with light weight, high strength, and high electrical conductivity can be developed to produce overhead high-voltage power transmission cables. The current power transmission cables (e. g., Aluminum Conductor Steel Reinforced (ACSR)) have acceptable performance for high-voltage AC transmission, but are less well suited for high-voltage DC transmission due to the poorly conducting core materials that support the cable weight. This Al/Ca composite was produced by powder metallurgy and severe plastic deformation by extrusion and swaging.

Two effects typical for <b>oil</b> <b>quenching</b> of large gears are incorporated in the model.
