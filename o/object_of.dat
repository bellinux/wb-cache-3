5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E

40|$|When a {{data set}} {{contains}} <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> multiple types, to cluster the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> one type, {{it is often}} necessary to consider the cluster structure on the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> the other types. Co-clustering the related objects often generates better clusters. One basic connection {{here is that the}} similarity among the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> one type is often affected by the cluster structures on the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> the other types. Although many co-clustering schemes have been proposed, none has explicitly explored such a connection. We propose a framework that utilizes this connection directly. In this framework, employing a spectral-embeddingbased approach, we first obtain certain approximate cluster information about the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> individual types. Such information is then used to refine the similarity measures for the <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> the related types. The final clustering is performed with the refined similarity. We tested our framework on both bipartite-graph and document clustering. Our experiments showed that the refined similarity leads to much better clustering, indicating that our refinement makes the similarity measures closer to their true values. ...|$|R

5|$|This step is {{necessary}} because the rational nexus test is not foolproof. The test {{is based on}} the presumption that the legislative object itself is not in violation of the Constitution.

Hence, the test is only applicable if the <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the impugned legislation is a proper one.|$|E

5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both {{in the sense of the}} previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct <b>object</b> <b>of</b> a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect <b>object</b> <b>of</b> a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the conceptual challenges to an aesthetic model of living plants based in embodied interaction with flora through smell, taste, touch, sound and sight.

A multi-sensorial aesthetics of flora requires auto-centric proximity and degrees of intersubjectivity between the appreciator and the appreciated plant that raise important philosophical questions about aesthetic experience of the natural world...|$|R
