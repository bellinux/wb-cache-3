5|$|Soon after {{producing}} {{the music for}} Myth II, Bungie contracted O'Donnell for several of Bungie's other projects, including the third-person game Oni. In 1999, Bungie wanted to re-negotiate the contracts for Oni, and the negotiations resulted in O'Donnell joining the Bungie team, only ten days before the company was bought by Microsoft. O'Donnell was one <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of Bungie employees who remained working at the company since then, until his termination as of April 2014. While O'Donnell worked at Bungie, Salvatori handled {{the business side of}} TotalAudio.|$|E
5|$|Alex Rebar, in one <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of film {{appearances}} {{throughout his}} acting career, starred as Steve West. Burr DeBenning played Dr. Ted Nelson, and General Michael Perry was portrayed by Myron Healey, who was, Everman notes, often {{cast as a}} villain in 1950s science fiction films. Film director Jonathan Demme played the small role of Matt Winters, one of West's victims. Rainbeaux Smith, {{best known for her}} appearances in B movies and exploitation films, appeared in The Incredible Melting Man as a model who finds one of West's victims while trying to avoid a photographer seeking to take explicit photos of her.|$|E

5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased {{to the point where it}} appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E
5|$|The 1949 Texas {{hurricane}} was {{an intense}} tropical cyclone of the 1949 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming in the Pacific Ocean on September 27, the storm crossed into the Gulf of Mexico—one <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of known storms to do so—and began to intensify. It ultimately peaked with winds corresponding to high-end Category 2 status on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale and made landfall near Freeport, Texas, {{on the morning}} of October 4. It rapidly weakened after moving inland and dissipated several days later. Damage from the storm was moderate, although the hurricane temporarily cut off the city of Galveston from the mainland. Rice crops suffered extensive damage, with losses estimated at up to $10million (1949USD, $ USD). Two people died due to the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, the medieval {{structure}} of the property had become quite limiting for the owners. The buildings {{on either side of}} the tower were then pulled down to allow for the construction of Hall Farm, including a more modern farm house; only the tower survived to become an ancillary farm building. In 1973 the Lonsdale Estate, who owned Hall Farm, placed the tower into the guardianship of the Department of the Environment, who decided to open it to the public. An archaeological excavation of the site took place between 1977 and 1979, making it one <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of such sites in Cumbria to have been investigated in this way. In the 21st century the tower is in the care of English Heritage as a tourist attraction, and is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E

25|$|Indiana was {{launched}} on March 25, 1873, {{and made her}} maiden voyage on October 27.

25|$|The Stems epitomised 1980s indie rock, {{giving it}} a wider currency. They are one <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of bands among them the Hoodoo Gurus (half of the {{original}} line-up of the Hoodoo Gurus also came from Perth) and The Sunnyboys) that cracked the mainstream charts with an indie approach in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|U-1163 did {{not have}} a very prosperous career. While she was {{commissioned}} on 6 October 1943, it was not until 3 December 1944 that she sank her first (and only) enemy vessel. Despite her lack of ships sunk, U-1163 was one <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of German U-boats in World War II to help shoot down a De Havilland Mosquito on 2 August 1944.|$|E

Because of this, the circuit contains more left-hand turns than right-hand ones, placing greater physical demands on the drivers whose bodies, particularly their necks, are more adapted to the lateral g-forces of clockwise circuits.|$|E

25|$|The Korematsu {{decision}} {{has not been}} explicitly overturned, but in 2011, the Department of Justice filed an official notice conceding that the Solicitor General's defense of the internment policy at the time had been in error. However, the Court's opinion remains significant: {{it was the first}} instance of the Supreme Court applying the strict scrutiny standard to racial discrimination by the government. Also, it was one <b>of</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>handful</b> of cases in which the Court held that the government had met that standard.|$|E

As a youth, he found himself torn between an Islamic upbringing and the Birmingham's thriving club scene. In his late teens and early twenties, Ali entrenched himself in the urban Hip hop music scene, a lifestyle of late nights and partying that he said eventually left him disillusioned.|$|E
25|$|The Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge (also {{known as}} the Woodrow Wilson Bridge or the Wilson Bridge) is a bascule bridge that spans the Potomac River between the {{independent}} city of Alexandria, Virginia, and Oxon Hill in Prince George's County, Maryland, United States.

It contained the only portion of the Interstate system {{owned and operated by}} the federal government, but was turned over to the Virginia and Maryland departments of transportation upon project completion.|$|E
50|$|The Gladstone Room also {{contains}} William Ewart Gladstone's original cabinet table, semi-circular in design {{so that he}} could look all his ministers in the eye as he held forth.
