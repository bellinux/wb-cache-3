5|$|The color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> {{indicates}} {{the results to}} the people assembled in St Peter's Square. Dark smoke (fumata nera) indicates that the ballot {{did not result in}} an election, while white smoke (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope was chosen. Originally, in the event a pope was not elected, damp straw was added to the fire to create dark smoke. In the event a new pope was elected, the ballots were burned alone, creating white smoke.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> {{the commanders}} {{of the second}} line of Polish {{outposts}} {{could not see the}} approaching Russians and did not open fire. Contrary to the battle plan, the second line did not send reinforcements to the first. This was particularly important in the case of Forts 54 and 56, as they had to face the enemy alone, without the support of Forts 21, 22 and 23 behind them. The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{animation}} <b>of</b> volcanic <b>smoke</b> {{is useful}} for natural disaster simulations, entertainments, etc. In this paper, we propose a model to generate realistic animations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke.</b> <b>The</b> model is designed by taking the eruption magnitude decided by the eruption velocity and <b>the</b> initial volcanic <b>smoke</b> density, <b>the</b> buoyancy generated by the difference between <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke</b> density and <b>the</b> atmospheric density, and <b>the</b> decreasing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke</b> density due to <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pyroclasts (fragments <b>of</b> magma); i. e., this model is based on <b>the</b> physical dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke.</b> In this model, the Navier-Stokes equations are used, and we solve the equations by using <b>the</b> method <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Coupled Map Lattice (CML) that is an efficient solver. Hence, in our system, <b>the</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke</b> can be calculated in practical calculation time, and various shapes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volcanic <b>smoke</b> can be generated by only changing some parameters. Therefore, realistic volcanic smoke animations can be created by our approach efficiently. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Tamale and three villages around it. The method involved processing and smoking some raw freshwater fish species with different fuel wood species to ascertain <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> products. A market survey was conducted to match <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> products with those sold on the market and determine consumer preference on the Tamale Central Market (TCM).

All the fuel wood species had high relative efficiency (> 5. 5 %). Thirty-one smoked freshwater fish species, belonging to 21 families were sold on the TCM. These come from 9 sources.

5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoke</b> in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
5|$|Several rebellions erupted {{during the}} regency. The first were the Rebellion of Santa Rita (1831), the Revolt of the Year <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Smoke</b> (1833) and the Cabanada (or War of the Cabanos, 1832–34), which sought {{the return of}} Pedro I and which {{had the support of}} common people, former slaves, and slaves. The death of Pedro I on 24 September 1834 ended their hopes. The {{promulgation}} of the Additional Act in 1834, a constitutional amendment that gave higher administrative and political provincial decentralization, exacerbated conflicts between political parties, as whichever dominated the provinces would also gain control over the electoral and political system. Those parties which lost elections rebelled and tried to assume power by force. Rebellious factions, however, continued to uphold the Throne as a way of giving the appearance of legitimacy to their actions (that is, they were not in revolt against the monarchy per se). The Cabanagem (1835–40), the Sabinada (1837–38) and the Balaiada (1838–41) all followed this course, even though in some instances provinces attempted to secede and become independent republics (though ostensibly only so long as Pedro II was a minor). The exception was the Ragamuffin War, which began as yet another dispute between political factions in the province of Rio Grande do Sul but quickly evolved into a separatist rebellion financed by the Argentine dictator Don Manuel Rosas. But even in this case, the majority of the province's population, including the largest and most prosperous cities, remained loyal to the Empire.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} and compare <b>the</b> shelf life <b>of</b> <b>smoked</b> and salted-dried Oreochromis niloticus over a relative time period. Improved traditional smoking kiln and salting were employed respectively. The smoking kiln was constructed with iron metal with a dimension of 120 cm x 70 cm and consisting of three smoking racks with dimension of 30 x 30 cm each. Table salt was used for preservation <b>of</b> some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specimens. A total of 30 samples weighing 7. 1 kg were used. Fifteen (15) samples each were used respectively for smoking and salting. Satisfactory smoking was achieved in two days while salting to dryness was accomplished in four days. The initial percentage proximate compositions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> products were 7. 94 %, 66. 97 %, 8. ` 84 % and 2. 96 % for moisture, protein, lipid and ash respectively, while that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> salted products were 8. 37 %, 63. 93 %, 12. 91 % and 3. 95 % for moisture, protein, lipid and ash. Preliminary results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proximate compositions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two products at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth week <b>of</b> storage were as follows; 8. 23 %, 65. 70 %, 10. 63 % and 2. 23 % for moisture, protein, lipid and ash respectively <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>smoked</b> products, while 6. 33 %, 64. 25 %, 11. 28 % and 2. 38 % represent <b>the</b> values <b>of</b> moisture, protein, lipid and ash <b>of</b> <b>the</b> salted-dried products.
