40|$|Recent {{speculation}} {{on whether the}} Government may seek to enforce a total ban on smoking in the UK’s bars and restaurants has reignited a long standing debate about the commercial impact of such a decision.

The findings suggest that those restaurants already <b>operating</b> a total <b>ban</b> on smoking may actually be opposed to Government legislation, as this would remove from them a potential source of competitive advantage. Thus, the paper suggests that those restaurants which operate a total smoking ban may enjoy some commercial benefits, especially if the question of partially or totally banning smoking remains a voluntary one...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} cross-layer optimization performance based on real-life experimental measurements, at {{the physical and}} network layers, across coexisting wireless body area networks (BANs). At the network layer, the best possible route is selected according to channel state information from the physical layer. Two types of dynamic routings are applied - shortest path routing (SPR), and novel cooperative multi-path routing (CMR) incorporating 3 -branch selection combining. These routing techniques are used for performing real-time, reliable data transfer across <b>BANs</b> <b>operating</b> near the 2. 4 GHz ISM band. An open-access experimental data set incorporating 'everyday' mixed activities is used for implementing and analyzing the proposed cross-layer optimization. In terms of outage probability, negligible packet error rate is achieved by applying CMR and SPR techniques with reasonably sensitive receivers. Moreover, up to 8 dB performance improvement is gained by applying CMR over SPR, at 10 % outage probability. The amount of end-to-end delay obtained from SPR and CMR schemes are 76 ms and 129 ms, respectively. Also, the combined channel gains across SPR and CMR are lognormal and Weibull distributed, correspondingly. The acquired empirical results comply with the IEEE 802. 15. 6 Standard for packet error rate and latency for both medical and non-medical BAN applications.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{performance}} of two cross-layer optimized dynamic routing techniques for radio interference mitigation across multiple coexisting wireless body area networks (BANs), based on real-life measurements. At the network layer, the best route is selected according to channel state information from the physical layer, associated with low duty cycle TDMA at the MAC layer. The routing techniques (i. e., shortest path routing (SPR), and novel cooperative multi-path routing (CMR) incorporating 3 -branch selection combining) perform real-time and reliable data transfer across <b>BANs</b> <b>operating</b> near the 2. 4 GHz ISM band. An open-access experimental data set of 'everyday' mixed-activities is used for analyzing the proposed cross-layer optimization. We show that CMR gains up to 14 dB improvement with 8. 3 % TDMA duty cycle, and even 10 dB improvement with 0. 2 % TDMA duty cycle over SPR, at 10 % outage probability at a realistic signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Acceptable packet delivery ratios (PDR) and spectral efficiencies are obtained from SPR and CMR with reasonably sensitive receivers {{across a range of}} TDMA low duty cycles, with up to 9 dB improvement of CMR over SPR at 90 % PDR. The distribution fits for received SINR through routing are also derived and validated with theoretical analysis.
