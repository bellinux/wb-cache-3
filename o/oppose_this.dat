5|$|Historian Jean-Claude Willame {{argued that}} the speech {{was the result of}} Lumumba's growing {{frustration}} with the process of independence which he believed might represent a purely nominal change in government with no real effects. Lumumba blamed Kasa-Vubu and his colleagues for failing to publicly <b>oppose</b> <b>this</b> situation. Gender historians have therefore {{argued that the}} speech was the result of Lumumba's growing feeling of emasculation. Others have pointed to the influence of Belgian Socialist delegates and representatives of the Guinean President, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who had a strongly Marxist ideology, all of whom hoped a public and international denouncement of colonialism would help them politically.|$|E

Japan has issued such permits since 1986, Norway and Iceland whale under objection to the moratorium and issue their own quotas.

25|$|The {{debate about}} the {{extension}} of local voting rights to non-EU residents (extracomunitari) resurfaces from time to time. A proposition included in the programme of the Prodi I Cabinet in 1997 had to be withdrawn because of the opposition from the Commission for Constitutional Affairs. Although the parties that support the Berlusconi governments <b>oppose</b> <b>this</b> extension, Gianfranco Fini, leader of the post-fascist National Alliance, supported it e.g. in 2004 and 2008, when {{he was president of}} the Chamber of Deputies.|$|E

25|$|To <b>oppose</b> <b>this,</b> on 27 January some Turkish {{journalists from}} Hurriyet {{landed on the}} islet with a helicopter, lowered the Greek flag and hoisted a Turkish flag, the whole event being {{broadcast}} live on Turkish television. On 28 January, the Greek Navy lowered the Turkish flag and restored the Greek, resulting in an exchange of fierce statements by the Turkish prime minister Tansu Çiller and the new Greek prime minister Kostas Simitis.

25|$|The legal {{situation}} concerning Gibraltar was settled in 1713 by the Treaty of Utrecht, in which Spain ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown stating that, should the British abandon this post, {{it would be}} offered to Spain first.

25|$|However, some {{linguists}} – Meillet, Klimas, Zinkevičius – <b>oppose</b> <b>this</b> view, providing {{arguments against}} a Balto-Slavic group, and explaining those similarities {{by one or}} several periods of close contacts. There exist a number of Baltic words {{that are similar to}} Sanskrit or Latin and which lack counterparts in Slavic languages. Latvian, Lithuanian, Armenian, Albanian, Slavic and Indo-Iranian languages are grouped as satem languages. While the possession of many archaic features is undeniable, the exact manner by which the Baltic languages have developed from the Proto-Indo-European language is not clear.|$|E
25|$|In {{a number}} of Muslim-majority {{countries}} the law requires women to cover either their legs, shoulders and head, or the whole body apart from the face. In strictest forms, the face as well must be covered leaving just a mesh to see through. These hijab rules for dressing cause tensions, concerning particularly Muslims living in Western countries, where restrictions are considered both sexist and oppressive. Some Muslims <b>oppose</b> <b>this</b> charge, and instead declare that the media in these countries presses on women to reveal too much {{in order to be}} deemed attractive, and that this is itself sexist and oppressive.|$|E
25|$|In the 2ndcentury the satirist Lucian of Samosata {{was a sharp}} {{critic of}} Neo-Pythagoreanism.

From this we can infer that Apollonius really had students and that his school survived at least until Lucian’s time. One of Philostratus’ foremost aims was to <b>oppose</b> <b>this</b> view. Although he related various miraculous feats of Apollonius, he emphasized {{at the same time}} that his hero was not a magician, but a serious philosopher and a champion of traditional Greek values.|$|E
