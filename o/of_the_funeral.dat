5|$|Clairmont accused Byron {{of murdering}} Allegra {{and demanded that}} Byron send her a {{portrait}} of Allegra, a lock of the child's hair, and that she be placed in charge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> arrangements. In the end, though, Clairmont {{could not bear to}} see Allegra's coffin or to hold a funeral service for her daughter. She blamed Byron {{for the rest of her}} life for Allegra's death.|$|E
5|$|Gorgias, in Plato's homonymous dialogue, uses Pericles as {{an example}} of {{powerful}} oratory. In Menexenus, however, Socrates (through Plato) casts aspersions on Pericles' rhetorical fame, claiming ironically that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would be superior in rhetoric to someone educated by Antiphon. He also attributes authorship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Funeral</b> Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries' veneration of Pericles.|$|E
40|$|Historical {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine <b>funeral</b> rites from <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Comparative Liturgy. <b>The</b> primitive <b>funeral</b> {{is structured}} on the Studite monastic matins, while <b>the</b> next stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rite {{are reflected in}} <b>the</b> <b>funerals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different categories <b>of</b> dead (lay, clergy, monks, children). <b>The</b> sacramental character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funerals</b> is best expressed in the inclination prayers. The hymnography moves {{in a completely different}} semantical key from the euchological texts...|$|R
50|$|A solemn celebration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funerals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two Dukes, {{called a}} 'Month's Mind', {{was held on}} 22 September 1551 with all <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> {{equipment}} in duplicate. The humanist intellectuals Thomas Wilson and Walter Haddon wrote a life of Suffolk {{and his younger brother}} shortly after their death.|$|R
25|$|Paul's guitar {{style was}} {{strongly}} influenced by <b>the</b> music <b>of</b> Django Reinhardt, whom he greatly admired. Following World War II, Paul sought out and made friends with Reinhardt. When Reinhardt died in 1953, Paul paid for part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral's</b> cost. One <b>of</b> Paul's prized possessions was a Selmer Maccaferri acoustic guitar {{given to him by}} Reinhardt's widow.|$|R
5|$|Lincoln was {{the first}} American {{president}} to be assassinated and his death had a long-lasting emotional impact upon the United States. Over the three weeks after his death, millions of Americans participated in a nationwide public pageant of grief, including a state funeral, and the 1,700-mile (2,700km) westward journey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> train from Washington, through New York, to Springfield, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Rex's mother, Phyllis Van de Kamp (Shirley Knight), {{comes to}} town for Rex's funeral. She and Bree clash heads {{throughout}} her visit, especially when Phyllis claims that Bree made Rex miserable during his last years, prompting Bree to disinvite her from the funeral. Eventually, Bree reconsiders; however, during the service, Bree discovers that Rex is being buried in his high school tie, which Phyllis insisted but Bree expressly forbade. Bree changes Rex's tie in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scouting was so {{important}} to Ford that his family asked that Scouts participate in his funeral. A few selected Scouts served as ushers inside the National Cathedral. About 400 Eagle Scouts were part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> procession, where they formed an honor guard as the casket went by in front of the museum.|$|E
25|$|Funeral rites {{took place}} {{at home and at}} <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> burial, which was located outside the city to avoid <b>the</b> {{pollution}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> living. <b>The</b> <b>funeral</b> procession (pompa funebris) transited the distance between the two.|$|R

5|$|A {{week after}} Reed's return from Baku, {{he began to}} {{experience}} dizziness and headaches, thought at first to be symptoms of influenza. Five days later, when he became delirious, doctors diagnosed typhus and {{sent him to the}} hospital. There, with Bryant by his side, he died on October 17, 1920, a few days shy of his 33rd birthday. On the day of Reed's funeral, in keeping with Russian custom, Bryant walked alone behind the hearse, at the head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> procession. Fainting during the burial, she awoke in her hotel room. Among those at her bedside were Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who had been arrested in the United States and deported to Russia in late 1919.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's body {{reportedly}} sustained two falls. As {{the coffin}} was lifted into {{place for the}} lying in state at the Column Hall of the House of the Unions, Brezhnev's body fell through the bottom. After that, a new, metal-plated coffin was made, and as it was lowered into the grave, the funeral servants could not handle its weight and the coffin fell with a loud crash into the grave hole. This account, however, was contested by Georgy Kovalenko, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> servants—according to him, twenty minutes before the deposition of the coffin he {{was asked by the}} Kremlin custodian Semyon Shornikov to lower the coffin simultaneously with the chime of bells.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's tombstone, {{featuring}} the muse of music, Euterpe, weeping over a broken lyre, {{was designed and}} sculpted by Clésinger. The expenses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> and monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid {{for the return of}} the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw. Ludwika took Chopin's heart in an urn, preserved in alcohol, back to Poland in 1850. She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who seems to have destroyed them.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> {{aftermath}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hillsborough disaster, which claimed <b>the</b> lives <b>of</b> 96 fans at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989, Staunton {{was among}} the players who comforted bereaved families and attended many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funerals.</b> He also put in an outstanding performance when the fateful FA Cup semi-final was rescheduled a month later, with Liverpool beating Nottingham Forest 3–1.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> literal graveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{situation}} (<b>the</b> <b>funeral)</b> subsides to <b>the</b> humor. [...] This {{makes it}} possible for the characters to look at <b>the</b> subject <b>of</b> death objectively, giving rise to such speeches as Hamlet's musings over <b>the</b> skull <b>of</b> Yorick.|$|R
50|$|For TV {{he covered}} the annual Lord Mayor's Banquet, the First and Last Nights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Proms, <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> <b>of</b> Dag Hammarskjöld and US President John F. Kennedy's visit to the Pope in 1963, as well as {{presenting}} Songs of Praise.|$|R
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the novel, the narrator, and by extension McGregor, treats disorganized workers with scorn; from the miners of Coal Creek, to the downtrodden laborers of Chicago who are shown mastered by their bosses (unlike McGregor, who does not follow this trend). It is when McGregor comes back to Coal Creek to bury his mother and sees the usually jumbled miners marching in step as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> procession does he have an epiphany that together the workers are a powerful force, to be organized specifically by him. Indeed, this realization is foreshadowed in Chapter 3 of Book I when as a young man he sees a troupe of marching soldiers disperse a rowdy mob of miner's (and, as a consequence, save his family's bakery) during a strike.|$|E
5|$|Having taken {{office in}} 1805, Shaw {{determined}} to re-establish the tradition whereby the Lord Mayor took precedence in public processions within the City of London over all except the reigning monarch, {{and took the}} opportunity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> of Lord Nelson in 1806 to do so. According to one account, Shaw discussed the matter with the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, who was aware that the Prince Regent would be attending the funeral, but did not seem willing to take action. Shaw then offered to visit the King himself at Windsor Castle to resolve the matter, and Liverpool {{said that he would}} see what could be done. By the following day, the Royal Warrant of Precedence had been granted, and Shaw duly led the procession.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 1978, Kenyatta {{died in the}} State House, Mombasa. As {{a result}} of the UK's longstanding {{experience}} in state funerals, the Kenyan government requested British assistance in organising Kenyatta's. McKenzie was employed as a go-between, and the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> was orchestrated to deliberately imitate that of deceased British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In doing so, senior Kenyans sought to project an image of their country as a modern nation-state rather than one incumbent on tradition. The funeral took place at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, six days after Kenyatta's death. Britain's first heir to the throne, Charles, Prince of Wales, attended the event, a symbol of the value that the British government perceived in its relationship with Kenya.|$|E

5|$|Ramsey {{suffered}} a stroke on 9 June 1998, during the 1998 World Cup. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease and prostate cancer, Ramsey spent three months in a general ward in Ipswich Hospital. He died {{less than a year}} later, in a nursing home, on 28 April 1999, at the age of 79 from a heart attack. He was buried in a private ceremony at Old Ipswich Cemetery on 7 May 1999. The location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> in Ipswich rather than in London was regarded as a snub to the Football Association whose members Ramsey had never forgiven for his sacking from the England's manager post in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Richard Nixon {{was buried}} beside his wife Pat {{on the grounds}} of the Nixon Library. He was survived by his two daughters, Tricia and Julie, and four grandchildren. In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full state funeral, though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> service. Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects. At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an {{estimated}} 42,000 people waiting.|$|E
5|$|Sung jwé, jwé chanté or chanté kont, {{is mostly}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> wake tradition. A jwé chanté leader uses {{pantomime}} to enact scenes from a story, or sometimes just the ribald double entendres from it. The gém (game song) are based around {{a leader who}} uses his own flourishes on a choreographed dance and improvises witty lyrics, while the audience participates in the performance. Jwé dansé includes four traditional dances. The solo is a couple dance, and the débòt, yonbòt and jwé pòté are all circle dances. The blòtjé is a musical movement found in all jwé dansé styles, occurring, for example, every four beats in the débòt dance.|$|E

5|$|The film {{begins with}} Rahul Khanna (Shah Rukh Khan) {{standing}} in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>funeral</b> pyre of his wife Tina (Rani Mukerji). Through a series of flashbacks we are shown Rahul and Tina's marriage, their honeymoon, Tina's pregnancy with their daughter and the child's eventual birth. It is revealed that Tina was aware of complications in her pregnancy, during which only mother or child could be saved, but decided not to tell Rahul as she knew how much he wanted a child. During her pregnancy, Tina, who also loved the baby more than her own life, writes eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother (Farida Jalal). Before dying, Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali.|$|E
5|$|The plutons in {{the park}} are Jurassic and Cretaceous aged and are located toward the park's western margin {{where they can be}} seen from {{unimproved}} roads. One of these relatively small granitic plutons was emplaced 6787 Ma and spawned one of the more profitable precious metal deposits in the Death Valley area, giving rise to the town and mines of Skidoo. In the Death Valley area these solidified blobs of magma are located under much of the Owlshead Mountains and are found in the western end of the Panamint Mountains. Thrusted areas can be seen at Schwaub Peak in the southern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Funeral</b> Mountains.|$|E
