5|$|The history <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> between 1219 and 1295 {{concerns}} {{the establishment and}} early history of the first Lithuanian state, the Grand Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> The beginning of the 13th century {{marks the end of}} the prehistory <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> From this point on the history <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> is recorded in chronicles, treaties, and other written documents. In 1219, 21 Lithuanian dukes signed a peace treaty with Galicia–Volhynia. This event is widely accepted as the first proof that the Baltic tribes were uniting and consolidating. Despite continuous warfare with two Christian orders, the Livonian Order and the Teutonic Knights, the Grand Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> was established and gained some control over the lands of Black Ruthenia, Polatsk, Minsk, and other territories east of modern-day Lithuania that had become weak and vulnerable after the collapse of Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{effects of}} the announcement of Lithuania's re-establishment of independence were limited. Publication of the Act was prohibited by the German authorities, and the text was distributed and printed illegally. The work of the Council was hindered, and Germans remained in control over Lithuania. The situation changed only when Germany lost World War I {{in the fall of}} 1918. In November 1918 the first Cabinet <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> was formed, and the Council <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> gained control over the territory <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> Independent Lithuania, although it would soon be battling the Wars of Independence, became a reality.|$|E

At first, Jogaila—like his father—based his rule in the southern and eastern territories <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania,</b> while his uncle, Kęstutis, the Duke of Trakai, continued to rule the north-western region. Jogaila's succession, however, soon placed this system of dual rule under strain.|$|E

5|$|The Lithuanian Civil War of 1389–92 was {{the second}} civil {{conflict}} between Jogaila, King of Poland and Grand Duke <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania,</b> and his cousin Vytautas. At issue was control of the Grand Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania,</b> then the largest state in Europe. Jogaila had been crowned King of Poland in 1386; he installed his brother Skirgaila as ruler <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania.</b> Skirgaila proved unpopular and Vytautas attempted to depose him. When his first attempt to take {{the capital city of}} Vilnius failed, Vytautas forged an alliance with the Teutonic Knights, their common enemy – just as both cousins had done during the Lithuanian Civil War between 1381 and 1384. Vytautas and the Knights unsuccessfully besieged Vilnius in 1390. Over the next two years it became clear that neither side could achieve a quick victory, and Jogaila proposed a compromise: Vytautas would become Grand Duke and Jogaila would remain Superior Duke. This proposal was formalized in the Ostrów Agreement of 1392, and Vytautas turned against the Knights. He went on to reign as Grand Duke <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> for 38 years, and the cousins remained at peace.|$|E
5|$|The first {{king of the}} new dynasty was Jogaila, the Grand Duke <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania,</b> who {{was known}} as Władysław II Jagiełło in Poland. He was elected king of Poland in 1386 after his {{marriage}} to Jadwiga of Anjou, the Queen of Poland in her own right, and his conversion to Roman Catholicism. The Christianization <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> in the Latin Rite followed. Jogaila's rivalry in Lithuania with his cousin Vytautas the Great, who was opposed to Lithuania's domination by Poland, was settled in 1392 in the Ostrów Agreement and in 1401 in the Union of Vilnius and Radom: Vytautas became the Grand Duke <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> for life under Jogaila's nominal supremacy. The agreement made possible a close cooperation {{between the two nations}} necessary to succeed in struggles with the Teutonic Order. The Union of Horodło of 1413 defined the relationship further and granted privileges to the Roman Catholic (as opposed to Eastern Orthodox) segment of the Lithuanian nobility.|$|E
5|$|The signatories of the Act of Independence <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> {{were the}} twenty Lithuanian men {{who signed the}} Act of Independence <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> on February 16, 1918. The signatories were elected to the Council <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> by the Vilnius Conference in September 1917 and {{entrusted}} with the mission of establishing an independent Lithuanian state. The proclaimed independence was established only in late 1918, after Germany lost World War I and its troops retreated from Lithuanian territory. What followed was a long process of building the state, determining its borders, and gaining international diplomatic recognition. The signatories succeeded in their mission and independent Lithuania survived until the Soviet Union occupied the state on June 15, 1940.|$|E

The region was on the periphery <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> proper and {{had been part of the}} Grand Duchy <b>of</b> <b>Lithuania</b> until the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795). Its upper class, including Mickiewicz's family, were either Polish or Polonized.
