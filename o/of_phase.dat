40|$|This study {{deals with}} model based {{dependability}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>phased</b> mission systems. From {{a comprehensive review}} of the studies in the literature, it appears that several aspects <b>of</b> multi <b>phased</b> systems still pose insurmountable problems for the dependability evaluation methods and tools. To address the weak points of the state-of?the?art we propose a modeling methodology that exploits the power of the class of Markov regenerative stochastic Petri net models. Our approach considerably enlarges the class <b>of</b> <b>phased</b> mission systems that can be analytically studied. It can accommodate in a compact and neat modeling all thosepeculiar aspects <b>of</b> <b>phased</b> mission systems that could not be dealt with up to now. By taking advantage of the special structure <b>of</b> <b>phased</b> mission systems, we develop an analytical solution technique with a low computational complexity, basically dominated by the cost of the separate analysis of the system inside each phase. Last, the existence of analytical solutions allows us to derive the sensitivity functions of the dependability measures, thus providing the dependability engineer with additional means for the study <b>of</b> <b>phased</b> mission system...|$|R

5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> will undergo destructive interference. Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out <b>of</b> <b>phase</b> will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E
