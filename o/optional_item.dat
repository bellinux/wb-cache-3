25|$|Mighty Wings – deep-fried spicy chicken wings. McDonald's {{began selling}} these in 1990 as an <b>optional</b> <b>item</b> and stopped selling them in 2003. They are still sold in China, Spain, Samoa, and the U.S. Virgin Island of St Croix as of March 6, 2010. Also sold as McWings in Pakistan, they were {{discontinued}} {{for a while}} but relaunched. On September 9, 2013, McDonald's brought the Mighty Wings back to its menus {{in all of its}} American restaurants as a limited time offer available until November 2013. The Mighty Wings did not sell well its second time around in the U.S. The main problems cited with the Mighty Wings was the price point versus the amount purchased. Compared with competitors, the pricing was determined to be too high, but McDonald's stated that due to overruns in purchasing, the company could not sell them at lower prices without losing money. On February 24, 2014, McDonald's decided to put them back on the menu for a limited engagement to liquidate the remaining inventory at a lower price in all U.S. locations.|$|E

50|$|In 1977 {{the city}} of Buffalo issued an {{official}} proclamation celebrating Anchor Bar co-owner Frank Bellissimo declared July 29, 1977 to be Chicken Wing Day. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Buffalo wings gained in popularity as a bar food and appetizer across the United States and Canada. Large franchises specializing in Buffalo wings have emerged, notably Buffalo Wild Wings founded in 1982 and Hooter's in 1983. McDonald's began selling Mighty Wings as an <b>optional</b> <b>item</b> in 1990 at their restaurant locations in the United States. In 1994, following four Super Bowl appearances by the Buffalo Bills football team, the Domino's pizza chain added Buffalo wings to their national menu followed by Pizza Hut the next year.|$|E
5000|$|Lor mee (...) is a Chinese-inspired noodle dish {{served in}} a thick starchy gravy and thick flat yellow noodles (also known as lor mee).

5000|$|Swagger sticks {{were once}} in vogue in the United States Marine Corps, {{starting}} as an informal accessory carried by {{officers in the}} late 19th century. In 1915, it gained official approval as recruiters were encouraged to carry them to improve their public image. This tradition grew when Marines deployed for World War I encountered European officers carrying swagger sticks, leading to an entry in the uniform regulations in 1922 authorizing enlisted Marines to carry them as well. The usage died down in the 1930s and 40s, {{with the exception of}} China Marines, and came back into vogue with a 1952 regulation encouraging them, reaching a peak from 1956 to 1960 when on 4 January 1960, the Commandant, General David M. Shoup, commented on their use in regards to Uniforms and Equipment.There is one item of equipment about which I have a definite opinion. It is the swagger stick.

5000|$|In South Africa barefoot {{walking in}} public {{is part of}} the {{predominantly}} white Afrikaans speaking culture, although English speaking people also often walk barefoot in public, especially in the summer months and in cities such as Cape Town. The National Guidelines on School Uniform list shoes as an <b>optional</b> <b>item</b> while the Draft Guidelines state [...] "Pupils, especially in lower grades, should alsobe permitted to attend without shoes in hot weather". Most children attend school barefoot. In many schools, the dress codes either encourage kids to attend school barefoot or prefer kids to attend school barefoot, especially in the summer months. Some South African schools have sport uniforms where bare feet are compulsory, such as primary school rugby. Another sport where bare feet for kids are compulsory is [...] "tou trek" [...] or tug of war. Being barefoot in public is generally tolerated, in contrast to other countries such as the United States. In South African shopping malls, stores and events, it is not an uncommon sight to see barefoot adults, kids and especially teenagers and young adults.|$|E
5000|$|In the British Army, {{the first}} cap {{to be adopted}} of this style was the [...] "Glengarry", which was {{authorised}} for all British infantry regiments in 1868 (although Scottish regiments had been wearing it since 1848). The Glengarry was replaced for officers of most non-Scottish units by a cap called the [...] "Torin" [...] (similar in shape to the USSR's pilotka), which was worn from circa 1884 until 1896, when it too {{was replaced by a}} style for all ranks known as the [...] "Austrian Cap", which had a fold down arrangement, giving the appearance when unfolded of a balaclava, thus warming the ears and back of the neck. The Austrian Cap (officially known as the field cap) was then replaced by an entirely different style of head dress in 1902 and so went into abeyance from general usage, although officers continued to wear them as a private purchase item of undress uniform. An all-khaki version was also selected in 1912 as a practical head dress by the fledgling Royal Flying Corps that {{went on to become the}} Royal Air Force (who continue to use the same type of cap to this day). Additionally, in 1937, a khaki field service cap, described in an amendment to the Dress Regulations for the Army that year as [...] "similar in shape to the Glengarry" [...] was introduced as the Universal Pattern Field Service Cap, and saw extensive service during World War II as a head dress to be worn with Battle Dress when steel helmets were not required. At around the same time coloured versions were introduced for officers of both regular and territorial regiments, although these were an <b>optional</b> <b>item</b> and in the midst of war not every officer chose to purchase one. Nevertheless, some did and they were produced in a wide range of colours for the different infantry, cavalry and yeomanry regiments.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the aforementioned white military 750 cc Tiger Trail, the model came in one colour only, 'Sunburst Yellow', and featured yellow plastic mudguards and side panels. The petrol tank of the smaller two gallon 'USA' type in the same colour, had a stylised 'T' decal affixed on either side, the first use of main styling decals for Triumph. The tank had two Italian Paioli petrol taps for main and reserve. The 'semi-western' handlebars, braced and fitted with Dohertey rubber grips, together with the petrol filler cap, two-into-one exhaust system and silencer were black chromed. The tachometer was omitted, its pod being filled with a warning light panel and ignition switch. Braking was by the standard Automotive Products Lockheed 10.25 inch front brake and a newly introduced 7 inch single-leading-shoe rear drum brake. The turn indicators, not featured in the 1981/1982 brochure photo, were black plastic ULO items from Germany who also supplied the rear stoplamp. Also German were the rear view mirrors by Bumm. Rear suspension were Marzocchi 'Euro 74' units from Italy, at 335mm, 22 mm longer than either the standard Girling units or Marzocchi types later fitted to road models. The front suspension was the same as for road models albeit with gaitors fitted as standard and sharing the satin black finish for the range that season. The front wheel rim was 3.00 x 21 inches and like the rear, a 4.00 x 18 inch item, was a chromed item supplied by the Italian firm, Radaelli, both featuring security bolts and both shod with Avon Mudplugger dual purpose tyres. The headlamp was smaller than on the road models in size, its bucket finished in satin black and sporting a separate chromed mesh stone guard. The seat was a 3/4 length item, unique to the model. A black-painted bash plate was fitted to the underside of the frame stopping just short of the sump plate. The silencer was a cut-and-shut version of the standard roadster 'barrel' type. The centre stand was an <b>optional</b> <b>item</b> with only a sidestand originally supplied. Pillion footrests, too, were omitted, the high level silencer precluding passengers. Later production models cured this by fitting a wire guard to the silencer and a footrest extended out to clear the same. No passenger grabrail was ever fitted. Rider footrests were short, black-painted metal items that, unlike the roadster models, were not rubber mounted but could fold back against a spring.|$|E
30|$|One {{immediate}} {{disadvantage of}} using the model order selection criterion is that since it is aimed at finding the optimal order among <b>optional</b> <b>items.</b> That is to say, {{a great many of}} ARMA models with different orders have to be built first. Obviously, it is time consuming and not good for the online application of the new ARMA-P method. In order to improve the calculation efficiency, the modeling procedure that specifies the search path of the optimal model order is considered in this article.|$|R
