2500|$|Optical Supervisory Channel (OSC). This is {{data channel}} which uses an {{additional}} wavelength usually outside the EDFA amplification band (at 1,510nm, 1,620nm, 1,310nm or another proprietary wavelength). The OSC carries {{information about the}} multi-wavelength optical signal as well as remote conditions at the optical terminal or EDFA site. It is also normally used for remote software upgrades and user (i.e., network <b>operator)</b> <b>Network</b> Management information. It is the multi-wavelength analogue to SONET's DCC (or supervisory channel). ITU standards suggest that the OSC should utilize an OC-3 signal structure, though some vendors have opted to use 100 megabit Ethernet or another signal format. [...] Unlike the 1550nm multi-wavelength signal containing client data, the OSC is always terminated at intermediate amplifier sites, where it receives local information before re-transmission.|$|E

The main result is that <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> and the regulator coincide in thier decisions about how much the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> should build jointly when the <b>network</b> <b>operators</b> decide simultaneously their network qualities.
