30|$|Basic {{cognitive}} radio {{systems can be}} divided into three paradigms [2, 11, 12]: <b>overlay,</b> <b>underlay,</b> and interweave. In the overlay model, secondary users employ the same spectrum concurrently with primary users if the interference to the primary users can be offset via channel coding or network coding. In the underlay model, secondary users are allowed to access the channel only if their transmissions do not cause intolerable (accumulated) interference at the primary receivers. In the interweave model, secondary users can only access the spectrum where the primary users are not active, known as spectrum holes, through periodically monitoring the radio spectrum. Since the overlay model needs the facilitation of sophisticated signal process and coding techniques [11], and the interweave model requires secondary users to have high sensing accuracy, our research focuses on the underlay model, in which concurrent transmissions may occur between the secondary and primary users as long as the interference generated by the secondary users at the primary receivers is below a certain acceptable threshold.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that spectrum congestion is mainly due to the inefficient use of spectrum rather than its unavailability. Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Cognitive Radio (CR) are two terminologies which are used in the context of improved spectrum efficiency and usage. The DSA concept has been around for quite some time while the advent of CR has created a paradigm shift in wireless communications and instigated a change in FCC policy towards spectrum regulations. DSA can be broadly categorized as using a 1) Dynamic Exclusive Use Model, 2) Spectrum Commons or Open sharing model or 3) Hierarchical Access model. The hierarchical access model envisions primary licensed bands, to be opened up for secondary users, while inducing a minimum acceptable interference to primary users. Spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay technologies fall within the hierarchical model, and allow primary and secondary users to coexist while improving spectrum efficiency. Spectrum overlay in conjunction with the present CR model considers only the unused (white) spectral regions while in spectrum underlay the underused (gray) spectral regions are utilized. The underlay approach is similar to ultra wide band (UWB) and spread spectrum (SS) techniques utilize much wider spectrum and operate below the noise floor of primary users. Software defined radio (SDR) is considered a key CR enabling technology. Spectrally modulated, Spectrally encoded (SMSE) multi-carrier signals such as Orthogonal Frequency Domain Multiplexing (OFDM) and Multi-carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MCCDMA) are hailed as candidate CR waveforms. The SMSE structure supports and is well-suited for SDR based CR applications. This work began by developing a general soft decision (SD) CR framework, based on a previously developed SMSE framework that combines benefits of both the overlay and underlay techniques to improve spectrum efficiency and maximizing the channel capacity. The resultant SD-SMSE framework provides a user with considerable flexibility to choose <b>overlay,</b> <b>underlay</b> or hybrid overlay/underlay waveform depending on the scenario, situation or need. Overlay/Underlay SD-SMSE framework flexibility is demonstrated by applying it to a family of SMSE modulated signals such as OFDM, MCCDMA, Carrier Interferometry (CI) MCCDMA and Transform Domain Communication System (TDCS). Based on simulation results, a performance analysis of <b>Overlay,</b> <b>Underlay</b> and hybrid Overlay/Underlay waveforms are presented.

However, the CRNs cannot obtain the maximal throughput, when the existing access strategies, including <b>overlay,</b> <b>underlay,</b> and hybrid access strategies, are applied to multichannel CRNs. In this paper, we present a generalized access strategy in a multichannel CRN smart home environment, in which a secondary user (SU) system selects part of channels for sequential spectrum sensing, and accesses these channels based on the sensing results. Moreover, it accesses the remaining channels directly. We then formulate a two-phase optimization framework, which takes the sensing channel selection, sensing time allocation, and the power allocation into consideration, to maximize the gross average throughput of the multichannel CRN. In the sensing phase, a generalized access strategy algorithm (GAS) is first proposed, where we prove that only part of channels needs to be selected for spectrum sensing to achieve the maximum throughput. An optimal stopping rule is proposed to determine the optimal number of selected sensing channels. In addition, a completed hybrid access strategy algorithm is further investigated where the SU system senses all channels. An approximation algorithm is also presented to achieve suboptimal results with low computational complexity. In the transmission phase, the transmission powers of all channels are optimized via convex algorithms. Numerical experiments show that, compared with the existing schemes, the proposed schemes are able to achieve considerable throughput improvement. Department of Computin...|$|E
30|$|Cognitive radio (CR) [1] {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} as a critical technique to mitigate the spectrum scarcity problem and enhance the overall efficiency of spectrum usage, aiming to accommodate {{for the evolution of}} wireless systems towards 5 G [2]. In a CR network (CRN), unlicensed secondary users (SUs) are allowed to opportunistically access the spectrum allocated to licensed or primary users (PUs) without interfering with the coexisting PUs. That is, the SUs do not violate the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the PUs. Most of the existing research efforts in CRNs mainly focus on the issues of the physical and media access control (MAC) layers for an infrastructure-based single-hop scenario, including spectrum sensing, spectrum access, and sharing techniques [3 – 5]. In addition, SUs can also form a multi-hop decentralized ad hoc network without the support of infrastructure. In a multi-hop cognitive radio ad hoc network (CRANET) [6], SU can access the licensed spectrum by seeking to <b>overlay,</b> <b>underlay,</b> or interweave its signal with the existing PUs’ signals [7]. For the underlay approach, SUs are permitted to concurrently share the licensed spectrum with PUs while guaranteeing the power of interference and noise at the PU not beyond the interference temperature limit. In this context, the interference caused by the SUs should be controlled and mitigated through effective power control strategies. Many studies on power control for CRNs have been reported from different perspectives, such as imperfect channel knowledge [8], arbitrary input distributions [9], and social utility maximization [10].|$|E

40|$|The femto {{access points}} (FAPs) with {{cognitive}} capabilities, {{also known as}} cognitive FAPs, are able to efficiently mitigate interference in two-tier heterogeneous networks. Hence, the concept of cognitive FAPs {{can be seen as}} one of the key enablers for future 5 G networks, where high density of FAPs is foreseen. However, conventional <b>overlay</b> and <b>underlay</b> spectrum sharing strategies enabling the cognitive FAPs to access spectrum of macrocells have several drawbacks. The main disadvantage of the former one is that its efficiency fully depends on the activity of macrocell users and insufficient resources can remain for the users of the FAP.

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid spectrum sharing that allows the FAPs to use both <b>overlay</b> and <b>underlay</b> strategies simultaneously and, thus, increase performance of FAPs' users. The proposed scheme is fully distributed since the FAPs allocate resources autonomously.

30|$|To {{overcome}} spectrum scarcity problem, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{has already}} started work {{on the concept of}} spectrum sharing where SUs can use licensed spectrum if their usage do not harm PUs [1]. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is proposed to solve the spectrum scarcity problem, which enables users to adjust communication parameters, such as operating frequency, transmission power, and modulation scheme, in response to the changes in the radio environment [1 – 3]. DSA enables implementation of cognitive radio (CR) that brings a promise to increase spectrum at a minimum cost by using licensed spectrum whenever spectrum owners do not use it. CR enables SUs to access the unused licensed spectrum using <b>underlay,</b> <b>overlay</b> or spectrum trading approaches [1, 3, 4].

40|$|Abstract. In {{peer-to-peer}} (P 2 P) overlay networks, {{the mechanism}} of a peer randomly joining and leaving a network, causes a topology mismatch between the <b>overlay</b> and the <b>underlying</b> physical topology.

Topology mismatch occurs because overlay networks are not aware of their underlying physical networks.

We also after determining the computational complexity of the model, propose an optimization heuristic algorithm to increase topology awareness of P 2 P overlay networks. Then we present the results of running the algorithm on different kinds of random graphs and show, how we can implement the algorithm over P 2 P networks. ...|$|R

D 2 D communications constitute a promising way to improve spectral, energy and latency performance, exploiting the physical proximity of communicating devices and increasing resource utilization. Furthermore, network infrastructure densification has been considered as one {{of the most}} substantial methods to increase system performance, taking advantage of base station proximity and spatial reuse of system resources. However, could we improve system performance by leveraging both of these two 5 G enabling technologies together in a multi-cell environment? How does spectrum sharing affect performance enhancement? This article investigates the implications of interference, densification and spectrum sharing in D 2 D performance gain. The in-band D 2 D approach, where legacy users coexist with potential D 2 D pairs, is considered in a multi-cell system. <b>Overlay</b> and <b>underlay</b> spectrum sharing approaches are employed in order for the potential D 2 D pairs to access the spectrum.

For example, when the PUs' traffic is low, which means the portion of spectrum occupied by PUs is small or the occupation time is short, the performance of overlay will better than that of underlay, therefore, CWNs should choose the overlay mode. However, on the other hand, when the PUs' traffic is heavy, which means the portion of spectrum occupied by PUs is large or the occupation time is long, SUs should choose the underlay mode because unoccupied spectrum is hard to find. Therefore, DSA protocols need to dynamically change the spectrum sharing mode to obtain the optimal network performance.|$|R
