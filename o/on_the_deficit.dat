Miliband's conference speech was criticised, particularly after he missed sections <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> and immigration, after attempting to deliver the speech without notes. At the conference, Miliband pledged to focus on six national goals for Britain until 2025, including boosting pay, apprenticeships and housing; a mansion tax and levy on tobacco companies to fund £2.5 billion a year 'time to care' fund for the NHS; a commitment to {{raise the minimum wage}} to £8 or more by 2020; and a promise to lower the voting age to 16 ready for elections in 2016.|$|E
25|$|In case {{of balance}} of {{payments}} imbalances, Keynes recommended that both debtors and creditors should change their policies. As outlined by Keynes, countries with payment surpluses should increase their imports from the deficit countries, build factories in debtor nations, or donate to them—and thereby create a foreign trade equilibrium. Thus, Keynes was sensitive to the problem that placing {{too much of the}} burden <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> country would be deflationary.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of limits on fiscal deficits when fiscal policy outcomes depend on automatic stabilizers and when fiscal rules lack perfect credibility. The model developed, which includes interactions between monetary and fiscal policy, provides theoretical support for existing arguments that fiscal rules contracted on a structural deficit will be welfare-enhancing relative to rules written <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>deficit.</b> <b>The</b> latter rules {{would result in a}} procyclical bias in fiscal policy, as well as a contractionary bias in monetary policy. Contrary to existing arguments, the model also suggests that rules written <b>on</b> <b>the</b> structural <b>deficit</b> may ultimately be more credible than those written <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>deficit.</b> <b>The</b> {{reason for this is that}} rules written <b>on</b> <b>the</b> actual fiscal <b>deficit</b> risk running into a credibility trap; higher marginal penalties will be necessary when initial credibility of enforcement is imperfect, but announcing a higher penalty for violating a fiscal rule can actually reduce credibility if the penalty is disproportionately large relative to the violation. ...|$|R

Since violations of the constraints are penalized there is a precautionary motive {{for the government to}} reduce deficits and debt. We find that welfare tends to be higher under the debt-based constraint. Further, the debt constraint is more robust to changes in the interest rate than is <b>the</b> primary <b>deficit</b> constraint. Our results support the shift {{in the design of the}} reformed Stability and Growth Pact from <b>the</b> narrow focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> public <b>deficit</b> to <b>the</b> enhanced emphasis <b>on</b> <b>the</b> public debt...|$|R
