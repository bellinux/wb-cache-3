5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, an {{energetic}} movement arose, centered in Greenwich Village, that sought to overturn bans <b>on</b> <b>free</b> speech.Kersch, Kenneth Ira, Freedom of Speech: Rights and Liberties under the Law, ABC-CLIO, 2003, pp. 109–110. Supported by radicals, feminists, anarchists, and atheists such as Ezra Heywood, Moses Harman, D. M. Bennett, and Emma Goldman, these activists regularly battled anti-obscenity laws and, later, the government's effort to suppress speech critical of involvement in World War I. Prior to 1914, the free speech movement focused on politics, and rarely addressed contraception.|$|E

5|$|EU {{legislation}} {{makes no}} provision for the preservation and protection of breed types, which, {{in the case of}} Limousins, have been maintained and the breed developed through a rigorously enforced breed standard for over a century. An attempt to protect the integrity of the French Limousin Herd Book by opposing the entry of foreign purebreds that may have been subject to less stringent selection criteria is prohibited under EU legislation because it is considered to hinder intra-Community trade. Current EU legislation with its focus <b>on</b> <b>free</b> trade thus has the potential to result in the dilution of purebred breeds and loss of efficiency gains arising from crossbreeding.|$|E
5|$|Following District Judge Earnest Lau's {{ruling in}} the Odex v. Pacific Internet lawsuit, Koshy {{expressed}} {{his belief that}} SingNet might be in breach {{of the spirit of}} the Telecommunications Competition Code, which protects the confidentiality of subscribers' information and prohibits unauthorised release. Another lawyer interviewed by ZDNet, however, did not think that SingNet's actions were improper, and a spokesman for the Infocomm Development Authority announced that SingNet was found to be in compliance with the code. Andy Ho, another The Straits Times editor, expressed concern that private entities might use intellectual property laws invasively, thus precipitating a chilling effect <b>on</b> <b>free</b> speech; he called for privacy laws to be quickly enacted.|$|E
5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe restrictions <b>on</b> <b>free</b> speech, some {{of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views. These restrictions inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered by the fear of defamation suits.|$|E

5|$|In God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy, {{published}} in 1976, David Ray Griffin criticised Augustine's reliance <b>on</b> <b>free</b> will {{and argued that}} it is incompatible with divine omniscience and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contented that, if God is truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what people will do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Yao {{discussed}} the injury with his doctors, and the Rockets {{applied for a}} disabled player exception, {{an exception to the}} NBA Salary Cap which grants the injured player's team money to sign a free agent.

He then steered the club through a programme of pre-season friendly matches, in which Norwich was unbeaten.|$|E
5|$|Smith lost Morrell and Trundle <b>on</b> <b>free</b> transfers, and {{replaced}} them with Chris Armstrong and Chris Llewellyn. The club's financial problems meant that players went unpaid at the start of 2003–04, although they remained in the play-off places in December 2003. However, a hairline fracture to Shaun Pejic left Smith short of defenders and the promotion challenge ebbed away to a mid-table finish. Wrexham retained the FAW Premier Cup though with a 4–1 victory over Rhyl. However, Smith made himself unpopular with supporters after refusing to endorse their campaign to oust controversial chairman Alex Hamilton.|$|E

5|$|The Irenaean theodicy {{was first}} {{identified}} {{as a form of}} theodicy by John Hick in Evil and the God of Love, written in 1966.

The Irenaean theodicy is distinguished by its acceptance that God is responsible for evil, but that he is not at fault.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} 2 Live Crew responded to these efforts by suing the Broward County sheriff in federal {{district}} court. The sheriff had previously told local retailers that selling the album {{could result in}} a prosecution for obscenity violations. While they were granted an injunction because law enforcement actions were an unconstitutional prior restraint <b>on</b> <b>free</b> speech, the court ruled that the album was in fact obscene. However, an appellate court reversed the obscenity ruling, because simply playing the tape was insufficient evidence of the constitutional requirement that it had no artistic value.|$|E

Jérémie Aliadière moved to Middlesbrough in a £2million deal while club captain and record goalscorer Thierry Henry left to join Barcelona for a reported fee of £16million.

Other players, Arturo Lupoli, Ryan Garry and Joe O'Cearuill, left <b>on</b> <b>free</b> transfers.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2011–12 season, Westley signed a three-year {{contract}} extension at Stevenage that kept him contracted to the club until 2014. Westley acquired five players <b>on</b> <b>free</b> transfers, while also releasing five of the existing squad. Stevenage started their first ever League One campaign well, beating the 2010–11 League One play-off semi-finalists, Bournemouth, 3–1 at Dean Court to secure their first victory of the season on 16 August 2011. Stevenage were exceeding expectations in the third tier of English football, sitting just outside the play-off places after securing a notable 5–1 victory against Sheffield Wednesday Broadhall Way in September 2011. The club also inflicted Charlton Athletic's first league defeat of the season after a 1–0 win against the league leaders. The victory against Charlton was to spark a 13-game unbeaten run for Westley's Stevenage, and a 6–1 away victory at Colchester United on Boxing Day 2011 meant the club were sat in sixth place, the final play-off position. After managing Stevenage for three-and-a-half years, Westley left Stevenage in January 2012, joining fellow League One side Preston North End. His final game as manager of Stevenage was a 1–0 away victory at Reading in the FA Cup Third Round.|$|E
