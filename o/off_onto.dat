5|$|Although both Susanna and Beale {{think they}} deserve full custody, {{their desire to}} keep Maisie is {{primarily}} to spite each other, and they are quick to pawn her <b>off</b> <b>onto</b> the other parent when looking after her becomes inconvenient. Maisie's time is split between staying with each of her parents, though her primary caregivers become Lincoln and Margo as Susanna leaves on a tour and Beale disappears on business trips. With his relationship with Margo disintegrating, Beale eventually decides {{to move to the}} UK.|$|E
5|$|BL-80 {{continues}} {{to the east}} past Aria Boulevard, which to the north connects to I-80, and to the south leads to the historic Wendover Air Force Base, where the 509th Composite Group was stationed while it prepared to conduct atomic bomb attacks against Japan during 1944 and 1945. The highway briefly parallels the Shafter Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor, which was formerly part of the Feather River Route of the Western Pacific Railroad. As the highway travels east towards a half trumpet interchange with I-80, the number of lanes drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access eastbound I-80 or turn <b>off</b> <b>onto</b> Frontage Road; however, to access westbound I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit and turn around. Traffic into Wendover can access BL-80 from both directions of I-80, and from Frontage Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} eggs laid depends on species, with batch sizes ranging {{from two to}} several dozen. The total number of eggs {{produced}} in a female's lifetime (fecundity) varies from around one hundred to several thousand. In some species, the flea lives in the nest or burrow and the eggs are deposited on the substrate, but in others, the eggs are laid on the host itself and can easily fall <b>off</b> <b>onto</b> the ground. Because of this, areas where the host rests and sleeps {{become one of the}} primary habitats of eggs and developing larvae. The eggs take around two days to two weeks to hatch. Experiments have shown that fleas lay more eggs on hosts which have limited food intakes, and that eggs and larvae survive better under these conditions, perhaps because the host's immune system is compromised.|$|E

5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} behind the safety {{car with the}} drivers in the positions held before the suspension. The safety car remained out for fourteen laps, during which the standing water was reduced as the cars circulated the track. Schumacher, Liuzzi and Yamamoto left the circuit during this period but were all able to rejoin. Di Grassi made a pit stop for new tyres three times under safety car and Senna made a pit stop {{at the end of}} the first lap. Once the safety car drove into the pit lane, cars were allowed to overtake. Vettel maintained his pole-position lead going into the first turn with Webber close behind. Further back, Schumacher passed Kubica for eighth place. Senna and Trulli spun <b>off</b> <b>onto</b> the run-off area but both drivers were able to continue. Rosberg passed Hamilton by taking the inside line to take fourth place at the third corner. Button tried to overtake Massa heading into turn four but ran wide. He momentarily lost the advantage and fended off Schumacher's attempts to pass him.|$|E

Barrichello and Button made pit {{stops on the}} {{following}} lap, and rejoined ahead of Irvine. Alesi retired from the race with an engine failure and spun <b>off</b> <b>onto</b> the circuit on lap 21. Häkkinen made a pit stop on lap 22. Michael Schumacher took over the lead for one lap before his pit stop on lap 23 giving it to Coulthard. The Scot took his pit stop on lap 24 handing back the lead to teammate Häkkinen. On the same lap, Villeneuve passed Irvine into turn 16 for seventh position. All of the drivers had made pit stops {{by the end of}} lap 25. The race order was Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher, Coulthard, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Button, Irvine, Herbert, Frentzen, Trulli, Diniz, Zonta, Salo, de la Rosa, Heidfeld, Fisichella, Gené, Wurz and Mazzacane. Häkkinen set a new fastest lap of the race on lap 26, a 1:39.189, as he built a gap between himself and Michael Schumacher to 2.9 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a ladder Cage held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped <b>off</b> <b>onto</b> Booker T and Joe. He followed by pinning Booker T to qualify and send Booker T to the penalty box. When Booker T was released from the box, he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by pinning Roode after slamming him back and neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E
