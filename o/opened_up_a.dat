5|$|Evers {{was named}} the White Sox acting manager for the 1924 season, {{succeeding}} Chance, who was ordered home due to poor health. However, Evers suffered from appendicitis during the season, missing time during the year, and the White Sox <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> managerial search when Chance died in September. The White Sox replaced Evers with Collins after the season.|$|E

5|$|With victory, the {{initiative}} firmly {{passed to the}} Red Army.

5|$|As the Dorniers passed Sheerness, the {{anti-aircraft}} defences opened fire {{to protect the}} naval yard at Chatham, Kent. Along the south bank of the Thames Estuary 15 gun positions fired six 4.5in of 3.7in heavy shells. The German bombers <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> little, to spread out. The cloud over the target ruined the German bomb run, and some bombers began the return trip with their loads still on board. While crossing the coast over Deal, Kent, three attacked the Royal Marines barracks there. They continued back across the Channel, having made no contact with enemy fighters.|$|E
5|$|During {{his second}} round match, O'Sullivan <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> four frame {{advantage}} over Murphy {{in the first}} session to lead 6−2. In the second session, O'Sullivan maintained his advantage to lead 10−6 going into the final session. The third session saw no comeback from Murphy and O'Sullivan progressed to the quarter-finals 13−7. The quarter-finals would be the furthest O'Sullivan would progress, as he fell behind Ding Junhui 6–10 after the opening two sessions. Despite scoring the tournament's highest break with a 146 in the final session, he would eventually lose 10–13. Following his loss, O'Sullivan stated {{that he had no}} intention of retiring.|$|E

5|$|During the drawn Third Test, Barnes {{was injured}} and Ian Johnson {{was used as}} a {{makeshift}} opener because Morris was the only specialist opener left in the team after the omission of Brown.

Harvey managed only ten and Brown only eight as Australia defeated Middlesex by ten wickets in their only county match between Tests.|$|E
5|$|During the drawn Third Test, opening batsman Sid Barnes was injured. This <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> vacancy for the Fourth Test.

5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen {{into the face of}} the {{advancing}} cruisers, blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning. The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> withering fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping through the narrow channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E

G/116, aiming for Dog White, <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> 1,000-yard (900m) gap between themselves and A/116 to their right when they landed at Easy Green instead.

On August 29, Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak named Siemian the starting quarterback for the 2016 season. On September 3, 2016, Sanchez was released by the team.|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} {{was one of}} the most-followed races in 2012 and cost approximately $82 million, which made it the most expensive election in Massachusetts history and the second-most expensive in the entire 2012 election cycle, next to that year's presidential election. This was despite the two candidates' having agreed not to allow outside money to influence the race. Opinion polling indicated a close race for much of the campaign, though Warren <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> small but consistent lead in the final few weeks. She went on to defeat Brown by over 236,000 votes, 54% to 46%.|$|E

5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field rotation system was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E

5|$|After Mercyful Fate {{broke up}} in 1985, King Diamond, along with Michael Denner and Timi Hansen, formed the eponymous King Diamond band. Both Denner and Hansen {{stayed with the}} group until 1987's Abigail, after which both left King Diamond. They were {{replaced}} by Mike Moon and Hal Patino, respectively, and King Diamond continued releasing albums even after Mercyful Fate had reformed. After leaving King Diamond, Michael Denner <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> recordshop in Copenhagen, until 1988, when he formed the band Lavina (which would later become Zoser Mez), along with former bandmate Hank Shermann. Hank Shermann had formed the hard rock band Fate in 1985, after having left Mercyful Fate. With Fate, Shermann released two albums: 1985's Fate and 1986's A Matter of Attitude. After leaving the band, Shermann joined-up with Michael Denner to form Lavina.|$|E
5|$|Asma is a {{professional}} Emirati puppeteer, storyteller and creative drama specialist. A graduate of the United Arab Emirates University, Asma earned her BA in English Literature, minoring in drama and theater. Through a Summer Master’s Degree Program in Applied Drama at the City University of New York, Asma distinguished herself as a creative drama specialist, {{with a focus on}} puppetry and early childhood education. This led her to be chosen by the Zayed Higher Organization in 2012 to work with children with special needs. As a result of her training with the ‘Kids on the Block’ program, which uses special puppets crafted with different disabilities, Asma has <b>opened</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> new field of early childhood intervention; one that uses the dynamics of puppetry and creative drama to enhance education for the most impressionable audience in the UAE.|$|E
