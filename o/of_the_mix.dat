40|$|In {{single phase}} flow of a passive tracer through {{heterogeneous}} porous media, a mixing layer develops between the tagged and untagged regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fluid. <b>The</b> <b>mixing</b> region expands {{as the time}} evolves. We have developed a multilength scale theory for <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> region induced by a general random velocity field (multi-fractal field). The theory relates <b>the</b> statistics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> layer to <b>the</b> statistics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> random field and derives an effective equation which governs <b>the</b> statistical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> layer. <b>The</b> theory provides an analytic prediction for <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> layer. <b>The</b> scaling behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> layer in a general random velocity field is determined over all length scales. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-length scale theory shows that the growth rate (i. e. <b>the</b> scaling exponent) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> layer at length scale l depends on <b>the</b> statistical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> random field on all length scales smaller than l.

25|$|Melamine also {{enters the}} {{fabrication}} of melamine poly-sulfonate used as superplasticizer for making high-resistance concrete. Sulfonated melamine formaldehyde (SMF) is a polymer used as cement admixture {{to reduce the}} water content in concrete while increasing the fluidity and the workability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> during its handling and pouring. It results in concrete with a lower porosity and a higher mechanical strength, exhibiting an improved resistance to aggressive environments and a longer lifetime.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for gas blenders to create toxic and dangerous gas mixes for divers. Too {{much or too little}} oxygen in the mix can be fatal for the diver. Oxygen analysers are used to measure the oxygen content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> after blending. Inadequate mixing may cause inaccurate analysis. To ensure that the composition of the gas is known by the end user, the contents are analysed {{in the presence of the}} diver who acknowledges the contents by signing a log.|$|E

25|$|Since their {{introduction}} in the mid-1980s, in-ear monitors {{have grown}} {{to be the most}} popular monitoring choice for large touring acts. The reduction or elimination of loudspeakers other than instrument amplifiers on stage has allowed for cleaner and less problematic mixing situations for both the front of house and monitor engineers.

This mystery has deepened with the results of the Stardust sample return mission, which captured particles from Comet Wild 2. Many of the Stardust particles were found to have formed at temperatures in excess of 1000 K.|$|E
25|$|Filling {{cylinders}} with {{a mixture}} of gases has dangers for both the filler and the diver. During filling there is a risk of fire due to use of oxygen and a risk of explosion due to the use of high-pressure gases. The composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> must be safe for the depth and duration of the planned dive. If the concentration of oxygen is too lean the diver may lose consciousness due to hypoxia and if it is too rich the diver may suffer oxygen toxicity. The concentration of inert gases, such as nitrogen and helium, are planned and checked to avoid nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair {{depicted}} the album as [...] "Chilly keyboard motifs gliding across gut-punching bass lines, strings and synths swooping {{in and out}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix,</b> naggingly familiar guitar licks providing visceral punctuation". NME described the production as [...] "patented tectonic funk beats and mournful atmospherics". PopMatters praised the production, stating that [...] "the hip-hop rhythms are catchy, sometimes in your face, sometimes subtle, but always a fine backdrop for the power of Dre's voice."

500|$|McCartney's bass, {{placed in}} front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mix,</b> is an ingenious {{counterpoint}} that takes him all over the fretboard ... At the chorus, for example, while Lennon and McCartney harmonize in fourths on a melody with a slightly Middle Eastern tinge, McCartney first points up the song's droning character by hammering on a high G (approached with a quick slide from the F natural just below it), playing it steadily on the beat for twenty successive beats. [...] The next time the chorus comes around, though, he plays something entirely different, a slightly syncopated descending three-note pattern that almost seems to evoke the falling rain.|$|E

500|$|On {{the longest}} track on the album, [...] "No Birds", Frith played on two {{prepared}} guitars simultaneously, creating the timbre {{and range of}} an orchestra.

He tuned the strings on both guitars to one note, and because they were stereo guitars with nut pickups, he had six separate sound sources coming from each guitar.

So, he used Waves’ Metaflanger on the {{percussion}} and some of the snares, and spent some time EQ’ing. Swivel explained that there was much parallel processing on the lead vocal. The lead-vocal bus was multed to a second bus, {{and one of them was}} entirely crushed on a 50:1 compression ratio which was totally limited and with a very low threshold. He elaborated, [...] "It creates a very gritty distorted sound in there, really low to taste, and it fills in the lead vocal very nicely. The crushed vocal runs quietly underneath." ...|$|E

Both studies noted that the set of species in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed (Conway Morris, 1986) and its expanded version the Greater Phyllopod Bed (Caron and Jackson, 2008) was different from those found {{in other parts of the}} Burgess Shale; and Conway Morris commented that faunas at most other Burgess Shale sites resembled those of the Raymond Quarry, which is above and therefore more recent than the Greater Phyllopod Bed (abbreviated [...] "GPB").|$|E
