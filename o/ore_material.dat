25|$|Mineral {{processing}} (or mineral dressing) is {{a specialized}} {{area in the}} science of metallurgy that studies the mechanical means of crushing, grinding, and washing that enable the separation (extractive metallurgy) of valuable metals or minerals from their gangue (waste material). Processing of placer <b>ore</b> <b>material</b> consists of gravity-dependent methods of separation, such as sluice boxes. Only minor shaking or washing {{may be necessary to}} disaggregate (unclump) the sands or gravels before processing. Processing of ore from a lode mine, whether it is a surface or subsurface mine, requires that the rock ore be crushed and pulverized before extraction of the valuable minerals begins. After lode ore is crushed, recovery of the valuable minerals is done by one, or a combination of several, mechanical and chemical techniques.|$|E

40|$|In 2011, Graeme Campbell & Associates Pty Ltd (GCA) {{completed}} a geochemical characterisation and assessment {{program for a}} single process tailings solid sample from the Pilbara Iron-Ore Project (PIOP) : for Flinders Mines Limited (FMS). The purpose of the GCA program of work was to predict the potential environmental risks posed by the process waste tailings materials during mining and post-closure. RGS has undertaken an independent third party review of the GCA 2011 report and finds that the static and kinetic geochemical characterisation and assessment of the process waste tailings is generally ‘fit for purpose’. Overall, RGS is satisfied that the sampling, testing and assessment of tailings materials aligns with Australian and internationally recognised practices. It is not clear from the GCA 2011 report whether the composite samples of <b>ore</b> <b>materials</b> used to generate the single tailings solids sample provide a reasonable representation of the tailings solids likely to be generated by the Project.

But these activities must have been of rather short duration, because already in 1916 it was reported that the shaft had filled in again.

50|$|Hydrometallurgy is {{concerned}} with processes involving aqueous solutions to extract metals from ores. The {{first step in the}} hydrometallurgical process is leaching, which involves dissolution of the valuable metals into the aqueous solution and/or a suitable solvent. After the solution is separated from the ore solids, the extract is often subjected to various processes of purification and concentration before the valuable metal is recovered either in its metallic state or as a chemical compound. This may include precipitation, distillation, adsorption, and solvent extraction. The final recovery step may involve precipitation, cementation, or an electrometallurgical process. Sometimes, hydrometallurgical processes may be carried out directly on the <b>ore</b> <b>material</b> without any pretreatment steps. More often, the ore must be pretreated by various mineral processing steps, and sometimes by pyrometallurgical processes.|$|E

The leach pad and the pond are built over a layer of 300 mm thick, clay of low-permeability. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) of 2 mm thickness is laid over the clay layer.

50|$|The most elaborately accurate, but totally destructive, {{precious}} metal assay is fire-assay. (It {{may also be}} called by the critical cupellation step that separates {{precious metal}} from lead.) If performed on bullion (high purity precious metal alloy) to international standards, the method can be accurate on gold metal to 1 part in 10,000. If performed on ore materials using fusion followed by cupellation separation, detection may be in parts per billion. However, accuracy on <b>ore</b> <b>material</b> is typically limited to 3 to 5% of reported value. Although time consuming, the method is the accepted standard applied for valuing gold ore as well as gold and silver bullion at major refineries and gold mining companies.In the case of fire assaying of gold and platinum ores, the lengthy time required to carry out an assay generally is offset by carrying out large numbers of assays simultaneously, and a typical laboratory will be equipped with several fusion and cupellation furnaces, each capable of taking multiple samples, so that several hundred analyses per day can be carried out. The principal advantage of fire assay is that large samples can be used, and these increase the accuracy in analysing low yield ores in the <1g/T range of concentration.|$|E
