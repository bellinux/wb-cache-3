40|$|The {{last decade}} of the 20 th century saw a {{decrease}} in the prevalence of illicit substance use. The results of the IPiN study (ESPAD) and the CBOS Foundation (Youth) revealed lower drug use prevalence rates in 2003 - 2007 and 2008. A substantial improvement in the epidemiological area as well as health and security of both problem and <b>occasional</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> was recorded in the Polish drug policy. However, these positive trends have been challenged in recent years by new developments, of which the most visible one has become the trade in new psychoactive substances (NPS), commonly known in Poland as ‘dopalacze’ (literally translated as afterburners) and ‘legal highs’ or ‘designer drugs’ in Western European literature, though these are not scientific terms.

Performance {{on the critical}} tracking (CTT) and divided attention (DAT) tasks was assessed in 19 male chronic, daily cannabis smokers at baseline and after 8, 14 - 16 and 21 - 23 days of continuously monitored abstinence. Psychomotor performance was compared to a control group of non-intoxicated <b>occasional</b> <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> Critical frequency (λ(c)) of the CTT and tracking error and control losses of the DAT were the primary outcome measures. Results showed that chronic cannabis smokers' performance on the CTT (p< 0. 001) and the DAT (p< 0. 001) was impaired during baseline relative to the comparison group. Psychomotor performance in the chronic cannabis smokers improved over 3 weeks of abstinence, but did not recover to equivalent control group performance.

40|$|We {{report the}} case of an <b>occasional</b> {{intravenous}} <b>drug</b> <b>user</b> who developed two successive hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. The first infection led to seroconversion (anti-HCV antibodies detected) and the detection of HCV RNA in serum. After a spontaneous recovery (normalization of alanine aminotransferase levels and HCV RNA clearance), a second HCV infection was observed, with the recurrence of HCV viremia. Antibody directed against HCV serotype 1 was detected throughout the follow-up monitoring, but two different HCV strains were identified during the two infectious episodes: genotype 1 a for the first and genotype 3 a for the second. This observation shows that primary HCV infection does not confer protective immunity against subsequent infection with viruses of other genotypes. This may hamper the development of a vaccine. Conflicting results were obtained in genotyping and serotyping assays, suggesting that the serotyping method cannot be used to identify the HCV type in patients, such as intravenous <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> who are exposed to successive HCV infections...|$|R

40|$|In general, {{little is}} known about the {{incidence}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) among <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> especially among non-injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users.</b> Therefore, changes in incidence, risk factors, and circulating genotypes over time were determined among <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Amsterdam over an 18 -year period (1985 - 2002). Sera of 1, 268 <b>drug</b> <b>users,</b> both injecting and non-injecting, were screened for anti-HBc. HBV genotypes of the anti-HBc seroconverters were determined. Poisson regression was used to test for temporal trends in incidence and to identify risk factors for seroconversion. Of the 598 participants who were anti-HBc negative at entry, 83 seroconverted for anti-HBc. The incidence of HBV declined from 5. 9 / 100 Person Years up to 1993 to 0 / 100 Person Years in 2002. Of the <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> infected acutely, both injecting and non-injecting, 88 % were infected with the same genotype D, serotype ayw 3 strain. Multivariate analyses revealed current injecting, age, and calendar year of visit as independent risk factors. The decline in the incidence of HBV among <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Amsterdam is probably caused by a decline in injecting behavior. Injecting and non-injecting <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were infected with the same strain, indicating that <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> infect one another, regardless of their risk behavior.

Despite the availability of effective HCV treatment, few <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> have been evaluated or treated for HCV. Racial and ethnic minorities have a higher incidence and {{prevalence of}} HCV and higher HCV-related mortality. Factors contributing to poor engagement in care are incompletely understood. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Fourteen mixed-gender focus groups of either African American or Latino/a <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> (N = 95) discussed barriers to HCV testing and treatment. Themes were identified through content analysis of focus group discussions. 				 				 					 						Results 					Many <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were tested for HCV in settings where they were receiving care. Outside of these settings, most were unaware of voluntary test sites. After testing HCV positive, <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> reported not receiving clear messages regarding {{the meaning of a}} positive HCV test, the impact of HCV infection, or appropriate next steps including HCV clinical evaluations. Many <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> perceived treatment as unimportant because they lacked symptoms, healthcare providers minimized the severity of the diagnosis, or providers did not recommend treatment. Mistrust of the motivations of healthcare providers was cited as a barrier to pursuing treatment. Social networks or social interactions were a source of HCV-related information and were influential in shaping <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> perceptions of treatment and its utility. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					<b>Drug</b> <b>users</b> perceived a paucity of settings for self-initiated HCV testing and poor provider-patient communication at test sites and during medical encounters. Notably, <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> reported having an unclear understanding about the meaning of a positive HCV test, the health implications of HCV infection, the importance of clinical evaluations and monitoring, and of treatment options for HCV. Efforts to improve the delivery of clinical messages about HCV infection for <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> at test settings and clinical encounters are needed...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) {{treatment has}} {{shown to be}} effective, uptake of treatment among active <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> is still low. The <b>Drug</b> <b>Users</b> Treatment for Chronic Hepatitis-C project aims to offer active <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> in Amsterdam HCV testing and treatment using a multidisciplinary approach. METHODS: The study population comprises <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> participating in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies and <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> referred to the <b>Drug</b> <b>Users</b> Treatment for Chronic Hepatitis-C unit. <b>Drug</b> <b>users</b> were offered HCV testing and, if chronically infected, medical and psychiatric screening and HCV treatment. Various specialists collaborated to provide optimal care. We assessed test-uptake and treatment-uptake and outcomes. RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-seven Amsterdam Cohort Studies <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> were offered HCV testing: 449 out of 497 (90 %) accepted. HCV antibodies were found in 267 out of 449 (60 %) : 183 out of 267 (69 %) were HCV-viremic and 49 out of 183 (27 %) were HIV-co-infected. Of the 134 HCV-monoinfected patients, 102 (76 %) initiated additional medical screening and 44 started treatment by 1 July 2009. Sixty-two <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> referred from methadone clinics were also HCV-monoinfected, of whom 14 started treatment by 1 July 2009. In total 58 persons were treated: 16 (27 %) with genotype 1 or 4, 42 (72 %) with genotype 2 or 3. Eighty-four percent used methadone, 97 % used drugs (heroin, cocaine or amphetamine) {{at least once in}} the 6 months before treatment, 19 % were active injectors. Sixty-two percent used alcohol, 41 % had psychiatric disease other than substance abuse. Of the 57 individuals with sufficient follow-up, 37 (65 %) achieved sustained virological response. CONCLUSION: In a multidisciplinary setting, HIV-negative <b>drug</b> <b>users</b> with chronic HCV infection can be treated successfully despite active drug or alcohol use and psychiatric diseases. Therefore, access to HCV therapy using an integrated approach should be increased for this population...|$|R
