5|$|Miking a Leslie is also {{important}} in a recording studio, as the choice and positioning of microphones determines the overall recorded sound. A popular recommendation is two Shure SM57s on the horn and a Sennheiser MD421 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b> Recording Magazine's Dave Martin suggests a similar setup, with various microphone models used as stereo pairs on the horn but using an Electro-Voice RE20 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> instead. Keith Emerson recorded his Leslie using a single mic each on the horn and the drum, but with the covers removed.|$|E
5|$|Shahaf and Doriel built {{models of}} the wall, {{concrete}} drum and IDF post, and tried to reenact the shooting. A mark <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> from the Israeli Bureau of Standards allowed them to determine its size and composition. They concluded that the shots {{may have come from}} a position behind the France2 cameraman, where Palestinian police were alleged to have been standing.|$|E
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed {{on opposite sides of the}} horn and a single microphone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ely was {{enrolled}} at Washington High School in Portland, Oregon. He {{did not play}} in the school band, but had a passion for singing. In 1959, Lynn Easton's mother invited him to play at a Portland hotel gig, with Ely singing and playing guitar with the backup band and Easton <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> kit. The two teenagers grew up together, as their parents were close friends. Easton and Ely performed at yacht club parties, and soon added Mike Mitchell on guitar and Bob Nordby on bass to round out a band. They called themselves The Kingsmen, taking the name from a recently disbanded group. The Kingsmen began their collective career playing at fashion shows, Red Cross events, and supermaket promotions, generally avoiding rock songs on their setlist. Ely played with the Kingsmen as he attended Portland State University.|$|E

25|$|The {{inclined}} planes used a large wheel round {{which the}} rope (later a wire rope) passed {{and there was}} a brake <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> enabling a man to control the speed of the movement; it was worked on the balanced system: four loaded waggons descended and hauled four empties up. The upper part of the inclined plane had three rails and the lower half was single track, with a passing loop at the mid point.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} ways to properly muffle a marching bass drum. If the tuner uses generic weather-stripping type foam, start with medium density. If inexperienced or {{do not know how}} much foam to apply, the person should apply it to the outside of the head after he/she has put the head onto the drum. Once drum is tuned to the right pitch, make a note of how much foam was applied for future head changes. At that time, apply the foam {{to the inside of the}} head before its placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum.</b> This provides a cleaner look to the drumhead and will protect the foam from falling from the player's beating and the environment.|$|E
25|$|Promotion {{of healthy}} sucking reflex: By using a pacifier-activated lullaby device, music {{therapists}} can help promote stronger sucking reflexes, while also reducing pain perception for the infant. The Gato Box {{is a small}} rectangular instrument that stimulates a prenatal heartbeat sound in a soft and rhythmic manner that has also been effective in aiding sucking behaviours. The music therapist uses their fingers to tap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> rather than using a mallet. The rhythm supports movement when feeding and promotes healthy sucking patterns. By improving sucking patterns, babies are able to coordinate the important dual mechanisms of breathing, sucking and swallowing needed to feed, thus promoting growth and weight gain. When this treatment proves effective, infants are able to leave the hospital earlier.|$|E

25|$|Some bands use small notebooks, {{also known}} as a dot book or drill book, which they hang about their necks, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> harness, or around the waist. These contain pages of drill charts, which often either give a picture or list {{coordinates}} that band members use to find 'pages' or 'sets' on the field. Coordinates are normally listed in 8-to-5 steps off the front sideline and front and back hashes, along with the number of 8-5 steps off of the yardline listed on each page. Some bands are even using small plastic pouches that hang about their neck on an adjustable strap, which has a zipper pocket for holding drill, flags to mark sets, and a pencil. There is also a clear plastic window in front to display the current part of drill being worked on at that point in time.|$|E
25|$|Michelangelo left a few drawings, {{including}} an early {{drawing of the}} dome, and some drawings of details. There were also detailed engravings published in 1569 by Stefan du Pérac who claimed {{that they were the}} master's final solution. Michelangelo, like Sangallo before him, also left a large wooden model. Giacomo della Porta subsequently altered this model in several ways, in keeping with changes that he made to the design. Most of these changes were of a cosmetic nature, such as the adding of lion's masks over the swags <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> in honour of Pope Sixtus and adding a circlet of finials around the spire {{at the top of the}} lantern, as proposed by Sangallo. The major change that was made to the model, either by della Porta, or Michelangelo himself before his death, was to raise the outer dome higher above the inner one.|$|E

500|$|Allama, {{also known}} as Allama Prabhu (lit, [...] "Allama the master") was a mendicant saint-poet who took to the path of asceticism after the {{untimely}} {{death of his wife}} Kamalate.

Wandering around grief-stricken by his wife's death, he came across a saint called Animisayya who initiated him into asceticism.|$|E

500|$|This song is {{characterized}} by its music produced from synthetic keyboards, and {{has been criticized for}} its lack of innovation, its musical bridge containing vulgar lyrics (with rap) reminiscent of the Madonna's song [...] "American Life", and choirs of children on guitar riffs which are actually the singer's voice remixed. According to journalist Alice Novak, the song begins with [...] "trippy and mysterious" [...] notes played on keyboards, then continues with [...] "fast and nervous" [...] sounds <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> machine; the tone is [...] "rather dark, hypnotic", with an [...] "swaying and repetitive" [...] end which uses [...] "the machinery of the lyrics of some rap groups".
