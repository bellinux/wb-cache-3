5|$|In 1934, Sanders {{took over}} the lease of the Pure Oil filling station on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> due to its greater {{visibility}} for motorists. He then began to sell fried chicken. To improve his skills, Sanders took an eight-week restaurant-management course at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. By 1936, his business had proved successful {{enough for him to}} be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937, Sanders expanded his restaurant to 140 seats, and in 1940 purchased a motel across the street, the Sanders Court & Café.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{ornamental}} woods {{within the}} grounds, Summercombe Wood and Luscombe Wood. Luscombe Wood covers an area {{south of the}} house, through the centre of which runs a private road known as The Terrace. The wood is made up primarily of deciduous trees, interspaced with laurels. It also includes an 18th-century pine plantation {{to the east of}} the woods. The north-west boundary of the woods is Haldon Lane and the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is Summercombe Wood. Summercombe has largely been replanted {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century, but the original 19th century drive follows a stream through the valley past a pond to a stone bridge to two further areas of nearby woodland. At the west side of Summercombe Wood, there is a 19th-century lodge, Haldon Lodge.|$|E
5|$|D'Erlon's men {{ascended the}} slope and {{advanced}} on the sunken road, Chemin d'Ohain, that ran from behind La Haye Sainte and continued east. It was lined {{on both sides}} by thick hedges, with Bylandt's brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On {{the right of the}} French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the 45e Régiment de Ligne and followed by the 25e Régiment de Ligne, somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the 21e and 45e regiments. Opposing them on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was Pack's 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the Royal Scots, the 42nd Black Watch, the 92nd Gordons and the 44th Foot totaling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.|$|E

5|$|Harland Sanders {{was born}} in 1890 and raised on a farm outside Henryville, Indiana (near Louisville, Kentucky). When Sanders was five years old, his father died, forcing his mother {{to work at a}} canning plant. This left Sanders, as the eldest son, to care for his two younger siblings. After he reached seven years of age, his mother taught him how to cook. After leaving the family home at the age of 13, Sanders passed through several professions, with mixed success. In 1930, he took over a Shell filling station on US Route 25 just outside North Corbin, Kentucky, a small town {{on the edge of the}} Appalachian Mountains. It was here that he first served to {{travelers}} the recipes that he had learned as a child: fried chicken and other dishes such as steaks and country ham. After four years of serving from his own dining room table, Sanders purchased the larger filling station on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and expanded to six tables. By 1936, this had proven successful enough for Sanders to be given the honorary title of Kentucky colonel by Governor Ruby Laffoon. In 1937 he expanded his restaurant to 142 seats, and added a motel he purchased across the street, naming it Sanders Court & Café.|$|E

25|$|All the 14 {{sections}} vary {{significantly from}} one another and were designed {{in such a way}} as to the differentiation of sections not leading to any break in the walkway, which is a continuous walking stretch from the Triumph of Labour Statue to the Kamaraj Statue. One of these galleries is flanked by two semi-circular stainless-steel pergolas resting on wire-cut brick columns. The galleries can accommodate over 1,000 people. The choice of natural stones and pillars used in each section of the promenade was based on the type of the buildings on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> The walkway was designed as low-lying as is necessary to have a clear view of the beach from the road. A total of 428 octagonal poles with seagull-shaped light fittings and additional high-mast lamps have been erected.|$|E
25|$|The 1789 Montgomerie Estate Plan by Ainslie shows a farm by {{this name}} {{existing}} on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{from the existing}} East Lambroughton, reached by a lane branching off the toll road. Its lands encompass all of the field running down to the woods. It appears that this farm was demolished and East Lambroughton was built to replace it, recycling worked stones from the old farm {{can be seen in}} the present building (2010). The 'footprint' and some foundations stones of the old Lambroughtonend Farm can still be seen in the field (2010), next to the site of a small burn, now piped down to the Lochrig Burn. William Roy's map of 1745 - 47 shows a roughly 'L' shaped farm and tree belts at this location.|$|E
25|$|Aitken's 1829 map {{gives the}} name as both South and West Lamberton on {{different}} pages. The farm is not {{marked on the}} Pont's (1604) or Armstrong's (1775) map. The farm does not appear on Ainslie's 1821 map, however it does appears on Thomson's 1828 map, with Townhead of Lambroughton next to it, known as Lambroughtonhead in the Montgomerie Estate plans. Lambroughtonend Farm no longer exists, having been replaced by East lambroughton. A lane which ran down to a ford across the river Annick at Bankend. John Allan and his wife Margaret Hunter lived here in the 19th century. John died, aged 67 in 1885 and was buried in Dreghorn Parish churchyard.

25|$|St Pancras {{occupies}} a site orientated north/south, deeper {{than it is}} wide. The south is bounded by Euston Road, with the frontage provided by the St Pancras Renaissance Hotel. Behind the hotel, the Barlow train shed is elevated 5m (17ft) above street level, with the area below forming the station undercroft. To the west, the original station is bounded by Midland Road with the British Library on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> To the east, it is bounded by Pancras Road and is opposite King's Cross station. The northern half of the station is mainly bounded to the east by Camley Street, with Camley Street Natural Park across the road. To the north-east is King's Cross Central, {{formerly known as the}} Railway Lands, a complex of intersecting railway lines crossed by several roads and the Regent's Canal.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{the railway}} served clay pits {{to the east}} side of the road from Wareham to Corfe Castle, but shortly {{thereafter}} it was extended under the road to serve clay workings on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> There are two tunnels under the road, serving different workings. The northern tunnel carries a plaque on its east face reading BF 1807. The southern tunnel has a plaque on its west face Dated in 1848, but as the tunnel is shown on earlier tithe maps, that is believed to be a rebuilding date. Workshops and a weighbridge were built near New Line Farm to the east of the road and weathering beds were also located here; these were dumps of newly dug clay which had to weather for up to a year to allow the clay to break down to make it workable.|$|E
25|$|When it {{was seen}} that the 4th Wilts on the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> had been delayed by the German defence of Lieu de France Farm at {{the east end of}} Maltot, Churchill and Churchill Crocodile tanks advanced, bombarded and flamed the {{defenders}} and then overran the position. As the advance moved into the woods, small parties of British and German infantry stalked each other through trees, small quarries and trenches. The German defenders were overrun in about two hours; mopping up began but some German troops held out as dark fell. Most of the surviving defenders retired to Château Maltot {{on the far side of}} the road and were by-passed and cut off. As the 4th Wilts moved forward to the Rau de Maltot stream, they were stopped by fire from the château. Bombardment by the Churchills had no effect, except to prompt a German medic to emerge and request a truce, which was offered provided that all German troops in the château surrender. This was refused and at dusk the British attacked again and broke into the ground floor but were not able to get upstairs against showers of hand grenades. Overnight the outbuildings were captured and the château was kept under fire by the tanks.|$|E

25|$|During 1922, {{when he hit}} his highest {{first-class}} {{score of}} 201, Jeacocke {{was involved in a}} controversy over his registration to play for Surrey. He was born outside of the county of Surrey, but qualified to play for the team through having lived there long enough to be eligible. In August, Kent questioned his qualification on the grounds that he technically lived in Kent—his house was within the Kent boundary, although the <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> fell within Surrey. The situation arose through a housing shortage; when Jeacocke married in 1920, there were no suitable houses for him and his wife, so his father lent him a house rent-free. Jeacocke missed the remainder of the season, but Percy Fender, the county captain, defended him in the press and pointed out that {{the letter of the law}} meant that Jeacocke would have to re-qualify, making him ineligible until 1924. Kent were probably driven by Lord Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent. During the same season, Harris had forced Gloucestershire to drop Wally Hammond from their team as he had not properly qualified for the team; he later defended Kent's actions in the press and equated any disagreement with Bolshevism. The Jeacocke episode generated much criticism of Lord Harris in the press, and the qualification rules were changed before the 1923 season so that a player was considered to be qualified for a county for the rest of his career once he had played three seasons with the club—as Jeacocke had.|$|E
