40|$|International audienceFullerenols C 60 (OH) have {{therapeutic}} potential, {{but there}} is debate regarding their toxicity. Here, we tested the hypothesis that C 60 (<b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> possesses a pro-inflammatory effect in vivo. Kinetic and dose-dependent experiments performed with the murine air pouch model of acute inflammation revealed that, unlike TiO 2 used as a positive control in this model, C 60 (<b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> NPs were not pro-inflammatory in CD- 1, C 57 BL/ 6, and BALB/c mice. However, after 3 h of treatment, C 60 (<b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> NPs were found to amplify the effect of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) causing a rapid leukocyte influx in which the major cells observed are neutrophils. The use of an antibody array assay to detect different analytes simultaneously indicates that the amplification effect is, at least partially, explained by an increased local production of several cytokines/chemokines in the exudates, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL- 6. Using an ELISA to quantify the amount of IL- 6 produced into air pouch exudates, we demonstrated that C 60 (<b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> increases the LPS-induced local production of this cytokine. Therefore, although C 60 (<b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> NPs alone do not exert proinflammatory activity under certain conditions, they can act in concert with other agents to cause inflammation, {{a situation that is}} likely to occur in vivo...|$|E

The results showed that the adsorption of Cu(II) had rapidly reached equilibrium and the kinetic process was well described by a pseudo-second-order rate model. Cu(II) adsorption on oMWCNTs was dependent on pH but independent of ionic strength. Compared with the Freundlich model, the Langmuir model was more suitable for analyzing the adsorption isotherms. The thermodynamic parameters calculated from temperature-dependent adsorption isotherms suggested that Cu(II) adsorption on oMWCNTs was spontaneous and endothermic. The effect of C 60 (<b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> on Cu(II) adsorption of oMWCNTs was not significant at low C 60 (<b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> concentration, whereas a negative effect was observed at higher concentration. The adsorption of Cu(II) on oMWCNTs was enhanced with increasing pH values at pH < 5, but decreased at pH ≥ 5. The presence of C 60 (C(COOH) 2) n inhibited the adsorption of Cu(II) onto oMWCNTs at pH 4 - 6.

Th(IV) adsorption on oMWCNTs was dependent on pH but independent on ionic strength. Adsorption isotherms were correlated better with the Langmuir model than with the Freundlich model.

40|$|This {{investigation}} uses {{a recent}} methodology, essentially {{based on our}} evolutionary algorithm (EA) to get new insights about the energetics {{and structure of the}} first solvation shells of lithium ion in polar solvents that form important hydrogen bonds. We employed the EA to search for the low-energy structures of the Li+(H 2 O) n and Li+(CH 3 <b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> clusters (with n ⩽ 20) as modeled by commonly used rigid nonpolarizable force-field potentials. Particular emphasis is given to the characterization of the putative global minima; for Li+(H 2 O) 17, the EA discovered a new global minimum with five water molecules directly coordinating the ion. Smaller-size clusters were, then, re-optimized by employing electronicstructure methods, namely, DFT (with the B 3 LYP functional and both the 6 - 31 +G∗ and 6 - 311 +G∗∗ basis sets) and MP 2 (with the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set). In the case of Li+(H 2 O) n, the ab initio global minimum structures are similar to those obtained with the EA up to n = 10. However, for n = 17, the structure of the global minimum discovered by the EA is different from the lowest-energy cluster obtained after re-optimization at the MP 2 /aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory. Such energy reorder may be attributed to the water–water interaction. As for the Li+(CH 3 <b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> clusters, the re-optimization process leads more often to a reorder in the energy of the minimum structures. Thus, forfluxional clusters like the Li+(CH 3 <b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> ones that show a huge number of stationary configurations within a small energy window, it is mandatory to carefully choose various structures, besides the global minimum, to be re-optimized at the ab initio or DFT levels. Due to the difficulty on choosing adequate departing structures by the usually employed chemical intuition, we noticed that some low-energy minima (including the global one) of even small Li+(CH 3 <b>OH)</b> <b>n</b> clusters were missed in literature.

On increasing the pressure to 5. 93 GPa a new polymorph, salicylaldoxime-II, was obtained in a single-crystal to single-crystal phase transition.

Interesting photocatalytic activity was achieved for the materialfirstly added with lanthanum. The increase in photocatalytic activity isattributed {{mainly to the}} synergy between fullerenol and La. Fullerenolenhances the electron charge transfer; whereas La increases the TiO 2 thermal stability by adjusting the TiO 2 crystallites sizes to low valuesand also by creating some structural defects...|$|E
40|$|Vibrational {{spectra of}} 1 -amino- 2 -propanol (1 AP) {{isolated}} in argon and krypton matrices at 14  K {{and of the}} pure liquid at room temperature were recorded and interpreted {{on the basis of}} ab initio MO calculations undertaken at the HF-SCF and MP 2 levels of theory. For the first time, five different conformational states of monomeric 1 AP could be experimentally observed and their vibrational signatures obtained. The observed conformers were found to correlate well with the most stable forms predicted by the MP 2 calculations, the first and second lowest energy forms corresponding to conformers which exhibit a considerably strong intramolecular <b>OH</b> [...] . <b>N</b> hydrogen bond (gG'g and g'Gg'), while the less abundant forms observed in the matrices (tG't, g'G't and tG'g') are characterized by having a relatively weak intramolecular NH [...] . O bond. These results were reinforced by infrared solution studies of the compound in tetrachloroethylene. The experimental data obtained for the pure liquid, where <b>OH</b> [...] . <b>N</b> intermolecular hydrogen bonding dominates, indicate that the preferred conformation of the monomeric unit within the aggregates is similar to conformer tG't.

40|$|Abstract. More than 100 {{reactions}} between stable {{molecules and}} free radicals {{have been shown}} to remain rapid at low temperatures. In con-trast, reactions between two unstable radicals have received much less attention due to the added complexity of producing and measuring ex-cess radical concentrations. We performed kinetic experiments on the barrierless <b>N</b> + <b>OH</b> and <b>N</b> + CN reactions in a supersonic flow (Laval nozzle) reactor. The results provide insight into the gas-phase forma-tion mechanisms of molecular nitrogen in interstellar clouds (ISCs). ...|$|R
