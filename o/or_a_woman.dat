5|$|According to Dasgupta, {{the term}} yoga {{can be derived}} from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samādhau (to concentrate). Someone who {{practices}} yoga or follows the yoga philosophy {{with a high level of}} commitment is called a yogi (may be applied to a man <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman)</b> or yogini (traditionally denoting a woman).|$|E
5|$|Most gods were {{depicted}} in several ways. Hathor {{could be a}} cow, cobra, lioness, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> with bovine horns or ears. By depicting a given god in different ways, the Egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature. The gods are {{depicted in}} {{a finite number of}} these symbolic forms, so that deities can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies. These forms include men and women (anthropomorphism), animals (zoomorphism), and, more rarely, inanimate objects. Combinations of forms, such as gods with human bodies and animal heads, are common. New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history, with the most surreal forms often found among the demons of the underworld. Some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing, as with Isis and Hathor. Because of the close connection between these goddesses, they could both wear the cow-horn headdress that was originally Hathor's alone.|$|E

25|$|Money {{made the}} concept of gender a broader, more {{inclusive}} concept than one of masculine/feminine. For him, gender included not only one's status as a man <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> but was also {{a matter of personal}} recognition, social assignment, or legal determination; not only on the basis of one's genitalia but also on the basis of somatic and behavioral criteria that go beyond genital differences.|$|E

25|$|To the Egyptians, {{the frog}} {{was a symbol}} of life and fertility, since {{millions}} of them were born after the annual flooding of the Nile, which brought fertility to the otherwise barren lands. Consequently, in Egyptian mythology, there began to be a frog-goddess, who represented fertility, named Heqet. Heqet was usually depicted as a frog, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> with a frog's head, or more rarely as a frog {{on the end of a}} phallus to explicitly indicate her association with fertility. A lesser known Egyptian god, Kek, was also sometimes shown in the form of a frog.|$|E
25|$|The {{spirits of}} the air above are {{believed}} to be the most powerful of the lesser spirits, while there are also spirits associated with clan-spears names such as WiW, a spirit of war, associated with thunder. Nuers believe that when a man <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> dies, the flesh, the life and the soul separate. The flesh is committed to the earth, while the breath or life goes back to God (Kuoth). The soul that signifies the human individuality and personality remains alive as a shadow or a reflection, and departs together with the ox sacrificed, to the place of the ghosts.".|$|E
25|$|Gampopa (12th century), one of {{the main}} early masters of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, {{followed}} the Indian Buddhist tradition, starting with the 3rd-century Hinayana texts of Vasubandhu, that oral and anal sex, whether with a man <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> are violations of the third precept regarding inappropriate sexual behavior. Longchenpa, the 13th-century founder of the Nyingma school, citing the 3rd-century Mahayana texts of the Indian master Asanga, elaborated that inappropriate sexual behavior also include the hands among inappropriate parts of the body for sexual activity. In the same way, Gelug predecessor Je Tsongkhapa also adheres to such rules in his studies.|$|E

25|$|During reincarnation {{consciousness}} {{tries to}} liberate {{itself from the}} burden of collected impressions. Yet, since it tries to achieve this by associating itself with impressions opposite from the previously accumulated ones, it gets further entangled in accumulating fresh impressions. Thus the soul experiences itself in a seemingly endless succession of human lives, as a man <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> as rich or poor, strong or weak, beautiful or ugly, black or white, in various places, religions, castes etc. It is only after numerous apparent births and deaths, that the range of human experience starts to get exhausted. In this way the soul starts dissociating itself from the gross world, enabling its consciousness {{to become aware of}} the subtle sphere.|$|E
25|$|A {{blood sample}} after 12-hour fasting is {{taken by a}} doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to {{determine}} a lipoprotein profile. This measures total cholesterol, LDL (bad) cholesterol, HDL (good) cholesterol, and triglycerides.

Other risk factors for heart disease include Diabetes, Hypertension (or use of anti-hypertensive medications), low HDL, family history of CAD and hypercholesterolemia, and cigarette smoking.|$|E
25|$|Even when {{passports}} {{were not}} usually required, Americans requested U.S. passports. Records of the Department of State show that 130,360 passports were issued between 1810 and 1873, and that 369,844 passports were issued between 1877 and 1909. Some of those passports were family passports or group passports. A passport application could cover, variously, a wife, a child, or children, {{one or more}} servants, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> traveling {{under the protection of}} a man. The passport would be issued to the man. Similarly, a passport application could cover a child traveling with his or her mother. The passport would be issued to the mother.

25|$|For lay Buddhists, marital {{fidelity}} {{is traditionally}} {{considered to be}} part of Right Action, part of the Eightfold Path. Specifically, it is considered part of the avoidance of sexual misconduct (kamesu miccha-cara veramani in Pali), which defines who is an illicit or inappropriate sexual partner for a man <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman,</b> depending on their marital status, age, etc. Different Buddhist-influenced cultures have interpreted the specifics of this prohibition differently with respect to practices like multiple marriage and concubinage; in 2015, for example, a Japanese court ruled that paying for prostitution did not constitute adultery, though traditional rules of sexual misconduct forbid a man from having sex with a woman who might be obliged to him for financial reasons.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught how}} they punished perjurers {{where they could}} not punish the perjurers with the {{punishment}} that the perjurers sought to inflict. If the perjurers testified that a priest was {{a son of a}} divorcee (thus disqualifying the son as a priest) or the son of a woman who had been declined in Levirate marriage (a woman who had received halizah, once again disqualifying the son as a priest), they did not order that each perjurer be stigmatized as born of a divorcee <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> declined in Levirate marriage. Rather, they gave the perjurer 40 lashes. If the perjurers testified that a person was guilty of a charge punishable by banishment, they did not banish the perjurers. Rather, they gave the perjurer 40 lashes.|$|E
25|$|According to sharī'ah law, it {{is legal}} for a Muslim man to marry a Christian or Jewish woman, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> {{of any of the}} divinely-revealed religions. A female does not have to convert from Christianity or Judaism to Islam in order to marry a Muslim male. While sharī'ah law does not allow a Muslim woman to marry outside her religion, a {{significant}} number of non-Muslim men have entered into the Islamic faith in order to satisfy this aspect of the religious law where it is in force. With deepening globalisation, it has become more common for Muslim women to marry non-Muslim men who remain outside Islam. These marriages meet with varying degrees of social approval, depending on the milieu. However, conversions of non-Muslim men to Islam for the purpose of marriage are still numerous, in part because the procedure for converting to Islam is relatively expeditious.|$|E
