40|$|AbstractThere is a {{continuing}} search for bone substitutes to avoid or minimize the need for autogenous bone grafts. Human platelet-rich plasma (hPRP) is used to stimulate bone formation in vivo. Hydroxyapatite, a crystalline phase of calcium phosphate found naturally in bone minerals, has shown tremendous promise as a graft material. Coral is an osteoconductive material used as a bone graft extender. This study examined the effect of human platelet-rich plasma in combination with hydroxyapatite and coral on osteogenesis in vivo using rabbit model bone healing. A critical size defect of 10  mm elongation {{was created in the}} radial diaphysis of 36 rabbit and either supplied with human platelet-rich plasma (12 rabbits), and in combination with hydroxyapatite (12 rabbits), or coral (12 rabbits). Radiographs of each forelimb were taken postoperatively on 1 st day and then at the 2 nd, 4 th, 6 th and 8 th weeks post injury to evaluate bone defect healing. The <b>operated</b> <b>radiuses</b> were removed on the 56 th postoperative day and were grossly and histopathologically evaluated. In addition, biomechanical test was conducted on the operated and normal forearms of another half of the rabbits in each group.

Methods: Thirty patients with unstable fractures of the distal extremity of the radius were evaluated {{after they had}} undergone a surgical procedure consisting of open reduction and internal fixation using a fixed-angle locked volar plate, at the Military Police Central Hospital of Rio de Janeiro between 2008 and 2009. The results were assessed based on range of motion, DASH protocol scores and radiographies with the Lidström classification. Results: The {{mean age of the}} patients in the study was 51 years.

It was found that flexion, pronation, supination and radial deviation correlated with the DASH score. Conclusions: The study showed that subjective functional outcomes using the DASH protocol, obtained from using a locked volar plate to treat fractures of the distal extremity of the radius, are influenced by the range of motion, and especially by the flexion, supination, pronation and radial deviation of the wrist after surgery.

40|$|Purpose: We {{hypothesized}} that radial shortening osteotomy (radial shortening) for skeletally immature patients with Kienböck's disease would induce overgrowth of the radius. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the effect of radial shortening on radial growth in skeletally immature patients with Kienböck's disease and to clarify the relationship between the postoperative growth alterations and the clinical results. Methods: Eight wrists of 8 skeletally immature patients with Kienböck's disease were treated with radial shortening. There were 3 males and 5 females, ranging in age from 11 to 18 (mean, 14) years old. All patients presented with open physis and negative ulnar variance. The length of the radial shortening equaled the amount of negative ulnar variance. Clinical assessment was based on the modified Nakamura scoring system. Radiographic assessment, including Lichtman's stages, ulnar variance, carpal height ratio, radial inclination, and volar tilt, was performed preoperation, immediately after surgery, and at follow-up. A difference in ulnar variance of more than 2 mm between these time points was considered to be overgrowth. Statistical comparisons were performed using paired t-tests. Results: At a mean follow-up period of 69 months, the mean clinical score was 19. 7 of 21 maximum points, with all wrists rated as excellent. Radiographically, no progression of Lichtman stage was found in any patient. At follow-up, the X-ray and MRI findings indicated lunate revascularization in all patients. Four of the 8 were recognized to have had overgrowth in the <b>operated</b> <b>radius.</b> On the other hand, other radiographic parameters showed no significant changes at follow-up. The occurrence of postoperative radial overgrowth did not significantly affect the clinical scores. Conclusions: The current results suggest the probability of occurrence in the overgrowth of the radius in skeletally immature patients with Kienböck's disease treated with radial shortening. The postoperative radial overgrowth after this osteotomy had no effects on clinical and other radiographic outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Intravenous Regional Anesthesia (IVRA) {{has been}} first {{described}} in 1908 by the German surgeon August KG Bier. Although the technique was convenient to perform and effective in giving surgical anesthesia, the recent plexus block techniques have largely replaced the "Bier’s block" instantly because of time limitations and safety considerations of IVRA.

The high reach excavator is a development of the excavator with an especially long boom arm, that is primarily used for demolition.
