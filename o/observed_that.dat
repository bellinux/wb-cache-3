5|$|A radio {{report was}} {{received}} from the Amana at 10:00pm advising it was on course and climbing to 9,000 feet. Nothing more was heard from the aircraft. As it flew east over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous {{people on the ground}} <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> it was flying unusually low, and heard at least one of its engines running roughly and backfiring repeatedly. Amana crashed at about 10:13pm.|$|E
5|$|An off-duty Northwest Airlines {{pilot who}} {{observed}} the crash told newspapers {{that he believed}} that the airliner had been struck by lightning. Some local farmers said that the plane seemed to barrel roll, but also <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> while rainfall was significant, winds were relatively light.|$|E

50|$|Commonsense reasoners try {{to explain}} the reasons {{underlying}} their observations. If I <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> the street is wet, I infer that it rained. If I <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> the sidewalk is not wet, I may decide instead that the street-cleaners have been by.|$|R
5|$|Ancient weather {{forecasting}} methods usually relied on observed patterns of events, also termed pattern recognition. For example, {{it might be}} <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> if the sunset was particularly red, the following day often brought fair weather. This experience accumulated over the generations to produce weather lore. However, {{not all of these}} predictions prove reliable, and many of them have since been found not to stand up to rigorous statistical testing.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the Limousin region was characterised by the mediocrity of its animals. Texier-Olivier Louis, prefect of the Haute-Vienne, <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> Limousin cattle weighed 300 to 350kg and measured 1.5 metres at the withers. The defect was considered to be attributable to poor genetics, nutrition and breeding practices. In competitions, Limousin cattle were among the worst performers. The breed was considered to be a working breed, but poorly shaped and with poor milk.|$|E

50|$|William McDougall {{disagreed}} with Shand's view, <b>observing</b> <b>that</b> Shand himself recognized that sorrow was itself derived from simpler elements. To support this argument, he <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> grief, at a loss, {{is a form}} of sorrow where there is no impulse to repair injury, and that therefore there are identifiable subcomponents of sorrow. He also <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> although {{there is an element of}} emotional pain in sorrow, there is no such element in pity, thus pity is not a compound made from sorrow as a simpler component.|$|R

5|$|Austrian naturalist Franz Xaver von Wulfen {{described}} the false chanterelle in 1781, noting both its resemblance with the true chanterelles and people's propensity to confuse them. The false chanterelle was then {{placed in the}} genus Clitocybe, but it was later <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> its forked gills and dextrinoid spores indicated a relationship to Paxillus. Genetic analysis has confirmed that {{it belongs to the}} order Boletales and is more closely related to boletes.|$|E
5|$|Banksia menziesii {{has several}} horticultural {{features}} including patterned buds and follicles, attractive pinkish new growth, and showy flowerheads.

5|$|By 10 November 2014, total {{comments}} by viewers posted below the video on YouTube numbered in the hundreds. The majority of comments were supportive. Visitors {{to the site}} wrote favourably of Capaldi's actions to record the video for the child. A few <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> Capaldi's version of the Doctor character is sinister and serious, and contrasted this with the actor's depiction of the character as warm and effusive in his recording.|$|E

Looking across the Mississippi River, Hindman <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> the young and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.|$|E
5|$|CNN {{reported}} that after its appearance on YouTube, the video had over 200,000 views {{in its first}} 48 hours of availability. BBC News noted that {{by the next day}}, it had received over 500,000 views, and by 10 November 2014 it had over 750,000. The Washington Post noted that by the next day the view count was above 900,000. Multiple publications <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> Capaldi's message had become a viral video. ITV News called online reaction to the video a global phenomenon.|$|E

30|$|We <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> as {{selling price}} (s) increases, {{the total cost}} decreases. This is because the demand is price and stock {{dependent}} so if the price increases, the demand decreases which results in increase in the total cost and vice versa. We <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> this parameter is highly sensitive.|$|R

5|$|Early COBOL compilers were {{primitive}} and slow. A 1962 US Navy evaluation found compilation speeds of 3–11 statements per minute. By mid-1964, they had increased to 11–1000 statements per minute. It was <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> increasing memory would drastically increase speed and that compilation costs varied wildly: costs per statement were between $0.23 and $18.91.|$|E
5|$|Faith et al. 2013 further {{suggested}} that the bluebuck, being a grazer, probably favoured grassland habitats. This hypothesis is supported by fossil evidencebluebuck fossils appear in significant numbers {{along with those of}} grassland antelopes. Kerley et al. 2009 {{suggested that}} the bluebuck frequented grasslands and shunned wooded areas and thickets. In a 1976 study of fossils in the Southern Cape, Klein <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> the bluebuck's habitat preferences were {{similar to those of the}} Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and the reedbuck (Redunca).|$|E

5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> colour {{is the result of}} objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Newton <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> the {{spectrum}} of colours exiting a prism {{in the position of}} minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E
