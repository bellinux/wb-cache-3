Previous works on globally convergent adaptive observers consider unknown parameters either in state equations or in <b>output</b> <b>equations,</b> {{but not in}} both of them. In this paper, a new adaptive observer is designed for linear time-varying systems with unknown parameters in both state and <b>output</b> <b>equations.</b> Its global convergence for simultaneous estimation of states and parameters is formally established under appropriate assumptions.

A generalized lumped-distributed L/D multiport is described by its associated state, output and non-linear equations in the time domain. Any network can be considered as composed of a set of multiports and independent sources. These equations have been incorporated into a computer-aided procedure for the analysis of L/D networks. The procedure can be used for the simulation of any non-linear microwave circuit and offers the facility of developing a multiport equivalent circuit for any linear or non-linear device or subcircuit.

40|$|International audienceMany active vehicle {{safety systems}} such as {{electronic}} stability control (ESC), rollover prevention, and lane departure avoidance could benefit from knowledge of the vehicle slip angle. However, {{it is a challenge}} to design an observer to estimate slip angle reliably under a wide range of vehicle maneuvers and operating conditions. This is due especially to nonlinear tire characteristics and system models which have nonlinear <b>output</b> <b>equations.</b> Hence this paper develops an extended H_∞ circle criterion observer for state estimation in systems with nonlinear <b>output</b> <b>equations.</b> The observer design approach utilizes a modified Young’s relation to include additional degrees of freedom in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) used for observer gain design. This enhanced LMI is less conservative than others proposed in the literature for Lipschitz nonlinear systems, both with and without nonlinear <b>output</b> <b>equations.</b> The observer is applied to slip angle estimation and utilizes inexpensive sensors available in all modern vehicles. Finally, experimental tests on a Volvo XC 90 sport utility vehicle are used to evaluate the developed approach.

The conventional Kalman filtering algorithm is a state equation with a linear system while the extended Kalman filtering algorithm (EFK) is required for nonlinear models such as battery.

40|$|A linearized discrete-time {{model of}} a thyristor-controlled series-compensated {{transmission}} line is presented, in which a thyristor-controlled reactor (TCR) is used as the compensating device. The discretization is performed at the peaks of the capacitor voltage of the series compensator. Since these peaks are broad, rather than sharp spikes, they are quite good indicators of variations in the fundamental component. During transients this will result in variation from uniform sampling. However, the system degenerates to a uniform sampled system in the steady state, and thus all the standard tools for the stability analysis of a standard discrete-time model can be applied. As {{a part of the}} linearized model, two different <b>output</b> <b>equations</b> are determined. They are the line current, which is in quadrature with capacitor voltage, and the real power flowing through the line. These <b>output</b> <b>equations</b> are then used for control design.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{feasibility}} of designing an accelerometer-based (or gyroscope-free) inertial navigation system that uses only accelerome-ters to compute the linear and angular motions of a rigid body. The accelerometer <b>output</b> <b>equation</b> is derived to relate the linear and an-gular motions of a rigid body relative to a fixed inertial frame. A suf-ficient condition is given {{to determine if a}} configuration of accelerom-eters is feasible. If the condition is satisfied, the angular and linear motions can be computed separately using two decoupled equations of an input-output dynamical system; a state equation for angular velocity and an <b>output</b> <b>equation</b> for linear acceleration. This simple computation scheme is derived from the corresponding dynamical sys-tem equations for a special cube configuration for which the angular acceleration is expressed as a linear combination of the accelerometer outputs. The effects of accelerometer location and orientation errors are analysed. Algorithms that identify and compensate these errors are developed.
