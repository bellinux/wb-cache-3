40|$|Abstract – Stochastic {{activity}} networks (SANs) are {{a powerful}} and flexible extension of Petri nets. Modeling and analysis with Petri nets and their extensions need a software tool to help to construct and analyze the models. The original definition <b>of</b> <b>SANs</b> {{has been used as}} a modeling formalism in several tools. In this paper, we introduce a modeling tool called SharifSAN, which is based on a new definition <b>of</b> <b>SANs.</b> This modeling tool is useful for both the verification and performance evaluation of systems. The functional aspects of a system are verified by model checking branching temporal logic formulas, whereas its performance aspects are evaluated using some analytic and simulative methods. The nondeterministic setting <b>of</b> <b>SANs</b> is used for verification, while their stochastic setting is employed for performance evaluation. In this paper, after a brief introduction to a new definition <b>of</b> <b>SANs,</b> we introduce the SharifSAN tool and its verification and evaluation techniques. We will also present some examples of its application...|$|R
