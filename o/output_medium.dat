40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a concept of}} dual-mode power amplifier (PA) module with in-band reconfigurable gain and output power. In the first mode, a wideband PA delivers a <b>medium</b> <b>output</b> power. This operational mode is particularly appropriate for ultra-wideband or multi-standard radio communication. In the second mode, a high power amplifier is turned on in order to deliver a high power signal within a sub-band for enhanced radar operation. This second mode allows both amplifiers to operate simultaneously {{in order to provide}} continuous service in sidebands. To demonstrate this concept, a network integrating a wideband <b>medium</b> <b>output</b> power PA and a narrowband high power PA is proposed. Both PA are based on low cost SiGe technology and optimized for maximum output power and Power Added Efficiency (PAE) in their operating frequency range.

It offers an especially large gamut designed for use with photographic output in mind. The ProPhoto RGB color space encompasses over 90% of possible surface colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of likely occurring real-world surface colors documented by Pointer in 1980, making ProPhoto even larger than the Wide-gamut RGB color space. The ProPhoto RGB primaries were also chosen {{in order to minimize}} hue rotations associated with non-linear tone scale operations.

50|$|Today, all content, {{no matter}} which <b>output</b> <b>medium</b> is planned, predicted, or not predicted, can be {{produced}} with technologies that allow downstream transformations into any presentation desired, although such best-practice preparation is still far from universal. This usually involves a markup language (such as XML, HTML, or SGML) that tags the content semantically and machine-readably, which allows downstream technologies (such as XSLT, XSL, or CSS) to output them into whatever presentation is desired. This concept {{is known as the}} separation of presentation and content. This paradigm is now the conventional one in most commercial publishing, except to the extent that legacy and backward compatibility issues and budget constraints interfere, {{and to the extent that}} many of the people involved don't understand the topic enough to help build compliance. But the need to manually paginate has diminished as the technology for dynamic display and automatic pagination advances. Also, there is less need to make a hierarchical distinction between pagination in print and pagination in electronic display, because the same underlying content will most likely be used for the latter exclusively if not for both display methods.|$|E
