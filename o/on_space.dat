30|$|These {{concrete}} operators, {{along with}} some integral-type ones, are among those considerably studied, during the last five decades, <b>on</b> <b>spaces</b> of analytic functions on various domains in C or domains in the complex-vector space C^n. Majority of the papers on the operators are devoted to investigating them <b>on</b> <b>spaces</b> of analytic functions on D. Much less papers consider the operators <b>on</b> <b>spaces</b> of analytic functions on other domains, including the upper half-plane. Even for some popular operators, such as the composition ones, {{up to the end}} of the previous century, there are no many papers <b>on</b> popular <b>spaces</b> such as H^p(Π^+) (see, e.g., [17 – 20] and the references therein). Hence, any new result <b>on</b> the <b>spaces</b> and operators <b>on</b> Π^+ is of some interest. Regarding some operators <b>on</b> the mentioned <b>spaces,</b> let us mention that some basic results on the boundedness of composition operators from H^p(Π^+) to the classical Bloch space B(Π^+) can be found in note [21]. For related investigations of composition or weighted composition operators <b>on</b> some other <b>spaces,</b> see [14, 15, 22 – 25]. Let us mention that the behavior of composition operators <b>on</b> <b>spaces</b> of analytic functions in Π^+ is considerably different from the behavior of composition operators <b>on</b> <b>spaces</b> of analytic functions in D. For example, every analytic self-map of D induces a bounded composition operator on the corresponding Hardy space, which is not always the case <b>on</b> the <b>space</b> H^p(Π^+) [17, 18].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is {{understood}} that spaces of modular forms of fixed weight and level {{can be identified}} with spaces of intertwining operators, usually from an irreducible (gC, K) -module (depending on the weight) to a (gC, K) module of automorphic forms. It seems known to experts that multiplying modular forms corresponds to a branching problem involving tensor products of irreducible (gC, K) -modules. In this paper, we explicitly connect the ring structure <b>on</b> <b>spaces</b> of modular forms with branching problems in representation theory of real semisimple Lie groups. Furthermore, we provide a collection of intertwining operators from discrete series representations into tensor products of other discrete series representations. This collection of intertwining operators provides a ring structure <b>on</b> <b>spaces</b> of modular forms associated to discrete series representations. In particular, this specializes to the well-known ring structure <b>on</b> <b>spaces</b> of holomorphic modular forms, and a new ring structure, <b>on</b> <b>spaces</b> of modular forms associated to quaternionic discrete series...|$|R
