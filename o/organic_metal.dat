Apocalypse offers to restore Angel's wings if Angel will serve {{him as one of}} his Four Horsemen. Apocalypse subjects Angel to extensive genetic alterations, giving him blue skin and <b>organic</b> <b>metal</b> wings which can cut through almost anything. The wings can fire the metal feathers as projectiles. Apocalypse gives Worthington the title of Death. He makes Worthington the leader of his Horsemen after Worthington beats the others in a fight, and gives him a drug that remove his reservations to follow Apocalypse's dark plans. Death is unveiled to X-Factor during their second encounter with the Horsemen, and Warren sadistically exploits the weaknesses of his friends to defeat them in combat. During a later attack on Manhattan, Iceman fakes his own death at Warren's hands, hoping that the shock of killing a friend will enable him to break free of the influence of Apocalypse's drug. Although freed, Warren refuses to rejoin X-Factor, feeling that he has changed too much psychologically to be a hero.|$|E
5000|$|Kane {{originally}} {{had a pair}} of cybernetic arms which provided him with superhuman strength. After he was sent to Cable's 40th Century alternate future his bionics were modified so that he gained new cybernetic appendages, which included synthetic-organic liquid metal arms, hands, and shoulders. The left and right sides of his torso have also been replaced by synthetic-organic metal parts, although the middle section is still organic. Ordinarily the metal parts of his body appear as flesh, but he can cause the metal to appear by willing a [...] "synthorg transfer." [...] Kane also has bionic legs and a bionic left eye. Kane's artificial hands are detachable and can be shot from his arms. He can also fire plasma from his metal arms. The arms can also produce large <b>organic</b> <b>metal</b> shields for protection.

He can generate electricity from his metal parts to shock an assailant. The bionic parts are self-repairing.|$|E
5000|$|Shrapnel {{appeared}} in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode [...] "When OMAC Attacks!" [...] voiced by Greg Ellis. This version is General Kafka (inspired by the eponymous future villain in the OMAC comic book series), a Russian war criminal who was turned into an <b>organic</b> <b>metal</b> being through a lab accident. As Shrapnel, he continuously fights OMAC in a destructive battle arranged by Equinox. Though the in the comics Shrapnel was simply deranged and the Kafka, a petty mercenary and dictator obsessed with world domination, this amalgam incarnation of Shrapnel is driven by revenge, as he claims, while fighting OMAC, to hail from a poor Russian village, razed and burnt to the ground during an unspecified conflict (apparently as collateral damage in {{an attempt by the}} GPA to curb a war in Kafka's country), dooming its farmer inhabitants, or better the survived ones, to poverty and famine, ending with the still thriving Kafka to seek retribution in response while others attempted to restore their homes. In this precarious state of mind, Shrapnel is exploited by Equinox, coaxed into trying, while battling OMAC, to set up a meltdown to burn New York City into a nuclear holocaust as a balance for the earlier loss of his people. Shrapnel is defeated when OMAC raised his shield defense so Shrapnel wasted his energy beating on him and tired himself out.|$|E
