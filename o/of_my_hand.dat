2500|$|McDaniel was a semi-regular on {{the radio}} program Amos 'n' Andy, first as Andy's {{demanding}} landlady. In one episode they nearly marry. Andy was out for her money, aided and abetted by the Kingfish, who gives his wife's diamond ring to present to McDaniel as an engagement ring. The scheme blows up in their faces when Sapphire decides to throw a party to celebrate. Andy desperately tries to conceal the ring from Sapphire. In frustration and growing anger, McDaniel says to Andy, [...] "Andy, sweetheart, darlin'. Is you gonna let go <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> or does I have to pop you??!!"

2500|$|Saadia Gaon {{read the}} words of [...] "And your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; then your heart be lifted up, and you forget the Lord your God," [...] to teach that {{if all goes well}} and runs {{smoothly}} for those engaged in the accumulation of money, then they are apt to put their entire trust in money and forget to make mention of their Master and deny their Provider. Reading [...] Hezekiah ben Manoah (the Hizkuni) lamented that the phenomenon of becoming haughty is tragically all too common. Reading [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that pride is the principal cause of forgetting essentials. Due to the abundance of affluence, peace, and tranquility, a person's heart can become haughty and smug, and the evil urge ( [...] , yetzer hara) can find it easy to provoke a person to follow the heart without restraint. When that happens, Heaven's concerns become marginal. In [...] "and you say in your heart: ‘My strength and the power <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> has gotten me this wealth,'" [...] Bahya ben Asher read Moses to warn of the possibility that arrogance can lead one to ascribe affluence to one's own lucky stars. And reading [...] "you shall remember the Lord your God," [...] Bahya ben Asher taught that God alone is the Source of good fortune, because God has given people the strength to perform deeds of valor, and has handed people the power to overcome bad fortune in their stars. Abraham ibn Ezra read Moses to warn the Israelites in [...] that they might forget that they were slaves with downcast hearts, forget the affliction and the hunger that they experienced in the wilderness, and forget that God sustained them nonetheless. But Ibn Ezra {{read the words}} [...] "But you shall remember" [...] in [...] to teach that if the thought [...] "My power and the might <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> has gotten me this wealth" [...] should enter one's mind, then one should remember the One Who gives one power.|$|E
2500|$|Following this success, {{she acted}} in several revivals and classics, and many French writers offered her new plays. In 1887, she {{acted in a}} stage version of the {{controversial}} drama Thérèse Raquin by Emile Zola. Zola had previously been attacked due to the book's confronting content. Asked why she chose this play, she declared to reporters, [...] "My true country is the free air, and my vocation is art without constraints." [...] The play was unsuccessful; it ran for just 38 performances. She then performed another traditional melodrama, Francillon by Alexandre Dumas, fils in 1888. A short drama she wrote herself, L'Aveu, disappointed both critics and the audience and lasted only 12 performances. She had considerably more success with Jeanne d'Arc by the poet Jules Barbier, in which the 45-year-old actress played Joan of Arc, a 19-year-old martyr. Barbier had previously written the librettos {{for some of the}} most famous French operas of the period, including Faust by Charles Gounod and The Tales of Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach. Her next success was another melodrama by Sardou, Cleopatra, which allowed her to wear elaborate costumes and finished with a memorable death scene. For this scene, she kept two live garter snakes, which played the role of the poisonous asp which bites Cleopatra. For realism, she painted the palms of her hands red, though they could hardly be seen from the audience. [...] "I shall see them," [...] she explained. [...] "If I catch sight <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> it will be the hand of Cleopatra." ...|$|E
