5|$|Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire are {{adjoining}} historical {{counties in}} SW Wales.

Further theories {{on the origin of}} the Pembroke variety suggest that they may have originated from central European herding breeds from the area around modern Germany. Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> period when these dogs were imported to Wales, they could have been either the extinct Deutsches Brachen, or the Dachshund breed.|$|E
5|$|Scaly-breasted munia {{clutches}} usually contain 4 to 6 eggs, but {{can contain}} up to 10. Both sexes build the nest and incubate the eggs, which hatch in 10 to 16 days. Juveniles typically fledge in three weeks. Both sexes may reach sexual maturity {{as early as}} 7 months after birth in captivity. In the wild, however, since maturation may be impacted by variable daylight and humidity, both sexes can take between 12 and 18 months to reach sexual maturity depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of year. Scaly-breasted munias have a typical life expectancy of 6 to 8 years.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} high desert region are the Northern Paiute people.

They make sandals, traps, and fishing nets, and weave baskets. Made out of sagebrush, willow, tule plant, Indian hemp, and sumac fibers, the baskets are tight enough to carry water. Archaeological evidence from near Fort Rock has shown that people wove baskets in the area at least 9,000years ago.|$|E

For the battle music, he used Sakuraba's battle compositions as a reference while keeping to his own style. The remixed and additional music for Innocence R was again handled and composed by Nakamura.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two ways}} to get to Lundy, {{depending}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of year. In the summer months (April to October) visitors are carried on the Landmark Trust's own vessel, MS Oldenburg, which sails from both Bideford and Ilfracombe. Sailings are usually three days a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, with additional sailings on Wednesdays during July and August. The voyage takes on average two hours, depending on ports, tides and weather. The Oldenburg was first registered in Bremen, Germany in 1958 and has been sailing to Lundy since her engine was replaced in 1985.|$|E

5|$|Unlike other snakes, Naja nigricollis can {{be either}} nocturnal or diurnal {{depending}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of year, geographic location, and average daytime temperature.

5|$|Camouflage is {{a common}} {{defensive}} mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out {{a position where they}} can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some frogs have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of year and general background colour. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.|$|E
5|$|Dragonlance {{is set on}} {{the world}} of Krynn. The {{majority}} of the novels {{take place in the}} various regions of Ansalon, a small continent, though some have taken place on the continent of Taladas, located northeast of Ansalon. The world's major gods are the High God and his children: good Paladine, neutral Gilean, and evil Takhisis. The gods are opposed by Chaos, who seeks to destroy Krynn. Depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> period, the evil chromatic and the good metallic dragons are rare or plentiful. Humans are Krynn's most common humanoid race, but elves, dwarves, kender, gnomes, and minotaurs occupy the world as well. Clerics derive magical powers from their gods, and wizards derive their power from the three moon gods, Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari. Hickman had previously served as a Mormon missionary in Java for two years, and uses Indonesian in Dragonlance spells. During Krynn's various wars, armies of draconians are used as troops. Draconians are created by corrupting a dragon egg, thereby creating a reptilian humanoid. The eggs of good dragons create evil draconians, and vice versa.|$|E
