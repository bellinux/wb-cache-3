40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{and mixing}} of tracer particles by chaotic advection in two-dimensional oscillating Rayleigh-Benard convection are {{shown to be}} anomalous due {{to the existence of}} two kinds of islands of tori. The dependence of the diffusion constant D on the amplitude B of the roll oscillation is calculated, which leads to the fjj dependence with several fine-grained peaks. It is found that accelerator-mode islands appear around the <b>oscillating</b> <b>roll</b> boundaries in a peak range of B, and the intermittent sticking of tracer particles to these islands leads to an anomalous diffusion with D=oo. The diffusion and the formation of the islands are elucidated in terms of the lobe dynamics. The spectrum ¢(A) and the probability density peA; n) of the coarse-grained expansion rates An of nearby particle orbits with length n in fluid space are also discussed to characterize the mixing. We have ¢(A) =O for OO obeys an anomalous scaling law peA; n) =n'p(n'A) with lJ=(P'- 1) /P'O) for x~ 1. These remarkable features of the mixing are numeri-cally justified for the oscillating Rayleigh-Benard flow...|$|E
40|$|Closed access. The {{majority}} of studies into visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) either use complex motion scenarios or {{are limited to}} single-axis motion. This study compared VIMS during single- and dual-axis motion. Twelve participants were exposed to (i) <b>oscillating</b> <b>roll</b> motion, (ii) linear motion in the fore-and-aft axis, and (iii) spiral motion, i. e. the summed direction of both of these flow vectors. Increased sensory conflict during exposure to spiral motion was hypothesised to increase the level of VIMS compared with exposure to its constituent motion patterns in isolation. Unexpectedly, spiral motion was {{not found to be}} more provocative than either of the two single-axis motion patterns, and this finding appears to be inconsistent with VIMS being determined by simple summation of the provocative stimuli. In the spiral motion condition, an atypical decrease in VIMS was observed during exposure, which was consistently preceded by a reduction in reported vection. It was hypothesised that the abstract nature as well as the unusual motion profile in the spiral motion condition may have rendered the stimulus increasingly ‘improbable’ and ultimately being disregarded, or ‘quarantined’, as an orientation cue by the central nervous system. The results are discussed in the context of methodological consequences for VIMS research and potential limitations of the use of abstract stimuli...|$|E
40|$|We {{report for}} the first time the pattern {{dynamics}} in the vicinity of an inverse homoclinic bifurcation in an extended dissipative system. We observe, in direct numerical simulations of three dimensional Rayleigh-Bénard convection, a spontaneous breaking of a competition of two mutually perpendicular sets of <b>oscillating</b> cross <b>rolls</b> to one of two possible sets of <b>oscillating</b> cross <b>rolls</b> as the Rayleigh number is raised above a critical value. The time period of the cross-roll patterns diverges, and shows scaling behavior near the bifurcation point. This is an example of a transition from nonlocal to local pattern dynamics near an inverse homoclinic bifurcation. We also present a simple four-mode model that captures the pattern dynamics quite well. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

A first frequency f 1, associated to <b>oscillating</b> <b>rolls,</b> appears for a Rayleigh number R ∼ 2 x 104, then for R ∼ 2. 7 × 10 4 a second frequency f 2, much smaller, is observed. Two frequency locking regimes are present, with hysteresis, for the frequency ratios f 1 /f 2 = 6. 5 and f 1 /f 2 = 7. The onset of turbulence germinates from the last frequency locking state for R ∼ 3. 4 × 104. This transition to turbulence is triggered by the generation of the frequencies f 2 / 2, f 2 / 4, [...] . and in real time is defined by a phase-chaotic behaviour rather than by an amplitude behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Thermogravitational {{flows of}} liquid metals are {{widespread}} {{in technology and}} related engineering applications. We investigate the typical properties of these flows and associated hierarchy of bifurcations in geometries with converging or diverging walls by solving the Navier Stokes and energy equations in their time‐dependent and non‐linear formulation. It is shown that an increased variety of oscillatory patterns and waveforms (with respect to classical purely rectangular cavities) is {{made possible by the}} new degree of freedom represented by the opposite inclination of the walls with respect to the horizontal direction. Even limited variations in the geometry and/or initial conditions can cause significant changes. An increase (a decrease) in the geometrical expansion (or compression) ratio  from the condition   1 determines a reduction of the number of rolls, whereas an increase in the Rayleigh number is generally responsible for an increase in the wavenumber m, the angular frequency and the complexity of the frequency spectrum (with the possible coexistence in some circumstances of disturbances operating at different time and spatial scales). The most interesting information provided by our numerical results, however, is the evidence they give about the existence of “multiple states”, which can replace each other in given sub‐regions of the space of parameters. Observed regimes include: quasi‐stationary convection, weakly <b>oscillating</b> <b>rolls,</b> coalescing rolls, traveling waves, and modulated (pulso‐traveling) disturbances...|$|R
40|$|A {{scale model}} of the Northrop F- 5 A was tested in NASA Ames Research Center Eleven-Foot Transonic Tunnel to {{simulate}} the wing rock oscillations in a transonic maneuver. For this purpose, a flexible model support device was designed and fabricated, which allowed the model to <b>oscillate</b> in <b>roll</b> at the scaled wing rock frequency. Two tunnel entries were performed to acquire the pressure (steady state and fluctuating) and response data when the model was held fixed {{and when it was}} excited by flow to <b>oscillate</b> in <b>roll.</b> Based on these data, a limit cycle mechanism was identified, which supplied energy to the aircraft model and caused the Dutch roll type oscillations, commonly called wing rock. The major origin of the fluctuating pressures that contributed to the limit cycle was traced to the wing surface leading edge stall and the subsequent lift recovery. For typical wing rock oscillations, the energy balance between the pressure work input and the energy consumed by the model's aerodynamic and mechanical damping was formulated and numerical data presented...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{convective}} {{flows of}} liquid metals in open or closed ducts and containers play a relevant {{role in a}} variety of applications in mechanical, materials and nuclear engineering. This analysis follows and integrates the line of inquiry started in past authors’ work about the typical properties of these flows and associated hierarchy of bifurcations in rectangular geometries. The Navier Stokes and energy equations are solved in their time-dependent and non-linear formulation to investigate the onset and evolution of oscillatory disturbances and other effects breaking the initially unicellular structure of the flow. It is shown that a kaleidoscope of oscillatory patterns is made possible by the new degree of freedom represented by the opposite inclination of the walls with respect to the horizontal direction. Even minute variations in the geometry and/or initial conditions can cause significant changes. Multiple states exist which can replace each other in given sub-regions of the space of parameters. Observed regimes include: stationary convection, weakly <b>oscillating</b> <b>rolls,</b> coalescing rolls, traveling waves, and modulated (pulso-traveling) disturbances. Most interestingly, traveling waves can propagate either in the downstream or the upstream direction according to whether the walls are converging or diverging...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{convection}} {{experiments in}} a liquid gallium layer {{were carried out}} with various intensities of uniform horizontal magnetic fields. The gallium layer was in a rectangular vessel with a 4 : 1 : 1 length ratio (1 is the height), where the magnetic field is applied in the direction normal to the longest vertical wall. An ultrasonic velocity profiling method was used to visualize the spatiotemporal variations in the flow pattern, and the temperature fluctuations in the gallium layer were also monitored. The observed flow pattern without a magnetic field shows <b>oscillating</b> <b>rolls</b> with axes normal to the longest vertical wall of the vessel. The oscillatory motion of the flow pattern was suppressed when increasing the applied magnetic field. The flow behavior was characterized by the fluctuation amplitude of the oscillation and the frequency {{in the range of}} Rayleigh numbers from 9. 3 x 10 ^[3] to 3. 5 x 10 ^[5] and Chandrasekhar numbers 0 - 1900. The effect of the horizontal magnetic field on the flow pattern may be summarized into three regimes with increases in the magnetic intensity: (1) no effect of the magnetic field, (2) a decrease in the oscillation of the roll structure, and (3) a steady two-dimensional roll structure with no oscillation. These regimes may be explained {{as a result of an}} increase in the dominance of Lorentz forces over inertial forces. The power spectrum from the temperature time series showed the presence of a convective-inertial subrange above Rayleigh numbers of 7 x 10 ^[4], which suggests that turbulence has developed, and such a subrange was commonly observed above this Rayleigh number even with applied magnetic fields when the <b>rolls</b> <b>oscillate...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{leaves of}} quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) have a {{flattened}} petiole {{that allows them}} to quake (<b>oscillate</b> and <b>roll)</b> under low wind velocities. It was hypothesized that this adaptation might enable the plant to respond to windy conditions that would increase transpirational losses. No effects of wind with or without leaf quaking on stomatal resistance were observed under controlled conditions in the field. If wind and leaf quaking affect stomatal resistance, such effects must be small in comparison to those caused by other factors such as leaf water potential and ambient humidity...|$|R

50|$|A Congreve clock (also {{known as}} Congreve's Rolling Ball Clock or <b>Oscillating</b> Path <b>Rolling</b> Ball Clock) {{is a type}} of clock that uses a ball rolling along a zig-zag track rather than a {{pendulum}} to regulate the time. It was invented by Sir William Congreve in 1808. The ball takes between 15 seconds and one minute to run down the zig-zag track, where it trips the escapement which in turn reverses the tilt of the tray {{and at the same time}} causes the hands of the clock to move forward. Thus the angle of the plate reverses and the clock hands move forward between one and four times every minute. On versions of the clock with a dial to indicate seconds, the second hand jumps forward either 15 or 30 seconds on each oscillation depending on the length of the track.|$|R

The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-14, began to <b>oscillate</b> about the <b>roll</b> axis after crossing the runway threshold during a landing approach, then rolled rapidly {{to the right}} and struck the runway with the right wing low. This flight's crash has been attributed to wake turbulence behind a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 that made a touch-and-go landing ahead of it. The plane's occupants consisted of three pilots and an FAA inspector, all of whom were killed in the crash and subsequent fire.

40|$|Unsteady, transonic, vortex {{dominated}} flow over a 65 deg. sharp-edged, cropped-delta wing of zero thickness undergoing forced rolling oscillations is investigated computationally. The wing {{angle of}} attack is 20 deg. and the free stream Mach number and Reynolds number are 0. 85 and 3. 23 x 10 (exp 6), respectively. The initial condition of the flow {{is characterized by a}} transverse terminating shock which induces vortex breakdown of the leading edge vortex cores. The computational investigation uses the time accurate solution of the laminar, unsteady, compressible, full Navier-Stokes equations with the implicit, upwind, Roe flux difference splitting, finite-volume scheme. While the maximum roll amplitude is kept constant at 4. 0 deg., both Reynolds number and roll frequency are varied covering three cases of forced sinusoidal rolling. First, the Reynolds number is held at 3. 23 x 10 (exp 6) and the wing is forced to <b>oscillate</b> in <b>roll</b> around the axis of geometric symmetry at a reduced frequency of 2 (pi). Second, the Reynolds number is reduced to 0. 5 x 10 (exp 6) to observe the effects of added viscosity on the vortex breakdown. Third, with the Reynolds number held at 0. 5 x 10 (exp 6), the roll frequency is reduced to 1 (pi) to complete the study...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} dynamic rolling {{oscillations}} of delta-wing/twin-tail configuration on twin-tail buffet response is investigated. The computational model {{consists of a}} sharp-edged delta wing of aspect ratio one and swept-back flexible twin tail with taper ratio of 0. 23. The configuration model is statically pitched at 30 deg. angle of attack and then forced to <b>oscillate</b> in <b>roll</b> around the symmetry axis at a constant amplitude of 4 deg. and reduced frequency of pi and 2 (pi). The freestream Mach number and Reynolds number are 0. 3 and 1. 25 million, respectively. This multidisciplinary problem is solved using three sets of equations on a dynamic multi-block grid structure. The first set is the unsteady, full Navier-Stokes equations, the second set is the aeroelastic equations for coupled bending and torsion vibrations of the tails, and the third set is the grid-displacement equations. The configuration is investigated for inboard position of the twin tails which corresponds to a separation distance between the twin tails of 33 % wing span. The computed results are compared {{with the results of}} stationary configuration, which previously have been validated using experimental data. The results conclusively showed that the rolling oscillations of the configuration have led to higher loads, higher deflections, and higher excitation peaks than those of the stationary configuration. Moreover, increasing the reduced frequency has led to higher loads and excitation peaks and lower bending and torsion deflections and acceleration...|$|R
40|$|When a {{stationary}} human observer watches a moving visual stimulus, {{he or she}} may experience postural disturbance and illusion of self-motion (vection). While studies of postural disturbance of viewers watching scene oscillations of different frequencies in roll direction has led to important discoveries on the possible cause of motion sickness (Duh et al., 2004), similar studies with scene oscillations in fore-and-aft direction are not found. This thesis examines the frequency response of postural disturbance and vection when viewing visual stimulus <b>oscillating</b> in <b>roll</b> direction and in fore-and-aft direction. The range of frequency investigated is from 0. 05 to 0. 8 Hz. Participants watching oscillating stimuli in both direction exhibited significantly higher postural disturbance and vection than watching stationary stimuli. Both the postural disturbance and vection reduce significantly with increasing scene oscillating frequency. Data obtained have been integrated with Duh et al. (2004) ’s result to provide new insight in the possible cause of motion sickness. So far, both the author and Duh had manipulated the scene oscillation by varying oscillation amplitudes at a constant peak velocity of 70 °/sec. A second study has been conducted to examine the effect of peak roll oscillation velocity on postural disturbance and vection. Frequency of visual stimulus oscillation was held constant at 0. 05 Hz. Among the four peak velocities being tested (35, 70, 100 and 140 °/sec), it was found that postural disturbance and vection at 35 °/sec condition are significantly lower than other velocity conditions. Implications of the second study on Duh et al. (2004) ’s work are discussed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{transition}} to unsteadiness and {{the dynamics of}} weakly turbulent natural convection, coupled to wall or gas radiation in a differentially heated cubical cavity with adiabatic lateral walls, are studied numerically. The working fluid is air with small contents of water vapor and carbon dioxide whose infrared spectral radiative properties are modelled by the absorption distribution function model. A pseudo spectral Chebyshev collocation method is used to solve the flow field equations and is coupled to a direct ray tracing method for radiation transport. Flow structures are identified by means of either the proper orthogonal decomposition or the dynamic mode decomposition methods. We first retrieve the classical mechanism of {{transition to}} unsteadiness without radiation, characterized by counter-rotating streamwise-oriented vortices generated at the exit of the vertical boundary layers. Wall radiation through a transparent medium leads to a homogenization of lateral wall temperatures and the resulting transition mechanism {{is similar to that}} obtained with perfectly conducting lateral walls. The transition is due to an unstable stratification upstream the vertical boundary layers and is characterized by periodically <b>oscillating</b> transverse <b>rolls</b> of axis perpendicular to the main flow. When molecular gas radiation is accounted for, no periodic solution is found and the transition to unsteadiness displays complex structures with chimneys-like rolls whose axes are again parallel to the main flow. The origin of this instability is probably due to centrifugal forces, as suggested previously for the case without radiation. Above the transition to unsteadiness, at Ra = 3 × 108, it is shown that both wall and gas radiation significantly intensify turbulent fluctuations, decrease the thermal stratification in the core of the cavity, and increase the global circulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is sea keeping and {{stability}} of a fishing vessel in regular waves, with focus on parametric roll resonance. Parametric roll resonance is resonance in roll due to time variation of a parameter, {{in this case the}} metacentric height or the restoring term. This variation is caused by the ship moving in waves, and is hence a function of heave, roll, pitch roll and time. We have made a mathematical model based on strip theory that can calculate the linear ship motions. The restoring term in roll has been modified to be non-linear and to vary with time, and we have added a viscous damping term in roll due to bilge keels. We look at any wave heading, and the equations of motions are coupled in terms of heave-pitch and sway-roll-yaw. The two dimensional added mass and damping coefficients are calculated beforehand by a separate program and used as input to this model. The linear ship motions are presented in the frequency domain in terms of transfer functions and the simulations of parametric roll resonance are presented by polar diagrams as function of forward speed and wave heading in terms of safe and unsafe domains with respect to resonance. We may get resonance both in head and bow sea as well as following and quartering sea. For head and bow sea, the dangerous forward speeds and headings are the ones giving a ratio of the period of encounter and the natural period in roll in the vicinity of T e /T n ≈ 0. 5. For the following and quartering sea case this ratio is in the vicinity of T e /T n ≈ 1 for the sea states analyzed here. The speed range giving resonance decreases for head or bow sea when the wave period is increasing and increases for following and quartering sea. The roll amplitude is small close to the lower speed limits of the speed range for head sea, but increases rapidly when T e /T n approaches 0. 51 - 0. 52, and a general trend seems to be that the roll amplitude increases with increasing forward speed. During parametric resonance, the vessel will <b>oscillate</b> in <b>roll</b> with its natural frequency, even though the wave excitation moment in <b>roll</b> <b>oscillates</b> with the frequency of encounter. The vessel analyzed here, a 90 ft purse seiner, has natural periods in coupled heave-pitch that are close to or equal to half the natural period coupled sway-roll-yaw. The vessel will then have its maximum vertical motions and hence maximum change of metacentric height when there is danger of parametric resonance. This makes this kind of vessel particularly vulnerable to parametric resonance in roll. It is not sufficient that the vessel complies the intact stability rules in order to avoid parametric resonance. If parametric resonance has occurred, an effective way to escape it is to slow down and increase the heading relative to the waves.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that {{attitude}} error of vehicles has an intense trend of divergence when vehicles undergo worsening coning environment, in this paper, the model of dynamic coning environment is derived firstly. Then, through investigation of the effect on Euler attitude algorithm for the equivalency of traditional attitude algorithm, it is found that attitude error is actually the roll angle error including drifting error and oscillating error, which is induced directly by dynamic coning environment and further affects the pitch angle and yaw angle through transferring. Based on definition of the cone frame and cone attitude, a cone algorithm is proposed by rotation relationship to calculate cone attitude, and the relationship between cone attitude and Euler attitude of spinning vehicle is established. Through numerical simulations with different conditions of dynamic coning environment, it is shown that the induced error of Euler attitude fluctuates by the variation of precession and nutation, especially by that of nutation, and the <b>oscillating</b> frequency of <b>roll</b> angle error is twice that of pitch angle error and yaw angle error. In addition, the rotation angle is more competent to describe the spinning process of vehicles under coning environment than Euler angle gamma, and the real pitch angle and yaw angle are calculated finally...|$|R
