40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{construct}} a robust <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>performance</b> (MEP) index of the State economies of an emerging market economy, i. e. India. Design/methodology/approach – Two variants of data envelopment analysis (DEA) models – radial and non-radial – are proposed to construct the <b>macroeconomic</b> policy <b>performance</b> of 22 Indian State economies in the post-economic reforms era covering the period: 1994 - 1995 to 2001 - 2002, using three macroeconomic indicators: growth in gross state domestic product, price stability, and fiscal deficit. Findings – The authors' three broad empirical findings are: first, the radial and non-radial DEA models yield significantly different rankings of State economies in terms of their MEP index scores; second, as against the use of only growth in gross state domestic product and price stability for MEP measure, the inclusion of fiscal deficit as an additional indicator yields a noticeable improvement not only in the State MEP index scores, but also in their rankings, thus providing the evidence of relatively successful attempt by the Indian States in reducing fiscal deficit, in general, and legislating FRBM bill, in particular; and third, a positive significant correlation between foreign direct investment (FDI) and MEP indicates that a State's <b>overall</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> policy <b>performance</b> does matter to attract FDI. Research limitations/implications – Since the DEA models employed in this study ignore the possibility of asymmetric shocks, the MEP results might be questioned in this deterministic setting. However, the study period has been smooth and has not been subject to any major changes in the State economic policies. Therefore, the MEP results might not be susceptible such changes. However, further research is desired on examining the <b>macroeconomic</b> policy <b>performance</b> behavior of Indian States using bootstrapping DEA. Originality/value – None of the past Indian studies were able to give a comprehensive picture concerning the MEP behavior of Indian State economies, since the methodologies adopted in those studies were not suitable to take into consideration all the macro indicators at a time. Therefore, this present study is considered the first of its kind in assessing the MEP index of the Indian State economies by simultaneously considering all the macro indicators.

The speed and the {{intensity}} with which the sub-prime crisis in the US culminated into global financial crisis and then into global economic crisis, however, made everybody wonder as to what went wrong. The question whether it all happened so suddenly or there were early warnings in the system, which was masked by the <b>overall</b> improvement in <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>performance</b> or rapid pace of financial innovations, and thereby could not evince required policy responses (policy of ‘benign neglect’) before the emergence of the crisis has invited a lot of interest among policymakers and academicians. While many facets of the crisis are still unfolding, a lot has been written about the origin, the impact and the lessons from the crisis. At the same time, the crisis has thrown up many debates which still remain unsettled. The role of a sustained perio d of easy monetary policy in creating preconditions for a crisis by inducing excessive credit growth, build-up of financial leverage and asset bubbles is one of them. Also, and more importantly, serious thoughts are being given to the desired changes in the framework of monetary policy to preempt the recurrence of such crises.

40|$|The theme {{selected}} for the conference is befitting in the present context as we grapple with issues and challenges for sustaining the elevated growth momentum {{that we have now}} achieved. This has assumed added contemporary significance in the wake of expected moderation in global growth due to a projected slowdown in the US and some other advanced economies. Whereas emerging markets, including India have so far not been greatly affected by the financial turbulence in advanced economies, the increasing global uncertainties need to be watched and guarded against appropriately.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{both the}} <b>overall</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>performance</b> of the UK labour market since 1997, {{as well as}} some of the underlying micro problems, particularly those facing unskilled workers, On the macro front, we have seen unemployment decline to its lowest level for a generation without excessive inflationary pressure. The main factors behind this decline in equilibrium unemployment stem from actions taken by the previous government. Changes introduced in the labour market since 1997 are likely to have only small effects on equilibrium unemployment. Underlying this favourable aggregate labour-market performance are serious problems facing unskilled men who have seen dramatic increases in their unemployment and inactivity rates, concentrated particularly in Wales and the northern regions of Britain. The policy response since 1997 has focused on encouraging the unskilled into work (the New Deal) while simultaneously raising the rewards for working (the minimum wage, tax credits). These policies have had a positive impact on youth employment and have significantly reduced child poverty. So far, however, existing policies do not seem likely to have a serious impact on the high levels of worklessness among unskilled men...|$|E

There have been some key policy changes with regard to competition and R&D but, given the overall problems, we should not expect any rapid improvement in this area. Third, we look at poverty rates. We discuss the reasons for the dramatic rise in poverty since 1979 and note how the policy changes since 1997 have started to reverse this seemingly inexorable trend. Finally, we set the scene for some of the other studies in this issue by noting the exceptionally low levels of net investment in the public sector since 1975 and the dramatic declines in the relative pay of certain groups of public sector workers since the same date. These trends have strongly exacerbated problems in the key areas of health, education, and transport...|$|E

It employed ARDL approach for this purpose due to its suitability for estimating an equation with a mix of stationary and nonstationary variables of order I(1) and address potential endogeneity problems.

Specialists consider inflation and output as the main determinats of the social welfare. The economic literature regarding this fact suggests that the central bank is seen as a free lunch institution.
