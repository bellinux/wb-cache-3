5|$|Rome's Ciampino airport, {{the site}} of the first Comet hull loss, was the origin of more {{disastrous}} Comet flights just over a year later. On 10 January 1954, 20minutes after taking off from Ciampino, the first production Comet, G-ALYP, broke up in mid-air while operating BOAC Flight 781 and crashed into the Mediterranean off the Italian island of Elba with the loss of all 35 <b>on</b> <b>board.</b> <b>With</b> no witnesses to the disaster and only partial radio transmissions as incomplete evidence, no obvious reason for the crash could be deduced. Engineers at de Havilland immediately recommended 60 modifications aimed at any possible design flaw while the Abell Committee met to determine potential causes of the crash. BOAC also voluntarily grounded its Comet fleet pending investigation into the causes of the accident.|$|E
