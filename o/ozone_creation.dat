Due to the space charge formed around the conductors, an HVDC system may have about half the loss per unit length of a high voltage AC system carrying the same amount of power. With monopolar transmission the choice of polarity of the energized conductor leads to a degree of control over the corona discharge. In particular, the polarity of the ions emitted can be controlled, which may have an environmental impact on <b>ozone</b> <b>creation.</b> Negative coronas generate considerably more ozone than positive coronas, and generate it further downwind of the power line, creating the potential for health effects.

Events with relativistic solar protons (i. e. protons with energies > 450 MeV) are observed at ground level by neutron monitors and called ground-level events (GLEs) (Shea and Smart, 2001). Analysis of experimental data and model calculations permits us to explain some distinctions observed in ozone total content (OTC) variations during several GLEs. For example, model simulations show a significant CN concentration enhancement during the May 1990 GLEs of relatively "moderate" magnitude, when polar ozone "mini-holes" (OTC depletions up to 20 %) have been observed, while no OTC variations and considerable aerosol enhancements were seen during more powerful GLEs (4 August 1972, 2 May 1998, 14 July 2000) (Reagan et al., 1981; Shumilov et al., 1995, 2003).

Environmental impacts include those from emissions into the environment and through the consumption of resources, as well as other interventions (e. g. land use) associated with providing products that occur when extracting resources, producing materials, manufacturing the products, during consumption/use, and at the products end-of-life (collection/sorting, reuse, recycling, waste disposal). These emissions and consumptions contribute {{to a wide range of}} impacts, such as climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, tropospheric <b>ozone</b> (smog) <b>creation,</b> eutrophication, acidification, toxicological stress on human health and ecosystems, the depletion of resources, water use, land use, and noise  among others. A clear need, therefore, exists to be proactive and to provide complimentary insights, apart from current regulatory practices, to help reduce such impacts. Practitioners and researchers from many domains come together in life cycle assessment (LCA) to calculate indicators of the aforementioned potential environmental impacts that are linked to products - supporting the identification of opportunities for pollution prevention and reductions in resource consumption while taking the entire product life cycle into consideration. This paper, Part 1 in a series of 2, introduces the LCA framework and procedure, outlines how to define and model a products life cycle, and provides an overview of available methods and tools for tabulating and compiling associated emissions and resource consumption data in a life cycle inventory. It also discusses the application of LCA in industry and policy-making. The second paper, by Pennington et al.

40|$|National audienceSustainable {{development}} requires D f E (Design for Environment) {{methods and}} tools {{to measure and}} compare {{the environmental impacts of}} human activities for the products. Environmental impacts include those from emissions into the environment and those due to the consumption of resources, as well as other interventions associated with the product's end-of-life.

A clear need, therefore, exists to be proactive and to provide complementary insights, apart from current regulatory practices, to help reducing such impacts. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a systematic approach that enables implementation of cleaner and greener product and process concepts in industry. It is described as a method to estimate environmental impacts associated with products, processes and services. LCA approach involves quantitative analysis structured in four stages: goal definition, inventory analysis, impact analysis and improvement analysis. Common criticisms of this approach include high completion costs, labour intensive data collection, unavailability of some information for the required assessment and the failure of LCA to address other design issues such as functionality, reliability and safety requirements. Taking these factors into consideration, a number of alternative or streamlining approaches have been suggested including a qualitative approach named as “EEA” (Environmental Effects Analysis). EEA is used in the early stages of product life cycle for the purpose of identifying and evaluating potential environmental impacts in all life cycle phases of a product. The objective of the tool is to take corrective and preventive actions to minimize the environmental burden from products during their life cycle. The EEA is a useful method in the early phases of all kinds of product development processes. LCA can also be used in the early phases of product/process elaboration, if data is available for the product being developed. By using the EEA method in the first steps of product development process, it is possible to find out where, in the product's life cycle, the hotspots occur that cause the major environmental impact. At that stage it is still easy to make efficient environmental improvements. The combining EEA-LCA is applied to a cement process...|$|R

Active sampling method using the low volume sampling pump (Acuro, Drager, Lubeck, Germany) was used to drawn the air into the tube; the absorbent was Chromosorb 106. The sampling periods were between May 2010 and June 2011; the period covered both dry and wet seasons. The adsorbed gases were desorbed using solvent extraction method with carbon disulphide as solvent. The extracted solutions were analyzed with gas chromatography and mass spectrometer. The observed concentrations of individual VOCs were determined and maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) coefficient along with rate constants of VOC-OH reactions were applied to assess the ozone formation potential of individual VOC in the ambient atmosphere. Sixteen VOC species were observed at various sites with mixing height in decreasing order: toluene (5. 82), mp-xylene (3. 58), ethylbenzene (3. 46), benzene (2. 29), and n-butane (0. 84).

Hence, these various options need to be assessed for avoided life cycle impact potentials, to understand where greatest savings lie and in order to rank these options for informed decision making by water industries. To fill a gap in the information available to industry dealing with wastewater, the avoided emissions by various AD based technologies, in primary impact potentials that make a difference between various systems, have been provided in this paper. 1 m 3 biogas can save 0. 92 m 3 natural gas. An average UK household (with a demand of 2 kWe) requires 180, 000 MJ or 5000 Nm 3 or 4. 76 t biogas per year, from 15. 87 t sewage sludge processed through AD. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEM FC) is suitable for building micro-generations; micro gas turbine (Micro GT), solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and SOFC-GT hybrid are suitable for distributed generations upto 500 kWe and occasionally over 500 kWe; engine and ignition engine above 1 MWe. These CHP technologies can be ranked from the lowest to the highest impacts per unit energy production: PEM FC is the environmentally most benign option, followed by SOFC, SOFC-GT, Engine or Micro GT and Ignition engine (with the highest impact potential), respectively. In terms of avoided global warming, acidification and photochemical <b>ozone</b> <b>creation</b> potentials, compared to equivalent natural gas based systems, the biogas based PEM FC micro-generation and Micro GT distributed systems achieve the greatest avoided emissions with the most cost-effectiveness. Application of digested sludge as fertiliser has more toxicity impacts, however, has greater avoided emissions in acidification and photochemical <b>ozone</b> <b>creation</b> potentials on the basis of inorganic N:P:K fertiliser, compared to the biogas production for the natural gas grid system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
