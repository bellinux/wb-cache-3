50|$|In the Philippines, Banana cue is {{a popular}} snack. The {{portmanteau}} 'Banana cue' may be a misnomer as {{it is not really}} cooked in a skewer over hot embers like a barbecue. Rather, the peeled flesh of an under ripe plantain is fried in hot <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> fire before it is held in a skewer ready for sale. There are two ways to prepare a banana cue. One way is to fry the peeled banana in oil with some amount of brown sugar thrown in to caramelize the flesh. Another way is to fry the flesh in oil until done. When done, they are scooped out of the cooking pan and placed on a dripping pan to allow the oil to drip, before a generous amount of refined sugar is sprinkled over them. A variant from Mindanao, known as Ginanggang, is different in that it is actually grilled over charcoal.|$|E
40|$|Tribology of a {{well known}} solid {{lubricant}} molybdenum disulphide is studied here {{in water and}} <b>oil</b> <b>medium,</b> <b>over</b> a large range of contact dimensions. Lateral force microscopy is used to identify the deformation modes, intra-crystalline slip, plastic grooving, fragmentation and fracture, of single particles The medium and agglomeration were found to dictate the deformation mode Steel on steel tribology lubricated by suspensions of these particles in liquid media was conducted over a range of contact pressure and sliding velocity. A scrutiny of the frictional data {{with the aid of}} Raman spectroscopy to identify the transfer film, suggested that the particle size, as it is at contact, is an important tribological parameter Ultrasonication of the suspension and dispersion of the particle by surfactants were used to control the apriori particle size fed into the suspension. Correspondence of friction data of the gently sonicated suspension with that of the ultrasonicated suspension with dispersants indicated the importance of liquid ingestion by these particles as it controls their mode of deformation and consequent tribology.
