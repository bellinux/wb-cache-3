50|$|The first V90-3MW {{was erected}} in {{northern}} Germany in May 2002. 15 test turbines were deployed {{around the world}} in different climatic conditions, so that when it went into production, the V90-3MW had been tested in more sites than the V80-2MW. Following a number of gearbox problems, the V90-3MW was withdrawn for <b>offshore</b> <b>sales</b> in early 2007 before being reissued for offshore use in May 2008. Presently, the nacelles are exclusively made at the Vestas Nacelles works in Taranto, Italy. Towers and blades may come from a number of locations.

The regulation as originally adopted and the brand new safe harbors it brought to the laws governing <b>offshore</b> offers and <b>sales</b> will also be explored. Then the subsequent regulatory abuses and concerns in the marketplace surrounding the regulation and the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s response to these issues will be discussed. The amendments to Regulation S which eventually served as the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s way of halting these problems and the changes they brought to the regulation will be laid out. Finally, this author will give what he believes will be the probable impact of the amendments on problems underlying the regulation as well his recommendations on how to eliminate these problems should they continue to occur after the amendments...|$|R
5000|$|In America in 1929 {{there was}} a {{short-lived}} Parlophone label made and distributed by OKeh. [...] Initially, certain OKeh records were issued using the Parlophone label and using the OKeh catalog number. An example - Miff Mole's [...] "Birmingham Bertha" [...] b/w [...] "Moanin' Low" [...] - has been found on Parlophone PNY-41273 and Odeon ONY-41273 (issued as by [...] "Eddie Gordon's Band") {{as well as the}} standard OKeh 41273 (issued as by [...] "Miff Mole and his Molers"). OKeh then started the PNY-34000 series (along with the Odeon ONY-36000 series) lasting until late 1930 or early 1931. No one has been able to determine for whom these two labels were intended, since many surviving copies are in new condition. A number of noted record collectors and researchers (George Blacker, Carl Kenziora, Len Kunstadt, among other members of the New York Record Research Associates) had long speculated that since these records were found in a west coast warehouse uncirculated, they were possibly intended for <b>offshore</b> <b>sales</b> in US possessions (Guam, Marianas, etc.) or possibly at military offshore bases, but this has never been proven. One of the reasons for this speculation is because OKeh specifically recorded quite a number of sides without vocals and issued them only on Parlophone and Odeon (in addition to the standard vocal versions). These non-vocal version are especially prized by collectors. Regardless, this series (along with OKeh's Odeon ONY- series) appears to not have been available for sale in the United States.|$|R

40|$|As {{information}} can be sent via various mediums through different channels,  visual or vocal communication can also be carried out though various channels such as public switched networks (PSTN) and packet based switched systems which {{are commonly known as}} voice over Internet protocol (VOIP). This particular study emphasizes on voice over Internet protocol and its various aspects.   Codec is the most important aspect in VOIP communication there is variety of codecs available. In order to have right quality of voice the right codec must be selected. There are various other factors such as bandwidth and right technical infrastructures which are also present and which must be addressed {{in order to have a}} better quality of voice over VOIP.   Mostly, VOIP is used in companies where a huge volume of voice calls is needed, especially in call centers which deal in <b>offshore</b> <b>sales</b> and support projects. The main factor which make companies and other users interested in  VOIP is the financial aspect as, VOIP cuts costs significantly. Every mode which may be utilised for voice communication has its own advantages and disadvantages so user can chose the mode of communication according to what is required.   In order to provide the financial and technical advantages of VOIP, various previous studies have been studied, information has been collected from different call centers and a network is simulated using OPNET MODELLER in order to evaluate the performance of VOIP codec as the codec is basically coder as well as decoder, hence it is the basic aspect in order to have a better quality of services (QOS) and quality of voice (QOV) ...|$|R

Cruz stated that the Corps' responsibilities were expanded without providing adequate measures for state participation. Proponents of the bill argued that it would provide steady funding to support research and restoration projects, funded primarily by dedicating 12.5% of revenues from offshore energy development, including oil, gas, and renewable energy, through <b>offshore</b> lease <b>sales</b> and production based royalty payments, distributed through a competitive grant program.|$|R

A simple model is presented showing that if the objects have different values and individuals tend to only bid on objects with high value, then the resulting {{distribution of}} the number of bidders will not be Poisson. The results of the model correspond closely to data observed in Federal Offshore Oil lease auctions and the model is simple enough so that it may be of practical use to an individual participating in such an auction. ...|$|R
40|$|Scholars {{typically}} view offshore outsourcing as a {{means of}} reducing the cost of manufacturing activities for large corporations, yet offshore outsourcing may entail administrative and technical services, and may include activities outsourced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Drawing on research in international entrepreneurship and services, we hypothesize and find evidence that offshore outsourcing of administrative and technical services by SMEs is associated with greater extent and scope of internationalization of <b>sales.</b> <b>Offshore</b> outsourcing enhances international competitiveness by enabling SMEs to reduce costs, expand relational ties, serve customers more effectively, free up scarce resources, and leverage capabilities of foreign partners.

25|$|McDonnell {{advocated}} drilling off the Virginia {{coast of}} the Atlantic Ocean as a possible revenue source for the state. However, according to the law, Virginia could not receive any revenues from drilling in federal waters, which included all drilling sites more than 3 miles off the coast. On May 6, 2010, the Department of Interior suspended the proposed auction of offshore Virginia leasing rights. Congressman Moran issued a statement commending the decision. On May 18, Moran forwarded to McDonnell a Department of Defense report finding that the proposed lease site would interfere with naval operations. On May 25, McDonnell reaffirmed his interest in having oil drilling off the Virginia coast notwithstanding the British Peteroleum oil spill and the inability of Virginia to get any of the royalty income. On May 27, President Obama announced that the <b>offshore</b> Virginia lease <b>sale</b> was cancelled. Subsequently, McDonnell proposed continuing a federal environmental study of drilling off the Virginia coast or drilling for just gas and not oil. However, a consulting firm said that liquids are almost always produced with gas offshore and so the proposed idea may not be possible.|$|R
40|$|While most {{models of}} auctions and {{competitive}} bidding assume that each bidder's utility for an outcome depends only {{on his own}} profit, we allow the utility to also depend on any regret that a bidder suffers after the fact and characterize when and how this affects bidding. Specifically, a winner might regret "money left on the table" in Federal <b>offshore</b> oil lease <b>sales,</b> while a loser might regret seeing an object sell for less than his own value for it. We show that for risk-neutral bidders who, after the fact, know the winner's price for the object, a bidder's optimal bidding strategy will {{not depend on the}} relative weight given to profit versus regret if both forms of regret weigh equally heavily. However, if bidders weight money-left-on-the-table regret more heavily, then the bid taker suffers. Likewise, if losers do not learn the winner's price, then the bid taker also suffers. Thus, the existing models' exclusion of regret from risk neutral bidders' utility functions affects the applicability of the resulting theory under certain, now clearly delineated, conditions. auctions, competitive bidding, regret, money left on the table...|$|R
40|$|The {{ocean is}} one of Earth's most {{valuable}} natural resources. From regulating the climate to providing a source of food, the ocean has an interrelated economic, ecological and social importance. The economic, environmental and cultural history of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) are all intrinsically linked to the Atlantic Ocean and its resources. Protection of the coastal and ocean environments was not only important to the province’s past but is also widely recognized as vitally important {{for the future of}} the province. In June of 2011 the provincial Government of Newfoundland and Labrador introduced a Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy and Policy Framework (Government of NL, 2011 a). The framework is designed to recognize the diversity of various stakeholders who rely on healthy coastal and ocean areas and to work together to provide long-term sustainable use of resources. One of the goals of the policy framework is to guide the coordination of provincial coastal and ocean policy in relation to priority issues identified for the province, with increased collaboration between governments, stakeholders, and communities (Department of Fisheries and Aquaculture, 2010). This research paper asks the question: how might the province’s new coastal and oceans management strategy and policy framework be used to address major coastal and oceans problems? To answer this question, the paper applies the policy framework to an emerging crisis in one of the province’s most important fisheries – the northern shrimp fisheries. Despite fundamental social-ecological transformations in recent decades, the province of Newfoundland and Labrador continues to rely heavily on the ocean for the fishery resources it provides. Following the collapse of the cod fishery in 1992, and the subsequent moratoria on cod and other groundfish fisheries that put tens of thousands of people in the province out of work, many harvesters and processors in coastal communities in the province turned to increasingly lucrative and abundant crab and shrimp as a new means of income and industry (Foley et al. 2013). However, due to a number of reasons, including an increase in cod numbers and rising ocean temperatures, northern shrimp stocks are in decline (Lilly et al, 2000). This decline led the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), the federal agency responsible for fish allocations, to make cut backs on the shrimp quota in recent years. These quota reductions are impacting the inshore fishery, which supports the shore based and community-based processing plants where workers produce cooked and peeled shrimp, much more negatively than the offshore fishery, which produces frozen shell on shrimp onboard <b>offshore</b> vessels for <b>sale</b> into global markets (Keenan and Carruthers, 2015). The allocation of higher quota reductions in the inshore sector than the offshore sector in ocean areas close to the province has led to intense and highly 4 politicized disagreements and distraught feelings from local rural communities that depend on the fishery for their livelihoods. The purpose of this research paper is to apply the province’s Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy and Policy Framework to the province’s northern shrimp fishery. The paper uses the framework as an analytical approach to explore potential ways to practically address and overcome the multi-faceted social, environmental, and political issues the province’s northern shrimp fishery, particularly the inshore sector, is currently facing. The policy framework is designed to address specific coastal and ocean issues, some of which can be related to the shrimp fishery. The issues are divided into six objectives: Healthy Marine Environments, Social, Cultural, and Economic Sustainability, Coastal Land Use, Competing Needs and Interests, Coastal and Marine Infrastructure, and Climate Change. This paper begins by examining the Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy that the province has developed to protect the ocean and coastline. This includes analyzing the goals, principles, tools, and departments involved in the strategy. Following this, the paper introduces the history and current issues facing the shrimp fishery in the province, specifically focusing on the decline in the resource and recent allocation changes and controversies. The policy framework is then applied to key issues in the fishery using some of the strategy objectives outlined above. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of how the NL Coastal and Ocean Management Strategy and Policy Framework can be potentially applied to coastal management challenges, such as at the shrimp fishery, to promote solutions...|$|R
