40|$|Abstract Based on the {{expression}} for notch <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> brittle {{material and the}} fundamental principle of probability theory, correlations between the statistical characteristic parameters <b>of</b> notch <b>strength</b> and those <b>of</b> flexural <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> ceramics are obtained and checked by test results. It’s shown that for the normal distribution, the mean value and the standard deviation <b>of</b> the notch <b>strength</b> are, respectively, Kt times less than those <b>of</b> flexural <b>strength,</b> where Kt is the theoretical stress concentration factor. For the log-normal distribution, the mean value of logarithm <b>of</b> notch <b>strength</b> is equal to that <b>of</b> flexural <b>strength</b> minus the logarithm of Kt, and the standard deviation of the logarithm <b>of</b> notch <b>strength</b> keeps equal to that <b>of</b> flexural <b>strength</b> as Kt increases. For Weibull distribution, the product of characteristic value, i. e. the scale parameter of Weibull distribution <b>of</b> notch <b>strength</b> and Kt {{is equal to the}} scale parameter of Weibull distribution <b>of</b> flexural <b>strength</b> and the shape parameter <b>of</b> notch <b>strength</b> keeps constant as Kt increases. Based on the above results, procedures are developed to predict the probability distribution <b>of</b> notch <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> ceramics from that <b>of</b> the flexural <b>strength.</b> It is shown that the notch <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> ceramics follows the normal distribution, the log-normal distribution and Weibull distribution, and all of the above distributions can be predicted. The predicted results of three probability distributions <b>of</b> notch <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> ceramics mentioned above are in good agreement with test results. The possibility of predicting the probability distribution <b>of</b> notch <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> ceramics is of practical importance in the design and reliability assessment of ceramic structure elements...|$|R

5|$|The player {{character}} has three levels <b>of</b> <b>strength.</b> The strength level {{is indicated by}} the cursor which will either be white, flashing yellow, or red. Strength will decrease after extreme actions or being attacked by the game's enemy, Scissorman, and recovers with time. When the character's life is being threatened, the cursor will blink red, indicating panic mode. If the character is being chased, click points are only effective on objects that will make Scissorman retreat. In escape mode, actions do not lower strength and recovery is suspended. This mode stays active until Scissorman is somehow forced to retreat. If the player's strength reaches zero, then it is game over and the player must continue from the last room they entered with one level <b>of</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before {{the game}} begins, each player creates their player {{character}} and records the details (described below) on a character sheet. First, a player determines their character's ability scores, which consist <b>of</b> <b>Strength,</b> Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each {{edition of the}} game has offered differing methods of determining these statistics. The player then chooses a race (species) such as human or elf, a character class (occupation) such as fighter or wizard, an alignment (a moral and ethical outlook), and other features to round out the character's abilities and backstory, which have varied in nature through differing editions.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{dissolution}} of the court in 1597, the musical style which was inspired by the concerto delle donne spread throughout Europe, and remained prominent for almost fifty years. The concerto delle donne was so influential and often imitated that it became a cliché of northern Italian courts.

It functioned as a powerful tool of propaganda, projecting an image <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> and affluence.|$|E
5|$|Early World Cups {{were given}} to {{countries}} at meetings of FIFA's congress. The locations were controversial because South America and Europe were by far the two centres <b>of</b> <b>strength</b> in football and travel between them required three weeks by boat. The decision to hold the first World Cup in Uruguay, for example, led to only four European nations competing. The next two World Cups were both held in Europe. The decision to hold the second of these in France was disputed, as the South American countries understood that the location would alternate between the two continents. Both Argentina and Uruguay thus boycotted the 1938 FIFA World Cup.|$|E

When the normal stress is less than 100  kPa, the effect <b>of</b> concrete <b>strength</b> on shear <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> interface is quite small.
