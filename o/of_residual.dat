5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat {{comes from}} a combination <b>of</b> <b>residual</b> heat from planetary accretion (about 20%) and heat produced through radioactive decay (80%). The major heat-producing isotopes within Earth are potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232. At the center, the temperature may be up to , and the pressure could reach 360GPa. Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately , twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.|$|E

Other radioisotopes, present as impurities, have a long enough half-life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests; in 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory issued a warning to the Los Alamos county and the Forest Service performing thinning of trees in the area to not remove the trees cut {{in various parts of the}} Bayo Canyon due to possible content <b>of</b> <b>residual</b> radioactive materials. The worst affected zones are fenced off; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil, insects and trees in the surrounding areas.

50|$|However, {{because of}} the {{behavior}} of the process of regression, the distributions <b>of</b> <b>residuals</b> at different data points (of the input variable) may vary even if the errors themselves are identically distributed.

To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels <b>of</b> <b>residual</b> stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E

Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads.

5|$|A {{personal}} dive {{computer is}} a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. The dive computer keeps track <b>of</b> <b>residual</b> gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers also provide a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E

Their tests relied on asymptotic results without requiring small sample normality. We extend this research by proposing additional tests based on partial sums <b>of</b> <b>residuals.</b> The asymptotic distribution for each test statistic is found so that the $P$ value can be efficiently approximated.

40|$|International audienceThe {{inspection}} <b>of</b> <b>residuals</b> is {{a fundamental}} step to investigate the quality of adjustment of a parametric model to data. For spatial point processes, the concept <b>of</b> <b>residuals</b> has been recently proposed by Baddeley et al. (2005) as an empirical counterpart of the Campbell equilibrium equation for marked Gibbs point processes. The present paper focuses on stationary marked Gibbs point processes and deals with asymptotic properties <b>of</b> <b>residuals</b> for such processes. In particular, the consistency and the asymptotic normality are obtained for a wide class <b>of</b> <b>residuals</b> including the classical ones (raw residuals, inverse residuals, Pearson residuals). Based on these asymptotic results, we define goodness-of-fit tests with Type-I error theoretically controlled. One of these tests constitutes {{an extension of the}} quadrat counting test widely used to test the null hypothesis of a homogeneous Poisson point process...|$|R

A mathematical model is developed for the process of drying <b>of</b> water treatment <b>residuals.</b> A steady-state heat-balance equation is applied for a control volume <b>of</b> <b>residuals</b> that takes into account the heat transfer by radiation, convection, and evaporation. The mathematical model was validated using drying experiments conducted in a wind tunnel as well as other experiments conducted in an open environment equipped with a weather monitoring station.
