5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture roosts on high, exposed {{dead trees}} to observe {{surrounding}} terrain. When flying, it travels in pairs or alone and is rarely found in groups. Flight is heavy and steady. It flies with its wings held flat or very slightly above horizontal, {{in what is}} called the dihedral position. The flight of the greater yellow-headed is an example <b>of</b> <b>static</b> soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} case <b>of</b> <b>static</b> equilibrium {{occurs when}} two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|Defenders of Ardania is a tower defense {{game that}} also has {{offensive}} real-time strategy elements. As with all tower defense games, the player must defend their home base by building several types <b>of</b> <b>static</b> tower units that fire at weak offensive units spawned by the opponent. In Defenders of Ardania, however, players must also spawn soldiers themselves. Like the opponent's soldiers, the player's soldiers move along a fixed path towards their opponent's base and cannot be directly maneuvered by the player. The game is won if units spawned by the player {{get past the}} opponent's towers and destroy the opponent's base before the opponent's units get past the player's towers and destroy the player's base.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, {{detailed}} invasion {{plans were}} {{drawn up by}} the Germans, but Switzerland was never attacked.

Under General Henri Guisan central command, a general mobilisation of the armed forces was ordered. The Swiss military strategy was changed from one <b>of</b> <b>static</b> defence at the borders to protect the economic heartland, to one of organised long-term attrition and withdrawal to strong, well-stockpiled positions high in the Alps known as the Reduit. Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.|$|E
5|$|Spacey was Mendes' {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Lester, though DreamWorks had urged the {{director}} to consider better-known actors; similarly, the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn until Mendes offered the part to Bening without DreamWorks' knowledge. Principal photography took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, and on location in Los Angeles. Mendes' dominant style was deliberate and composed; he made extensive use <b>of</b> <b>static</b> shots and slow pans and zooms to generate tension. Cinematographer Conrad Hall complemented Mendes' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on-screen events. During editing, Mendes made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone than the script.|$|E

5|$|The {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} flies solitarily, {{with wings}} held in a {{dihedral}} position. It glides at a low altitude over wetlands while locating food, and perches on fence posts or on other low perches. When flying, it travels alone and is rarely found in groups. The flight of the lesser yellow-headed is an example <b>of</b> <b>static</b> soaring flight, which uses thermals to maintain altitude without the need to flap its wings. This vulture rarely soars high in the air, preferring low altitudes. This bird {{is believed to be}} somewhat migratory in response to the changes in water level where it lives.

5|$|Historically, {{forces were}} first quantitatively {{investigated}} in conditions <b>of</b> <b>static</b> equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out. Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities: they have magnitude and direction. When two forces act {{on a point}} particle, the resulting force, the resultant (also called the net force), can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition: the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram, gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram. The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum, depending on the angle between their lines of action. However, if the forces are acting on an extended body, their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on {{the motion of the}} body.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, the Australian Army mostly copied British Army doctrine, {{in as much}} as one existed semi-officially in {{the form}} of the Field Service Regulations. Pre-war {{planning}} had largely seen the Australian Army focus on defending the continent from invasion with a relatively small force, and as a result any future war was thought to likely be a highly mobile one. This was in contrast to the offensive focus of many British and European theorists of this time, despite their influence on local professional military debate. As a result, there was an emphasis on entrenchments, and whilst there was a recognition of the problems posed by increasing firepower as a result of the continued development of small arms and artillery technology, there was considered to be little requirement for the direct assault <b>of</b> <b>static</b> defensive positions given the room for manoeuvre afforded by the vastness of the Australian continent. Meanwhile, in order to be compatible with British forces, pre-war agreements ensured that Australian Army units were mostly organised, trained and equipped in accordance with British Army doctrine and establishment tables.|$|E

5|$|The {{first real}} {{progress}} toward a modern understanding of nervous function, though, came from the investigations of Luigi Galvani, who discovered that a shock <b>of</b> <b>static</b> electricity applied to an exposed nerve of a dead frog could cause its leg to contract. Since that time, each major advance in understanding has followed more or less directly from {{the development of a}} new technique of investigation. Until the early years of the 20th century, the most important advances were derived from new methods for staining cells. Particularly critical was the invention of the Golgi stain, which (when correctly used) stains only a small fraction of neurons, but stains them in their entirety, including cell body, dendrites, and axon. Without such a stain, brain tissue under a microscope appears as an impenetrable tangle of protoplasmic fibers, in which it is impossible to determine any structure. In the hands of Camillo Golgi, and especially of the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the new stain revealed hundreds of distinct types of neurons, each with its own unique dendritic structure and pattern of connectivity.|$|E
