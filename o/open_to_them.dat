5|$|Squall was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with input from game director Yoshinori Kitase. He was modelled after late actor River Phoenix. Squall's weapon, the gunblade, also made {{so that it would}} be difficult to master. In order to make players understand Squall's silent attitude, Kazushige Nojima made the character's thoughts <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> Squall's first voiced appearance was in the first Kingdom Hearts game, voiced by Hideo Ishikawa in Japanese and by David Boreanaz in English; Doug Erholtz has since assumed the role for all other English-speaking appearances.|$|E

Rowland refused and the eight directors prepared to pass a motion at the first full board meeting, set for 18 April 1973, forcing Rowland to relinquish all of his executive appointments. Rowland, aware of the possibility, had obtained an interlocutory injunction from the High Court of Justice preventing the board from voting on his removal.|$|E

25|$|If {{the court}} refused to grant such an application, then the {{defendant}} would (quite obviously) {{be unable to}} cross examine the makers of the hearsay statements.

25|$|To {{capitalize}} on the enlisted women's experience, commission status was <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> beginning in July 1943. To be eligible, the applicant had to have completed six months of service, be recommended by her commanding officer, and be selected by a board {{of male and female}} officers. After October 1943, the majority of women officers came from the ranks; only civilian women with specialized skills or exceptional leadership qualities were accepted for officer training.|$|E

The Kangal Dog is recognized by the United Kennel Club in the US, and by the national kennel clubs of South Africa and New Zealand. Many Kangal Dogs are being bred in Germany as well, mostly by immigrant workers.

25|$|From 1998 through 2005, {{non-profit}} hospitals, {{state and}} local governments and other agencies paid Copeland Lowery at least $13.5 million for federal lobbying.; Many, if not most of these were in the Inland Empire (central and southern California), within or near the district that Lewis represents. The agencies paid the fees because they felt it would help them get federal money from a congressman whose door was already - in theory - <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the war, Douglas {{returned}} to New York City and found work in radio, theater and commercials. In his radio work, he {{acted in a}} number of network soap operas, and sees those experiences as being especially valuable, as skill in using one's voice is important for aspiring actors, and regrets that the same avenues are no longer <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> His stage break occurred when he took over the role played by Richard Widmark in Kiss and Tell (1943), which then led to other offers.|$|E

25|$|As William Nelson, {{the major}} contributor, donated money {{rather than a}} {{personal}} art collection, the curators were able to assemble a collection from scratch. At {{the height of the}} Great Depression, the worldwide art market was flooded with pieces for sale, but there were very few buyers. As such, the museum's buyers found a vast market <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> The acquisitions grew quickly and within a short time, the Nelson-Atkins had one of the largest art collections in the country.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears to}} me that the {{developers}} have been completely indifferent to, or perhaps have even welcomed, this deterioration in the condition of the building, and have done virtually nothing to halt it. I feel the developers have shown a complete disregard for the moral obligations which arose from their course of dealing with the corporation or the planning applications; but I feel the corporation have also been extremely remiss to exercising whatever statutory powers were <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> to cope with the situation.|$|E

During this backlash, he stepped down from his role as chief physician. In 1926, the Hospital closed due to concerns for the safety of foreign workers, but Dr. Cadbury urged its reopening. Many saw him to be a unifying force for missionaries in Canton. Though his home was luxurious compared to his students. they didn't feel upset since his home was <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> for Bible sessions and worship services.|$|E

25|$|Bohol's first {{indigenous}} people {{settled in the}} Anda peninsula. These people came from northeast Mindanao. These people {{were responsible for the}} Anda petrographs which {{are one of the most}} important indigenous rock writing in the country. Around the 12th century, a group of people from Northern Mindanao settled in the strait between mainland Bohol and the island of Panglao. Those people came from a nation in northern Mindanao called Lutao (probably the animist kingdom of what will soon be the Islamic Lanao). Those people established the kedatuan (kingdom) of Dapitan in western Bohol because the true {{indigenous people}} of Bohol in the Anda peninsula and nearby areas were not <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> forcing them to establish settlement in the western part of the island. They occupied both shores and the entire island of Panglao. The kedatuan was first built with hardwood on the soft seabed. It engaged in trade with nearby areas and some Chinese merchants.|$|E
500|$|Political {{observer}} John McWhorter has commented, [...] "eenagers have {{a variety}} of identities <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> for trying on anti-Establishment postures.

He stated that the acting white attitude developed as the creation of an [...] "Other" [...] among newly integrated African-American kids.|$|E
500|$|The commissioners soon {{discovered}} that only unofficial channels were <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Over the next several months, Talleyrand sent a series of informal negotiators to meet with and influence the commissioners. [...] Some of the informal avenues were closed down (Gerry, for instance, informed Hauteval that {{they could no longer}} meet, since Hauteval had no formal authority), and Talleyrand finally appeared in November 1797 at a dinner, primarily to castigate the Americans for their unwillingness to accede to the demand for a bribe.|$|E

His life was a noble example of faithful and untiring devotion to the Gospel." [...] Bush was believed to be buried on Kauai, but the location of his grave is uncertain. According to Anita Manning, an Associate in Cultural Studies at Bishop Museum, [...] "even the family can't find him".|$|E
500|$|Claudia Johnson, a {{prominent}} Wollstonecraft scholar, {{has called the}} Rights of Woman [...] "a republican manifesto". Johnson contends that Wollstonecraft is hearkening back to the Commonwealth tradition of the 17th century and attempting to reestablish a republican ethos. In Wollstonecraft's version, there would be strong, but separate, masculine and feminine roles for citizens. According to Johnson, Wollstonecraft [...] "denounces the collapse of proper sexual distinction as the leading feature of her age, and as the grievous consequence of sentimentality itself. The problem undermining society in her view is feminized men". If men feel free to adopt both the masculine position and the sentimental feminine position, she argues, women have no position <b>open</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in society. Johnson therefore sees Wollstonecraft as a critic, in both the Rights of Men and the Rights of Woman, of the [...] "masculinization of sensitivity" [...] in such works as Edmund Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France.|$|E
