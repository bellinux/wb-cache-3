40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comprehensive}} outline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> an element <b>of</b> black culture, <b>the</b> <b>blues,</b> analyzed through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> concepts created for this endeavor. The conceptual framework referred to above for <b>the</b> anthropology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blues</b> is derived from a synthesis of elements drawn from previous works on <b>the</b> <b>blues</b> with <b>the</b> author’s own. When applies to <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blues,</b> this new conceptual orientation renders a history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blues</b> in skeletal form which is more comprehensive than those of other scholars working in this field. This comprehensiveness is manifested in several ways. Firstly the resultant formulation elucidates the general patterns discernable in blues while still recognizing and emphasizing the great diversity observable within these patterns. Secondly, this reconciliation of homogeneity and differentiation is accomplished for <b>the</b> evolutionary process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blues' development. Thirdly, <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blues</b> is seen as having been influenced by a multitude of factors. These factors are treated not as sufficient causes for evolutionary change in the music, but as having created <b>the</b> structure <b>of</b> opportunities within which individual actors have acted to change <b>the</b> <b>blues.</b> Lastly, <b>the</b> formulation seeks to locate <b>the</b> <b>blues</b> accurately within <b>the</b> social context {{in which it was}} performed and which conditioned its development. The result, a more rounded and comprehensive representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>blues,</b> more nearly coincides 'with reality than those of other scholars...|$|R
