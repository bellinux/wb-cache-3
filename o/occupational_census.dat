30|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} changes in the classification of occupations between the 1990 and 2000 Censuses that warrant careful attention when making comparisons. The 1990 <b>Census</b> <b>occupational</b> codes are based on the 1980 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) system in which occupations are organized hierarchically in terms of the skill level and the experience considered necessary for individuals engaged in the occupations. By contrast, the 2000 <b>Census</b> <b>occupational</b> codes are based on the 1998 SOC, which classifies occupations by “job families”—job families combine occupations where people involved work together regardless of their respective skill level (i.e., doctors, nurses, and nurse assistants are grouped together). In addition, the 1998 SOC has more professional and technical occupations due to advances in technology and shifts in service-oriented sectors of the economy. Some 1990 occupations have become obsolete and do not figure in the 1998 SOC. In addition, some occupations have been “upgraded” or “downgraded”. For example, farm, ranch, and other agricultural managers are found in the major groups of management occupations in the 2000 Census whereas in 1990, they were listed under farming occupations. Without ensuring that <b>occupational</b> categories across <b>Censuses</b> are comparable, it is impossible to get an accurate measure involving change in the occupational classifications over the period. Peter B. Meyer and Anastasiya Osborne of the BLS converted Census occupation codes from 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 to 1990 scheme, available at the University of Minnesota “IPUMS Project” (ipums@pop.umn.edu).

Since the history of Dutch photography {{became the subject of}} academic research some thirty years ago, most attention has been given to individual photographers and their work. As a consequence, we hardly know anything about more general topics concerning the whole profession, like their comprehensiviness, income, and status, or the organization of the studios. This Ph. D. is meant to fill that gap. There are many sources to gain information from, sources that until now have hardly been used by photohistorians, such as tax accounts and <b>occupational</b> <b>censuses.</b> This Ph. D. concentrates on photographers in five cities: Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam, Delft and Dordrecht, of which the first three held the largest amount of photographers in the Netherlands. It covers the first fifty years of photography (1839 - 1889) in which the new medium gained ground and came (more or less) of age. Among the subjects that are being treated are the photographers' income, their social standing, their clientele, the way photographs were being used and treated, the organization of the studios, the part women played in photography, and the (difficult) relationship with the arts. In trying to reconstruct these and other aspects of nineteenth-century Dutch photography, as much use as possible has been made of archival sources. Quite some conceptions proof not to be correct when checked. Of all important nineteenth-century inventions photography was probably the least influential. It did not affect people's lives in a direct way; at most it documented the great changes that took place in that century. Photographs were seldomly published in newspapers and magazines - the 'state of the art' was not advanced enough yet - and the editions of hand printed photographs must have been modest. No photograph was thus seen by many people. We now probably know more nineteenth-century photographs than our ancestors. Photography stood at the border of technique, art, craft, industry, and commerce, without exclusively belonging to one of them...|$|R

No excess of stomach cancer was found among farmers in the two countries, which is in agreement with the most recent data from other surveys. The risk of oesophageal cancer was reduced among the Danish and increased among the Italian male farmers. This can probably be explained by differences in alcohol consumption between the Danish and Italian farmers compared with the general population. The risk of brain cancer was significantly reduced among Italian farmers. There was a significant risk reduction for Hodgkin's disease and no excess for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Denmark, whereas in Italy a statistically significant excess risk was found for the first and a slight excess risk for the second of these diseases. The per capita consumption of phenoxy-herbicides between 1950 and 1970 was lower in Italy than in Denmark but treatments were performed mainly by professional applicators in Denmark and by the farmers themselves in Italy. Risk of leukaemia among Italian female farmers was increased. In Denmark, this increase was limited to women who were themselves owners of a farm.

The most important point was {{the construction of an}} intertemporary comparable classification of the sectors of the economy. A long term classification was created by using the systematics of the bureau of census which continued from one census year to another. The comparison was based on two historical points of departure. Because the representation of 1970 is the most differentiated one we used it as model classification-system to represent the present economical structure {{as well as those of}} past cenus years. Whenever we found a more differentiated systematics in the past we adopted certain aspects that seemed suited to the comparison. On account of theoretical considerations we decided to base the comparison on 34 categories. Such a classification is still managable provided the categories are homogenous enough. Beside this intertemporary classification for the economical branches, which is the focal point of the study, we also compared the collected variables. First we looked for changes, in their meaning. Then we tried to categorise them in such a way that as few restrictions as possible results for the comparison. For this reason it was necessary to give a summary of the development of the census of enterprises in their 100 year old history.

DESIGN [...] Occupational information {{was obtained from the}} 1971 census records of women in the Longitudinal Study carried out by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS) and related to their subsequent mortality in the period between the 1971 and 1981 censuses. SETTING [...] In the Longitudinal Study, census, vital statistics, and other OPCS records are linked for a 1 % sample of the population of England and Wales. The women studied in this paper were drawn from the 513, 071 persons in the 1971 census who were included in the Longitudinal Study and whose entries were traced at the National Health Service Central Register by 1977. PARTICIPANTS [...] The analysis was based on 77, 081 women aged 15 - 59 years in the Longitudinal Study for whom occupational information was collected in the 1971 census (99 % of whom were in paid employment in the week before the census). There were 1553 deaths among these women in the follow up period analysed here. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Numbers of deaths in each <b>occupational</b> group at <b>census</b> were compared to those expected on the basis of age specific death rates among all women in the study. "Professional, technical workers, and artists" had significantly low mortality while "Engineering and allied trades workers nec" had significantly high mortality. Among the latter, cancer mortality of electrical production process workers was extremely high. A number of other cause specific associations (which appear to confirm proportionate Decennial Supplement analyses) were suggested by the data; examples include high levels of mortality from ischaemic heart disease among cooks, lung cancer and respiratory disease among charwomen and cleaners, and accidents, poisonings, and violence among several groups of professional and technical workers. CONCLUSIONS [...] By using prospective follow up from the <b>census,</b> <b>occupational</b> differences in mortality can be identified among women in paid employment.

40|$|Women’s {{work has}} never been a linear process of {{extending}} participation. Instead, female labour force participation (FLFP) has extended and curtailed throughout time. This dissertation studies a period of contraction: the nineteenth-century Netherlands. This country makes an important case study to explore the factors influencing the trajectory of women’s work. First, FLFP rates as recorded in <b>occupational</b> <b>censuses</b> were low compared with surrounding countries. Second, Dutch industrialization took off relatively late and until well into the twentieth century {{a significant part of the}} labour force worked in agriculture, in contrast to neighbouring countries such as Britain and Belgium. This dissertation contributes to answering the following question: Why were Dutch female labour force participation rates lower than in surrounding countries during the period 1830 - 1914 ? I consider the following explanatory factors: social norms, the opportunity costs of women’s labour, and structural change. My conclusions about the relative weight of each factor are as follows. First, social norms regarding women’s role within the household following from the growing desire for domesticity have affected the trajectory of women’s labour. I show that married women withdrew from the registered labour force and instead, performed work that could be combined with domestic chores and that remained invisible in most statistical sources. However, these social norms were likewise strong in other western European countries, such as Britain, where FLFP was higher. Furthermore, Dutch FLFP was already low around 1850 when the transition to the male breadwinner society in western Europe started. Thus, it is no conclusive explanation for the aberrant Dutch trend in FLFP. Second, men’s real industrial wages started to rise after 1880 and became increasingly able to take care of a family of four. However, this was not true for men’s agricultural wages. Women’s wages in both sectors hardly increased at all during the nineteenth century in both sectors. I therefore conclude that industrial households were already able to realize a breadwinner-homemaker type of labour division from the 1880 s, whereas agricultural households still relied for an important part on other sources of income besides the husband’s wage labour by 1910. Thus, men’s wages profoundly influenced household labour division. However, in Britain, men’s real wages were even higher, but so were FLFP rates in the censuses. Thus, if the extent of men’s real wages was indeed the most important explanatory factor, we would have expected even lower participation rates in Britain than in the Netherlands. Third, the impact of economic structure and the changing demand for labour on FLFP has been a pivotal factor of influence. I show that the structure of the local economy had a statistically significant effect on the chance that a bride stated an occupation in her marriage record. Furthermore, in agriculture women increasingly performed work in a private business which was usually not registered in the censuses. Moreover, technological change in the textile industry and the transition to the factory system negatively impacted women’s position in the labour market because married women could no longer combine domestic chores with wage labour. Finally, many parts of the production process that had traditionally been women’s work were taken over by men when mechanization progressed. Considering all my research results, I conclude that the structure of the Dutch economy is the most important explanation for the exceptionally low Dutch FLFP rates during the long nineteenth century...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>census</b> <b>occupational</b> {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed over the last 150 years. Availability of digital census data sets now means such classifications can be systematically analyzed. Examination of heavy industrial workers in the full count U. S. 1880 census, and other censuses, has revealed major problems in the attribution of occupations to industrial sectors. This is traceable to the original enumeration process, and it particularly affects generic tradesmen such as blacksmiths and carpenters, who worked in numerous industrial sectors. As a result, the imputation of industrial sector codes from recorded occupations by the North Atlantic Population Project (NAPP) is substantially in error, suggesting that re-coding of existing census records using non-census sources would be necessary for such industrial sector codes to have empirical validity. A new occupational/industrial coding system, incorporating the NAPP-modified HISCO scheme, is presented.

Deleting individuals who do not have information on occupations at the current year and/or one year ago, the final sample size is 434, 902.

However, there still might be unobserved heterogeneity in schooling requirements within some 3 -digit occupations. One concern would be that a 3 -digit occupation contains several occupations with different schooling requirements. With this in mind, for occupations such that the frequencies of two or more schooling levels are within 15 percentage points of each other, we choose to use a more conservative definition of over (and under)-education. Specifically, workers whose schooling attainments fall within the range defined by these schooling levels are classified as matched, while those with a higher (lower) level of education are defined as overeducated (undereducated).

Urban Interactions: Soft Skills vs. Specialization This paper considers the role of soft skills in cities and industry clusters. It begins by specifying a model of agglomeration economies where soft skills allow agents to interact more productively. The model exposes two conflicting forces: agglomeration allows opportunities to interact, but it also produces thick, specialized markets, and this specialization can be a substitute for interaction. In order to empirically evaluate the soft skills – agglomeration relationship, the paper matches data on the interaction requirements of occupations from the Dictionary of <b>Occupational</b> Titles to <b>Census</b> data. The withinindustry average level of soft skills {{is found to be}} higher in cities but not in industry clusters.

We show that our gender-specific crosswalk more accurately captures the trends in occupational segregation that are masked using the aggregate crosswalk (based on combined male and female employment) provided by the U.

Using the 2000 occupational codes, we find that segregation by sex declined over the period but at a diminished pace over the decades, falling by 6. 1 percentage points over the 1970 s, 4. 3 percentage points over the 1980 s, 2. 1 percentage points over the 1990 s, and only 1. 1 percentage points (on a decadal basis) over the 2000 s. A primary mechanism by which occupational segregation was reduced over the 1970 - 2009 period was through the entry of new cohorts of women, presumably better prepared than their predecessors and/or encountering less labor market discrimination; during the 1970 s and 1980 s, however, there were also decreases in occupational segregation within cohorts.

40|$|Men {{with higher}} levels of serum {{testosterone}} have lower-status occupations, as indicated by archival data Erom 4, 462 military veterans in six U. S. <b>census</b> <b>occupational</b> groups. This finding supports a structural equation model in which higher testosterone, mediated through lower intellectual ability, higher antisocial behavior, and lower education, leads away Erom white-collar occupations. The model is plausible because testosterone levels are heritable and available early enough to affect a number of paths leading to occupational achievement. Prior research has related testosterone to aggression in animals and men, and high levels of testosterone presumably evolved in association with dominance in individual and small-group settings. It appears an irony of androgens that testosterone, which evolved in support of a primitive kind of status, now conflicts with the achievement of occupational status. Occupations are cultural creations, and cultural forces lead us toward or away from them. The choice of an occupation depends upon skill, experience, and the work available in a particular society. Biological factors are not usually considered, beyond those so potent as to be of little psychological interest: sumo wrestlers are large, airline pilots have good vision, and most professors are mentally competent. But on a subtle level, biological factors act through small and continuing effects on thoughts, feelings, and behavior. Arvey et al. (1989) found job satisfaction to be heritable, though they did not indicate the biological factors that are important or the pathways through which these factors operate.

Professions experienced a relative gain in occupational prestige over this 40 year period; however, professions did not gain as much in comparison to all occupations. In predicting 2005 occupational prestige between 1965 and 2005, the change in income, data and people-complex tasks, gender of incumbents, and the gender of the rater all impact the prestige that professions receive. Women’s increase in numerical representation within professions increases the 2005 prestige ratings of professions. In predicting 2005 prestige, female raters attributed significantly more and male respondents attributed significantly less prestige to professions. Gender significantly predicted the level of law an individual practiced and the distribution of gender across specializations also suggests that the legal specializations where many women work are less prestigious than men’s specializations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Death {{certificates}} are {{a potential}} source of sociodemographic data for decedents in epidemiologic research. However, because this information {{is provided by the}} next-of-kin or other proxies, there are concerns about validity. Our objective was to assess the agreement of job titles and occupational categories derived from death certificates with that self-reported in mid and later life. Methods Occupation was abstracted from 431 death certificates from North Carolina Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study participants who died between 1987 and 2001. Occupations were coded according to 1980 Bureau of Census job titles and then grouped into six 1980 <b>census</b> <b>occupational</b> categories. This information was compared with the self-reported occupation at midlife as reported at the baseline examination (1987 – 89). We calculated percent agreement using standard methods. Chance-adjusted agreement was assessed by kappa coefficients, with 95 % confidence intervals. Results Agreement between death certificate and self-reported job titles was poor (32 %), while 67 % of occupational categories matched the two sources. Kappa coefficients ranged from 0. 53 for technical/sales/administrative jobs to 0. 68 for homemakers. Agreement was lower, albeit nonsignificant, for women (kappa = 0. 54, 95 % Confidence Interval, CI = 0. 44 – 0. 63) than men (kappa = 0. 62, 95 % CI = 0. 54 – 0. 69) and for African-Americans (kappa = 0. 47, 95 % CI = 0. 34 – 0. 61) than whites (kappa = 0. 63, 95 % CI = 0. 57 – 0. 69) but varied only slightly by educational attainment. Conclusion While agreement between self- and death certificate reported job titles was poor, agreement between occupational categories was good. This suggests that while death certificates may not be a suitable source of occupational data where classification into specific job titles is essential, in the absence of other data, it is a reasonable source for constructing measures such as occupational SES that are based on grouped occupational data. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cet article explique comment les modèles Candide et Cofor peuvent être utilisés conjointement pour effectuer, à l'échelle d'une province, des prévisions d'emploi par {{profession}} dans chaque industrie. The authors {{present a}} review and {{an assessment of}} the Candide 1 and Cofor 2 models as instruments for estimating manpower requirements at the industry and provincial levels. In summary form the approach is as follows. Following upon a forecast of Real Domestic Product by industry generated by Candide, Cofor allows the preparation of estimates of total employment by industry at the national level by making use of productivity equations of the following form: In Y/L = f (T) where Y is Real Domestic Product, L is employment and T is a time trend. In certain instances K (capital stock) is used instead of T. Then total employment by industry is estimated at the provincial level by extrapolating the ratio of total employment in the industry by province to that at the national level. Finally employment by occupation is obtained by applying the 1971 <b>Census</b> <b>occupational</b> distribution of experienced labour force by industry at the provincial level. Adjustments are made for death and retirement rates as observed at the all industry and Canada levels. The paper then illustrates the use of the models with results obtained for the Canadian industrial chemicals and Québec textiles and total Québec industries. Comments are then made concerning the strenght and weaknesses of the models. Among these are: 1) The use of average productivity estimates to examine manpower requirements in industries contemplating large scale projects. 2) An implicit hypothesis to the effect that capacity is utilized fully. 3) The aging of the occupational distributions, and the use of experienced labour force rather than employment in the analysis of occupational distributions. 4) Estimates for both sexes together rather than by sex. 5) Lack of adjustments to reflect the age-experience profiles by industry. 6) Lack of adjustment for recent significant increases in turnover rates. 7) Insufficient adjustment for cyclical effects. 8) Inadequate disaggregation at the provincial level, etc [...] 1 Canadian Disaggregated Interdepartmental Econometric Model operated by the Economic Council of Canada. 2 Canadian Occupational Forecasting Model developed and operated by the Canadian Department of Manpower and Immigration...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{an overview of}} fatal and nonfatal injuries reported to MSHA during 1986 - 1995. Reportable injuries follow the criteria for reporting specified in 30 CFR 50. These criteria are listed in appendix A. The data used for these analyses came from the MSHA accident, injury, and illness data closeout files for the years 1986 - 1995. The MSHA data are described in appendix A and methods used in data analysis in appendix B. There may be slight discrepancies between the figures presented here and other presentations of MSHA data for the following reasons: (1) injuries to nonemployees have been excluded from analysis; and (2) injuries identified by MSHA after the files were closed out are not included. Within the MSHA data, {{there are differences in}} reporting requirements for operators and contractors. Contractors are required to report only those injuries that occur during certain categories of work (described in appendix A). For this reason, data on injuries among employees of operators and contractors in the MSHA database should not be considered directly comparable. As discussed in the "Introduction," the MSHA data on fatal injuries differ from the CFOI data (chapter 1) because of varying definitions used for the mining industry. As compared to the CFOI data, MSHA data exclude injuries that occurred off of mine property and include injuries occurring at mills and processing plants on mine property. Tables 4 - 1 through 4 - 9 and figure 4 - 1 provide comparisons of injury frequencies and rates among the commodities. These comparisons are followed by sections 4 A through 4 E, which provide more detailed tables and figures for each commodity separately. The method used to calculate injury rates is described in appendix B. Since denominator data for occupations (lob titles) were available for 1986 only, estimates of rates by occupation for the entire 10 year period are based on extrapolation from 1986 data. For this reason, estimates of injury by occupation should be interpreted with caution. Fatal Injuries A total of 1, 078 fatal on-the-job injuries were reported to MSHA during the 10 -year period 1986 - 1995. The average annual fatal injury rate for all commodities combined during this period was 30. 9 per 100, 000 full-time equivalent workers. Mine operators accounted for 908 (84 %) of the fatalities and had an average annual fatal injury rate of 28. 2 per 100, 000. While mine contractors comprised only 16 % (n = 170) {{of the total number of}} fatalities, their average annual fatal injury rate was 2. 3 times higher than that of mine operators (65. 0 per 100, 000). Table 4 - 1 presents the number and rates of fatal injuries by commodity for operators and contractors. Contractors in metal, nonmetal, stone, and sand and gravel are grouped together, since MSHA data on employment were not available for rate calculations for these commodities separately. The highest average annual fatality rate for the period, 66. 5 per 100, 000, occurred among metal and nonmetallic mineral mining contractors, followed closely by coal contractors (63. 1 per 100, 000). Among mine operators, the highest average annual fatal injury rate was in coal (38. 9 per 100, 000); the lowest was in nonmetal (14. 3 per 100, 000). Table 4 - 2 shows the average annual fatal injury rate by type of operation for each commodity for mine operators only. Of commodities with underground mines, all except stone had higher fatality rates at underground than at surface operations of these mines. The highest fatality rate for any operation occurred in surface operations at underground stone mines (124. 5 fatal injuries per 100, 000 workers). Stone had the second highest fatality rate for underground operations at underground mines (77. 9 per 100, 000). The highest rate for underground operations at underground mines occurred in metal (87. 6 per 100, 000). Table 4 - 3 shows the number and rate of fatal injuries by U. S.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an empirical}} {{investigation into the}} distributive effects of over- and under-education, defined as market outcomes such that some workers possess skills over or below those required at their jobs respectively. This type of market failure can arise in assignment and search equilibrium settings, {{as well as in}} the presence of asymmetric information regarding workers 2 ̆ 7 performance on the job. The existence of permanent and sizable mismatch rates means that returns to education are depressed for over-educated workers and inflated for under-qualified workers. Thus, irreversible decisions to invest in human capital are made in a context of uncertainty regarding the exact outcomes that might arise. As in the Todaro model, where individuals decide whether to migrate to cities based on the expected values of the available alternatives, workers might decide it is worthwhile to keep investing in education even if the probability of finding appropriate employment is falling. The three chapters of the dissertation are entitled: 2 ̆ 2 Skill Mismatch and Earnings: A Panel analysis of the U. S. Labor Market, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Earnings Inequality and Skill Mismatch in the U. S: 1973 – 2003, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Employment and Distribution Effects of Changes in the Minimum Wage. 2 ̆ 2 ^ Skill mismatch and earnings: A panel analysis of the U. S. labor market. This chapter examines the effect on earnings induced by a mismatch between workers 2 ̆ 7 skills and the skills actually required on the job. It uses the Current Population Survey (CPS) for the period 1983 – 2002. The special re-interview methodology of the CPS is used to create a large panel, so that individual heterogeneity can be controlled for. Skill requirements are estimated by the median education level for each 3 -digit occupation in the 1980 <b>census</b> <b>occupational</b> classification. The analysis, including the determination of skill requirements, is conducted for males and females separately. Cross-sectional analysis confirms the findings in the recent literature. Returns to required schooling are higher than the returns to attained education in standard earnings regressions. Also, for workers with similar educational attainment, over-education reduces earnings and under-education increases them. Contrary to what other studies have found, we conclude that these results are confirmed after controlling for individual fixed effects. The chapter also investigates which groups are more exposed to mismatch. I use standard probit analysis with over-education and under-education as the respective dependent variables. Women, service sector, and non-unionized workers appear to have higher probabilities of mismatch. ^ Earnings inequality and skill mismatch. This chapter shows that skill mismatch is a significant source of inequality in real earnings in the U. S. and that a substantial fraction of the increase in wage dispersion during the period 1973 – 2002 was due to the increase in mismatch rates and mismatch premia. Standard human capital earnings regressions that do not decompose the education variable into required, surplus, and deficit years provide biased estimates of the relative importance of education in explaining earnings inequality. In 2000 – 2002 surplus and deficit qualifications taken together accounted for 4 : 3 and 4 : 6 percent of the variance in earnings, or around 15 percent of the total explained variance. The dramatic increase in over-education rates and premia accounts for around 11 and 32 percent of the increase in the coefficient of variation of log earnings during the 30 years under analysis for males and females respectively. Residual inequality is slightly diminished when the estimating equation allows the prices of surplus, required and deficit qualifications to differ but the well-studied increasing trend of within-group inequality remains otherwise unchanged. Changes in the composition of the labor force are found to be important predictors of increasing residual inequality even when skill mismatch is taken into account. ^ The distributive effects of the minimum wage: An efficiency wage model with skill mismatch (co-authored with Peter Skott). This chapter analyzes the effect of changes in the real value of the minimum wage on the wage distribution. Changes in the minimum wage and other labor market institutions affect workers in all groups and empirically appear to be good complement to standard supply and demand arguments in explaining overall inequality. We use an efficiency wage model but allow for mismatch between jobs and workers. This framework yields predictions not only on the skill premium but also on the extent of inequality within groups. To keep matters as simple as possible, we assume that high-skill workers can get two types of jobs (good and bad), whereas low-skill workers have only one type of employment opportunity (bad). As long as some matches of high-skill workers and bad jobs are sustained in equilibrium, changes in the exogenous variables will affect not only wages and employment rates but also the degree of mismatch. Thus, this paper shows that 2 ̆ 7 over-education 2 ̆ 7 can be generated endogenously in efficiency wage models and that a fall in the real value of the minimum wage can (i) reduce total employment, (ii) lead to a simultaneous decline in both the relative employment and the relative wage of low-skill workers, and (iii) produce a rise in within-group as well as between-group inequality. Evidence from the US suggests that these theoretical results are empirically relevant. ...|$|R
