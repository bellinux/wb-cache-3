5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, <b>overfitting,</b> and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the related}} concept of <b>overfitting,</b> {{excessively}} complex models {{are affected by}} statistical noise (a problem {{also known as the}} bias-variance trade-off), whereas simpler models may capture the underlying structure better and may thus have better predictive performance. It is, however, often difficult to deduce which part of the data is noise (cf. model selection, test set, minimum description length, Bayesian inference, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Data mining can unintentionally be misused, and {{can then}} produce results which {{appear to be}} significant; but which do not {{actually}} predict future behaviour and cannot be reproduced on a new sample of data and bear little use. Often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing. A simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as <b>overfitting,</b> but the same problem can arise at different phases {{of the process and}} thus a train/test split - when applicable at all - may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening.|$|E
25|$|Ridge regression, {{and other}} forms of penalized {{estimation}} such as Lasso regression, deliberately introduce bias into the estimation of Î² {{in order to reduce the}} variability of the estimate. The resulting estimators generally have lower mean squared error than the OLS estimates, particularly when multicollinearity is present or when <b>overfitting</b> is a problem. They are generally used when the goal is to predict the value of the response variable y for values of the predictors x that have not yet been observed. These methods are not as commonly used when the goal is inference, since it is difficult to account for the bias.|$|E
25|$|Applications whose goal is {{to create}} a system that generalizes well to unseen examples, face the {{possibility}} of over-training. This arises in convoluted or over-specified systems when the capacity of the network significantly exceeds the needed free parameters. Two approaches address over-training. The first is to use cross-validation and similar techniques to check for the presence of over-training and optimally select hyperparameters to minimize the generalization error. The second is to use some form of regularization. This concept emerges in a probabilistic (Bayesian) framework, where regularization can be performed by selecting a larger prior probability over simpler models; but also in statistical learning theory, where the {{goal is to}} minimize over two quantities: the 'empirical risk' and the 'structural risk', which roughly corresponds to the error over the training set and the predicted error in unseen data due to <b>overfitting.</b>|$|E
500|$|Deep {{learning}} is a branch of machine learning that models high level abstractions in data by using a deep graph with many processing layers. According to the Universal approximation theorem, deep-ness isn't necessary for a neural network {{to be able to}} approximate arbitrary continuous functions. Even so, there are many problems that are common to shallow networks (such as <b>overfitting)</b> that deep networks help avoid. As such, deep neural networks are able to realistically generate much more complex models as compared to their shallow counterparts.|$|E
2500|$|Because such models {{may have}} as many as [...] {{parameter}}s, <b>overfitting</b> may be an issue. [...] Some common choices that reduce the parameter space are: ...|$|E
2500|$|The term P-spline {{stands for}} [...] "penalized B-spline". It refers {{to using the}} B-spline {{representation}} where the coefficients are determined partly by the data to be fitted, and partly by an additional penalty function that aims to impose smoothness to avoid <b>overfitting.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{final step}} of {{knowledge}} discovery from data is {{to verify that}} the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set. This is called <b>overfitting.</b> To overcome this, the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this test set, and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish [...] "spam" [...] from [...] "legitimate" [...] emails would be trained on a training set of sample e-mails. Once trained, the learned patterns would {{be applied to the}} test set of e-mails on which it had not been trained. The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify. A number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm, such as ROC curves.|$|E
2500|$|ABC {{can be used}} {{to infer}} {{problems}} in high-dimensional parameter spaces, although one should account for the possibility of <b>overfitting</b> (e.g., see the model selection methods in [...] and [...] ). However, the probability of accepting the simulated values for the parameters under a given tolerance with the ABC rejection algorithm typically decreases exponentially with increasing dimensionality of the parameter space (due to the global acceptance criterion). Although no computational method (based on ABC or not) seems to be able to break the curse-of-dimensionality, methods have recently been developed to handle high-dimensional parameter spaces under certain assumptions (e.g., based on polynomial approximation on sparse grids, which could potentially heavily reduce the simulation times for ABC). However, the applicability of such methods is problem dependent, and the difficulty of exploring parameter spaces should in general not be underestimated. For example, the introduction of deterministic global parameter estimation led to reports that the global optima obtained in several previous studies of low-dimensional problems were incorrect. For certain problems, it might therefore be difficult to know whether the model is incorrect or, as discussed above, whether the explored region of the parameter space is inappropriate. A more pragmatic approach is to cut the scope of the problem through model reduction.|$|E
2500|$|Linearity. [...] This {{means that}} {{the mean of the}} {{response}} variable is a linear combination of the parameters (regression coefficients) and the predictor variables. [...] Note that this assumption is much less restrictive than it may at first seem. [...] Because the predictor variables are treated as fixed values (see above), linearity is really only a restriction on the parameters. [...] The predictor variables themselves can be arbitrarily transformed, and in fact multiple copies of the same underlying predictor variable can be added, each one transformed differently. [...] This trick is used, for example, in polynomial regression, which uses linear regression to fit the response variable as an arbitrary polynomial function (up to a given rank) of a predictor variable. This makes linear regression an extremely powerful inference method. [...] In fact, models such as polynomial regression are often [...] "too powerful", in that they tend to overfit the data. [...] As a result, some kind of regularization must typically be used to prevent unreasonable solutions coming out of the estimation process. [...] Common examples are ridge regression and lasso regression. [...] Bayesian linear regression can also be used, which by its nature is more or less immune to the problem of <b>overfitting.</b> (In fact, ridge regression and lasso regression can both be viewed as [...] special cases of Bayesian linear regression, with particular types of prior distributions placed on the regression coefficients.) ...|$|E

50|$|In {{statistics}} and machine learning, apophenia {{is an example}} of what is known as <b>overfitting.</b> <b>Overfitting</b> occurs when a statistical model fits the noise rather than the signal. The model overfits the particular data or observations rather than fitting a generalizable pattern in a general population.|$|E
50|$|The {{methods for}} {{controlling}} <b>overfitting</b> differ between NPMR and the generalized linear modeling (GLMs). The most popular <b>overfitting</b> controls for GLMs are the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for model selection. The AIC and BIC {{depend on the}} number of parameters in a model. Because NPMR models do not have explicit parameters as such, these are not directly applicable to NPMR models. Instead, one can control <b>overfitting</b> by setting a minimum average neighborhood size, minimum data:predictor ratio, and a minimum improvement required to add a predictor to a model.|$|E

5000|$|AICc is {{essentially}} AIC {{with a greater}} penalty for extra parameters.

5000|$|Criticisms of EWA include <b>overfitting</b> due to many parameters, lack of {{generality}} over games, and {{the possibility}} that the interpretation of EWA parameters may be difficult. <b>Overfitting</b> is addressed by estimating parameters on some of the experimental periods or experimental subjects and forecasting behavior in the remaining sample (if models are <b>overfitting,</b> these out-of-sample validation forecasts will be much less accurate than in-sample fits, which they generally are not). Generality in games is addressed by replacing fixed parameters with [...] "self-tuning" [...] functions of experience, allowing pseudo-parameters to change {{over the course of a}} game and to also vary systematically across games.|$|E
