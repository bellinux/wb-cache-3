After that financial analysis that includes analysis of three major financial statements was carried out, as well as calculation basic ratio indicators and the resulting appreciation of the financial health of the company.

These differences are most clearly demonstrated between the first category and fourth category. In the first category, the campaign led to the shutting down of privately run coal mines, indicating that privately run coal mines received rather poor property rights protection. Firstly, private coal mines in these provinces were not only deprived of industry access, but they had to face either closure or merger with a state-owned coal mine. Secondly, concerning <b>price</b> <b>valuation</b> and compensation, since the owners of privately run coal mines did not have any choice in the matter, they did not receive the same kind of consultation conditions as government or state-owned coal mines did.

40|$|In recent years, {{the initial}} public offerings (IPOs) on the Ghana Stock Exchange (GSE) {{witnessed}} some level of undersubscriptions.

The research was informed by the <b>valuation</b> and <b>pricing</b> framework of Roosenboom. The research questions addressed whether IPOs on the GSE were under/overpriced and whether the projected and pre-issue financials were free from forecasting errors and earnings management. A cross-sectional, explanatory research design was employed to examine a dataset of 30 sampled IPOs. The dataset, obtained from IPO prospectuses, trading data, and financial statements, was analyzed using both logistic and multiple regressions. IPO valuation methods, first-day returns (R(1 st day)), absolute forecast errors (AFE), and discretionary current accruals (DCA) served as dependent variables and firm characteristics of size, age, profitability, dividends, price-to-value (P/V) ratios, owner-manager, and auditors 2 ̆ 7 reputation served as independent variables. Results revealed that firm characteristics were not significant predictors of the choice of IPO valuation methods, IPOs were underpriced and their R(1 st day) were significantly predicted by P/V ratios, the financial projections were over forecasted and their AFE were not predicted by the independent variables, and the pre-IPO financials experienced earnings management and their DCA were significantly explained by the owner-manager variable.

30|$|In {{order to}} ease the heavy burden on the RSU, we {{introduce}} an auction-based cooperative authentication mechanism. The cooperative authentication will be triggered once {{the number of the}} RSU’s received messages is beyond a threshold TH. First, the RSU calculates a cost price CP (CP is the amount that the RSU can afford for the entire authentication service)[38] and then broadcasts a request message to all vehicles in M for cooperation. Let the set of ID of messages waiting to be authenticated at RSU at time t be L_RSU^t, L_RSU^t = {mid}. For the sake of communication efficiency, the RSU will only include L_RSU^t in the request message instead of the entire message contents. Vehicles that have received the request message will {{decide whether or not to}} participate in cooperative authentication. Each vehicle vRID will cross-check the ID of its authenticated messages and L_RSU^t to see whether there exists overlap. If there happens to exist messages in L_RSU^t authenticated by vRID, vRID will calculate a <b>valuation</b> <b>price</b> eRID (eRID is the vehicle’s valuation of a single message). There are many factors affecting the <b>valuation</b> <b>price</b> eRID of a vehicle, such as the resource consuming and privacy exposing. Here, we omit the details of pricing scheme and follow the mainstream work [38, 39]. Let L_RID^t be the set of ID of overlapped messages between L_RSU^t and the messages authenticated by vRID. Let bRID be the bid price of a single message that vRID asks for. Thus, vRID will participate in auction announcing that it can authenticate messages in L_RID^t with a price bRID for each message. In order to prevent market distortion, we assume that each vehicle uses its true valuation in the auction, i.e., bRID=eRID. In addition, we assume that each vehicle can only bid once at an auction. After receiving bids from vehicles, the RSU will select vehicles for cooperation and compute the corresponding payment.|$|R
40|$|MBA thesisThe {{value of}} a brand can be {{difficult}} to measure since it is an intangible asset and it is only since the early 1980 s that brand valuation has gained importance in terms of inclusion in business valuation (Kapferer, 1997). As brand valuation has become more acceptable Wyner (2001) has raised some concerns regarding the use of the correct model for the correct purpose during calculations. With twenty-two brand valuation approaches highlighted by Abratt and Bick (2003) it can be difficult for marketers to know which approach is suitable for their specific objective. This study reviewed different methods of measuring brand equity in an organisation in a South African context and evaluated the suitability of various brand equity valuation approaches to specific brand <b>valuation</b> <b>objectives.</b> Data was collected using the financial statements for the case site and by conducting semi-structured interviews to, in part, explore brand <b>valuation</b> <b>objectives</b> and brand <b>valuation</b> approach selection. This study confirmed the role of the brand as a resource that can provide a firm with a sustained competitive advantage. It was found that the brand is a valuable asset to firms and brand equity a measure of the value added by the brand. The study found that different brand <b>valuation</b> <b>objectives</b> influence the selection of a brand valuation approach. This study provides a guide in terms of available brand valuation approaches categorised by broad brand <b>valuation</b> <b>objectives</b> and provides a process for South African firms to follow when attempting brand valuation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the paper is to correct a {{commonly}} mistaken notion that an Asian option is always cheaper than its plain vanilla European counterpart in a general setting. Design/methodology/approach – The paper shows that by letting volatility go to zero, the lower bounds of Asian options and vanilla options are derived. Those bounds are then compared. Findings – The paper finds that the notion can be violated for call options when the dividend yield of the underlying stock {{is higher than the}} interest rate, as well as for put options when the dividend yield of the underlying stock is lower than the interest rate. Research limitations/implications – The approach used in this paper, boundary analysis, can be applied to other exotic options.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} how public goods may {{be incorporated into}} a cost-of-living index. When public goods are weak complements to a market good, quality-adjusted prices for the market good capture all the welfare information required. They are also consistent with a Laspeyres index that maintains the bound on a true cost-of-living index. The paper recovers this information from a discrete-choice model, using a simulation routine to solve for the appropriate price adjustments. These concepts are applied {{to the case of}} housing, education, crime, and air quality in Los Angeles for 1989 to 1994. Over a period of time when they are improving, incorporating pubic goods into the index lowers the estimated change in the cost of living by 0. 5 to 2. 6 percentage points. In other years, when public goods diverge, the estimated annual adjustment differs by model, with a range of - 0. 2 to + 1. 3 percentage points. air quality, discrete choice models, green accounting, nonmarket <b>valuation,</b> <b>price</b> inde...|$|R
