40|$|Ultraviolet {{spectra of}} the {{peculiar}} eclipsing binary Epsilon Aurigae (FO Ia + ?) were obtained with the International Ultraviolet Explorer at pre-eclipse and ingress partial phases. The results show a wavelength {{dependence of the}} eclipse {{in contrast to the}} grayness (non-wavelength dependence) of the eclipse observed in visible light. From the current results, incorporating previous observations, it is suggested that: (1) the <b>obscuration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the F supergiant by the disk proposed by Huang (1965) is the result of electron scattering in visible light; (2) the increase in the eclipse depths toward shorter wavelengths observed in the ultraviolet is caused by dust; and (3) the temperature of the disk is in the range from 1000 to 2000 K...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{choppers}} with rotating {{wheels are}} some of the most used macroscopic optomechatronic devices for the controlled modulation, attenuation or <b>obscuration</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in a wide area of applications. We discuss and compare the modulation functions produced by two types of chopper wheels: the classical device, with windows with linear edges, and the eclipse chopper (with windows with circular edges) that, to the best of our knowledge, we have introduced. This discussion is based on the analysis and the design we have previously developed for these various devices, for top-hat (constant over the entire section) light beam distributions. While the comparison of the different shapes of transmitted signals allows for the proper choice of the most appropriate device and parameters to obtain the modulation function that is fit for a certain application, the present work also presents the mechanical setup we have designed and manufactured for testing choppers with rotating wheels. A series of prototype wheels with different, optimized profiles were obtained for the purpose. The simulation and the electro-erosion programs for the wire electro-erosion of aluminum plates to manufacture the wheels are presented. An advantageous double wheel solution has been developed to obtain wheels with windows of different shapes and sizes, and the testing of this final assembly concludes the study...|$|R
5000|$|Optical beam smoke {{detectors}} consist {{of at least}} one light transmitter and one receiver, which is photosensitive. The photosensitive receiver monitors light produced by the transmitter under normal conditions. In the absence <b>of</b> smoke, <b>light</b> passes from the light transmitter to the receiver in a straight line. In a fire, when smoke falls within the path of the beam detector, some <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> is absorbed or scattered by the smoke particles.

40|$|We study {{properties}} of the host galaxies of 15 hard X-ray selected type- 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at intermediate redshifts (0. 05 < z < 0. 6) detected in ASCA surveys. The absorption corrected hard X-ray luminosities L 2 − 10 keV range from 10 42 erg s − 1 to 10 45 erg s − 1. We took the R-band image of these AGNs with the University of Hawaii 2. 2 m telescope. Thanks to the intrinsic <b>obscuration</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>light,</b> we can decompose the galaxies with a spheroid component and a disk component. The resulting spheroid luminosities correlate with L 2 − 10 keV; higher (lower) X-ray luminosity AGNs tend to reside in luminous (less luminous) spheroids. It is {{also found that the}} hosts of luminous AGNs show a large spheroidto-disk luminosity ratio (∼ 1), while those of less luminous AGNs spread between 0 and 1. The correlation between L 2 − 10 keV and spheroid luminosity indicates that the relation between mass of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) and spheroid luminosity (BS-relation) agrees with that in the local universe if the Eddington ratio of 0. 24 is adopted, which is a mean value determined from our ASCA type- 1 AGN sample at similar redshifts through the broad-line width and continuum luminosity. The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of using type- 2 AGNs at high redshifts to study their host properties.

40|$|The role of star-formation driven {{outflows}} in the <b>obscuration</b> <b>of</b> {{the central}} source in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is discussed. The outflow from a sub-parsec scale accretion disc is numerically modelled for parameters {{appropriate to the}} Galactic Centre. The resulting obscuration pattern is very patchy, with some lines of sight becoming optically thick to Thomson scattering. A fixed observer would see column depth changing by factors of many over time scales ranging from months to hundreds of years, depending on the physical size of the outflow region. Such winds may be relevant for the <b>obscuration</b> <b>of</b> some AGN, especially "changing look AGN". The winds are Thomson-thick for outflow rates exceeding the Eddington accretion rate limit, which may be satisfied in strong near-AGN starbursts as observed in a few nearby galactic nuclei.

We present the discovery of a gas-rich, star-forming galaxy at z = 2. 48 through the detection of CO J = 1 - 0 line emission in the COLDz survey and through a sensitive, Ka-band (31 - 39 GHz) VLA survey of a 6. 5 arcmin 2 region of the COSMOS field. We argue that the broad line (FWHM 570 &# 0177; 80 km s&# 8211; 1) is most likely to be CO J = 1 - 0 at z = 2. 48, as the integrated emission is spatially coincident with an infrared-detected galaxy with a photometric redshift estimate of z phot = 3. 2 &# 0177; 0. 4.
