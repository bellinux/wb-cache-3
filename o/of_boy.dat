5|$|Born {{to a lower}} middle-class {{family in}} Etterbeek, Brussels, Hergé began his career by {{contributing}} illustrations to Scouting magazines, developing his first comic series, The Adventures of Totor, for Le Boy-Scout Belge in 1926. Working for the conservative Catholic newspaper Le Vingtième Siècle, he created The Adventures of Tintin in 1929 {{on the advice of}} its editor Norbert Wallez. Revolving around the actions <b>of</b> <b>boy</b> reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, the series' early instalments – Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, Tintin in the Congo, and Tintin in America – were designed as conservative propaganda for children. Domestically successful, after serialisation the stories were published in book form, with Hergé continuing the series and also developing both the Quick & Flupke and Jo, Zette and Jocko series for Le Vingtième Siècle. Influenced by his friend Zhang Chongren, from 1934 Hergé placed far greater emphasis on conducting background research for his stories, resulting in increased realism from The Blue Lotus onward. Following the German occupation of Belgium in 1940, Le Vingtième Siècle was closed but Hergé continued his series in Le Soir, a popular newspaper controlled by the Nazi administration.|$|E

Hence, this paper suggests ways in which pedagogies directed towards the specifics <b>of</b> <b>boys</b> 2 ̆ 7 education can improve the educational experiences <b>of</b> girls, <b>boys</b> and teachers. In the process it also notes some of the dangers of a take up of the productive pedagogies model with boys without a demonstrated commitment to gender justice...|$|R
