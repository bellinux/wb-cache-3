5|$|NGC 678 and NGC 680 are a pair {{of galaxies}} in Aries that are only about 200,000 light-years apart. Part of the NGC 691 group of galaxies, both are at a {{distance}} of approximately 130 million light-years. NGC 678 is an edge-on spiral galaxy that is 4.5 by 0.8 arcminutes. NGC 680, an elliptical galaxy with an asymmetrical boundary, is the brighter of the two at magnitude 12.9; NGC 678 has a magnitude of 13.35. Both galaxies have bright cores, but NGC 678 is the larger galaxy at a diameter of 171,000 light-years; NGC 680 has a diameter of 72,000 light-years. NGC 678 is further distinguished by its prominent dust lane. NGC 691 itself is a spiral galaxy slightly inclined to <b>our</b> <b>line</b> of sight. It has multiple spiral arms and a bright core. Because it is so diffuse, it has a low surface brightness. It has a diameter of 126,000 light-years and is 124 million light-years away. NGC 877 is the brightest member of an 8-galaxy group that also includes NGC 870, NGC 871, and NGC 876, with a magnitude of 12.53. It is 2.4 by 1.8 arcminutes and is 178 million light-years away with a diameter of 124,000 light-years. Its companion is NGC 876, which is about 103,000 light-years from the core of NGC 877. They are interacting gravitationally, as they are connected by a faint stream of gas and dust. Arp 276 is a different pair of interacting galaxies in Aries, consisting of NGC 935 and IC 1801.|$|E
25|$|The {{emission}} lines seen on {{the spectrum}} of a Seyfert galaxy may come {{from the surface of}} the accretion disc itself, or may come from clouds of gas illuminated by the central engine in an ionization cone. The exact geometry of the emitting region is difficult to determine due to poor resolution of the galactic center. However, each part of the accretion disc has a different velocity relative to <b>our</b> <b>line</b> of sight, and the faster the gas is rotating around the black hole, the broader the emission line will be. Similarly, an illuminated disc wind also has a position-dependent velocity.|$|E
25|$|Disks around {{brown dwarfs}} {{have been found}} to have many of the same {{features}} as disks around stars; therefore, it is expected that there will be accretion-formed planets around brown dwarfs. Given the small mass of brown dwarf disks, most planets will be terrestrial planets rather than gas giants. If a giant planet orbits a brown dwarf across <b>our</b> <b>line</b> of sight, then, because they have approximately the same diameter, this would give a large signal for detection by transit. The accretion zone for planets around a brown dwarf is very close to the brown dwarf itself, so tidal forces would have a strong effect.|$|E

Because <b>our</b> <b>lines</b> in wood must be thick, {{it becomes}} an extreme virtue in wood {{engraving}} to economize lines,--not merely, as in all other art, to save time and power, but because, <b>our</b> <b>lines</b> being necessarily blunt, we must make up our minds to do with fewer, by many, than are in the object.

25|$|This {{definition}} for addition works {{except in a}} few special cases related to the point at infinity and intersection multiplicity. The first is {{when one of the}} points is O. Here, we define P + O = P = O + P, making O the identity of the group. Next, if P and Q are opposites of each other, we define P + Q = O. Lastly, if P = Q we only have one point, thus we can't define the line between them. In this case, we use the tangent line to the curve at this point as <b>our</b> <b>line.</b> In most cases, the tangent will intersect a second point R and we can take its opposite. However, if P happens to be an inflection point (a point where the concavity of the curve changes), we take R to be P itself and P + P is simply the point opposite itself.|$|E
25|$|At low luminosities, {{the objects}} to be unified are Seyfert galaxies. The {{unification}} models propose that in Seyfert 1s the observer {{has a direct}} view of the active nucleus. In Seyfert 2s the nucleus is observed through an obscuring structure which prevents a direct view of the optical continuum, broad-line region or (soft) X-ray emission. The key insight of orientation-dependent accretion models {{is that the two}} types of object can be the same if only certain angles to the line of sight are observed. The standard picture is of a torus of obscuring material surrounding the accretion disc. It must be large enough to obscure the broad-line region but not large enough to obscure the narrow-line region, which is seen in both classes of object. Seyfert 2s are seen through the torus. Outside the torus there is material that can scatter some of the nuclear emission into <b>our</b> <b>line</b> of sight, allowing us to see some optical and X-ray continuum and, in some cases, broad emission linesâ€”which are strongly polarized, showing that they have been scattered and proving that some Seyfert 2s really do contain hidden Seyfert 1s. Infrared observations of the nuclei of Seyfert 2s also support this picture.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle for}} No.3 Post seemed {{a major event}} to those involved, but in General Ian Hamilton's dispatches the fight only {{received}} a brief mention: [...] "On 28 May, at 9 p.m., a raid was made on a Turkish post overlooking the beach 1,200 yards north of Kaba Tepe, H.M.S. [...] "Rattlesnake" [...] co-operating. A party of 50 rifles rushed the post, killing or capturing the occupants. A similar raid was made against an enemy trench {{to the left of}} <b>our</b> <b>line</b> which cost the Turks 200 casualties, as was afterwards ascertained." ...|$|E

A Canadian volunteer, John Richardson, who had marched with the 41st Regiment of Foot, later wrote, [...] "On the 22nd, before daybreak, came {{within sight of}} the enemy... such was their security and negligence that... <b>our</b> <b>line</b> was actually half formed within musket shot of their defenses before they were even aware of our presence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Binary {{stars are}} often {{detected}} optically, {{in which case}} they are called visual binaries. [...] Many visual binaries have long orbital periods of several centuries or millennia and therefore have orbits which are uncertain or poorly known. [...] They may also be detected by indirect techniques, such as spectroscopy (spectroscopic binaries) or astrometry (astrometric binaries). [...] If a binary star happens to orbit in a plane along <b>our</b> <b>line</b> of sight, its components will eclipse and transit each other; these pairs are called eclipsing binaries, or, as they are detected by their changes in brightness during eclipses and transits, photometric binaries.|$|E

2500|$|On the Confederate right flank, Jones's brigade of Virginians had {{the most}} {{difficult}} terrain to cross, the steepest part of Culp's Hill.

Their charges were beaten off with relative ease by the 60th New York, which suffered very few casualties. Confederate casualties were high, including General Jones, who was wounded and left the field. One of the New York officers wrote [...] "without breastworks <b>our</b> <b>line</b> would have been swept away in an instant by the hailstorm of bullets and the flood of men." ...|$|E

The square pond next to the line is the site of Turf engine house. This stretch of the line used to have long water troughs between the rails from which steam locomotives could refill their water tanks without stopping.|$|E

There seemed to be no end to the line. There they stood in double ranks within forty feet of us. They were well mounted and admirably armed. How they got there in our {{immediate}} rear I know not, and from what direction they came I have never learned. The fact is, they were there in overpowering numbers, with pistol or gun ready to do damage upon the least show of resistance.
