5|$|The first {{drinking}} age law in New Jersey {{was passed}} in 1846. It allowed the parents <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> under 21 to sue for up to $10 ($ in modern dollars) in damages against a tavern keeper or shopkeeper who supplied alcoholic beverages to their children. In 1880, a criminal statute was enacted, fining businesses that sold liquor to people under 18 if their parents had told the establishment not to sell to their child. The law was amended in 1888 to eliminate the parental consent provision, thus making it illegal in all cases for a tavern or liquor store to sell alcohol to person under 18. In 1908, the penalties were increased so that a tavern keeper who served a minor could be jailed. Upon the start of Prohibition, New Jersey repealed its laws regarding the sale of alcohol to minors since the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited almost all liquor sales.|$|E
5|$|The {{first floor}} of the {{building}} was built as a grand 1,200-seat auditorium with a proscenium stage, and meeting rooms dedicated to student organizations. The second floor consisted of a U-shaped balcony and the Old Council Room, a gathering space for smaller organizations. The Old Council Room was repainted in 1945 as part of a minor renovation of the building that also included the opening <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>student</b> eatery called The Hoot on the west side. The ceiling was made from decorated plaster and dentils evoked the exterior neoclassical architectural style. The basement housed several offices and later a bicycle exchange, used bookshop, and student storage space. After the 1973 renovation, dishwashing equipment for the ACDC was housed upstairs, along with staff offices. The 2003 renovation saw the removal of this dishwashing equipment; instead, the second upstairs was repurposed as a multifunctional student space, in line with the original intentions for the building. The second story—called UpC—is now an open space capable of seating 600 people when chairs are added; it also features multimedia equipment and a third-floor mezzanine that, until 2015, housed the UpC Cafe.|$|E
