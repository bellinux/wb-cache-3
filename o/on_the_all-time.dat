5|$|Gilchrist's attacking batting {{has been}} {{a key part of}} Australia's one-day success, as he usually opened the batting. He {{was a part of the}} {{successful}} 1999, 2003 and 2007 Cricket World Cup campaigns. Gilchrist's Test batting average in the upper 40s is unusually high for a wicket-keeper. He is currently 45th <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>all–time</b> list of highest batting averages. He maintains a Test strike-rate of 82 runs per hundred balls, the highest since balls were recorded in full.

He is second <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>all-time</b> list of most sixes in Tests at 100 with only Brendon McCullum ahead of him with 107. Gilchrist's skills as a wicket-keeper are sometimes questioned; some people claim that he is the best keeper in Australia whilst others claim that Victorian wicket-keeper Darren Berry is the best Australian wicket-keeper of the 1990s and early 2000s.|$|E
