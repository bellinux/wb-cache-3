40|$|A new and {{efficient}} combination of signal tracing and block recognition techniques for circuit analysis is proposed. It utilizes {{the benefits of}} both approaches to solve problems such as signal flow or gate recognition. The analysis process is easily controlled by a user definable rule set where ports, nets and blocks are attributed with types. After structural investigation a hierarchical netlist is produced providing block information as subcircuits. As an important feature, the algorithm allows the handling of <b>optional</b> <b>ports</b> as well. Thus, this flexible approach is applicable to various circuit types and works on several abstraction levels. Classification Algorithm At several stages in a design flow the current statu...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this thesis is the {{liability}} of the sea carrier in the international carriage of goods by sea. Chapter One: discuses the nature of liability of the sea carrier under the Hague/Visby Rules and Hamburg Rules. The Hague/Visby Rules define the term “Carrier” as including the owner or the charterer who enters into contract of carriage with the shipper, while Hamburg Rules widen the definition to include any person by whom or on whose name contract of carriage of goods by sea has been concluded with a shipper. The Hague/Visby scheme of liability is built on specific obligations by which the carrier is bound, i. e. the obligation to issue a bill of lading, obligation to exercise due diligence, to provide a seaworthy ship and the obligation of care of cargo. The failure of the carrier in the fulfillment of the obligations will expose him to cargo claims by shippers or cargo owners in cases of loss or damage to cargo. He will be held as liable for damages unless he proves that he is exempted form liability by virtue {{of one of the}} seventeen exceptions provided for in Article IV. The most significant of them are: fire; perils of the sea; force majeure, nautical fault; acts and omissions of the shipper. Hamburg Rules introduce a relatively simple scheme of liability based on the “presumed fault” by the carrier his agents or servants. Thus in cases of loss or damage to cargo the carrier is held to be liable unless he proves that he, his servants and agents were not at fault. Chapter Two: considers the scope of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules. They cover bills of lading which are issued in contracting state or which incorporate the Rules by paramount clause. They cover the international outward carriage only. While under Hamburg Rules it is immaterial whether or not a bill of lading has been issued. The Rules cover contract of carriage concluded in a contracting state or if the port of loading or port of discharge is in a contracting state. Moreover if the <b>optional</b> <b>port</b> of discharge is in a contracting state. Similarly, it can be incorporated by paramount clause in the bill of lading. Hamburg Rules cover the inward and outward international carriage. The period of application under the Hague/Visby Rules is limited from the time of loading till the time of discharge, i. e. “tackle to tackle” period, while Hamburg Rules cover the entire voyage until the goods are handed over or put in disposal of the cargo owner. The Hague/Visby Rules do not provide for liability in cases of delay in delivery. They exclude the live animals and deck cargo from the definition of goods. While Hamburg Rules provide for liability of carrier in cases of delay in delivery. They bring all cargoes under their umbrella. Thus they provide for liability of the carrier in cases of live animals and deck cargo. Both conventions provide for liability for shipment of dangerous cargoes. The well known doctrine of deviation under the common law is still in use under the Hague/Visby Rules. It operates to hold the carrier as in a fundamental breach of contract unless he proves that he deviates to save life or property at sea. Hamburg Rules do not recognize the doctrine of deviation. Chapter Three: considers the limits of liability and limits of actions. The same system of calculating the limit of liability is valid under both conventions, i. e. the dual system of per package, per kilo. The former is for goods with high value compared to their weight, while the latter is suitable for bulk cargoes. Although the Hague/Visby Rules introduce a provision for calculating limit of liability in containerized goods, i. e. according to the items enumerated on the bill of lading, the position is still ambiguous. The unit of account is Poincare franc which is replaced by the additional Protocol ١٩٧٩ by the Special Drawing Right (SDR) and so forth under Hamburg Rules. The limits should be broken when the carrier is in default of negligence, recklessness or intentional acts. Moreover, the carrier cannot be benefited by the limits of liability under the Hague/Visby Rules if he is in default i. e. in cases of fundamental breach of contract such as deviations or stowage on deck without shippers consent...|$|E

5000|$|Vpp [...] - Programming mode voltage. This must be {{connected}} to the MCLR pin, or the Vpp pin of the <b>optional</b> ICSP <b>port</b> available on some large-pincount PICs. To put the PIC into programming mode, this line must be in a specified range that varies from PIC to PIC. For 5 V PICs, this is always some amount above Vdd, and can be as high as 13.5 V. The 3.3 V only PICs like the 18FJ, 24H, and 33F series use a special signature to enter programming mode and Vpp is a digital signal that is either at ground or Vdd. There is no one Vpp voltage that is within the valid Vpp range of all PICs. In fact, the minimum required Vpp level for some PICs can damage other PICs.|$|R

The original speakers came in Platinum gray to match Apple's desktop line, while the second generation were curvier and also came in a darker gray color designed to match the PowerBook line and PowerCD. Both were powered with an AC adapter and could be attached to any audio output source, with two separate inputs for the computer and an external CD player. Both had a headphone jack {{in the front of}} one speaker along with the volume control and an <b>optional</b> subwoofer connection <b>port</b> on some models.|$|R

40|$|SoC) {{designers}} to specify test systems in a generic way. As the IEEE 1500 Standard {{does not address}} the specification and design of the on-chip Test Access Mechanism (TAM), considerable effort may still be required if test engineers are to optimise testing SoCs with IEEE 1500 Wrapped Cores. This paper describes novel research activity based on the design of TAMs that are compatible with IEEE 1500 wrapped cores. Taking into account previous work on Test Resource Partitioning (TRP), functional testing using the system bus and TAM architectures, a novel approach is introduced that allows some elements of the system bus to be used as part of the TAM while retaining compatibility with the IEEE 1500 wrapped cores. A small microcontroller SoC design based on the AMBA APB bus is used to investigate this approach. A crucial element of this approach involves interfacing the combined TAM to the mandatory Wrapper Serial Port (WSP) and the <b>optional</b> Wrapper Parallel <b>Port</b> (WPP) of the IEEE 1500 wrapped cores in the chip. Test Application Time (TAT) results are presented that establish the viability of the ideas described, as well as comparative analysis of TAT results derived from a number of test structures based on these techniques.
