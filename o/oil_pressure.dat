5|$|After having {{held off}} {{for most of}} the race, the rain began to fall once more during the final three hours. This caused {{numerous}} incidents, including the No. 93 Autorlando Porsche missing a Mulsanne chicane and plowing through a temporary tire barrier.

5|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session {{was held on}} Friday before the two races. King was fastest {{with a time of}} 1:42.441, ten-hundredths of a second faster than teammate Alexander Rossi in second. Alex Lynn was third-fastest, ahead of Stoffel Vandoorne. Arthur Pic and Rio Haryanto were fifth and sixth. Gasly was seventh-fastest, Evans eighth, Raffaele Marciello ninth, and Matsushita completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Vandoorne's run ended prematurely with seven minutes of the session remaining when his car stopped due to an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> failure.|$|E
5|$|The third caution {{was given}} on lap ten; Tracy glanced the rear-right wheel of Servià's car heading into turn three which caused both drivers to spin and stall. De Ferran led at the lap-12 restart, ahead of Bräck and Franchitti. Bräck was {{overtaken}} by Franchitti {{for second place}} around {{the outside of the}} third turn on lap 18, while Tagliani passed Kanaan at the same corner one lap later. De Ferran continued to pull away {{from the rest of the}} field and held a 7.5 second lead over Franchitti by the 30th lap. The fourth caution came out two laps later when Takagi made contact with the side of Wilson at the entrance of turn three. Both cars spun with Takagi going into the outside tire barrier and Wilson went off into the run-off area with a broken suspension. Franchitti drove into the turn six run-off area to retire with an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> problem on the same lap caused by a lack of oil in his car. During the caution, most of the field made pit stops. Dixon moved from 17th to fifth and Junqueira went from 18th to seventh position because they made pit stops before the caution was displayed. Andretti moved up from 15th to tenth place. De Ferran led the lap-37 restart, and was followed by Tagliani, Bräck, Castroneves and Dixon.|$|E

40|$|Hydrodynamic journal {{bearings}} are critical power transmission components that are carrying increasingly high loads {{because of the}} increasing power density in various machines. Therefore, knowing the true operating conditions of hydrodynamic {{journal bearings}} is essential to machine design. <b>Oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> {{is one of the}} key operating parameters describing the operating conditions in hydrodynamic journal bearings. Measuring the <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> in bearings has been a demanding task and therefore the subject has been studied mainly by mathematical means. The aim of this study was to determine the <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> in real hydrodynamic journal bearings under realistic operating conditions. The study focused on engine bearings. Test rig experiments, simulations and calculations were carried out to determine the <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> and to understand its relationship with other operating parameters. The main test apparatus was a versatile bearing test rig with a hydraulic loading system. The operating ranges of the bearings were determined by a novel method and the friction loss was determined by a heat flow analysis. The <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> was measured by optical pressure sensors integrated in the bearings. The Author was a member of the research team that developed these sensors. The realistic <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> was measured under hydrodynamic lubrication in realistic operating conditions. Significant differences between the measured and simulated <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> distributions were found. Typically, the measured area of high pressure in the lubricating oil film was wider than the simulated one. The results can be used in the development and validation of mathematical methods for research into hydrodynamic journal bearings...|$|R
5|$|Three days later, on 26 April, Ball scored another double victory, flying S.E.5 no.A4850, and {{one more}} on 28 April. This last day's {{fighting}} left the S.E.5 so battered by enemy action that it was dismantled and sent away for repair. The following month, despite continual problems with jamming guns in the S.E.5s, Ball shot down seven Albatroses in five days, including two reconnaissance models on 1 May, a reconnaissance plane and an Albatros D.III fighter on 2 May; a D.III on 4 May, and two D.IIIs the next day, 5 May. The second of these victims nearly rammed Ball as they shot {{it out in a}} head-on firing pass. As they sped past one another, Ball was left temporarily blinded by oil spraying from the holed oil tank of his craft. Clearing the oil from his eyes, he flew his S.E.5 home with zero <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> in an engine on the brink of seizure. He was so overwrought that it was some time after landing before he could finish thanking God, then dictating his combat report.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} {{approached}} its halfway point, Lotterer gained on the No. 9 Audi {{and moved into}} second place, becoming Audi's lead challenger to Porsche. After leaving the pit lane, Pierre Ragues's No. 43 Morand car billowed smoke because of an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor failure and his vehicle caught fire, causing him to retire at Arnage corner. Several LMGTE cars {{took the opportunity to}} change brake discs {{at this point in the}} morning, including Fernando Rees in the No. 99 Aston Martin. Returning to the track Rees' car failed to stop in time for the first Mulsanne Straight chicane and hit the rear of the TDS Racing Oreca-Nissan. The Oreca, which had held second place in the LMP2 category, was abandoned in the gravel at the chicane while Rees limped the damaged Aston Martin back to the garage for repairs to its front-left corner. The No. 26 G-Drive Ligier took over second place in LMP2, although still a lap behind the leading KCMG Oreca while the lead in LMGTE Pro was now left to Jordan Taylor's No. 64 Corvette and the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari of Bruni on the same lap. In the early morning the No. 7 Audi's hold on second place was relinquished when the right-rear bodywork of the car came apart on the circuit and littered debris at the Porsche Curves, requiring a seven-minute stop for repairs and dropping the car down the race order.|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
40|$|Simulation {{calculations}} {{has been}} performed {{for measuring the}} elastohydrodynamic lubrication characteristics of a stern tube bearing, and several main characteristic values has been determined. If it is not parallel to the propeller shaft and stern tube bearings, {{the magnitude of the}} maximum <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> generated in the bearing increases significantly. The magnitude of the maximum <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> generated is greatly affected by the attitude angle of the shaft. As the attitude angle of the shaft is varied from 90 to 180 degrees, the maximum <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> gradually increases. If the eccentricity at the centre of the bearing, the angle of the shaft centre relative to the bearing centre and the attitude angle of the shaft can be determined, then it is possible to quantitatively determine the maximum <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> taking the elastic deformation of the bearing into account by the method described in this paper...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} the Elasto-Hydrodynamic Lubrication?EHL?of thrust slide-bearings in scroll compressors, resulting in the superior lubrication characteristics of these bearings. The thrust plate undergoes elastic deformation due to axial loading, resulting in the formation of a uniform fluid wedge between the orbiting and fixed thrust plates. This wedge region has very high induced <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure,</b> which explains the remarkably good lubrication characteristics of the thrust slide-bearing. Furthermore, the high <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> induces further local elastic deformation of the thrust plate, forming an EHL oil pocket with the thrust plate and a further increase in the <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> between the sliding surfaces due to this oil envelopment. The formation of the EHL pocket was confirmed using FEM analysis and lubrication tests on the elastic deformation of the thrust plate. Subsequently, the additional increase in <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure,</b> due to the EHL pocket effect, was examined in computer simulations applying the average Reynolds equation for the boundary of elastic deformation of the thrust plate. In these studies, a 6. 7 % increase in <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> was ascertained for a small cooling capacity scroll compressor driven at 3600 rpm with 0. 1 kW motor. The oil envelopment contributes to the superior lubrication performance of the thrust slide bearings scroll compressors...|$|R

The results are shown that the difficulty of the EHL for journal bearings in the case of high eccentricity ratios or heave loads can be effectively solved by the FFT method. When the eccentricity ratio is smaller, the magnitude and distribution of the <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure</b> are basic agreement by FFT method and flexibility matrix method.

40|$|Abstract: Dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> film bearing is an {{important}} mechanical component of the ship. With the development of large-sized ships, their dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> films often run at high speed and under heavy load generating high <b>oil</b> film <b>pressure.</b> In addition, due to {{the increased use of}} thin walled bearing shell with materials of low elastic modulus, the elastic deformation of the bearing shell which is in dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> film bearing cannot be ignored. During computation, if the effect of elastic deformation on the performance of dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> film bearing is ignored as is usually the practise, the difference between the theoretical and the actual results will be enormous. Therefore, this article took the effect of bearing shell's elastic deformation on bearing performance as the research target. A coupling algorithm program in Matlab is written to simulate and solve the oil film bearing dynamic pressure lubrication theory, considering elastic deformation of bearing shell {{in a way that is}} more aligned with the actual working conditions. Conducted a comparison between the above results and the results with no consideration of elastic deformation and analyzed the process and regularity of the effect of elastic deformation and other factors on the performance of oil film bearing shell in operation under dynamic lubrication. Therefore more accurate theoretical basis can be provided for the design and fault diagnose of dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>oil</b> film bearing of the ships...|$|R
