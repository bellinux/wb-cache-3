5|$|Gymnopils maritimus {{is clearly}} a {{different}} species from <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of its clade, despite their close relation. All other species in the clade grow upon dead wood and have well-developed rings on their stems. The spores also differ; {{in the case of}} G.junonius and G.spectabilis (often considered synonymous), as well as G.pampeanus, they are narrower, {{and in the case of}} G.imperialis, they are wider. Of the <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the clade, only G.junonius and G.spectabilis also grow in Europe.|$|E

5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the <b>other</b> <b>members</b> of the group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E

5|$|Hermética's last {{concert was}} held in Mar del Plata. Their second concert in Obras was canceled; rumors that Iorio had {{contracted}} hepatitis B {{turned out to be}} false. The <b>other</b> <b>members</b> sent him a formal request to attend the concert but Iorio refused and the band broke up. Iorio did not attend any meeting since then and ordered the other band members to stop using the name Hermética, which Iorio had invented. Iorio gave his first interviews after the break-up to the Clarín newspaper and the <b>other</b> <b>members</b> to the music magazine Madhouse. Iorio said that the band had always been united, but few weeks before their final concert, the members were not talking to each other. He said he had lied about having hepatitis B, expecting to end the hostilities, but it did not work. Iorio flew from Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires to avoid seeing the <b>other</b> <b>members,</b> who returned by bus. O'Connor, Romano, and Strunz stated in Madhouse magazine that the harsh relation was because Iorio had not consulted the others about the decisions he was making, that he received most of the money, and that he avoided meeting them when they were discussing the problems in the band.|$|E
