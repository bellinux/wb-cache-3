5|$|The Knight's Cross <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its {{variants}} was {{the highest}} award in the military of the Third Reich.

5|$|The Knight's Cross <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross and its higher {{grades were}} based on four {{separate}} enactments. The first enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 1573 of 1 September 1939 instituted the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz) and the Knight's Cross <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross. As the war progressed, some of the recipients distinguished themselves further and a higher grade, the Oak Leaves to Knight's Cross <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross, was instituted. The Oak Leaves, as they were commonly referred to, {{were based on}} the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 849 of 3 June 1940. In 1941, two higher grades of the Knight's Cross were instituted. The enactment Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 introduced the Knight's Cross <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords and the Knight's Cross <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. At the end of 1944 the final grade, the Knight's Cross <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iron</b> Cross with Golden Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds (Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes mit goldenem Eichenlaub, Schwertern und Brillanten), based on the enactment Reichsgesetzblatt 1945 I S. 11 of 29 December 1944, concluded the variants of the Knight's Cross.|$|E
