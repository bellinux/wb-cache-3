25|$|<b>Overtorquing</b> {{might cause}} failure by {{damaging}} the threads and deforming the fastener, though {{this can happen}} over a very long time. Undertorquing can cause failures by allowing a joint to come loose, and it may also allow the joint to flex and thus fail under fatigue.|$|E
40|$|Magnetically {{controlled}} {{torque wrench}} produces the required torque values accurately, and prevents <b>overtorquing.</b> The force between a magnet {{and a soft}} iron bar on {{the arms of the}} wrench constitutes a predetermined maximum torque that cannot be exceeded. So long as the magnetic flux remain constant, the torque remains the same...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} associated with <b>overtorque</b> applied to the Booster Separation Motor (BSM) Igniter Adapter high strength 200 KSI (1379 Mpa) A 286 CRES bolts and the threaded holes of the 7075 -T 73 aluminum alloy BSM cases are addressed. The evaluation included torque, tensile, and stress corrosion tests incorporating the A 286 CRES bolts and the 7075 -T 73 aluminum alloy BSM cases. The tensile test data includes ultimate tensile load (UTL), Johnson's 2 / 3 yield load (J 2 / 3 YL), proportional limit load (PLL), and total bolt stretch. Torque tension data includes torque, torque induced load, and positive and negative break-away torque. Stress corrosion test data reflect the <b>overtorque</b> and the resulting torque induced loads sustained by the A 286 CRES bolts torqued into a 7075 -T 73 aluminum alloy forged dome with threaded holes. After 60 days of salt fog exposure, the positive and the negative break-away torques, the subsequent mechanical property tensile test results, and the BSM dome threaded hole axial tensile pullout loads are reported...|$|R
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work accomplished through computer simulation {{to understand the}} impact of the hydromechanical turbine assembly (TA) fuel control on rocket gas ingestion induced engine surges on the AH- 1 (Cobra) helicopter. These surges excite the lightly damped torsional modes of the Cobra rotor drive train and can cause <b>overtorqueing</b> of the tail rotor shaft. The simulation studies show that the hydromechanical TA control has a negligible effect on drive train resonances because its response is sufficiently attenuated at the resonant frequencies. However, a digital electronic control working through the TA control's separate, emergency fuel metering system has been identified as a solution to the <b>overtorqueing</b> problem. State-of-the-art software within the electronic control can provide active damping of the rotor drive train to eliminate excessive torque spikes due to any disturbances including engine surges and aggressive helicopter maneuvers. Modifications to the existing TA hydromechanical control are relatively minor, and existing engine sensors can be utilized by the electronic control. Therefore, it is concluded that the combination of full authority digital electronic control (FADEC) with hydromechanical backup using the existing TA control enhances flight safety, improves helicopter performance, reduces pilot workload, and provides a substantial payback for very little investment...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the major}} {{operational}} concerns {{that have to be}} addressed in planning a real tether mission, such as the TTS- 1 mission, which is due to fly on the Space Shuttle in the early 1990 's, are discussed. Specifically, several operational hazards, such as the tether reel <b>overtorque</b> and the loss of tether system control, are considered from the viewpoint of flight crew, who must be able to detect the presence of a problem and to determine the corrective action to be taken. Various safety measures are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Flanged joints are {{fundamental}} components of pipelines {{and they must}} be optimized to avoid leaks, bolts overstress and flanged joints damage. Overcoming standards indications as <b>overtorqueing,</b> and combination of different parameters, as difference in hardness between flanges and gasket, can cause groove impressions. Aim {{of this study is to}} provide an efficient tool to optimize the choice of characteristic parameters of flanged joints, by numerical simulations. Geometries of a real test case are simulated by FE models, considering different values of flange and gasket hardness, as well as tightening torques, in order to cover possible ranges. From the analyses, it is possible to highlight that a particular combination of hardness difference and over-torque is responsible for permanent flange impression...|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 33 - 48 The {{successful}} {{application of}} synchronous motors requires special design consideration {{to account for}} their speed-dependent characteristics, such as the large oscillating torque levels that occur during startup. This paper focuses on the torsional design and analysis process associated with revamping a 7000 hp synchronous motor-driven compressor train with an 8000 hp synchronous motor driver. Torsional analyses indicated that the replacement motor?s startup torque would produce unacceptable levels of torsional vibration. An accurate <b>overtorque</b> protection slip clutch was integrated into the low-speed coupling assembly to limit startup peak torque to about three times the normal operating torques. The paper details multiple issues associated with revamping the compressor drive train, including {{the selection of the}} replacement driver and low-speed coupling assembly, torsional vibration analysis, and the mechanical operation of the controlled slip clutch mechanism. The paper also presents the acquired torsional field measurements that were used to confirm the clutch?s operation...|$|R
40|$|When {{assembling}} tubing strings in the oilfields, threaded {{connections are}} used to connect the pipes with each other. The possibility to reuse these connections is often required and {{a certain degree of}} leak tightness is required, even without the use of a sealing surface or shoulder. For this reason, the total plasticity within the connection should be limited and relative movement between pin and box ought to be restricted. Within this publication, a finite elements analysis is conducted using a 4. 5 inch buttress threaded connection as defined in API 5 B together with a connection using the enhanced SR 23 buttress thread. In addition, an experimental validation of the make-up stage is conducted by comparing the strains generated during make-up using Digital Image Correlation and infrared monitoring. In order to determine the optimal make-up, values found in literature are compared with a developed method using the magnitude and size of the plastically deformed zones during make-up. In addition, the effect of external axial and pressure loading is examined to identify the effects and critical areas. As a result, it is observed that pressure loading and make-up tend to have similar effects and {{in order to determine the}} optimal make-up torque, the pressure ratings of the assembly should be taken into account to prevent <b>overtorqueing</b> the connection. For the case of axial loading, a critical zone is visible near the last engaged thread and excessive loading of this thread can cause premature failure within this zone. Overall, the SR 23 connection shows limited, yet visible, advantages over the standard BTC connection as described in literature...|$|R
