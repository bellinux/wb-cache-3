5|$|According to Eliot {{the poetic}} {{aspects of the}} poem are {{grounded}} {{in the tradition of}} John Cleveland, Edward Benlowes, William Blake, and William Butler Yeats's early work. Additionally, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> are connected to the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé. In terms of theology, Eliot is orthodox in his theory and relies primarily on the writings of St Augustine. There are some additional influences from the works of Thomas Browne and Saint John of the Cross. In applying these views upon society, Eliot was heavily influenced by the writings of Christopher Dawson and Dawson's reliance on understanding God as the first step to a better society.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} in the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme {{in a manner similar to}} Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and the challenges that this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's poetry is the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E

5|$|The Round Church was {{unmatched}} in its ceramic decoration by any {{church in}} Preslav, {{and was the}} only known building {{in the city to}} rely heavily on polychrome ceramic tiles. Ceramic and mosaic icons were a highlight of the interior; they ranged in size from almost life-sized to miniature. While the ceramic images were constructed out of clay tiles, the mosaic icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are Charalampus and perhaps Joel. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> were enclosed in ellipses.|$|E

5|$|The imams {{said that}} the three {{additional}} images were sent anonymously by mail to Muslims who were participating in an online debate on Jyllands-Postens website, and were apparently included to illustrate the perceived atmosphere of Islamophobia in which they lived. On 1 February, BBC World incorrectly reported that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> had been published in Jyllands-Posten. This image was later {{found to be a}} wire-service photograph of a contestant at a French pig-squealing contest in the Trie-sur-Baise's annual festival.

5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by a comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major issue}} {{is the amount of}} {{radiation}} to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts, but it lost most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> of the moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E

5|$|By 1955 the {{original}} sound negatives began to deteriorate, though a four-track copy had survived in good condition. Using the remaining Fantasound {{system at the}} studio, a three-track stereo copy was transferred across telephone wires onto magnetic film at an RCA facility in Hollywood. This copy was used when Fantasia was reissued in stereo by Buena Vista Distribution in SuperScope, a derivative of the anamorphic widescreen CinemaScope format, on February 7, 1956. The projector featured an automatic control mechanism designed by Disney engineers that was coupled to a variable anamorphic lens, which allowed the picture to switch between its Academy standard aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to the wide ratio of 2.35:1 in twenty seconds without {{a break in the}} film. This was achieved by placing the cues that controlled the mechanism on a separate track in addition to the three audio channels. Only selected parts of the animation were stretched, while all live action scenes remained unchanged. This reissue garnered some criticism from viewers, as the widescreen format led to the cropping and reframing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images.</b>|$|E

Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad.

30|$|Images {{produce a}} reality of their own. This {{specific}} reality cannot be grasped by dualistically separating {{it from an}} alleged reality of ‘the factual’. We can clearly see this effect of creating an ‘own’ reality in works of art of abstract modernism displaying something which eludes objective, measurable and countable approaches. What is displayed by these images points to meaning (or emotion) rather than matter. This implicit meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> is perceived as <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image.</b> From an epistemological perspective, <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> and <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factual are incongruent and disparate (Schütz 2016 a, 2016 b). <b>The</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> with its inherent logic and materiality can become tangible precisely in this incongruity. From an epistemological point <b>of</b> view, <b>the</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> is not only perceived as reality, but also responded to immediately. <b>The</b> multitude <b>of</b> experiences which are constituted while looking at an image are immediate responses to <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image.</b> <b>The</b> inherent, experiential reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>image</b> is grounded in this pre-verbal and implicit meaning.|$|R

5|$|P. l. mesopotamica or Mesopotamian lion, flourished {{during the}} Neo-Assyrian Period (approximately 1000–600 BC).

Ancient evidence from adjacent landmasses reveal no substantiation for lions with underbelly hair in this manner so that the distinct phenotype of depicted lions in ancient Mesopotamia (including Babylon, Elam and ancient Persia) represent an extinct sub-species. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>images</b> of these lions are derived from lion hunting sculptures so that the extinction of this sub-species likely resulted from overhunting {{in the ancient world}} (See the Cultural significance below).|$|E
