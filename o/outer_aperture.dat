40|$|In the Wadden Sea, shell repair {{frequency}} {{in the small}} gastropod Hydrobia ulvae varied from 2. 8 % to 11. 2 %. On tidal flats of the Mok, a small bay {{on the island of}} Texel, The Netherlands, in the Wadden Sea, higher repair frequencies varying from 11. 8 % to 41. 8 % were measured. The shelduck, Tadorna tadorna, a predator of Hydrobia, occurs here in densities far above average densities for the Wadden Sea. Shelducks ingest their prey whole and crush the shells of H. ulvae internally. Live specimens of H. ulvae were collected from shelduck feces. Those with intact operculum and only a damaged <b>outer</b> <b>aperture</b> rim of the shell were kept in aquaria and repaired their shell rapidly. This indicates that predators that ingest shelled prey can also leave repair scars on shells. Such scars, however, are indistinguishable from those resulting from failed predation by predators using such pre-ingestive shell breakage as decapod crustaceans...|$|E
40|$|The {{periwinkle}} Littorina saxatilis {{has repeatedly}} evolved both a small, fragile and globose "wave ecotype" confined to wave-swept shores and a large, robust and elongated "crab ecotype" found in nearby crab-rich but less-exposed shores. This phenotypic divergence {{is assumed to}} reflect, in some part, local adaptation to wave exposure, but this hypothesis has received incomplete experimental testing. Here, we report {{a test of the}} prediction that the wave ecotype has a higher capacity to resist water flow than the crab ecotype. We sampled snails along a crab-wave transect and measured their resistance to dislodgement in a high-speed water flume with water speeds that match those of breaking waves in a range of relevant field conditions. Snails from the wave environment were consistently more resistant to water flow than snails from the crab environment and high resistance was positively correlated with the surface area of the foot and the area of the <b>outer</b> <b>aperture</b> contour both relative to shell size, and to the extent of lateral shell compression. In a separate experiment, we found that snails raised in still water in a common garden showed higher resistance to water flow if originating from a wave environment than from a crab environment, and this was true both at juvenile (2 weeks) and adult (10 months) developmental stages. This result suggests genetic control of a distinct "wave adapted" phenotype, likely to be maintained under strong divergent selection between the two adjacent habitats...|$|E

40|$|The {{periwinkle}} Littorina littorea (L.) is {{a common}} prosobranch gastropod at the North Atlantic coasts, ranging from Greenland to New Jersey in America and, from Portugal to the White Sea in Europe (Johannesson, 1988). It presents a planktonic development; females release planktonic egg capsules that are pelagic, asymmetrically biconvex with a flat peripheral rim. The egg capsules contain a maximum of nine eggs (Linke, 1933); more commonly, they contain one to three (Cummins et al, 2002). Upon release, the egg capsules swell osmotically and burst after five to six days. Each egg hatches into a free swimming veliger larva and remains in this planktonic stage for six to seven weeks (Fish, 1979). At hatching larvae measure about 180 micrometers long and are competent to settle after spending 2 - 6 weeks in the plankton and reaching about 300 - 360 micrometers in length (Hohenlohe, 2002). Metamorphosis may be delayed if conditions are not suitable and it results in considerable variation of settlement times, with larvae settling on the shore throughout several months of the year. Adults of L. littorea species are ecologically similar, so this genus is a potential model system for testing the hypothesis that gene flow among populations should be higher in species with planktonic larvae because of their greater dispersal capacity (Jablonski and Lutz, 1983). L. littorea is of economic interest in Portugal where it is highly appreciated as shellfish food, being the peak season of consumption in summer. Since the local production {{is not sufficient to}} meet demand, it has been necessary to import stocks from abroad (mainly from Scotland and Ireland) in order to satisfy market needs. For this reason, the development of strategies to produce L. littorea in Portugal is crucial. This work aims to determine basic rearing conditions and obtain data on L. littorea larval development and growth rate. These results are important to establish the conditions for cultivating larvae of this species, as well as to access its feasibility since a lack of information was detected in literature. Egg capsules and larvae were obtained from an adult broodstock maintained at Estação Litoral da Aguda. Larvae were reared in 30 L white tanks, maintained at a density of 5 larvae per ml in seawater with aeration, at 22 °C. They were fed a mixture of microalgae that included Isochrysis galbana, Tetraselmis suecica, Nannochlorospsis gaditana, Rhodomanas marina, Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Chaetoceros gracilis. Water was partially (30 - 60 %) changed every 2 - 3 days. Egg capsules and eggs were measured on the day following their arrival at the laboratory (n = 68). External diameter of the capsule, eggs chamber and each egg in the chamber were measured. Larval shell length was measured every 6 - 8 days (n = 20) using a Leica DM 6000 microscope coupled with a digital B/W - 2. 0 MPix and colour camera. Microphotographs of each egg and larvae were recorded and analyzed by the LEICA LAS AF version 1. 8. 0. Since larval shells were planispiral, shell length was established as the maximum dimension of the shell: the distance from the <b>outer</b> <b>aperture</b> lip to {{the opposite side of the}} last whorl. The mean external length of egg capsules was 852. 1 μm. This value is smaller than 1 mm, previously described in the bibliography (Fisher, 1972), probably due to the conditions in which eggs were obtained, a broodstock maintained from November to February in a recirculation system at 16 - 18 ºC. According to Fisher (1972), L. littorea egg capsules are described to have 1 mm and containing 2 - 9 eggs, being 1 - 2 eggs the most common (Fish, 1972). Accordingly, the more frequent number of eggs inside each capsule, in the present study, was 2 eggs per capsule (Fig. 1 A). However, no more than 5 eggs were observed in any capsule. Regarding the relation between the number of eggs per capsule and the outer capsule diameter, only capsules with one egg were significantly different from the other, although an increasing pattern seems to be revealed (Fig. 1 B). It is worth to mention that data are preliminary, only few egg capsules with 4 and 5 eggs were observed, which may have compromised the significance of the difference of other values. Larvae hatched at veliger stage with a mean shell diameter of 179. 3 μm. Post-larvae were first observed at day 12 when they have settled to the bottom and the typical velum of veliger larvae disappeared (Fig. 2). The duration of the veliger stage (12 - 15 days) was much shorter than previously described (Fish, 1979; Cummins et al, 2002) and comparing with other species of Littorina studied in laboratory conditions (Hohenlohe, 2002). In his study, Hohenlohe detected that the whole planktonic period L. scutulata and L. plena, under laboratory conditions, ranged from 37 - 70 days and 62 days (since only one larvae of this specie metamorphosed) respectively. We suppose shorter larval period observed in the present study is due to the optimized rearing conditions, with a wide variety of algae supplied, at adequate densities, and to the higher rearing temperature, 22 ºC, as compared to normal temperatures in the wild for this time of the year in Portugal (12 - 15 ºC) and other Atlantic water. The improvement of rearing conditions can play a crucial role in boosting both pre- and post-settlement development, required for rapidly overcome the more sensitive and labor intensive stages. Mean shell size observed at metamorphosis was 325. 2 μm. Comparing these results with other Littorina species such as L. scutulata, with had a mean shell size at metamorphosis of 355 μm (Hohenlohe, 2002), L. littorea are slightly smaller. By day 30 after hatching mean shell length was 387. 3 μm long (Fig. 3). The duration of the pelagic phase is primarily temperature dependent, lasting from 2 - 6 weeks and allowing a dispersal potential exceeding 10 km (Fisher, 1972). In the present study and since temperature was increased to 22 ºC, time to metamorphosis was reduced to 12 - 15 days. We highlight the importance global warming may have on the dispersal of this species and consequent effects on gene flow among populations. Since the main aim of this work is to set up the conditions for rearing L. littorea under controlled conditions, we have observed that higher temperature (22 ºC) and an adequate food supply are very important parameters to increase developmental rate, reduce time to settlement and improve survival on this species. The information obtained will be also useful to schedule laboratory trials intended for basic research, e. g. the study of potential settlement cues on this species. The management system developed is, however, extremely labor-intensive. Larvae require very careful hatchery conditions since they are very fragile and easily disturbed. Survival rates, not mentioned in this work, need to be improved, particularly after metamorphosis. In conclusion, the results reported here lay down the first steps to cultivate L. littorea industrially, describing some optimized conditions and revealing hardships.

The occurrence of vestured pits in Hydrolea provides additional support for excluding this genus from Hydrophylloideae, since Hydrolea is the only species of this subfamily with vestured pits.

To elucidate the adaptive potential of intervessel pits towards fluctuating environmental conditions, two mangrove species {{with a distinct}} ecological distribution growing along a natural salinity gradient were investigated. Methods: Scanning and transmission electron microscopic observations were conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative characteristics of alternate intervessel pits in A. marina and scalariform intervessel pits in Rhizophora mucronata. Wood samples from three to six trees were collected at seven and five sites for A. marina and R. mucronata, respectively, with considerable differences between sites in soil water salinity. Key Results: Vestured pits without visible pores in the pit membrane were observed in A. marina, the mangrove species with the widest geographical distribution on global {{as well as local}} scale. Their thick pit membranes (on average 370 nm) and minute pit apertures may contribute to reduced vulnerability to cavitation of this highly salt-tolerant species. The smaller ecological distribution of R. mucronata was in accordance with wide pit apertures and a slightly higher pitfield fraction (67 % vs. 60 % in A. marina). Nonetheless, its <b>outer</b> pit <b>apertures</b> were observed to be funnel-shaped shielding non-porous pit membranes. No trends in intervessel pit size were observed with increasing soil water salinity of the site. Conclusions: The contrasting ecological distribution of two mangrove species was reflected in the geometry and pit membrane characteristics of their intervessel pits. Within species, intervessel pit size seemed to be independent of spatial variations in environmental conditions and was only weakly correlated with vessel diameter.

40|$|Part I: Systematic {{distribution}} of pit membrane thickenings and vesturesChapter 1 : The micromorphology of pit membranes in tracheary elements of Ericales: new records of tori or pseudo-tori?Intervascular pit membranes were examined within Ericales {{to determine the}} distribution and structure of torus-like thickenings. Forty-nine species representing 12 families of the order Ericales were investigated using light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. They were compared with four species of Oleaceae to determine {{the true nature of}} the thickenings. Pit membranes with torus-like thickenings were observed in seven species of Ericaceae and were found to be amorphous, plasmodesmata associated structures with an irregular distribution. These pseudo-tori show major differences compared to true tori with respect to their distribution, ultrastructure and chemical composition. Genuine tori, which are strongly correlated with round pit apertures in narrow tracheary elements, were found in two species of Osmanthus (Oleaceae). The pseudo-tori found in some Ericaceae are considered to be similar to pit membrane thickenings previously recorded in Rosaceae. While true tori appear to be functionally significant in terms of efficiency and safety of water transport, the possible function of pseudo-tori could be associated with the role of plasmodesmata during differentiation of tracheids, fibre-tracheids or narrow vessels. Chapter 2 : Micromorphology and systematic {{distribution of}} pit membrane thickenings in Oleaceae: tori and pseudo-toriRecent studies on the functional significance of pit membranes in water conducting cells have renewed general interest in their micromorphology. At least two types of pit membrane thickenings have been described in angiosperm families, i. e. genuine tori and pseudo-tori. This study explores the distribution and morphology of pit membrane thickenings in 69 species and 23 genera within Oleaceae using light and electron microscopy. Torus-bearing pit membranes are confirmed for Osmanthus, and new records are reported for Chionanthus retusa, Picconia azorica, and P. excelsa, but not for the other species of Chionanthus studied. This intrageneric variation suggests that tori represent a plastic feature that has evolved more than once within the family as the result of functional adaptation to efficient and safe water transport. Pseudo-tori are observed in species of Abeliophyllum, Fontanesia, Forsythia, Jasminum, Ligustrum, Menodora, and Syringa. Based on structural differences, we state that tori and pseudo-tori can be distinguished as non-homologous features. Chapter 3 : Torus-bearing pit membranes in species of OsmanthusTorus thickenings of pit membranes are found not only in gymnosperms, but also in certain genera of eudicots. One such genus is Osmanthus. Wood from 17 species of Osmanthus was examined for tori. Fourteen species from three of the four sections investigated showed torus thickenings. Ten of the species represent new records. Only the three New Caledonian species of section Notosmanthus lacked tori. This observation in combination with other characters suggests us to separate this section from the remainder of the genus. Chapter 4 : The phylogenetic significance of vestured pits in BoraginaceaeThe bordered pit structure in tracheary elements of 105 Boraginaceae species is studied using scanning electron microscopy to examine the systematic distribution of vestured pits. Forty-three species out of 16 genera show a uniform presence of this feature throughout their secondary xylem. Most vestures are small, unbranched and associated with the <b>outer</b> pit <b>aperture</b> of bordered intervessel pits. The feature is likely to have originated independently in the distantly related subfamilies Boraginoideae (tribe Lithospermeae) and Ehretioideae. The distribution of vestures in Ehretia agrees with recent molecular phylogenies: (1) species with vestured pits characterise the Ehretia I group (incl. Rotula), and (2) species with non-vestured pits belong to the Ehretia II group (incl. Carmona). The occurrence of vestured pits in Hydrolea provides additional support for excluding this genus from Hydrophylloideae, since Hydrolea is the only genus of this subfamily with vestured pits. Functional advantages of vestured pits are suggested to promote parallel evolution of this conservative feature, although the exact hydraulic benefits of poorly developed vestures remain unknown. Part II: Development of pseudo-toriChapter 5 : The ultrastructure and development of pit membranes with plasmodesmata associated thickenings in xylem elementsRecent micromorphological observations of angiosperm pit membranes have extended the range of taxa with pseudo-tori in tracheary elements. Since developmental studies on pseudo-tori have only been conducted on Pyrus and Sorbus (Rosaceae), it is unclear whether all pseudo-tori in angiosperms develop in a similar way and whether they are homologous structures. We studied the ontogeny of pseudo-tori using transmission electron microscopy in four species belonging to four different orders of flowering plants: Malus yunnanensis, Ligustrum vulgare, Pittosporum tenuifolium, and Vaccinium myrtillus. The developmental patterns observed in these four species are similar. A primary thickening is formed when the secondary cell wall formation is initiated followed by the deposition of a secondary cap. After hydrolysis of the pit membrane, the cap becomes persistent, partially covering the pit membrane. Our observations do not fully corroborate the earlier ontogenetic studies in Rosaceae. The formation of the primary thickening in Pyrus and Sorbus is completed before the secondary cell wall formation is initiated, which is not the case in our study. This developmental difference questions the homologous nature of pseudo-tori throughout the flowering plants. Part III: Structure-function relationships of bordered pits in angiosperm vesselsChapter 6 : Wood anatomical features associated with cavitation resistance across 10 species of PrunusWood of 10 Prunus species that were hydraulically studied by Cochard et al. (2008) were examined to study structure-function trade-offs regarding vulnerability to drought-induced cavitation. A detailed study of hydraulically relevant characters is conducted using light microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Vessel network characters are most important in explaining cavitation resistance (quantified as P 50 value). Strong relations are demonstrated between P 50 and vessel grouping indices (VG, VS), vessel contact characters (FC), and vessel dimension characters (DH, LV). The most drought resistant Prunus species in our study tend to show vessels that are less grouped and more solitary than the more vulnerable species. Our results support the theoretical model on vessel connectivity of Loepfe et al. (2007), but provide no evidence for Carlquists vessel grouping hypothesis. At the pit level however, we found a strong negative correlation between P 50 and the thickness of intervessel pit membranes, although this correlation was not found significant and was not supported in PCA. No other pit related character (including AP) was found to be related with P 50. This is surprising since the rare pit hypothesis, linking P 50 with AP, is was originally formulated based on observations in Rosaceae (incl. Prunus), this hypothesis could not be fully corroborated in our study. status: publishe...|$|R
