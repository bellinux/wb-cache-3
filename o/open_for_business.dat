On 9 March 1966, the venue became notorious after Ronnie Kray fatally shot George Cornell at the pub. The premises remains <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business,</b> though it has been refurbished several times. The Kray Twins also used the Blackwall Buildings, by then dilapidated, {{as a form of}} punishment by locking a victim in a flat alone with Ronnie's German Shepherd dog.|$|E

That night, Rose asks Erica Page (Allison Hayes) to close her saloon at 3 AM {{in accordance with}} town regulations, but Erica insists her saloon is <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business</b> 24 hours. The women fight, but eventually Erica, who loses the fight, closes for the night. After Rose exits, Erica tells lackey Jake (Jonathan Haze) to hire a killer, which he does, finding a man named Cane Miro (John Ireland). As Cane enters town, Rose shoots at him, mistaking him for a man she has been searching out. She apologizes. Cane tells Rose that {{he has come to}} Oracle to see town mayor Gideon Polk (Martin Kingsley).|$|E

5|$|The mass {{influx of}} {{immigrants}} {{during this period}} were almost totally English and Welsh; the most notable exception being an immigrant nationality from outside the United Kingdom, the Italians. In the late 19th century a group of Italian immigrants, originally from the northern area of Italy, centred on the town of Bardi, were forced out of London by an over-saturation of the market. These immigrants set up a network of cafés, ice cream parlours and fish & chip shops throughout South Wales and these businesses became iconic landmarks in the villages they served and they and subsequent generations became Welsh Italians. Particular to the Rhondda, the shops ran by the Italian immigrants, were known as 'Bracchis', {{believed to have been}} named after Angelo Bracchi who opened the first café in the Rhondda in the early 1890s. By the early 21st century several of the original Bracchis were still <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business</b> in the Rhondda.|$|E

The project was called the New Suez Canal, as it would allow ships to transit the canal in both directions simultaneously. The project cost more than $8 billion and was completed within one year. Sisi declared the expanded channel <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business</b> in a ceremony on 6 August 2015.|$|E

25|$|Michigan Central Station (also {{known as}} Michigan Central Depot or MCS) {{was the main}} {{intercity}} passenger rail depot for Detroit, Michigan. Built for the Michigan Central Railroad, it replaced the original depot in downtown Detroit, which was shuttered after a major fire on December 26, 1913, forcing the still unfinished station into early service. Formally dedicated on January 4, 1914, the station remained <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business</b> until the cessation of Amtrak service on January 6, 1988. At {{the time of its}} construction, it was the tallest rail station in the world.|$|E
25|$|The studio lot {{is where}} sets and {{buildings}} are built. In {{order to increase}} the 'prestige' of the studio lot, the studio must be neat, free of litter, well laid out and with areas of grass, trees and decoration. Buildings must also be linked together by paths. Buildings and sets also decay, thus decreasing the quality of movies that they appear in. They will eventually become unusable {{if they do not}} receive maintenance or repair by staff. The game begins with four rival studios, and six studios are added later. No more studios <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business</b> after the year 1970.|$|E
25|$|This October 31st, {{bars and}} {{restaurants}} in the Castro will be <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business.</b> However, {{as was the case}} last year the streets will not be closed to traffic.

25|$|LaSalle Street Fund {{bought the}} mall in the early 1980s and oversaw {{continued}} expansion, including {{the addition of a}} fourth anchor store. September 1, 1985, marked the first legal Sunday shopping day in the State of Texas. It, like other area malls, celebrated the end of the state's 24-year-old blue law with entertainment and special promotions. Some smaller retailers objected to the new hours but mall officials informed them in writing of their contractual obligations to operate while the mall is open. January 1, 1987, was the first New Year's Day that the anchor stores were <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business</b> on the holiday. Many smaller stores in the mall followed their lead, although it would be a few years before every store would be obligated to be open {{on the first day of}} the new year.|$|E
25|$|Each branch had {{an initial}} {{investment}} of $160,000, at first {{there were only}} ten branches and the total bank's value was $1.6 million. The start up money was all hard money in Spanish and Mexican silver dollars. The money was raised by issuing stock sold at $50 per share. Half of the stock was to be purchased {{by the state and}} the other half was sold to the public. By May 20, 1834, all the public stock for the new bank had been issued. The state allowed the public stock to be sold at $18.75 per share, with the other $31.25 being financed on the state's credit, until the purchaser could pay the full amount back to the state with 6% interest. On August 6, the state completed its purchase of 50% of the bank's stock. The money to purchase the stock came through the sale and mortgage of thousands of acres of public land. On November 19 Governor Noah Noble declared the bank <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Sacramento-Yolo Port District {{was created}} in 1947, and ground was broken on the Port of Sacramento in 1949. On June 29, 1963, with 5,000 spectators waiting to welcome her, the Motor Vessel Taipei Victory arrived. The port was <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business.</b> The Nationalist Chinese flagship, freshly painted for the {{historic}} event, was loaded with 5,000 tons of bagged rice for Mitsui Trading Co. bound for Okinawa and 1,000 tons of logs for Japan. She was the first ocean-going vessel in Sacramento since the steamship Harpoon in 1934. The Port of Sacramento has been plagued with operating losses {{in recent years and}} faces bankruptcy. This severe loss in business is due to the heavy competition from the Port of Stockton, which has a larger facility and a deeper channel. As of 2006, the city of West Sacramento took responsibility for the Port of Sacramento. During the Vietnam War era, the Port of Sacramento was the major terminus in the supply route for all military parts, hardware and other cargo going into Southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|After the {{flooding}} of Hurricane Diane, the former wetlands became {{the ownership of}} Walter Beekman from Beekman and Beekman Inc. He kept ownership of the land for only nineteen years before selling the land {{to the town of}} Amenia in 1974 for one dollar. The land remained unkept at that point, until the 1980s, when groups of volunteers (funded by the town) started installing ball fields and park like scenery. In 1983, Beekman Park was <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business</b> as the new local park. In 1985, the local baseball fields started hosting their own games for locals team on the local Don Herring Field. Some of the former lake remains, including a portion of the former dam in the southwestern corner of the park, and Amenia Island Cemetery still stands along New York State Route 343 towards Sharon, Connecticut, but on stable ground. On May 14, 2009, the town of Amenia secured $3,829 (2009 USD) from their recreation fund to help make improvements to Beekman Park, and on June 11, 2009, the money distribution was approved.|$|E
25|$|The anchor {{from the}} Sailboat Wreck {{is located on}} the Ocean City Boardwalk. The anchor, which is 2 ½ tons, was {{recovered}} from the Sailboat Wreck in 1870 by the commercial clam vessel Star Light. It is now located on the boardwalk for people to admire the history of it. The Atlantic Hotel, located at 401 S Baltimore Ave, is another historical site that is also still <b>open</b> <b>for</b> <b>business.</b> After a fire that destroyed the original and first ever hotel in Ocean City, Maryland, the Atlantic Hotel was rebuilt in 1926 {{and is one of the}} oldest and most historic hotels in Ocean City. The Ocean City Life-Saving Station Museum is another historical site originally called the Ocean City Life-Saving Station. The station was part of the coastal system and was important for the saving of vessels and lives in distress. It was built in 1891, and after much debate over having it demolished, the station was saved and eventually dedicated as a museum in 1978. The museum attracts people due to the interesting facts and exhibits of ocean life, nature, and life-saving services.|$|E
