40|$|International audienceSince {{air traffic}} volume {{increased}} over the <b>oceanic</b> <b>airspaces,</b> it has been primordial to improve oceanic air traffic management procedures. One {{of the most important}} limitations in the oceans air traffic is the lack of radar coverage. The availability of new surveillance means, called automated dependence surveillance broadcast system (ADS-B), permits to enhance the strategic flight planning over the oceans by reducing the separation standards. Besides, oceanic flights are mainly subjected to strong winds caused by the jet streams. In this work, we focus on optimizing the strategic flight planning over the North Atlantic airspace. First, we organize the traffic inside a route structure that benefits from both the Jet streams and the exploitation of ADS-B systems. Indeed, from one side, these routes are merged inside the jet streams in order to be as close as possible from wind-optimal routes. On the other side, these routes are constructed to fit in with the new separation standards required when implementing the ADS-B systems. Then, we resolve conflicts between aircraft via an optimization model based on a speed regulation. Simulations were conducted for a real traffic data. Computational findings show that the proposed methodology provides satisfying results...|$|R

5000|$|To {{mitigate}} the described problem, many recommend, as legally allowed in very limited authorized airspace, that planes fly {{one or two}} miles offset {{from the center of}} the airway (to the right side) thus eliminating the problem only in the head-on collision scenario. The International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) [...] "Procedures for Air Navigation--Air Traffic Management Manual," [...] authorizes lateral offset only in <b>oceanic</b> and remote <b>airspace</b> worldwide. [...] However, this workaround for the particular case of a head-on collision threat on a common assigned airway fails to address the navigation paradox in general, and it fails to specifically address the inherent system safety fault intolerance inadvertently designed into international air traffic safety regulations.4 [...] To be specific, in the cases of intersecting flight paths where either aircraft is not on an airway (for example, flying under a [...] "direct" [...] clearance, or a temporary diversion clearance for weather threats), or where intersecting aircraft flights are on deliberately intersecting airways, these more general threats receive no protection from flying one or two miles to the right of the center of the airway. Intersecting flight paths must still intersect somewhere. As with the midair collision over Germany, an offset to the right of an airway would have simply changed the impact point by a mile or two away from where the intersection actually did occur. Of the 342 deaths since 1997 so far encouraged by the lack of a linear cruising altitude rule (like ACCAR) improvement to the fault intolerance of the hemispherical cruising altitude rules, only the head-on collision over the Amazon could have been prevented if either pilot had been flying an offset to the right of the airway centerline. In contrast, ACCAR systematically separates conflicting traffic in all airspace at all altitudes on any heading, whether over the middle of the ocean or over high-density multinational-interface continental airspace. Nothing about Reduced Vertical Separation Minima (RVSM) system design addresses the inherent vulnerability of the air traffic system to expected faults in hardware and human performance, as experienced in the Namibian, German, Amazon and Japanese accidents.5 ...|$|R

40|$|The European {{air traffic}} {{management}} (ATM) systems handles approximately 26, 000 flights daily. Forecasts indicate that the European air traffic levels going to be double by 2020. In addition, European ATM costs an additional 2 - 3 billion every year, compared to other similar systems in the world. 1 Taking into account this scenario, European ATM systems {{have to look for}} solutions for accommodates the increasing air traffic flows in the future airspaces, whilst cutting costs and improving its performance. One of these solutions came with the initiative of organizing airspace into functional blocks, according to traffic flows rather than to national borders. Such a project was not possible without common rules and procedures at European level. 1 The establishment of Functional Airspace blocks (FAB) shall enable optimum use of airspace taking into account air traffic flows. In the same way, FABs initiatives contain a new philosophy for design the airspace, the new airspace structures include application of Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA) concept, Free Route Airspace (FRA) blocks, night direct routes implementation, etc. Additionally, FAB blocks look for cooperation or fusion between Air Navigation Services providers (ANPs), all this with the goal of reduce air navigation services costs for users. Particularly, Free Route Airspace concept offers enormous benefits to airspace users, because permits to select the user-preferred trajectories with the optimal flight profile, enabling flights to operate outside a pre-defined route structure, resulting in shortest routes and big distances saving for airlines. Furthermore, free route blocks will significantly impact in ATC systems, changing the way for establish aircraft separation in these new airspace structures. For all these reasons, this thesis will study the functionality of the future Southwest Functional Airspace Block (SW FAB), specially the implementation of the Free Route Airspace concept, focused in the long term phase (2020) that includes Santiago-Asturias, Lisbon, Santa Maria <b>Oceanic</b> and Canarias <b>airspaces</b> in one free route airspace block. 2 Objectives 1. -Evaluate the Free Route Airspace block in the future Southwest Functional Airspace Block in terms of flight efficiency (fuel,CO 2,NM), ATC workload****. 2. -Study the interaction between Free Route Airspace and conventional airspace divided in sectors (flying with RNAV). 3. -Explore the future systems and procedures for traffic separation in Free route airspace. Methodology As was explained before, this thesis pretend to make an analysis of the free route airspace in the future SW FAB, for achieves this goal it will be necessary, firstly to explain the main concepts and background of: Flexible Use of Airspace (FUA), Functional Airspace Block (FAB) and Free Route Airspace (FRA), and others concepts.

50|$|In the North Atlantic Region {{pilots are}} {{expected}} to fly along the oceanic track center-line or 1 or 2 nautical miles to its right, randomly choosing one of these three offsets on each entry to <b>oceanic</b> <b>airspace.</b> The aim is to not achieve an overall even distribution of one-third of all flights {{on each of the}} three possible tracks, as one might assume. When the procedure was originally developed, 4.9 percent of aircraft in most oceans could not offset automatically, so the centerline had to remain as an option. Because of the possibility of opposite direction traffic on the centerline, it is the least desirable option, with the highest risk. The procedure lowers the overall risk of collision should an aircraft move vertically away from its assigned level. This randomization has the advantage over a planned assignment of offsets to each individual aircraft in that it mitigates the collision hazard for same-direction flights should an aircraft be erroneously flown along a track that was not assigned by ATC.|$|E

The forecast uncertainties result in uncertainties in conflict prediction, and thus, conflict resolution becomes less efficient.
