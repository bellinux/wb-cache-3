5|$|Killed in the {{airplane}} were the pilot Steven Altman, his brother Daniel, and his nephew Douglas. The helicopter tourists were in two groups; {{the first was}} Michele Norelli and his son, Filippo Norelli. The other group was Fabio Gallazzi, his wife, Tiziana Pedroni, and his son, Giacomo Gallazzi. The pilot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> was New Zealander Jeremy Clarke, who had logged 2,700 hours as a helicopter pilot. All recovered victims died from blunt trauma to the head, torso and extremities, according to the NYC medical examiner's office.|$|E
5|$|Six {{external}} hardpoints {{were located}} {{along the bottom}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter,</b> with two under each wing and two on the fuselage under the sponsons. The two inner wing hardpoints could carry pods of three TOW anti-tank missiles. 2.75-inch (70mm) rockets in 7-rocket or 19-rocket launchers could be carried on the four wing hardpoints. The two fuselage mounts were dedicated to carrying external fuel tanks. The wing hardpoints were also plumbed to allow the carriage of additional fuel tanks if required.|$|E
25|$|During {{this same}} period it was {{reported}} that 18 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SAAF's AgustaWestland AW109 helicopters have been grounded due to an accident involving one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> several months prior and a lack of funds for regular maintenance, however in November 2013 after five months <b>of</b> not flying, <b>the</b> grounding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> was lifted after more funds became available.|$|R
500|$|Final {{approval}} to acquire CH-47s was {{granted by the}} Australian Government in February 2010, seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> being ordered. A contract for these helicopters was signed on 19 March that year. The decision to increase the fleet size from six to seven was made to improve <b>the</b> robustness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Army's <b>helicopter</b> capacities, including by reducing <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopters.</b> <b>The</b> total cost <b>of</b> <b>the</b> CH-47F project, including <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> new facilities and <b>the</b> acquisition <b>of</b> two flight simulators, was $631 million.|$|R
50|$|Government {{officials}} and international dignitaries were travelling to the Naltar Valley where the Prime Minister was hosting lunch for <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diplomatic corps. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif {{was scheduled to}} travel by fixed-wing aircraft, while 32 foreign diplomats and their spouses as well as 25 other Pakistanis were flown in from Islamabad to Gilgit Airport hours earlier, from where a flight of four helicopters was scheduled to transport them to nearby Naltar. Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopters</b> had already landed at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident. <b>The</b> <b>helicopter</b> lost control and crashed while landing; <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crash {{has been attributed to}} mechanical failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter's</b> tail rotor.|$|R
5|$|Weapon turrets were {{mounted at}} {{the nose and}} the middle of {{aircraft}} underbelly. The nose turret could rotate +/- 100° from the aircraft's centerline and could mount either a 40mm (1.57in) grenade launcher, or a 7.62mm (0.308in) minigun. The belly turret included a 30mm (1.18in) automatic cannon with 360° of rotation. Mechanical stops prevented the belly turret from aiming at any part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the air {{ambulance}} prepares to land outside {{the emergency department}} a rotor blade is struck by a drone, causing the helicopter to crash land {{in the parking lot}} outside the hospital and into the back of an ambulance, causing the ambulance to knock scaffolding down over Alicia Munroe (Chelsea Halfpenny) and Ethan Hardy (George Rainsford). The tail <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> smashes into the entrance of the emergency department causing brutal injuries. The department is shut down following the incident, with Connie and Grace’s lives prioritised. Grace is freed from the helicopter and taken into the department for treatment. Connie learns Grace has life-threatening injuries and may not survive surgery. The staff at Holby City come together to treat casualties of the accident. Grace survives surgery, but remains in a critical condition.|$|E
5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the rotor, as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to replicate the half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter.</b>|$|E

One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missiles flew between <b>the</b> two <b>helicopters,</b> while <b>the</b> other struck <b>the</b> engine <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead <b>helicopter.</b> <b>The</b> <b>helicopter</b> was shot down near <b>the</b> village <b>of</b> Podrute, located in an area administered by <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Novi Marof, north <b>of</b> Zagreb. <b>The</b> second <b>helicopter</b> had to crash-land to evade the attack.|$|R
5|$|Leonard {{arrived at}} Irish Helicopters on 31 October and was {{introduced}} to the pilot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter,</b> Captain Thompson Boyes. Boyes was instructed to fly to a field in Stradbally, in order to pick up Leonard's photographic equipment. After landing Boyes saw two armed, masked men approaching the helicopter from nearby trees. Boyes was held at gunpoint and told he would not be harmed if he followed instructions. Leonard left with one gunman, while the other gunman climbed aboard the helicopter armed with a pistol and an Armalite rifle. Boyes was instructed to fly towards Dublin following the path of railway lines and the Royal Canal, and was ordered not to register his flight path with Air Traffic Control. As the helicopter approached Dublin, Boyes was informed of the escape plan and instructed to land in the exercise yard at Mountjoy Prison.|$|E
5|$|Raw's {{role in the}} Battle of Long Tan on 18 August 1966 was controversial. During the engagement, he {{initially}} refused to allow No. 9 Squadron to fly ammunition to D Company of the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment after it was heavily engaged and nearly surrounded, as {{he believed that the}} heavy rain at the time made flying too dangerous. The commander of the 1st Australian Task Force, Brigadier David Jackson, was angered by this decision and argued that the risk of losing a few helicopters was unimportant compared to the possibility of having 200 infantrymen killed if the unit was overrun {{due to a lack of}} ammunition and other supplies. Raw eventually allowed the resupply flight to proceed after the most experienced <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> pilots present stated that the mission needed to be flown regardless of its risk.|$|E
5|$|The air {{wings of}} the USS Enterprise and USS Coral Sea, were ready to provide close air support and {{anti-aircraft}} suppression if required with their A-6 and A-7 attack aircraft, and would provide continuous fighter cover the evacuation route including by VF-1 and VF-2, flying from the Enterprise with the first combat deployment of the new F-14 Tomcat. USAF aircraft operating out of Nakhon Phanom Air Base, Korat Air Base and U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand were also overhead for the duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> evacuation. A C-130 Airborne Command and Control controlled all US air operations over land. USAF F-4s, F-111s and A-7s provided air cover during daylight, being replaced by AC-130s from the 16th Special Operations Squadron at night. Strategic Air Command KC-135 tankers provided air-to-air refueling.|$|E

5|$|While the {{majority}} of the meerkats filmed were partially habituated, the cinematographers had to move carefully to avoid scaring the animals. The crew used radios to keep in contact with one another as they followed the meerkat groups around. Although the park normally prohibits low-flying aircraft, the production crew was given permission to film for three days using a low-flying helicopter. Mounted to its front underside was a new type of camera that was not affected by the shaking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter.</b> Full-color scenes depicting the birth of meerkat pups were obtained by filming captive meerkats at the Cotswold Wildlife Park in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Author Fred Brooks {{criticized the}} program's {{requirement}} for the Comanche {{to be capable of}} ferrying itself across the Atlantic as an example of excessive requirements being present in a project's design phase and of their costly repercussions. Williams observes that the Comanche's weight requirements were unachievable, and claimed that this was due to poor management, in which no party was allegedly aware of or in control of the rotorcraft's final weight; there were concerns that, when outfitted with actual equipment required for operations, the Comanche's engines would be incapable of lifting the total weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter.</b> Additionally, it has been claimed that it proved difficult to convince the Army that the program suffered from serious troubles while key individuals failed to realize the existence of insurmountable technical problems. Prized elements of the program, such as certain software capabilities and its integration, failed to foster confidence with Army overseers; several capabilities were viewed as having been unproven and risky, while the anticipated consumption of up to 40 per cent of the aviation budget by the Comanche alone {{for a number of years}} was considered to be extreme. According to Williams, it was concluded that the Army's aviation budget would be better spent on the delivery of less risky and more critical needs.|$|E
5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to help maintain what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E
25|$|The crash raised {{questions}} about <b>the</b> airworthiness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopters,</b> following from their grounding two years earlier from operational stress suffered by <b>the</b> core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotor blades, although the accident wasn't linked to that defect.|$|R

5|$|The film {{references}} Resident Evil, {{with the}} crash site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> being located in the Arklay Forest near the Arklay Mountains, where the Resident Evil series began. Other similarities include Jill's moves from the first game. The recording of Terri's death is similar to Kenneth's death. A white goddess statue {{can be seen in}} the church, with artwork of goddesses having a large role in the puzzles of the Resident Evil series. Whilst walking on the Arklay Overpass, Jill speculates that there is no way out, and that Ashford may just be watching them on the cameras, as if the whole thing were some sort of sick game. The games use a fixed camera perspective, which in most of the earlier games resembles a mounted camera's perspective. Another similarity includes a scene where Jill finds a gun under a pew, mirroring the game when the player finds ammunition or weapons in certain areas.|$|E
5|$|The game's design also {{received}} acclaim. Carter from Destructoid {{thought that the}} fortress and the outpost system provided players {{with a sense of}} accomplishment and success, and he considered having the freedom to use different ways to approach and complete missions one of the greatest parts of the game. In addition, Carter applauded the game's driving mechanics and the auto-drive feature, which he considered a significant improvement for the series. However he criticized the upgrade system, which he thought was directly converted from Far Cry 3 and was uninspiring. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Harmon thought that the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> was dull. Mitch Dyer, from IGN, praised the game's economy system, which he thought was satisfying. He added that it gives players motivations to complete side-quests. Justin McElroy of Polygon praised the introduction of the grappling hook and the vertical map-design, which he thought had allowed players to develop strategy before taking action. He also praised the game for allowing players to use multiple approaches towards a single objective.|$|E
5|$|With Kate {{convicted for}} Pope's murder, Merc plans {{a way for}} Faith to ambush the police convoy {{transporting}} her to prison, and Faith helps to free Kate. She gives Kate her comms unit that she and Merc use and tells her that he will guide her back to his hideout. When Faith returns to the hideout, she finds it in ruins, with Merc dying and Kate recaptured. In his dying words, Merc tells Faith that Kate {{is now at the}} Shard, which contains Mayor Callaghan's office and the servers that run the city's surveillance systems. With Miller's help, Faith is able to enter the Mayor's private offices, and destroys the servers that will unlock the rooftop security door. She gains access to the roof, but Miller is killed. On the roof, she finds Kate held at gunpoint by Jacknife. Jacknife reveals that he too is part of Project Icarus, and {{has been part of the}} plan all along to lure the Runners out of hiding. When Jacknife tries to take Kate onto a waiting helicopter, Faith jumps on before it can leave, knocking Jacknife out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>helicopter</b> to fall to his death but also damaging the helicopter in the process. Faith helps Kate to escape safely from the falling helicopter.|$|E
