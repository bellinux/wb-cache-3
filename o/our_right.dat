25|$|In {{the last}} 6 months we've seen that {{government}} agencies, namely the NSA and GCHQ and others, have broken laws and twisted legal interpretations {{to create an}} infrastructure of mass surveillance {{of all of us}} online. This creates a dark form of censorship as people become afraid to speak freely -- and it's one that undermines our security and <b>our</b> <b>right</b> to privacy as well. As users of the Internet, {{we have a responsibility to}} defend its freedom.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, the British felt {{disenchanted with}} Indian {{reaction}} to social change. Until the rebellion, they had enthusiastically pushed through social reform, like {{the ban on}} sati by Lord William Bentinck. It was now felt that traditions and customs in India were too strong and too rigid to be changed easily; consequently, no more British social interventions were made, especially in matters dealing with religion, even when the British felt very strongly about the issue (as in the instance of the remarriage of Hindu child widows). This was exemplified further in Queen Victoria's Proclamation released immediately after the rebellion. The proclamation stated that 'We disclaim alike <b>our</b> <b>Right</b> and Desire to impose Our Convictions on any of Our Subjects'; demonstrating official British commitment to abstaining from social intervention in India.|$|E
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as that lesson is not understood, we all will find <b>our</b> <b>right</b> to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

500|$|Hubbard {{took three}} major new {{initiatives}} {{in the face}} of these challenges. [...] "Ethics Technology" [...] was introduced to tighten internal discipline within Scientology. It required Scientologists to [...] "disconnect" [...] from any organization or individual—including family members—deemed to be disruptive or [...] "suppressive". According to church-operated websites, “A person who disconnects is simply exercising his right to communicate or not to communicate with a particular person." [...] Hubbard stated: “Communication, however, is a two-way flow. If one has the right to communicate, then one must also have the right to not receive communication from another. It is this latter corollary of the right to communicate that gives us <b>our</b> <b>right</b> to privacy.” Scientologists were also required to write [...] "Knowledge Reports" [...] on each other, reporting transgressions or misapplications of Scientology methods. Hubbard promulgated a long list of punishable [...] "Misdemeanors", [...] "Crimes", and [...] "High Crimes". The [...] "Fair Game" [...] policy was introduced, which was applicable to anyone deemed an [...] "enemy" [...] of Scientology: [...] "May be deprived of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{attempting}} {{to apply the}} Near and Pentagon Papers standards, the court {{was concerned about the}} prospect of publication causing the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and potentially a global nuclear holocaust. The government did not {{go so far as to}} claim that publication might pose an immediate or inevitable danger, only that it [...] "would substantially increase the risk that thermonuclear weapons would become available or available at an earlier date to those who do not now have them. If this should occur, it would undermine our nonproliferation policy, irreparably impair the national security of the United States, and pose a threat to the peace and security of the world." [...] However, the court still found that [...] "a mistake in ruling against the United States could pave the way for thermonuclear annihilation for us all. In that event, <b>our</b> <b>right</b> to life is extinguished and the right to publish becomes moot", and that publication could indeed cause [...] "grave, direct, immediate and irreparable harm to the United States", thereby meeting the test the Supreme Court had enunciated in the Pentagon Papers case. The preliminary injunction was therefore granted.|$|E
500|$|The Colmar Pocket was [...] in the Vosges Mountains and {{had been}} held by German troops since November 1944. Murphy was still hospitalized on 15 December when General O'Daniel moved the 3rd Infantry Division into the area. Murphy {{described}} it as [...] "a huge and dangerous bridgehead thrusting west of the Rhine like an iron fist. Fed with men and materiel from across the river, it is a constant threat to <b>our</b> <b>right</b> flank; and potentially it is a perfect springboard from which the enemy could start a powerful counterattack." [...] He rejoined his platoon on 14 January 1945, the date Lieutenant General Jacob Devers ordered the 3rd Division reinforced by the 28th Infantry Division. The 3rd Division engaged in sixteen days of battle to secure the bridgeheads west of the Rhine at the Colmar Canal. After crossing the Ill river through the Riedwihr Woods on 24 January, the 3rd Division was ordered {{to the town of}} Holtzwihr, where they met with a strong German counterattack. Two officers in the division were killed by mortar shells in an attack the following day during which Murphy was wounded in both legs, and for which he received a second Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart.|$|E
500|$|On April 2, 2014, the News Journal {{reported}} that Bevin {{spoke at a}} pro-cockfighting rally in Corbin, Kentucky. Asked about his attendance, Bevin said he understood that the rally was a states' rights event: [...] "I {{was the first person}} to speak and then I left." [...] Organizers of the event, which was closed to the media, said there was [...] "never any ambiguity" [...] regarding its purpose, and WAVE in Louisville published an undercover video from the event showing that Bevin was the third speaker; the speaker who immediately preceded Bevin said the rally was held [...] "for the sole purpose of legalizing gamecock fighting at the state level." [...] Bevin told a WAVE reporter, [...] "I honestly wasn't even paying attention. I was thinking about what I was going to say. I don't even remember him saying that." [...] The WAVE video also showed an attendee asking Bevin if he would support the legalization of cockfighting in Kentucky, to which he replied, [...] "I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is <b>our</b> <b>right</b> to decide what it is that we want to do, and not the federal government's. Criminalizing behavior, if it's part of the heritage of this state, is in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it." [...] Bevin was referencing the Agricultural Act of 2014, commonly called the [...] "farm bill", which contained a provision that criminalized spectators at cockfighting events.|$|E
