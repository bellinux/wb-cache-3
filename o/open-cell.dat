25|$|Sponge {{filters and}} corner filters (sometimes called box filters) work by {{essentially}} the same mechanism as an internal filter. Both generally work by airlift, using bubbles from an air pump rising in a tube to create flow. In a sponge filter, the inlet may only be covered by a simple <b>open-cell</b> block of foam. A corner filter is slightly more complex. These filters are often placed in the corner {{on the bottom of}} the aquarium. Water enters slits in the box, passes through a layer of medium, then exits through the airlift tube to return to the aquarium. These filters tend to only be suitable for small and lightly stocked aquaria. The sponge filter is especially useful for rearing fry where the sponge prevents the small fish from entering the filter.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{examines}} the foam density, average cell sizes, and cell structure of four polystyrene (PS) blended with calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) or {{low density polyethylene}} (LDPE) at various ratios. The PS/CaCO 3 and PS/LDPE are foamed by carbon dioxide (CO 2) under supercritical conditions. CaCO 3 and LDPE can strongly influence the foam density, average cell sizes, and cell structure of PS foams. Based on the result of PS/CaCO 3 foams and PS/LDPE foams, the thermal conductivity of large porous PS foams as core materials used in vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) is further studied. Large porous PS foams are produced by the mixture of CO 2 and fluorocarbon or the mixture of CO 2 and nitrogen (N 2) as foaming agents. The content of <b>open-cells</b> in PS foams is affected by materials, foaming temperatures, and foaming agents. A higher content of <b>open-cells</b> in a porous PS foam {{can lead to a}} lower and more stable thermal conductivity of VIPs...|$|R
40|$|Thanks to its planar structure, {{graphene}} {{is characterized}} by unique properties, such as excellent chemical inactivity, high electrical and thermal conductivity, high optical transparency, extraordinary flexibility and high mechanical resistance, which make it suitable in a very wide range of applications. This paper details {{the state of the}} art in graphene coating applied to aluminum <b>open-cells</b> foams for the improvement of their mechanical and thermal behavior. Metallic foams are highly porous materials with extremely high convective heat transfer coefficients, thanks to their complex structure of three-dimensional <b>open-cells.</b> Graphene nanoplatelets have been used to improve thermal conductivity of aluminum foams, to make them better suitable during heat transfer in transient state. Also, an improvement of mechanical resistance has been observed. Before electrodeposition, all the samples have been subjected to sandblasting process, to eliminate the oxide layer on the surface, enabling a better adhesion of the coating. Different nanoparticles of graphene have been used. The experimental findings revealed a higher thermal conductivity for aluminum open cells foams electroplated with graphene. Considered the relatively low process costs and the improvements obtainable, these materials are very promising in many technological fields. The topics covered include surface modification, electrochemical plating, thermo-graphic analysis...|$|R

50|$|<b>Open-cell</b> foam is porous so it {{will let}} gasses through which could {{otherwise}} cause blistering of the sealant.

40|$|In {{this study}} the static and dynamic {{characteristics}} of conventional open cell polyurethane (PU), of auxetic (negative Poisson’s ratio) and of iso-density foams were analysed. The specimens were produced from conventional gray <b>open-cells</b> polyurethane foam with 30 - 35 pores/inch and 0. 0027 g/cm 3 density, {{by means of}} process which has been previously defi ned by the authors. Poisson’s ratio measurements were performed under quasi-static conditions using an MTS 858 servo-hydraulic test machine and a video image acquisition system. For the auxetic foams the results suggested similar behaviour to that previously reported in the literature, with signifi cant increases in stiffness during compressive loading, and a signifi cant dependence of the Poisson’s ratio on the applied strain. Transmissibility tests, performed {{in accordance with the}} ISO 13753 procedure for antivibration glove materials, suggested a strong dependence of the transmissibility on the foam manufacturing parameters.

40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} the air heat transfer and fluid flow through <b>open-cells</b> copper foam samples with different number of pores {{per unit of}} length (PPI) with constant porosity (ε= 0. 93) and foam core height of 40 mm. The experimental heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop measurements were carried out during air forced convection through electrically heated copper foams; the data points are collected in a dedicated test rig. The experimental measurements permit to understand {{the effects of the}} pore density on the heat transfer and fluid flow performance of the foams. Present data relative to copper foam samples are compared against present authors experimental measurements for 40 mm high aluminum foams at the same operative test conditions. The paper presents experimental heat transfer coefficients, pressure gradients, permeability, inertia and drag coefficients; moreover, it also reports two meaningful parameters: the normalized mean wall temperature and the pumping power per area density that permit to compare different enhanced surfaces, which can be considered suitable for electronic thermal management...|$|R
40|$|Blends of CO 2 ̆ 082 and n-pentane were {{extruded}} in polystyrene. Rheological {{characterization of}} the system using the on-line slit die showed that n-pentane is a more effective plasticizer than CO 2 ̆ 082 on an equivalent molar basis. This {{is consistent with previous}} findings indicating that larger gas molecules create more internal spacing at the molecular level. Solubility and homogeneity of the blends was also probed using ultrasonic monitoring. It was observed that degassing pressure in CO 2 ̆ 082 /n-pentane blends was CO 2 ̆ 082 -dependant only. This feature enables to increase the global gas loading in a foaming system in order to improve the expansion ratio without compromising on the gas pressure exiting the die, which may cause extrusion defects. Moreover, adding a lower diffusing agent such as n-pentane is expected to decrease the overall diffusion rate of the blend. Foam characterization results revealed that incorporating n-pentane to CO 2 ̆ 082 lowered the density further while producing foam samples comtaining virtually no <b>open-cells</b> as compared to its pure CO 2 ̆ 082 counterpart.

40|$|The {{action of}} {{polymyxin}} B (0. 1 μM) on ATP-sensitive K+ (K+ ATP) channels in RINm 5 F insulin-secreting cells was investigated by patch-clamp techniques. Using inside-out patches, <b>open-cells</b> and outside-out patches, polymyxin B {{was found to}} block K+ ATP channels by, on average, approximately 90 - 95 of the initial control level of channel activity. The effects were rapid in onset, sustained and readily reversible. Similar effects were found in patches excised from cells pretreated overnight with 1 μM of the phorbol ester phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). External block of channels {{was associated with a}} marked decrease in single-channel current amplitude, whereas these effects were not seen when polymyxin B was added to the inside face of the membrane. In patches bathed with internally applied ATP (0. 5 mM) and ADP (0. 5 mM), polymyxin B inhibited channels but its actions were not reversible upon removal of the compound. However, when the same protocol was undertaken upon cells pre-treated with PMA, the effects of polymyxin B were readily reversed. Our data suggests that polymyxin B is a novel modulator of K+ ATP channels, exhibiting multiple blocking actions that may possibly involve a direct effect upon the channel and indirect effects mediated through the inhibition of endogenous protein kinase(s). © 1994 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
40|$|As NASA pursues the {{exploration}} mission, advanced propulsion {{for the next}} generation of spacecraft will be needed. These new propulsion systems will require higher performance and increased durability, despite current limitations on materials. A break-through technology is needed in the thrust chamber. In this paper the idea of using a porous metallic foam is examined for its potential cooling enhancement capabilities. The goal is to increase the chamber wall cooling without creating an additional pressure drop penalty. A feasibility study based on experiments at laboratory-scale conditions was performed and analysis at rocket conditions is underway. In the experiment, heat transfer and pressure drop data were collected using air as the coolant in a copper or nickel foam filled annular channel. The foam-channel performance was evaluated based on comparison with conventional microchannel cooling passages under equal pressure drop conditions. The heat transfer enhancement of the foam channel over the microchannel ranges from 130 % to 172 %. The enhancement is relatively independent of the pressure drop and increases with decreasing pore size. A direct numerical simulation model of the foam heat exchange has been built. The model is based on the actual metal foam microstructure of thin ligaments (0. 2 - 0. 3 mm in diameter) that form a network of interconnected <b>open-cells.</b> The cell dimension is around 2 mm. The numerical model was built using the FLUENT CFD code. Comparison of the pressure drop results predicted by the current model with those experimental data of Leong and Jin [8] shows favorable comparisons. Pressure drop predictions have been made using hydrogen as a coolant at typical rocket conditions. Conjugate heat transfer analysis using the foam filled channel is planned for the future...|$|R
