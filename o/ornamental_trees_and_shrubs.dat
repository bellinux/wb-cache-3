2500|$|The {{greatest}} monument of this period, {{executed in}} {{the reign of}} Chandragupta Maurya, was the old palace {{at the site of}} Kumhrar. Excavations at the site of Kumhrar nearby have unearthed the remains of the palace. The palace is thought to have been an aggregate of buildings, the most important of which was an immense pillared hall supported on a high substratum of timbers. The pillars were set in regular rows, thus dividing the hall into a number of smaller square bays. The number of columns is 80, each about [...] meters high. According to the eyewitness account of Megasthenes, the palace was chiefly constructed of timber, and was considered to exceed in splendour and magnificence the palaces of Susa and Ecbatana, its gilded pillars being adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The buildings stood in an extensive park studded with fish ponds and furnished with a great variety of <b>ornamental</b> <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrubs.</b> Kauṭilya's Arthashastra also gives the method of palace construction from this period. Later fragments of stone pillars, including one nearly complete, with their round tapering shafts and smooth polish, indicate that Ashoka was responsible for the construction of the stone columns which replaced the earlier wooden ones.|$|E

The initial material includes the <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrubs</b> of Serbia, <b>and</b> the methods are the comparative morpho-physiological analysis, ionising radiation and chemical half-sib tests Spontaneous mutations in our country have been recorded more frequently since the sixties and the study of intra-variability of <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrubs</b> in Serbia has been intensified. They include the changes of growth habit, character of increment, abnormalities in the structure of vegetative and generative organs. By selection and vegetative propagation, numerous <b>ornamental</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> varieties have been synthesised over a more or less long period. After the discovery of the vigour of triploid mutants trees, their mass production has been elaborated: by crossing triploid <b>and</b> diploid <b>trees</b> By the treatment of the reproductive material by ionising radiation (UV, gamma rays, terminal neutrons), and chemical materials, the frequency of mutations increased drastically, especially with higher doses up to 100 % in the treated organisms. The mutants have, as a rule, reduced growth elements, reduced adaptation, and when selected and propagated vegetatively, they ensure a rich initial material for the synthesis of numerous <b>ornamental</b> cultivars of <b>trees</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrubs.</b> The method of radiation breeding is the most promising for the improvement of ornamental plants, while mass production of triploid mutants is the only method used in the improvement of forest trees...|$|R

40|$|Comminution is a {{critical}} process in biomass supply chains and can be conducted with either chippers or grinders. These machines use different work tools(knives and hammers, respectively) and are applied to different feedstock types, but few studies {{are available on the}} inherent differences between the two technologies. A versatile grinder, alternatively equipped with hammers and knives, was studied to investigate the effect of tool type on machine productivity, fuel consumption, and product quality. The machine was powered by an agricultural tractor rigged with a flow meter, a torque meter, and shaft revolution meter for determining fuel consumption, power output, and engine speed. Three different feedstock types were processed: discarded pallets, solid logs, and residues from park maintenance, the latter consisting of branches from <b>ornamental</b> <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrub</b> species. Depending on feedstock type, the knife configuration was 30 - 80 % (average 50 %) more productive than the hammer configuration and required 15 - 30 % (average 24 %) less energy per unit of product. Fuel consumption per dry ton was 30 - 75 % (average 52 %) higher for the hammer configuration. That held true for all feedstock types. Product quality was better for the knife configuration, except for park maintenance residues. In general, hammers should be limited to product with severe contamination that prevents the efficient use of knives. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
