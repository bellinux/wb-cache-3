5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% greater than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the Sun in the element helium.|$|E

5|$|Altair is a type-A main {{sequence}} star with approximately 1.8 times the mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> 11 times its luminosity. Altair possesses an extremely rapid rate of rotation; {{it has a}} rotational period of approximately 9 hours. For comparison, the equator of the Sun requires {{a little more than}} 25 days for a complete rotation. This rapid rotation forces Altair to be oblate; its equatorial diameter is over 20 percent greater than its polar diameter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given the very small mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> planets.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is {{inclined}} only about 5.145° to the ecliptic and the Sun is always very near the ecliptic, eclipses always occur on or near it. Because of the inclination of the Moon's orbit, eclipses do not occur at every conjunction and opposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> Moon, but only when the Moon is near an ascending or descending node {{at the same time}} it is at conjunction or opposition. The ecliptic is so named because the ancients noted that eclipses only occurred when the Moon crossed it.|$|E

5|$|Beta Hydri, the {{brightest}} star in Hydrus, is a yellow star of apparent magnitude 2.8, lying 24 light-years from Earth. It has about 104% of the mass <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> 181% of the Sun's radius, with {{more than three times the}} Sun's luminosity. The spectrum of this star matches a stellar classification of G2IV, with the luminosity class of 'IV' indicating this is a subgiant star. As such, it is a slightly more evolved star than the Sun, with the supply of hydrogen fuel at its core becoming exhausted. It is the nearest subgiant star to the Sun and one of the oldest stars in the solar neighbourhood. Thought to be between 6.4 and 7.1 billion years old, this star bears some resemblance to what the Sun may look like in the far distant future, making it an object of interest to astronomers. It is also the closest bright star to the south celestial pole.|$|E
