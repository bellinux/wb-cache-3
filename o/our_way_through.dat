It cited Andrew Ryder, a theologian at All Hallows College in Dublin, who wrote, [...] "While he may not use the language of traditional Christian spirituality, Tolle is very much concerned that, as we make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the ordinary events of the day, we keep in touch with the deepest source of our being." ...|$|E
500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} that some first season episodes were too neatly wrapped and solved, Jeff Pinkner commented {{towards the end}} of that season, [...] "We found that, absolutely, early on, we were falling into the trap of—the tease would be fantastic. And then we would too quickly answer it and [...] the tension. And we've tried to course-correct and have the tease promise" [...] questions that don't get answered right away. He further elaborated that the goal now is to [...] "have the energy of the show get bigger as [...] goes along... We're learning how to tell this version of a detective story. It's not really a police procedural. There are elements of that. But it's an incredible mish-mash of genres. I think we're getting better at finding <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> these stories." ...|$|E
500|$|Aspinall later commented {{about his}} first meeting with George Harrison, who also {{attended}} the Liverpool Institute: [...] "My first encounter with George was behind the school’s air-raid shelters. [...] This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It {{was one of the first}} cigarettes either of us had smoked. We spluttered <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> it bravely but gleefully. After that the three of us did lots of ridiculous things together.... By the time we were ready to take the GCE exams we added John Lennon to our 'Mad Lad' gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime." [...] Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, but failed the French exam. He left school in July 1959, and studied accountancy. [...] Aspinall worked for a Liverpool company for two years, receiving a wage of £2-10s–0d. (£2.50 decimal equivalent) per week as a trainee accountant.|$|E

500|$|Empire {{magazine}} rated it five {{stars in}} the August2010 issue and wrote, [...] "it feels like Stanley Kubrick adapting {{the work of the}} great sci-fi author William Gibson ... Nolan delivers another true original: welcome to an undiscovered country." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B+ rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "It's a rolling explosion of images as hypnotizing and sharply angled as any in a drawing by M. C. Escher or a state-of-the-biz video game; the backwards splicing of Nolan's own Memento looks rudimentary by comparison." [...] The New York Post gave the film a four-star rating and Lou Lumenick wrote, [...] "DiCaprio, who has never been better as the tortured hero, draws you in with a love story that will appeal even to non-sci-fi fans." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars and said that Inception [...] "is all about process, about fighting <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> enveloping sheets of reality and dream, reality within dreams, dreams without reality. It's a breathtaking juggling act." [...] Richard Roeper, also of the Sun-Times, gave Inception a perfect score of [...] "A+" [...] and called it [...] "one of the best movies of the [...] century." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart from {{a change}} in musical style, the band changed the way they recorded. [...] "It {{was the first time}} we sort of jammed," [...] Coxon revealed. [...] "We've never really jammed before. We've been quite white-coaty, overall about recording, like in a laboratory. Yeah, we did {{actually}} feel <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> just playing whatever came to our minds and editing, which was really exciting." [...] "We just played together for two weeks in a way we hadn't done since 1991," [...] Dave recalls. [...] "We wanted to purify the sound, to not have anything there not played by us. We reasoned that if we made small changes at the input end, we could effect large changes in the output." [...] According to producer Stephen Street, [...] "Blur had decided that commercial pressures and writing hit singles wasn't going to be the main consideration any more. The mood in the studio was very different to when I'd first worked with them." [...] "In the studio, once we got past those first few days, where I felt everyone was treading on eggshells, there was a great atmosphere. I think it was because they didn't want to be competing with anyone on this record, they wanted to make a record that would help keep the band together." [...] Street had acquired a new piece of hardware, described as [...] "muso-ish to talk about but really useful" [...] which enabled him to sample loops and otherwise cut-and-paste entire sections of the band's jam sessions.|$|E
2500|$|On October 9, Philippe Danielides, {{a senior}} adviser to Samson, e-mailed Wildstein a daily news summary and asked [...] "Has any thought been given to writing an op-ed or {{providing}} a statement about the GWB study?

2500|$|... "Plain Language from Truthful James" [...] (or [...] "The Heathen Chinee") {{was very}} popular among general readers. One New York {{newspaper}} {{reported on the}} frenzy over the poem: [...] "Strolling down Broadway... we saw a crowd of men and boys, {{of high and low}} degree, swarming about a shop-window, pushing, laughing, and struggling... Elbowing <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> the crowd, we discovered an illustrated copy of Bret Harte's poem 'The Heathen Chinee.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Much {{has been}} made over {{the years of the}} unusual {{question}} mark suffix to the band's name. In early interviews the band said that the name was [...] "really deep" [...] and intended to raise the question [...] "do you need therapy?", but in a 1992 interview guitarist Andy Cairns admitted that it was a chance design when he was working on band's first record sleeve. Working with Letraset transfers, Cairns misaligned the band's name, and used the [...] "?" [...] icon to fill the space to the right. [...] "And then we thought, well maybe we can bluff <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> when people start reading into it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 26, 2008, Secretary Paulson said in remarks at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, “As we work <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> this turbulence, our highest {{priority}} is limiting {{its impact on}} the real economy. We must maintain stable, orderly and liquid financial markets and our banks must continue to play their vital role of supporting the economy by making credit available to consumers and businesses. And we must of course focus on housing, which precipitated the turmoil in the capital markets, and is today the biggest downside risk to our economy. We must work to limit the impact of the housing downturn on the real economy without impeding the completion of the necessary housing correction. I will address each of these in turn. Regulators and policy makers are vigilant; we are not taking anything for granted.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In the lead-up to the 2010 federal election, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated [...] "I {{believe that}} this nation should be a republic. I also {{believe that this}} nation has got a deep affection for Queen Elizabeth." [...] It was her view {{that it would be}} {{appropriate}} for Australia to become a republic only once Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends. On the process for becoming a republic, Gillard said [...] "What I would like to see as the prime minister is that we work <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> to an agreement on a republic." [...] In 2010, then opposition leader Tony Abbott, who previously served as Executive Director of Australians for Constitutional Monarchy, supported the status quo. He opined: [...] "While there may very well be further episodes of republicanism in this country, I am far from certain that, at least in our lifetimes, there's likely to be any significant change." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sociologist Susie Scott {{challenged}} the interpretation {{and treatment of}} shyness as being pathological. [...] "By treating shyness as an individual pathology, ... we forget that {{this is also a}} socially oriented state of mind that is socially produced and managed." [...] She explores the idea that [...] "shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual", and concludes that, to some extent, [...] "we are all impostors, faking <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> social life". One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: [...] "Sometimes I want to take my cue from the militant disabled lobbyists and say, 'hey, it's not MY problem, it's society's'. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys are probably more sensitive, and nicer people, than 'normals'. I shouldn't have to change: society should adapt to meet my needs." ...|$|E
2500|$|There, Nicholls said he met Monsier le Docteur Brachie, {{a leading}} {{physician}} and [...] "multimillionaire of the place". Brachie said, [...] "I want {{a golf course}} in Aix-les-Basin. Far up on the mountain side I {{have a piece of}} land. After breakfast we will take the mules and look over this property with a view to building a course there". Nicholls mentioned that difficulties were encountered in viewing the land {{due to the fact that}} it was heavily wooded. [...] "I saw some beautiful olive and fig trees, but more important, I also saw 60 husky Italian laborers equipped and ready to work. After threading <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> this mountainous woodland and taking another look at the 60 huskies, I promised to give Monsier Le Docteur a golf course in six weeks", said Nicholls. Brachie retorted, [...] "Nicholls, if you can do that the Bank of France is open to you. Moreover, I will have King Leopold of the Belgians and King George of Greece present for the grand opening".|$|E

2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E
