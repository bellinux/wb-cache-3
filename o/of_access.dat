5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic imbalance between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds <b>of</b> <b>access</b> points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points <b>of</b> <b>access.</b> Singapore for example has only one point <b>of</b> <b>access,</b> while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic imbalance for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E

40|$|It {{is common}} to embed {{instruments}} when developing integrated circuits (ICs). These instruments are accessed at post-silicon validation, debugging, wafer sort, package test, burn-in, printed circuit board bring-up, {{printed circuit board assembly}} manufacturing test, power-on self-test, and operator-driven in-field test. At any of these scenarios, it is <b>of</b> interest to <b>access</b> some but not all of the instruments. IEEE 1149. 1 - 2013 and IEEE 1687 propose Test Access Port based (TAP-based) mechanisms to design flexible scan networks such that any combination of instruments can be <b>accessed</b> from outside <b>of</b> the IC. Previous works optimize TAP-based scan networks for one scenario with a known number <b>of</b> <b>accesses.</b> However, at design time, it is difficult to foresee all needed scenarios and the exact number <b>of</b> <b>accesses</b> to instruments. Moreover, the number <b>of</b> <b>accesses</b> might change due to late design changes, addition/exclusion of tests, and changes of constraints. In this paper, we analyze and compare seven IEEE 1687 compatible network design approaches in terms <b>of</b> instrument <b>access</b> time, hardware overhead, and robustness. Given the similarities between IEEE 1149. 1 - 2013 and IEEE 1687, the conclusions are also applicable to IEEE 1149. 1 - 2013 networks...|$|R
