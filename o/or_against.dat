5|$|Adult solitary wasps {{spend most}} of their time in {{preparing}} their nests and foraging for food for their young, mostly insects or spiders. Their nesting habits are more diverse than those of social wasps. Many species dig burrows in the ground. Mud daubers and pollen wasps construct mud cells in sheltered places. Potter wasps similarly build vase-like nests from mud, often with multiple cells, attached to the twigs of trees <b>or</b> <b>against</b> walls.|$|E

5|$|Along with {{offering}} {{emotional support}} {{to both the}} patient and family, palliative care serves {{an important role in}} addressing goals of care. People with Parkinson's may have many difficult decisions to make as the disease progresses such as wishes for feeding tube, non-invasive ventilator, and tracheostomy; wishes for <b>or</b> <b>against</b> cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and when to use hospice care. Palliative care team members can help answer questions and guide people with Parkinson's on these complex and emotional topics to help them make the best decision based on their own values.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics have {{no effect}} against viral infections <b>or</b> <b>against</b> the viruses that cause the common cold. Due to their side effects, {{antibiotics}} cause overall harm but are still frequently prescribed. Some {{of the reasons that}} antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics. There are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.|$|E

5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking facts and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more facts and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for <b>or</b> <b>against</b> it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of facts, and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E

5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, <b>or</b> <b>against</b> the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E
