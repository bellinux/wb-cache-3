500|$|The {{heat-affected zone}} (HAZ) is a ring {{surrounding}} the weld {{in which the}} temperature of the welding process, combined with the stresses of uneven heating and cooling, alter the heat-treatment properties of the alloy. The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimental—depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used, the HAZ can be of varying size and strength. The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large role—if the diffusivity is high, the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Conversely, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well, as processes like <b>oxyacetylene</b> <b>welding</b> have an unconcentrated heat input and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser beam welding give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input. To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures, the following formula can be used: ...|$|E

25|$|Since {{the melted}} metal flows {{out of the}} workpiece, there must be room on the {{opposite}} side of the workpiece for the spray to exit. When possible, pieces of metal are cut on a grate that lets the melted metal fall freely to the ground. The same equipment can be used for <b>oxyacetylene</b> blowtorches and <b>welding</b> torches, by exchanging the part of the torch in front of the torch valves.|$|R
50|$|In common welding practices, {{the welding}} surface {{needs to be}} {{prepared}} to ensure the strongest weld possible. Preparation is needed for all forms of welding and all types of joints. Generally, butt welds require very little preparation, but some is still needed for the best results. Plate edges can be prepared for butt joints in various ways, but the five most common techniques are <b>oxyacetylene</b> cutting (oxy-fuel <b>welding</b> and cutting), machining, chipping, grinding, and air carbon-arc cutting or gouging.

In 1932, he installed a forge and anvil in his studio at the farm in Bolton Landing that he and Dehner had bought a few years earlier. Smith started by making three-dimensional objects from wood, wire, coral, soldered metal and other found materials but soon graduated to using an <b>oxyacetylene</b> torch to <b>weld</b> metal heads, which are probably the first welded metal sculptures ever made in the United States.

The development and advantages of arc-based welding processes have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding equipment is quite versatile – {{not only because the}} torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. Bell Canada cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manholes and in some aerial locations. <b>Oxyacetylene</b> <b>welding</b> may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in many metal fabrication shops. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi, if subjected to a shockwave (caused for example by a flashback), acetylene decomposes explosively into hydrogen and carbon.|$|E

In building construction today some lead flashing is welded but soldered copper flashing is much more common in America. In the automotive body collision industry before the 1980s, <b>oxyacetylene</b> gas torch <b>welding</b> was seldom used to weld sheetmetal, since warpage was a byproduct besides the excess heat. Automotive body repair methods at the time were crude and yielded improprieties until MIG welding became the industry standard.

After the 1980s, the oxyacetylene torch fell out of use for sheetmetal welding in the industrialized world.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} some {{options for}} weld repairs {{to the outer}} shell of the dome on the U. S. Capitol. During the past 140 years, corrosion products have built up within many of the joints, leading to cracking {{of some of the}} iron castings that form the shell. Since the dome is a national landmark, the goal is to restore the structural integrity of the original castings, replacing as few of the components as is absolutely necessary. While mechanical joining of the fractures or filling of the gaps with epoxy are alternative procedures, a fused (leak-tight) and ductile joint is preferred. A major challenge is that the castings were produced with 1850 's technology, so the composition is far different from current castings that are designed for weld repair. Therefore, we chose to develop some alternative approaches, designed specifically for the dome castings. Of the various options, <b>oxyacetylene</b> braze <b>welding</b> (a flame repair process where the filler metal melts at a temperature below that of the casting) with low-fuming bronze (about 60 Cu- 40 Zn) worked best. The bronze forms joints that are very similar in strength to the castings. A joining trial in July 2002 demonstrated the utility of this technique in the flat and vertical positions at four corner cracks on the dome.

40|$|Increased use of {{automated}} welding {{in recent years}} has demonstrated deficiencies in our understanding of the factors controlling the geometry of the weid pool. In the present paper, all fusion welding processes are categorized in terms of the welding power density delivered {{to the surface of the}} workpiece. It is shown that there are three regimes of power density in which different factors control the weld shape. In the low heat density regime, characterized by <b>oxyacetylene</b> and electroslag <b>welding,</b> convection within the metal and slag pools controls the heat transport. In the medium heat density regime, characterized by most arc welding processes, a number of phenomena have been shown to have an influence on weld pool shape; ho~v ever, no formalism has been developed which allmvs a pi"io·pi estimation of the weld geometry. In the high heat density regime, characterized by elec-tron beam and laser welding, metal evaporation is known to be important, but little has been done to quantify the effects of this evaporation. In each regime, but particularly in the high and medium heat density regimes, the shape of the weld pool is strongly dependent upon the composition of the base metal.
