The system is simulated {{with a range of}} organic working fluids and its performance is optimised for operation in the UK climate. The findings are applicable to similar geographical locations with significant cloud coverage, a low solar resource and limited installation areas. A key feature of the system’s design is the implementation of fixed fluid flow-rates during operation in order to avoid penalties in the performance of components suffered at part-load. Steady operation under varying solar irradiance conditions is provided by way of a working-fluid buffer vessel at the evaporator outlet, which is maintained at the evaporation temperature and pressure of the ORC. By incorporating a two-stage solar collector/evaporator configuration, a maximum net annual electrical work output of 1070 kWh yr− 1 (continuous average power of 122 W) and a solar-to-electrical efficiency of 6. 3 % is reported with HFC- 245 ca as the working fluid at an optimal evaporation temperature of 126 ◦C (corresponding to an evaporation pressure of 16. 2 bar).

40|$|Coffee {{roasting}} is {{a highly}} energy intensive process {{with much of the}} energy being lost in intermittent cycles as discharged heat from the stack. In this work, combined heat and power (CHP) systems based on micro gas-turbines (MGT) are investigated for providing heat to the roasting process. Much of the heat released in a coffee roaster is from the afterburner that heats up the flue gases to high temperatures in order to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other pollutants. An interesting solution for utilizing waste heat is assessed through energy and material balances of a rotating drum coffee roasting with partial hot gas recycling. A cost assessment methodology is adopted to compare the profitability of three proposed system configurations integrated into the process. The case study of a major coffee torrefaction plant with 500 kg/h production capacity is assumed to carry out the thermo-economic assessment, under the Italian energy framework. The CHP options under investigation are: (i) regenerative topping MGT coupled to the existing modulating gas burner to generate hot air for the roasting process; (ii) intermittent waste-heat recovery from the hot flue-gases through an <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> (ORC) <b>engine</b> coupled to a thermal storage buffer; and (iii) non-regenerative topping MGT with direct recovery of turbine outlet air for the roasting process by means of an afterburner that modulates the heat demand of the roasting process. The results show that the profitability of these investments is highly influenced by the natural gas/electricity cost ratio, by the coffee torrefaction production capacity and by the intermittency level of discharged heat. The MGT appears as a more profitable option than waste-heat recovery via the ORC engine due to the intermittency of the heat source and the relatively high electricity/heat cost ratio...|$|R

A model of the Up-THERM engine is developed via lumped dynamic descriptions of the various engine sub-components and electrical analogies founded on previously developed thermoacoustic principles. These are extended here to include a description of phase change and non-linear descriptions of selected processes. The predicted first and second law efficiencies and the power output of a particular Up- THERM engine design aimed for operation in a specified CHP application with heat source and sink temperatures of 360 ○C and 10 ○C, are compared theoretically to those of equivalent sub-critical, nonregenerative <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> (ORC) <b>engines.</b> Five alkanes (from n-pentane to n-nonane) are being considered as possible working fluids for the aforementioned Up-THERM application, and these are also used for the accompanying ORC thermodynamic analyses. Owing to its mode of operation, lack of moving parts and dynamic seals, the Up-THERM engine promises a simpler and more cost-effective solution than an ORC engine, although the Up-THERM is expected to be less efficient than its ORC counterpart. These expectations are confirmed in the present work, with the Up-THERM engine showing lower efficiencies and power outputs than equivalent ORC engines, but which actually approach ORC performance at low temperatures. Therefore, it is suggested that the Up-THERM can be a competitive alternative in terms of cost per unit power in low-power/temperature applications, especially in remote, off-grid settings, such as in developing countries where minimising upfront costs is crucial...|$|R

Nonetheless, the adoption of such technology in the automotive domain requires specific R&D activities to select the working fluid, the components and the most appropriate system architecture in order to achieve sustainable costs and the required level of reliability, while the transient nature of the heat sources available on the truck {{must be taken into account}} to evaluate the resulting fuel economy. In this regards, this thesis, based on experimental studies and simulation models, contributes to the characterization and the design of Waste Heat Recovery <b>Organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>Cycle</b> Systems for <b>engines</b> of long haul trucks...|$|R
40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes and {{conventional fossil fuel}} energy production systems used in small-medium industries, such as internal combustion engines and gas turbines, provide low or medium temperature (i. e., 200 - 500 Â Â°C) heat fluxes as a by-product, which are typically wasted in the environment. The possibility of exploiting this wasted heat, converting it into electric energy by means of different energy systems, is investigated in this article, by extending the usual range of operation of existing technologies or introducing novel concepts. In particular, among the small size bottoming cycle technologies, the identified solutions which could allow to improve the energy saving performance of an existing plant by generating {{a certain amount of}} electric energy are: the <b>Organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>Cycle,</b> the Stirling <b>engine</b> and the Inverted Brayton Cycle; this last is an original thermodynamic concept included in the performed comparative analysis. Moreover, this paper provides a parametric investigation of the thermodynamic performance of the different systems; in particular, for the Inverted Brayton Cycle, the effects of the heat source characteristics and of the cycle design parameters on the achievable efficiency and specific power are shown. Furthermore, a comparison with other existing energy recovery solutions is performed, in order to assess the market potential. The analysis shows that the highest electric efficiency values, more than 20 % with reference to the input heat content, are obtained with the <b>Organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>Cycle,</b> while not negligible values of efficiency (up to 10 %) are achievable with the Inverted Brayton Cycle, if the available temperature is higher than 400 Â Â°C.

40|$|The Up-THERM heat {{converter}} is an unsteady, two-phase thermofluidic oscillator {{that employs}} an organic working fluid, {{which is currently}} being considered as a prime-mover in small- to medium-scale {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) applications. In this paper, the Up-THERM heat converter is compared to a basic (sub-critical, non-regenerative) <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> (ORC) heat <b>engine</b> with respect to their power outputs, thermal efficiencies and exergy efficiencies, as well as their capital and specific costs. The study focuses on a pre-specified Up-THERM design in a selected application, a heat-source temperature range from 210 °C to 500 °C and five different working fluids (three n-alkanes and two refrigerants). A modeling methodology is developed that allows the above thermo-economic performance indicators to be estimated for the two power-generation systems. For the chosen applications, the power output of the ORC engine is generally higher than that of the Up-THERM heat converter. However, the capital costs of the Up-THERM heat converter are lower than those of the ORC engine. Although the specific costs (£/kW) of the ORC engine are lower than those of the Up-THERM converter at low heat-source temperatures, the two systems become progressively comparable at higher temperatures, with the Up-THERM heat converter attaining a considerably lower specific cost at the highest heat-source temperatures considered...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} {{integrated}} {{thermal energy storage}} (TES) solutions for a domestic-scale solar {{combined heat and power}} (S-CHP) system based on an <b>organic</b> <b>Rankine</b> <b>cycle</b> (ORC) <b>engine</b> and low-cost non-concentrating solar-thermal collectors. TES is a critical element and distinct advantage of solar-thermal systems. It can allow, depending on how it is implemented, improved matching to the end-user demands, improved load factors, higher average efficiencies and overall performance, as well as reduced component and system sizes and costs, especially in climates with high solar-irradiance variability. The operating temperature range of the TES solution must be compatible with the solar-collector array and with the ORC engine operation in order to maximise the overall performance of the system. Various combinations of phase change materials (PCMs) and solar collectors are compared and the S-CHP system’s performance is simulated for selected months in the contrasting climates of Cyprus and the UK. The most important performance indicator of the ORC engine, i. e., net-power output, and the required TES volume are compared and discussed. The PCM-TES solutions that enable the best summer performance from an ORC engine sized for a nominal ∼ 1 -kWe output in combination with a 15 -m 2 solar collector array result in diurnal volume requirements as low as ∼ 100 L in Cyprus and 400 – 500 L in the UK. However, the required TES volume is strongly influenced by the choice of operational strategy for the system in matching the domestic load profiles. In a full-storage strategy in which electrical energy generation from the ORC engine is offset to match the week-day evening peak in demand, it is found that a ∼ 20 % higher total daily electrical output per unit storage volume can be achieved with a PCM compared to water as a sensible storage medium. The isothermal operation of the PCMs during phase-change allows for smaller diurnal storage temperature swings and higher energy conversion efficiencies from the solar collector array. These results are useful in informing the development of small-scale solar-thermal heat and power systems and of suitable integrated TES solutions for such applications...|$|R
