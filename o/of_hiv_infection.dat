40|$|AbstractObjectivesFrom the {{introduction}} <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> into the Republic of Korea in 1985 through 2012, 9, 410 HIV-infected Koreans have been identified. Since 2000, {{there has been}} a sharp increase in newly diagnosed HIV-infected Koreans. It is necessary to estimate the changes in <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> to plan budgets and to modify HIV/AIDS prevention policy. We constructed autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to forecast the number <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> from 2013 to 2017. MethodsHIV infection data from 1985 to 2012 were used to fit ARIMA models. Akaike Information Criterion and Schwartz Bayesian Criterion statistics were used to evaluate the constructed models. Estimation was via the maximum likelihood method. To assess the validity of the proposed models, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) between the number of observed and fitted <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> from 1985 to 2012 was calculated. Finally, the fitted ARIMA models were used to forecast the number <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> from 2013 to 2017. ResultsThe fitted number <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> was calculated by optimum ARIMA (2, 2, 1) model from 1985 – 2012. The fitted number was similar to the observed number <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections,</b> with a MAPE of 13. 7 %. The forecasted number <b>of</b> new <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> in 2013 was 962 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 889 – 1, 036) and in 2017 was 1, 111 (95 % CI: 805 – 1, 418). The forecasted cumulative number <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> in 2013 was 10, 372 (95 % CI: 10, 308 – 10, 437) and in 2017 was 14, 724 (95 % CI: 13, 893 – 15, 555) by ARIMA (1, 2, 3). ConclusionBased on the forecast of the number <b>of</b> newly diagnosed <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> and the current cumulative number <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections,</b> the cumulative number of HIV-infected Koreans in 2017 would reach about 15, 000...|$|R
40|$|The Demographic and Health Surveys from Lesotho, Zimbabwe, and Malawi {{reveal that}} a {{significant}} proportion <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> in adolescent women occurred in women who claim to be virgin. Two possible conclusions arise from this observation: adolescent women misreport sexual status or non-sexual risk is more relevant than previously asserted. This paper uses a nonparametric model to estimate the proportion <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> associated with sexual activity under different assumptions on data accuracy. It shows {{that there is an}} inverse relation between data accuracy and importance <b>of</b> sexual <b>HIV</b> transmission. If all adolescent women in the considered sub-sample correctly report sexual activity, 70 % <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> cannot be attributed to sexual HIV transmission. The model predicts that more than 95 % <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infections</b> are due to sexual <b>HIV</b> <b>infections,</b> if a substantial proportion of self-reported virgins (between 40 and 90 %) misreport sexual status.

These hosts have adapted to the presence of the virus, which is present at high levels in the host's blood but evokes only a mild immune response, does not cause the development of simian AIDS, and does not undergo the extensive mutation and recombination typical <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> in humans.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection</b> is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, {{near the end of}} this stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50 and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.|$|E

5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative <b>of</b> <b>HIV</b> <b>infection.</b> Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E
