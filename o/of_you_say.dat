I know that you middle class and well-heeled Bangkokians are used to snapping your fingers and having your maids, drivers, waitresses and even sex workers jump to satisfy you. It must be such a pain to see these people turning the tables and dictating the course of Thai politics.... Some <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> these 'red-shirt buffaloes' are too stupid to be allowed to vote—a privilege that should only go to college-educated Thais or the middle class". He compared this attitude to the apartheid system. [...] "The poor and less-educated Thais in rural areas and in Bangkok want their political opinions counted as well. A lorry with 10 wheels cannot move forward with just one wheel dictating the speed. And so it is with Thailand". He called on his fellow Bangkokians to [...] "try harder to convince them through civil dialogue, rather than engaging in bouts of expletive-loaded hate speech and showing open indifference to loss of life of among protesters who don't share your political opinions. We need to give a space for our fragile and young democracy to grow and mature. And that means employing legitimate democratic means in opposing Thaksin and Yingluck—no military coup and no mob rule, please".|$|E

60|$|Methinks I {{hear some}} <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> Must a Man afford himself no Leisure?

60|$|If that be true I {{wish you}} then {{to note the}} next fact: that within the space of five years Senator Douglas, in the {{argument}} of this question, has got his entire party, so far as I know, without exception, in saying that the negro has no share in the Declaration of Independence. If there be now in all these United States one Douglas man that does not say this, I have been unable upon any occasion to scare him up. Now, if none of you said this five years ago, and all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it now, that is a matter that you Kentuckians ought to note. That is a vast change in the Northern public sentiment upon that question.|$|E
