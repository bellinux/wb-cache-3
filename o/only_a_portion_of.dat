5|$|It is {{possible}} that IK Pegasi B will follow a similar pattern. In order to accumulate mass, however, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the accreted gas can be ejected, so that with each cycle the white dwarf would steadily increase in mass. Thus, even should it behave as a recurring nova, IK Pegasus B could continue to accumulate a growing envelope.|$|E
5|$|With these reforms, kings {{were reduced}} to being nominal heads of their fiefs, gaining a {{personal}} income from <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the taxes collected in their kingdom. Similarly, the officials in the administrative staff of a full marquess's fief were appointed by the central government. A marquess's Chancellor was ranked as {{the equivalent of a}} county Prefect. Like a king, the marquess collected a portion of the tax revenues in his fief as personal income.|$|E
5|$|Issued {{nine years}} after Harrison's death, the limited-edition release coincided with {{celebrations}} for Shankar's 90th birthday and was overseen by Harrison's widow, Olivia. Among the lavish packaging for the compilation, each disc appears inside enlarged, 8½-inch sleeves, and each {{copy of the}} set is individually numbered. An accompanying book contains a foreword by American composer Philip Glass, rare photographs documenting Shankar and Harrison's 35-year friendship, and commentary from both artists on the projects featured in the box set. While Collaborations presents <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> Shankar and Harrison's work together, music critics have recognised it as a successful representation of the far-reaching cultural legacy of their partnership.|$|E

5|$|Mosaicism in horses {{is thought}} to account for some {{spontaneous}} occurrences of white, near-white, spotted, and roan horses. Mosaicism refers to mutations that occur after the single-cell stage, and therefore affect <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the adult cells. Mosaicism may be one possible cause for the rare occurrence of brindle coloring in horses. Mosaic-white horses would be visually indistinguishable from dominant whites. Mosaicism could produce white or partially white foals if a stem cell in the developing foal underwent a mutation, or change to the DNA, that resulted in unpigmented skin and hair. The cells that descend from the affected stem cell will exhibit the mutation, {{while the rest of}} the cells are unaffected.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} input and display methods for users of varying {{abilities}} {{to make use}} of SGDs. Some SGDs have multiple pages of symbols to accommodate a large number of utterances, and thus <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the symbols available are visible at any one time, with the communicator navigating the various pages. Speech-generating devices can produce electronic voice output by using digitized recordings of natural speech or through speech synthesis—which may carry less emotional information but can permit the user to speak novel messages.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{different}} options for achieving the same goal when broaching a flat surface. The first {{is similar to the}} rotor-cut design, which is known as a double-cut design. Here four teeth in a row have the same RPT, but each progressive tooth takes <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the cut due to notches in the teeth (see the image gallery below). The other option is known as a progressive broach, which completely machines the center of the workpiece and then the rest of the broach machines outward from there. All of these designs require a broach that is longer than if a standard design were used.|$|E

5|$|Exactly {{who owned}} the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and {{probably}} never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as {{those found in the}} Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.|$|E
5|$|The strong winds, {{combined}} with saturated ground from the rainfall, brought down trees in widespread {{areas of the}} Hudson Valley and Capital District. Many of the trees would not have otherwise fallen in drier conditions. Some of the downed trees fell on structures. In a narrow swath in the Wolf Pond Valley of Warren County, where wind gusts are estimated to have reached , hundreds of trees were blown down. At the storm's worst, power outages affected over 100,000 people region-wide, and some individuals remained without power for a week. At the Albany International Airport, the storm forced the cancellation of flights, and throughout the region schools were closed. Several boats sustained damage along the shore of Lake Champlain. Throughout Orange, Putnam, Rockland, and Westchester counties, initial cost estimates were $14.6 million, although that figure represents <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> the actual monetary damage. The storm also caused about $2 million in property damage in Essex County.|$|E

Likewise, a user of FPGAs or gate arrays will only use the analysis portion, as the design is already fixed.|$|R
