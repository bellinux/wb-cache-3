40|$|This paper proposes an {{advanced}} spatially {{scalable video coding}} approach that exploits the inter layer correlation between different resolution layers by classified patch learning. The novelty of our proposed scheme is twofold. First, the correlation between low and high resolution frames is explored at patch level with regard to image features. Patches extracted from the previous coded frame are classified into structural and textural sets according to the gradient information. Then the inter layer correlation is separately studied for the two sets, resulting in two databases containing pairs of patches at different resolutions. Second, our proposed patch-based compensation manages to simultaneously exploit the spatial and temporal redundancies without <b>overhead</b> <b>bit</b> for motion. Based on the two databases, a high resolution prediction {{is derived from the}} current low resolution reconstruction at structural and textural regions, respectively. Experimental results show that our proposed approach improves the performance of H. 264 /MPEG spatially scalable coding up to 1. 9 dB and significantly enhances the subjective quality, especially at low bit rates.

40|$|SUMMARY With the {{increase}} of commercial multimedia applications using digital video, the security of video data {{becomes more and more}} important. Although several techniques have been proposed in order to protect these video data, they provide limited security or introduce significant overhead. This paper proposes a video security scheme for MPEG video compression standard, which includes two methods: DCEA (DC Coefficient Encryption Algorithm) and “Event Shuffle. ” DCEA is aim to encrypt group of codewords of DC coefficients. The feature of this method is the usage of data permutation to scatter the ciphertexts of additional codes in DC codewords. These additional codes are encrypted by block cipher previously. With the combination of these algorithms, the method provides enough security for important DC component of MPEG video data. “Event Shuffle ” is aim to encrypt the AC coefficients. The prominent feature of this method is a shuffling of AC events generated after DCT transformation and quantization stages. Experimental results show that these methods introduce no bit overhead to MPEG bit stream while achieving low processing overhead to MPEG codec. key words: commercial multimedia applications, selective encryption, MPEG codec, MPEG bitstream, data shuffle, processing <b>overhead,</b> <b>bit</b> overhead 1...|$|E
30|$|Given {{that the}} encoder and decoder {{work on the}} same set of data to {{estimate}} the pattern direction, {{there is no need to}} transmit the five direction masks and only the directional weighting coefficients for the left view (i.e., η _h^l, η _ 45 ^l, η _v^l, η _ 135 ^l, and η _ud^l) and the right view, need to be estimated at the encoder side and transmitted to the decoder side. Obviously, the <b>overhead</b> <b>bit</b> cost of transmitting the weighting coefficients is negligible in comparison to the bit cost of texture and depth map. In the experimental results section, the term “DDFU” will be used to refer to this proposed full version scheme. In addition, DDFU can be simplified to only transmit the weighting coefficients of the first frame, which will be used for the fusion of all the remaining frames as well. This simplification is possible as the content of each frame does not change significantly, especially for the sequences with slow motion. Based on this observation, the simplified approach can further reduce the amount of transmitted side information with little quality degradation. In the experimental section, the term “DDFU (first frame η)” will be used to refer to this simplified scheme.|$|E

40|$|Migrating {{wireless}} communications to millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies can satiate {{the growing demand}} for higher throughput and delay sensitive service provision. Due to high path loss and poor penetration, mmWave communications are challenged by limited coverage and blockage. Dense access point (AP) deployment and beamforming can enable mmWave networks to increase coverage and combat blockage. Greater AP density gives users diversity in AP selection, and thus a user can probe multiple APs to opportunistically transmit over the best channel. Yet, the opportunity to transmit to a previously probed AP may be lost due to inherent network properties (e. g. blockage, deafness, or decentralized scheduling), and the overhead delay and cost of probing more APs may also be detrimental to the search itself. We analyze the impact of AP diversity, beamforming, and overhead in opportunistic mmWave networks in terms of throughput and service provision capabilities. Decentralized opportunistic solutions are presented within a model that accounts for overhead delay and <b>overhead</b> <b>bit</b> cost. We assume no a priori knowledge of channel conditions, thus a deterministically optimal solution is unattainable in non-trivial scenarios. Stochastically optimal strategies are proposed and genie-aided solutions are presented as tight upper bounds. Ultimately, we present a model which includes the inherent properties of mmWave networks and obtain opportunistically optimal strategies for throughput and service provisioning. Conditions under which throughput maximization is a sub-martingale are presented, thus the problem is approached as a finite horizon stopping problem with unreliable recall. The optimal opportunistic strategy {{is a set of}} a priori computable thresholds. Bounds on average overhead, average delay, and average performance bound of the stopping strategy are presented. The throughput performance of optimal opportunistic strategies and the impact of imperfect network measurements are evaluated via simulations. Service provision maximization is considered under strict delay or average delay constraints. Both constraints lead to unique non-linear knapsack problems, yet reformulations into linear optimization problems are obtained by expanding the variable space. Optimal probing orders, for specific network conditions, are presented and the intuition of the optimal orders is leveraged for general network conditions. Opportunistic strategies are presented and evaluated via simulations against computationally intense stochastic programming solutions and impractical genie-aided tight upper bounds...|$|E

Also, we propose enhancements to the frame layer rate control to better allocate the source bits.|$|R
