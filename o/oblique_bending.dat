40|$|U-shaped Larssen {{steel sheet}} piles are {{normally}} driven in pairs. The common interlock may be crimped or welded to prevent inter-pile movement, creating an asymmetric section which may exhibit a reduced bending strength due to oblique (biaxial) bending. The recently introduced Eurocode 3 : part 5 takes this into account and applies a reduction factor on bending strength. This paper {{provides information on}} the selection of values for the reduction factor and will {{be of interest to}} designers of U-section steel sheet pile retaining walls. Experimental tests carried out on one-sixth scale U-piles are reported, together with a theoretical analysis of <b>oblique</b> <b>bending.</b> The research shows that freedom of lateral movement is important to the development of <b>oblique</b> <b>bending.</b> Furthermore, pile walls restrained against lateral movement by soil–structure interaction, among other things, will not exhibit significant <b>oblique</b> <b>bending.</b> <br/...|$|E
40|$|In {{geotechnical}} practice frequently use is made {{of steel}} sheet pile walls for soil and/or water retaining constructions. High demands are made {{with respect to the}} deformations, in particular in urban surroundings. Often these walls are composed of V- or Z-shaped profiles, whereby both profiles have their specific advantages and disadvantages. A common used variant is a sheet pile wall composed of so called double If-profiles. A double If-profile is made up of two single U-profiles which are connected by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double If-profile is the rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of that, the sheet pile wall tends to deflect both in forward (lateral) direction as well as in sideway (transverse) direction. This phenomenon is called <b>oblique</b> <b>bending,</b> and it results in a loss of stiffness and strength (compared to a continuous wall) and thus larger deformations. <b>Oblique</b> <b>bending</b> goes together with slip in the free interlocks and a transverse deflection of the sheet pile wall relative to the soil body. <b>Oblique</b> <b>bending</b> might be influenced by the transverse bearing capacity of the soil, i. e. the soil reduces or even prevents the transverse deformation of the sheet pile. Besides, the shear stress in the free interlock possibly reduces <b>oblique</b> <b>bending.</b> The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine the transverse bearing capacity of the soil. Therefore a three dimensional finite element model {{is made of}} a cantilever sheet pile wall with a dry excavation in front and without friction in the sliding interlocks. This is a 'worst case' model, i. e. if a sheet pile wall is modelled in this way, <b>oblique</b> <b>bending</b> can be observed most clearly. Emphasis has been put on the generation of an appropriate mesh which is also useful for further investigations regarding <b>oblique</b> <b>bending.</b> Use is made of the finite element system DIANA, version 6. 1.

40|$|For {{over three}} {{quarters}} of a century steel sheet pile walls are applied in geotechnical practice. For example in quay walls and construction pits in urban surroundings. Steel sheet pile walls are often composed of so called double U-profiles. These profiles consist of two single U profiles fixed in the common interlock by welding or crimping. A very specific property of the double U-profile is an asymmetric cross-section which can lead to a rotation of the neutral axis. As a result of this, the sheet pile wall tends to deflect both forward (lateral) and sideways (transverse). This phenomenon is called <b>oblique</b> <b>bending.</b> As a result of <b>oblique</b> <b>bending,</b> the strength and lateral stiffness of the sheet pile wall may be decreased considerably up to values of 60 % to 70 % compared to a continuous sheet pile wall. This leads to uneconomical designs. Four different methods to reduce <b>oblique</b> <b>bending</b> in a steel sheet pile wall have been studied: 1) Cantilever sheet pile wall in dry sand. 2) Cantilever steel sheet pile wall with a fix of the horizontal displacement at the top. 3) Cantilever steel sheet pile wall with a capping beam on top. 4) Cantilever steel sheet pile with the sliding interlock welded during the excavation. The main goal {{of this study is to}} determine which method is able to give the highest resistance against <b>oblique</b> <b>bending.</b> Therefore calculations have been made with a 3 D-finite element model (DIANA) of a dry excavation of a sand body in front of a cantilever sheet pile wall consisting of double U-profiles. The lower limit of the strength and stiffness is obtained when no transverse bending moment is activated and the in plane deformation is free. The maximum or upper limit strength and stiffness is derived if <b>oblique</b> <b>bending</b> is prevented by fixing the free interlocks (no in plane deformation). Depending on the loading conditions, the stiffness varies from 0. 49 to 1 time the maximum stiffness. The strength appeared to vary from 0. 59 to 1 time the maximum strength. 3 D-finite element calculations have been made for the mentioned four methods to reduce <b>oblique</b> <b>bending.</b> From the 3 D calculations it followed that the use of these methods may increase the strength and stiffness up to about 0. 8 times the maximum value for strength and stiffness. Welding of the interlock during excavation gave the highest reduction of <b>oblique</b> <b>bending.</b> Foundation Engineering GroupHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, a {{noticeable}} amount of research efforts has been directed to minimising injuries and death to people inside a structure that is subjected to an impact loading. Thin-walled (TW) tubular components have been widely employed in energy absorbing structures to alleviate the detrimental effects of an impact loading during a collision event and thus enhance the crashworthiness performance of a structure. Comprehensive knowledge of the material properties and the structural behaviour of various TW components under various loading conditions is essential for designing an effective energy absorbing system. In this paper, based on a broad survey of the literature, a comprehensive overview of the recent developments {{in the area of}} crashworthiness performance of TW tubes is given with a special focus on the topics that emerged {{in the last ten years}} such as crashworthiness optimisation design and energy absorbing responses of unconventional TW components including multi-cells tubes, functionally graded thickness tubes and functionally graded foam filled tubes. Due to the huge number of studies that analysed and assessed the energy absorption behaviour of various TW components, this paper presents only a review of the crashworthiness behaviour of the components that can be used in vehicles structures including hollow and foam-filled TW tubes under lateral, axial, <b>oblique</b> and <b>bending</b> loading...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{ballistic}} {{impact properties}} of a borosilicate ('pyrex') glass was studied using mild steel rods accelerated using a light gas gun. High-speed photography at sub-microsecond framing rates was used along with schlieren optics {{to investigate the}} propagation of elastic shock waves and fracture fronts. Flash X-radiography was used to visualize the deformation of rods as they penetrated the comminuted glass normally. The rod was seen initially {{to dwell on the}} surface for at least 3 μs creating a Hertzian cone-crack. Later on, between 40 and 60 μs, self-sharpening of the projectile was observed as the 'wings' of the heavily deformed front end sheared off. After this event, the front of the rod speeded up. X-rays also showed that the pattern of fissures within the comminuted glass was observed to be very similar shot-to-shot. X-radiography was also used to examine the mechanisms occurring during oblique impact of rods at 45 °. In <b>oblique</b> impact, <b>bending</b> of the rod rather than plastic deformation ('mushrooming') takes on the role of distributing the load over an area larger than that of the original rod diameter. High-speed photography of the rear surface of a glass block on which a fine grid had been placed confirmed that the comminuted glass moved as larger interlocked blocks. The experiments were modelled using the QinetiQ Eulerian hydrocode GRIM making use of the Goldthorpe fracture model. The model was found to predict well the transition from dwell to penetration...|$|R

40|$|U-section {{steel sheet}} piles {{are one of}} the largest {{structural}} sections available and are a popular product for constructing large retaining walls throughout Europe and Asia. U-section piles have been widely used throughout the 20 th Century. However, in recent years their bending strength has been an issue of uncertainty because they are connected together by interlocking joints located along the pile wall centreline. As the piles resist bending moments, inter-pile movement can significantly increase bending stresses. When this occurs, the wall is said to have exhibited reduced modulus action, also known as clutch slippage. U-shaped piles are normally driven in pairs and the common interlock may be crimped or welded to prevent this inter-pile movement. The resulting pair of piles is asymmetric in cross-section and may exhibit a reduced bending strength due to oblique (biaxial) bending. The recently introduced Eurocode 3 Part 5 has taken this into account and applies a reduction factor to the bending strength. The work presented herein has been carried out to determine suitable values for the reduction factor. The work has involved the experimental testing 1 / 6 th scale U-piles and the research shows that freedom of lateral movement is essential to the development of <b>oblique</b> <b>bending,</b> and piles that are restrained against lateral movement will not exhibit significant <b>oblique</b> <b>bending...</b>|$|E

This code offers possibilities for cheaper and safer steel sheet piling, in comparison with the existing design criteria used in most countries.

40|$|Abstract-We studled {{the fatigue}} {{behavior}} of bovine trabecular bone specimens under stress control using a sinusoidal uniaxial compressive load profile with a frequency of 2 Hz, The stress range was determined from the corresponding initial global platen-to-platen strain range, where the maximum initial strain was between 0. 8 and 2. 1 % and the minimum strain was 0. 6 %. The local strain distribution was measured {{on the same}} type of specimen by affixing glass spheres and photographing them in the unloaded and loaded positions using multiple exposures. The number of cycles to failure (defined as a 5 % decrease in secant modulus) was strongly correlated with the initial global maximum strain (r * = 0. 78) and ranged from 20 cycles at 2. 1 % strain to 400, 000 cycles at 0. 8 % strain. All of the fatigue specimens showed a region of transverse failure approximately I mm {{from the end of the}} specimen. Microscopic examination of the failure zones revealed two failure modes: a straight transverse brittle-like fracture through the trabeculae, most often found in trabeculae transverse to the loading direction, and buckling-like failure, common in <b>oblique</b> trabeculae. involving <b>bending</b> and splitting. The local strain increased towards the ends of the specimens to a value 2 - 4 times that in the middle. Modulus degradation with the number of cycles was distinctively different for high-cycle and low-cycle fatigue, suggesting the possibility that both creep and damage accumulation contribute to fatigue failure of trabecular bone...|$|R
