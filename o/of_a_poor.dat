5|$|Han Sai Por {{was born}} on 19 July 1943 in Singapore during the Japanese occupation. She was one of six {{children}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> couple, and her family were squatters living in Changi in a house made of cardboard boxes and coconut leaves. Nonetheless, Han had a happy childhood, {{and went to a}} nearby beach to make figurine animals out of sand. This experience helped her to appreciate nature and instilled in her a sense of adventure and exploration. At ten years of age, Han was introduced to Michelangelo's sculptures through a book given to her by her mother.|$|E

The club won the Division Three (South) title again in 1956–57, {{and returned to the}} higher division. This time, Ipswich established themselves in Division Two, and as the division champions, won promotion to the top level of English football, Division One, in 1960–61.|$|E

5|$|During the 2006–07 season, manager Colin Todd {{had been}} sacked because <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> run of results. Club captain David Wetherall was {{originally}} appointed Todd's successor on a caretaker basis, before being handed the role {{until the end}} of the season, during the following month. Wetherall could not stop City's run of poor form, and the club were relegated to League Two on 28 April 2007 after a 3–0 defeat at Chesterfield. It was the club's third relegation in seven seasons, and meant the 2007–08 season would be their first season in the fourth division of English football in 25years. On 22 May 2007, former City player Stuart McCall, who had played more than 400games for the club during two previous spells, was announced as the club's new manager to take over on 1 June 2007. Although the club had just 13players with first-team experience, the bookmakers made City second favourites to win the League Two title.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s striker Tom Garneys {{finished}} as club top-scorer for four seasons in a row, {{and became the}} first professional Ipswich player to score four times in a game. During this period, Ipswich won the title and promotion to the Second Division in the 1953–54 season, during which eight consecutive wins were recorded. The club was relegated back to Division Three (South) the following year at the end <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> season, the highlight of which was progress to the fifth round of the FA Cup, a run ended by First Division Preston North End. Duncan resigned but stayed on at the club in a secretarial role for a further three years. His replacement was a managerial novice, former England international and double Championship winner at Tottenham Hotspur, Alf Ramsey.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} fighting at Ap My An the Viet Cong had elected to fight from a hasty but well-prepared position and had displayed good battle discipline, {{command and control}} and effective camouflage and concealment. The Australians were later generous in their praise for their performance. In particular their use of snipers had been particularly effective, although overall their individual shooting was <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> standard and had often been too high. Townsend concluded that the Viet Cong force had most likely been ordered to fight a rearguard action until dark in order to cover the withdrawal a larger force and their command elements. Regardless, despite their strong performance, the battle also held lessons for the Viet Cong themselves. In particular their failure to deploy their machine-guns in the tree line {{on the edge of}} the landing zone had allowed the Australians to establish a foothold, despite A Company being forced to assault into an insecure landing zone with only minimal suppression from a single artillery battery. Later during the war the Viet Cong developed the effective tactic of targeting troop helicopters as they arrived at landing zones when they were most vulnerable.|$|E

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{identify}} baseline predictors of 10 -year course trajectories and outcomes {{in patients with}} dysthymic disorder and double depression. Eighty-seven outpatients with early-onset (< 21 years) dysthymic disorder, with or without superimposed major depression, were assessed five times at 30 -month intervals for 10 years. Baseline evaluations included semi-structured diagnostic interviews for Axis I and II psychopathology and childhood adversity. Direct interview and family history data were collected on first-degree relatives. Follow-up assessments included the Longitudinal Follow-up Evaluation and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Using mixed effects growth curve models, univariate predictors of depression severity and functional impairment at 10 -year outcome included older age, less education, concurrent anxiety disorder, greater familial loading for chronic depression, <b>a</b> history <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poorer</b> maternal relationship in childhood, and <b>a</b> history <b>of</b> childhood sexual abuse. In addition, longer duration of dysthymic disorder also predicted greater impairment 10 years later. Predictors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poorer</b> trajectory <b>of</b> depressive symptoms over time included ethnicity and personality disorders; predictors <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poorer</b> trajectory <b>of</b> social functioning included familial loading of chronic depression {{and quality of the}} childhood maternal relationship. Thus, demographic, clinical, family history, and early adversity variables all contribute to predicting the long term trajectory and outcome of DD. These variables should be routinely assessed in clinical evaluations and can provide clinicians with valuable prognostic information...|$|R

5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} seizures that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|His father distrusted or {{was jealous}} of George's popularity, which contributed to the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> relationship between them. The birth in 1717 of George's second son, Prince George William, {{proved to be a}} catalyst for a family quarrel; the king, supposedly following custom, appointed the Lord Chamberlain, the Duke of Newcastle, as one of the baptismal sponsors of the child. The king was angered when George, who disliked Newcastle, verbally insulted the duke at the christening, which the duke misunderstood as a challenge to a duel. George and Caroline were temporarily confined to their apartments on the order of the king, who subsequently banished his son from St James's Palace, the king's residence. The Prince and Princess of Wales left court, but their children remained in the care of the king.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were among}} the favourites to win the {{competition}} while Ajax were virtually unknown outside of the Netherlands. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly had made a scouting trip to watch Ajax before the match and witnessing them lose to lowly opposition returned confident Liverpool would progress. A few of Liverpool's players, including striker Roger Hunt, were part of England's victorious World Cup campaign in 1966. Ajax were coming out <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> period, after they had finished in 13th place in the 1964–65 Eredivisie, while the Netherlands national team had yet to make an impression on the international stage. The board of Ajax decided to hire Rinus Michels. He changed the team's formation to a 4–2–4, {{with an emphasis on}} passing and possession of the ball. The team showed improvement, winning the Eredivisie in his first season in charge.|$|E

5|$|The King of Fighters series {{director}} Toyohisa Tanabe {{asserted that}} the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury fighters were added specifically for adults, and the newer KOF characters were aimed to appeal to younger and newer audiences. Characters such as Benimaru Nikaido and Chang Koehan were added to have an off-beat variety to the cast, which he has previously deemed to be too serious. SNK artist C.A.C Yamasaki commented that although the lead programmer thought the game would not sell well, he believed it would eventually become popular. Ten people arrived at the first location test, but larger numbers came to subsequent tests. The SNK staff also had troubles with advertising the game {{due to a lack}} of money and some of their ads were noted to be <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> quality.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} {{factors in the}} decline of coal {{were related to the}} massive {{under-investment}} in Rhondda mines over the past decades. Most of the mines in the valleys were sunk between the 1850s and 1880s, which, as a consequence, meant they were far smaller than most modern mines. The Rhondda mines were in comparison antiquated, with methods of ventilation, coal-preparation and power supply all <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> standard. In 1945 the British coal industry cut 72 per cent of their output mechanically, whereas in South Wales the figure was just 22 per cent. The only way to ensure the financial survival of the mines in the valleys was massive investment from the NCB, but the 'Plan for Coal' paper drawn up in 1950 was overly optimistic in the future demand for coal, which was drastically reduced following an industrial recession in 1956 and an increased availability of oil.|$|E
5|$|The third spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, shows Scrooge a Christmas Day in the future. The ghost {{shows him}} scenes {{involving}} {{the death of}} a disliked man. The man's funeral will only be attended by local businessmen if lunch is provided. His charwoman, his laundress, and the local undertaker steal some of his possessions and sell them to a fence. When Scrooge asks the ghost to show anyone who feels any emotion over the man's death, the ghost can only show him the pleasure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> couple in debt to the man, rejoicing that his death gives them more time to put their finances in order. After Scrooge asks to see some tenderness connected with any death, the ghost shows him Bob Cratchit and his family mourning the passing of Tiny Tim. The ghost then shows Scrooge the man's neglected grave, whose tombstone bears Scrooge's name. Sobbing, Scrooge pledges to the ghost that he will change his ways to avoid this outcome.|$|E

5|$|The film is {{a debate}} with Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, which Wilton is seen reading early on, {{identifying}} him with the anti-hero Raskolnikov. That character is a brooding loner who kills two women {{to prove that he}} is a superior being, but is racked by guilt and eventually admits all to a dogged sleuth, and he is finally redeemed by punishment, the love <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>poor</b> girl, and the discovery of God. Wilton is a brooding loner who kills a poor girl who loves him because he considers his interests superior to those around him, knows little guilt, and avoids detection through luck. Allen signals his intentions with more superficial similarities: both killers attempt to cover their crime by faking a robbery, both are almost caught by a painter's unexpected appearance in the stairwell, and both sleuths play cat and mouse with the suspect. Allen argues, unlike Dostoyevsky, that there is neither God, nor punishment, nor love to provide redemption. The theme of parody and reversal of Dostoyevsky's motifs and subject matter has been visited by Allen before, in his film Love and Death. In Love and Death, the dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as The Brothers Karamazov, Crime and Punishment, The Gambler, The Idiot, and War and Peace. In Match Point, Allen moves the theme from parody to the more direct engagement of Dostoyevsky's motifs and narratives.|$|E
