5|$|Doxorubicin {{and several}} {{chemotherapeutic}} drugs (including cyclophosphamide) cause dyspigmentation. Other groups <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> cause this problem include antimalarials, amiodarone, heavy metals (but not iron), tetracyclines, and antipsychotics.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> can help prevent or {{interrupt}} malaria in travelers to places where infection is common. Many of these drugs are also used in treatment. Chloroquine may be used where chloroquine-resistant parasites are not common. In places where Plasmodium is resistant {{to one or more}} medications, three medications—mefloquine (Lariam), doxycycline (available generically), or the combination of atovaquone and proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone)—are frequently used when prophylaxis is needed. Doxycycline and the atovaquone plus proguanil combination are the best tolerated; mefloquine is associated with death, suicide, and neurological and psychiatric symptoms.|$|E

50|$|An {{effective}} dose (ED) in pharmacology is the dose or amount <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in some {{fraction of the}} subjects taking it.|$|R
50|$|Cerebrospinal fluid {{penetration}} is {{the proportion}} <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> crosses the blood-brain barrier {{to enter the}} cerebrospinal fluid. It is usually expressed {{as a percentage of}} the blood concentration.|$|R
25|$|Analgesic {{choice is}} also {{determined}} {{by the type of}} pain: For neuropathic pain, traditional analgesics are less effective, and there is often benefit from classes <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> are not normally considered analgesics, such as tricyclic antidepressants and anticonvulsants.|$|E
25|$|The {{cytotoxic}} antibiotics are {{a varied}} group <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> have various mechanisms of action. The common theme that they share in their chemotherapy indication {{is that they}} interrupt cell division. The most important subgroup is the anthracyclines and the bleomycins; other prominent examples include mitomycin C, mitoxantrone, and actinomycin.|$|E
25|$|A {{direction}} {{of research is}} towards the use <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> target remyelinating inhibitor proteins, or other inhibitors. Possible strategies include vaccination against these proteins (active immunisation), or treatment with previously created antibodies (passive immunisation). These strategies appear promising on animal models with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS.|$|E
50|$|An aquaretic is a class <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> is used {{to promote}} aquaresis, the {{excretion}} of water without electrolyte loss. Aquaretics are not strictly speaking diuretics, but are sometimes classified as such.|$|R
50|$|Seletracetam {{exhibits}} first-order mono-compartmental pharmacokinetics, {{in which}} there is a simple linear relationship between the amount <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> was administered, the time that has passed, and the amount <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> subsequently remaining in the body. This contrasts the nonlinear pharmacokinetics typical of previously available anticonvulsants such as phenobarbital, phenytolin, valproate and carbamazepine. The benefit of linear kinetics is that the steady-state concentration <b>of</b> the <b>drug</b> is directly and reliably related to the dose <b>of</b> the <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> is administered; this allows for simple and reliable dose adjustments.|$|R

25|$|Nevirapine is a {{substrate}} for liver CYP3A and CYP2B6 enzymes. Concomitant administration <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> are inhibitors {{of these}} enzymes may increase serum nevirapine levels significantly. Some {{examples of these}} drugs include ritonavir, fosamprenavir, and fluconazole. On the other hand, drugs that are inducers of these enzymes such as rifampicin may lower serum nevirapine levels.|$|E
25|$|The {{fentanyl}} patch {{is one of}} a {{small number}} <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> may be especially harmful, and in some cases fatal, with just one dose, if used by someone other than the person for whom the drug was prescribed. Unused fentanyl patches should be kept in a secure location that is out of children’s sight and reach, such as a locked cabinet.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicity}} <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> are metabolised by the cytochrome P450 {{system is}} enhanced by concomitant use of some quinolones. Quinolones, including norfloxacin, may enhance the effects of oral anticoagulants, including warfarin or its derivatives or similar agents. When these products are administered concomitantly, prothrombin time or other suitable coagulation tests should be closely monitored. Coadministration may dangerously increase coumadin warfarin activity; INR should be monitored closely.|$|E
50|$|On the {{cellular}} level, the dephosphorylation of ATPases determines {{the flow of}} ions {{into and out of}} the cell. Proton pump inhibitors are a class <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> acts directly on ATPases of the gastrointestinal tract.|$|R
50|$|An {{enzyme inducer}} {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> {{increases}} the metabolic activity of an enzyme either by binding to the enzyme and activating it, or by increasing {{the expression of the}} gene coding for the enzyme.|$|R
50|$|Generic {{medicines}} {{have the}} same active ingredient as the branded medicine, but are not always identical, which could affect some patients. The amount <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> finally reaches the site of action {{is known as the}} bioavailability, directly impacting on the effectiveness and tolerability <b>of</b> a <b>drug.</b>|$|R
25|$|Statins {{are another}} class <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> inhibit the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. Unlike bisphosphonates, statins do not bind to bone {{surfaces}} with high affinity, {{and thus are}} not specific for bone. Nevertheless, some studies have reported a decreased rate of fracture (an indicator of osteoporosis) and/or an increased bone mineral density in statin users. The overall efficacy of statins {{in the treatment of}} osteoporosis remains controversial.|$|E
25|$|The drug thalidomide's {{birth defects}} in {{children}} affected many people's lives, and from these events came {{the formation of}} the group called The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada, a group of 120 Canadian survivors. Their goal was to prevent future usage <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> could be of potential harm to mothers and babies. The members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the STEPS program, which aimed to prevent teratogenicity.|$|E
25|$|Antihypertensives are a class <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> {{are used}} to treat {{hypertension}} (high blood pressure). Antihypertensive therapy seeks to prevent the complications of high blood pressure, such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Evidence suggests that reduction of the blood pressure by 5mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of ischaemic heart disease by 21%, and {{reduce the likelihood of}} dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Norepinephrine reuptake {{inhibitor}}s (NRIs or NERIs) are a type <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> {{acts as a}} reuptake inhibitor for the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (noradrenaline) {{by blocking}} {{the action of the}} norepinephrine transporter (NET). This in turn leads to increased extracellular concentrations of norepinephrine.|$|R
50|$|Agomelatine, {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> acts on a dual melatonergic-serotonergic pathway, {{which have}} shown its {{efficacy}} {{in the treatment of}} anxious depression during clinical trails, study also suggests the efficacy in the treatment of atypical and melancholic depression.|$|R

This in turn leads to increased extracellular concentrations of norepinephrine.|$|R
25|$|Beta2-adrenergic agonist acts on beta-2 {{receptor}} {{to drive}} potassium into the cells. Therefore, beta blockers {{can cause the}} rise in potassium levels due to blockage of beta-2 receptors. However, the rise potassium levels is not marked unless there are other co-morbidities present. Examples <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> can raise the serum potassium are non-selective beta-blockers such as propanolol and labetalol. Beta-1 selective blockers such as atenolol do not increase serum potassium levels.|$|E
25|$|THX 1138 is an American {{science fiction}} film {{set in a}} dystopian future in which the populace is {{controlled}} through android police officers and mandatory use <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> suppress emotion, including outlawed sexual desire. It was directed by George Lucas in his feature film directorial debut in 1971. Produced by Francis Ford Coppola and written by Lucas and Walter Murch, it stars Donald Pleasence and Robert Duvall.|$|E
25|$|Laser {{therapy is}} the use of high-intensity light to destroy tumor cells while {{affecting}} only the treated area. This is typically done if the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. The relief of a blockage can help with pain and difficulty swallowing. Photodynamic therapy, a type of laser therapy, involves the use <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> are absorbed by cancer cells; when exposed to a special light, the drugs become active and destroy the cancer cells.|$|E
50|$|Deslanoside (trade name Cedilanide in Brazil) is {{a cardiac}} glycoside, a type <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> {{can be used}} in the {{treatment}} of congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat).

2500|$|Expression of β3-tubulin [...] {{has been}} {{reported}} to alter cellular responses to drug-induced suppression of microtubule dynamics. In general [...] the dynamics are normally suppressed by low, subtoxic concentrations <b>of</b> microtubule <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> also inhibit cell migration. However, incorporating β3-tubulin into microtubules increases the concentration <b>of</b> <b>drug</b> <b>that</b> is needed to suppress dynamics and inhibit cell migration. Thus, tumors that express β3-tubulin are not only resistant to the cytotoxic effects <b>of</b> microtubule targeted <b>drugs,</b> but also to their ability to suppress tumor metastasis. Moreover, expression of β3-tubulin also counteracts the ability <b>of</b> these <b>drugs</b> to inhibit angiogenesis which is normally another important facet of their action.|$|R
25|$|Clayton Lockett {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} during a failed {{execution}} attempt on April 29, 2014, at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma. Lockett was administered an untested mixture <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> had not previously been used for executions in the U.S., and survived for 43 minutes before being pronounced dead. Lockett convulsed and spoke during the process, and attempted to rise from the execution table 14 minutes into the procedure, despite having been declared unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Microbiology {{receives}} {{almost any}} clinical specimen, including swabs, feces, urine, blood, sputum, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, {{as well as}} possible infected tissue. The work here is mainly concerned with cultures, to look for suspected pathogens which, if found, are further identified based on biochemical tests. Also, sensitivity testing is carried out {{to determine whether the}} pathogen is sensitive or resistant to a suggested medicine. Results are reported with the identified organism(s) and the type and amount <b>of</b> <b>drug(s)</b> <b>that</b> should be prescribed for the patient.|$|E
25|$|In addition, MSM {{focused on}} the use of natural {{medicine}}. Natural medicine seeks to combine the advantages of both traditional and modern medicine. Traditional medicine refers to the use of knowledge of the use of locally grown plants coupled with an understanding of the language and culture of local villages. Modern medicine refers to the use <b>of</b> <b>drugs</b> <b>that</b> are regulated and produced to a high standard. Through combining these two types of medicine, natural medicine seeks to develop a new culturally appropriate and cost effective health service.|$|E
