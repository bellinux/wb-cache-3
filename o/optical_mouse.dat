25|$|Optical mice rely {{entirely on}} one or more {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) and an imaging array of photodiodes to detect movement relative to the underlying surface, eschewing the internal moving parts a mechanical mouse uses {{in addition to its}} optics. A laser mouse is an <b>optical</b> <b>mouse</b> that uses coherent (laser) light.|$|E
25|$|Most {{optical and}} laser mice {{do not require}} a pad. Whether to use a hard or soft mousepad with an <b>optical</b> <b>mouse</b> is largely a matter of {{personal}} preference. One exception occurs when the desk surface creates problems for the optical or laser tracking, for example, a transparent or reflective surface.|$|E

Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision, improving performance on opaque specular surfaces. Battery powered, wireless optical mice flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> detected {{movement on}} pre-printed mousepad surfaces. Whereas modern <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> work on most opaque diffusely reflective surfaces like paper, they usually aren't {{able to detect}} movement on specularly reflective surfaces like polished stone; coherently-lit (laser) mice can function even on such glossy surfaces, but perform poorly on transparent surfaces; dark field illumination allows mice to function reliably even on glass. Laser diodes are also used for better resolution and precision. Battery-powered wireless <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> flash the LED intermittently to save power, and only glow steadily when movement is detected.|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>mice</b> {{often used}} {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) for illumination when first popularized. The {{color of the}} <b>optical</b> <b>mouse's</b> LEDs can vary, but red is most common, as red diodes are inexpensive and silicon photodetectors {{are very sensitive to}} red light. Other colors are sometimes used, such as the blue LED of the V-Mouse VM-101 illustrated at right.|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>mice</b> capture one {{thousand}} successive images {{or more per}} second. Depending on how fast the mouse is moving, each image will be offset from the previous one by {{a fraction of a}} pixel or as many as several pixels. <b>Optical</b> <b>mice</b> mathematically process these images using cross correlation to calculate how much each successive image is offset from the previous one.|$|R
25|$|In computing, a mouse is a {{pointing}} device that functions by detecting two-dimensional motion relative to its supporting surface. The mouse's motion typically translates into {{the motion of}} a pointer on a display, which allows for fine control of a Graphical User Interface. Douglas Engelbart invented the computer mouse at the Augmentation Research Center, funded by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) in 1963. The first mouse was carved from wood and tracked motion via two wheels mounted on the bottom. Later on, a ball instead of two wheels was employed. The concept was soon overtaken by a modern and more technologically advanced <b>optical</b> <b>mouse.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{keyboard}} and mouse were redesigned for the iMac with translucent plastics and a Bondi Blue trim. The Apple USB Keyboard {{was smaller than}} Apple's previous keyboards, with white characters on black keys, both features that attracted debate. The Apple USB Mouse was mechanical, of a round, [...] "hockey puck" [...] design which was derided as being unnecessarily difficult for users with larger hands. Apple continued shipping the round mouse, adding a divot to the button in later versions so that users could distinguish proper orientation by feel. Eventually, a new capsule-shaped <b>optical</b> <b>mouse,</b> known as the Apple Mouse (formerly [...] "Apple Pro Mouse"), replaced the round mouse across all of Apple's hardware offerings.|$|E

50|$|Early {{types of}} <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> {{have the problem}} of not working well on {{transparent}} or reflective surfaces such as glass or highly polished wood. These surfaces, which often include desk and table surfaces, cause jitter and loss of tracking on the display pointer as the mouse moves over these reflective spots. The use of mousepads with precision surfaces eliminates spot jitter effects of older and/or low-quality <b>optical</b> <b>mice.</b>|$|R

50|$|To {{understand}} how optical flow {{is used in}} <b>optical</b> <b>mice,</b> imagine two photographs of the same object except slightly offset from each other. Place both photographs on a light table to make them transparent, and slide one across the other until their images line up. The amount that the edges of one photograph overhang the other represents the offset between the images, {{and in the case}} of an <b>optical</b> computer <b>mouse</b> the distance it has moved.|$|R
50|$|<b>Optical</b> <b>mice</b> {{utilizing}} infrared elements (LEDs or lasers) offer substantial {{increases in}} battery life over visible spectrum illumination. Some mice, {{such as the}} Logitech V450 848 nm laser mouse, are capable of functioning on two AA batteries for a full year, due to the low power requirements of the infrared laser.|$|R
50|$|Optical models {{outperform}} mechanical mice on uneven, slick, soft, sticky, or loose surfaces, {{and generally}} in mobile situations lacking <b>mouse</b> pads. Because <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> render movement {{based on an}} image which the LED (or infrared diode) illuminates, use with multicolored mouse pads may result in unreliable performance; however, laser mice do not suffer these problems and will track on such surfaces.|$|R

2500|$|Modern {{computer}} mice took form at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) {{under the}} inspiration of Professor Jean-Daniel Nicoud and {{at the hands of}} engineer and watchmaker André Guignard. This new design incorporated a single hard rubber mouseball and three buttons, and remained a common design until the mainstream adoption of the scroll-wheel mouse during the 1990s. In 1985, René Sommer added a microprocessor to Nicoud's and Guignard's design. Through this innovation, Sommer is credited with inventing a significant component of the mouse, which made it more [...] "intelligent"; though <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> from Mouse Systems had incorporated microprocessors by 1984.|$|R
50|$|Early <b>optical</b> <b>mice,</b> first {{demonstrated}} by two independent inventors in 1980, came {{in two different}} varieties:Some, such as those invented by Steve Kirsch of MIT and Mouse Systems Corporation, used an infrared LED and a four-quadrant infrared sensor to detect grid lines printed with infrared absorbing ink on a special metallic surface. Predictive algorithms in the CPU of the mouse calculated the speed and direction over the grid.|$|R
50|$|Though not {{commonly}} referred to as <b>optical</b> <b>mice,</b> nearly all mechanical mice tracked movement using LEDs and photodiodes to detect when beams of infrared light did and didn't pass through holes in an incremental rotary encoder wheel. Thus the primary distinction of “optical mice” is not their use of optics, but their complete lack of moving parts to track mouse movement, in lieu of an entirely solid-state system.|$|R

50|$|Modern surface-independent <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> work {{by using}} an {{optoelectronic}} sensor (essentially, a tiny low-resolution video camera) to take successive images of the surface on which the mouse operates. As computing power grew cheaper, it became possible to embed more powerful special-purpose image-processing chips in the mouse itself. This advance enabled the mouse to detect relative motion {{on a wide variety}} of surfaces, translating the movement of the mouse into the movement of the cursor and eliminating the need for a special mouse-pad.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{mechanical}} mice, whose tracking mechanisms {{can become}} clogged with lint, <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> have no moving parts (besides buttons and scroll wheels); therefore, {{they do not}} require maintenance other than removing debris that might collect under the light emitter. However, they generally cannot track on glossy and transparent surfaces, including some mouse-pads, causing the cursor to drift unpredictably during operation. Mice with less image-processing power also have problems tracking fast movement, whereas some high-quality mice can track faster than 2 m/s.|$|R
5000|$|Trackballs have {{appeared}} in computer and video games, particularly early arcade games (see a List of trackball arcade games) notably Atari's Centipede and Missile Command - though Atari spelled it [...] "trak-ball". Football, by Atari, released in 1978, is commonly misunderstood {{to be the first}} arcade game to use a trackball, but in The Ultimate History of Video Games by Steven L. Kent the designer of Football, Dave Stubben, claims they copied the design from a Japanese game, Soccer (Taito, 1973). Console trackballs, now fairly rare, were common in the early 1980s: the Atari 2600 and 5200 consoles, as well as the competing ColecoVision console, though using a joystick as their standard controller, each had one as an optional peripheral. The Apple Pippin, a console introduced in 1996 had a trackball built into its gamepad as standard. Trackballs were occasionally used in e-sports prior to the mainstreaming of <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> in the early 2000s because they were more reliable than ball mice, but now they are extremely rare because <b>optical</b> <b>mice</b> offer superior speed and precision. A trackball requires no mousepad and enables the player to aim swiftly (in first person shooters). Trackballs remain in use in pub golf machines (such as Golden Tee) to simulate swinging the club.|$|R
