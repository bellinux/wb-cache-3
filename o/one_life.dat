5|$|A level ends {{when all}} of the point-scoring objects are gone - either lost down the drain, cleaned by sponges/brushes, eaten by roaches, or absorbed by the bubble. At this point, if the bubble is large enough to have a {{complete}} face, the player moves on to the next level; otherwise, <b>one</b> <b>life</b> is lost and the level must be replayed. In addition, whenever the bubble has a face, the drain flashes green, giving the player a chance to enter it and skip the next level. Entering the drain while the bubble is too small costs <b>one</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} gained further {{success with}} the popular Dimitri and Erica pairing. In 1993, viewers named them a supercouple, along with <b>One</b> <b>Life</b> to Live's Bo and Nora and Days of our Lives Roman and Marlena. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly listed them among the top seventeen supercouples.

The exact cause of the tree's uprooting was unknown, although it may have been hit by lightning or a short-lived tornado. Elsewhere, two individuals died of heart attacks: one while installing storm shutters on his home, and another at a designated shelter.|$|E

50|$|Gaining {{direction}} {{and meaning in}} <b>one's</b> <b>life.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>One’s</b> <b>life</b> can be meaningful, but {{not worth}} living, or worth living, but not meaningful, which {{demonstrates}} that {{an evaluation of}} whether life is worth living differs from an evaluation of whether <b>one’s</b> <b>life</b> is meaningful. But how do these evaluations differ? As I will argue, an evaluation of whether life is worth living is a more comprehensive evaluation than the evaluation of whether <b>one’s</b> individual <b>life</b> is meaningful. In judging whether <b>one</b> finds <b>life</b> worth living, <b>one</b> takes into account, not only whether <b>one’s</b> <b>life</b> is meaningful, but undesirable aspects of life such as chronic pain and suffering. For example, {{a person who is}} suffering greatly, but who has lived a meaningful life, might still conclude that his or her life is not worth living. Although the famed question about the meaning of life has received most of the attention, I argue that the better and more fruitful question is “Is <b>life</b> worth living?” <b>One</b> should want, not just for <b>one’s</b> <b>life</b> to be meaningful, but for it to be worth living...|$|R

5|$|Arkham Origins {{introduces}} a multiplayer component to the series. Invisible Predator Online revolves around a gang war in Blackgate Prison between supervillains Joker and Bane. Three Joker gang members fight three Bane gang members, {{and in turn}} the team of Batman and Robin. Gangs win by killing all the opposing team's reinforcements, while Batman and Robin win by acquiring intimidation points (from eliminating gang members). A gang member can become boss (Joker or Bane), gaining more-powerful abilities. Gang members can access guns and explosives; Batman and Robin can access gadgets and abilities from the main game, including Detective Vision. Gang members have a limited Enhanced Vision, which requires recharging. Hunter, Hunted sets three Joker thugs and three Bane thugs against Batman in a last-team-standing match in which each character has <b>one</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E
5|$|Aside from Ariffien, who {{continued}} directing into the 1960s, none of Union's directors or producers {{returned to the}} film industry after {{the conclusion of the}} Japanese occupation in 1945. Several actors, however, continued their careers. Djoewariah, for instance, made her first film after leaving Union, Sehidup Semati (<b>One</b> <b>Life,</b> One Death), in 1949, and continued acting until the mid-1950s. The career of Soekarno, meanwhile, lasted through the 1970s; he was mostly credited as Rendra Karno after changing his name in the 1950s. Others had careers behind the screen; Kedok Ketawa star Basoeki Resobowo, for instance, became art director on films such as Darah dan Doa (The Long March; 1950).|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessors, Super Smash Bros. Brawl {{includes}} various {{modes of}} play {{from the previous}} game designed for a single player. Classic mode, as the name implies, is a classical approach to the game, in which players fight individual characters in a selected order. Each match features an arena or opponent from a particular series, such as The Legend of Zelda or Pokémon. Several matches have a unique battle condition, such as a metal opponent, large opponent or a two-on-two team battle. Similar to Classic mode are All Star mode and Boss Battles, where the player has only <b>one</b> <b>life</b> to defeat all of the playable characters and bosses, respectively.|$|E

Despite a British bombardment, the Americans successfully dug the trenches.|$|E
5|$|Since its inception, {{the award}} {{has been given}} to 27 actresses. <b>One</b> <b>Life</b> to Live is the show with the most awarded actresses, with a total of eleven. In 1995, Erika Slezak became the actress with the most wins in the {{category}} when she won a fourth time, surpassing Helen Gallagher's previous record of three; Slezak went on to win in two additional years, ultimately receiving six wins. Susan Flannery and Kim Zimmer have since received four wins each. Susan Lucci has been nominated on 21 occasions, more than any other actress. As of the 2017 ceremony, Gina Tognoni is the most recent winner in this category for her portrayal of Phyllis Summers on The Young and the Restless.|$|E
5|$|The game {{contains}} {{a variety of}} elements that both aid and hinder the player's progress through the waves. At his disposal, Jones has TNT, guns, swords, hats for extra lives, jewels for extra time and his classic whip. Opposing him are bats, rats, snakes, spiders and an endless supply of Thugee servants. In addition, if Jones lands {{in any of the}} lava pits, crashes a mine cart or hits a boulder or spike trap, he loses <b>one</b> <b>life.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Amor fati ( [...] "love of fate") is a Latin {{phrase that}} may be {{translated}} as [...] "love of fate" [...] or [...] "love of one's fate". It is used to describe an attitude in which one sees everything that happens in <b>one's</b> <b>life,</b> including suffering and loss, as good or, at the very least, necessary, {{in that they are}} among the facts of <b>one's</b> <b>life</b> and existence, so they are always necessarily there whether one likes them or not.

5|$|The show {{centers on}} Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a police detective living in two {{separate}} realities after a car accident. In this episode, Michael deals with a case where a girl is found after on a hotel top {{in which she was}} pushed or jumped from. He sees Kate Porter (Brianna Brown) in both realities, after her sister died. In <b>one</b> <b>life,</b> Kate is a successful investment banker, while in the other she is a cocaine addict. Meanwhile, Rex's (Dylan Minnette) racket is broken by his best friend Cole (Logan Miller), which was an accident. Rex is angry because it belonged to his mother, Hannah (Laura Allen).|$|E
5|$|The storm dropped an {{estimated}} 500,000 tonnes of hailstones in its path. Insured damages {{caused by the}} storm were over A$1.7 billion, with the total damage bill (including uninsured damages) estimated to be around A$2.3 billion. It was the costliest in Australian history in insured damages, surpassing the A$1.1 billion in insured damages caused by the 1989 Newcastle earthquake. Lightning also claimed <b>one</b> <b>life</b> during the storm, and the event caused approximately 50 injuries.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles is {{an action}} game with puzzle {{elements}} where the player controls the protagonist, a soap bubble, from a top-down perspective. The {{object is to}} clean a kitchen sink by maneuvering over ants, crumbs, and grease spots to absorb them before they slide into the drain. As the bubble absorbs more objects, it grows in size, eventually acquiring first eyes and then a smiling mouth. At the same time, sponges and scrub brushes slowly move around the sink, cleaning {{it on their own}} in competition with the player. Touching either of these enemies costs a player <b>one</b> <b>life</b> unless the bubble is large enough to have a complete face. In this case, the enemy will be knocked away and the bubble will shrink. Sponges and brushes can be knocked into the drain for bonus points, eliminating them from play. Two other enemies in the sink are stationary razor blades and roaches that crawl out of the drain. Contact with a blade is always fatal, while the bubble can safely touch the roach only while carrying a broom, which will kill the roach with one hit. The broom can be acquired by running over a cleaning lady who appears in the sink from time to time.|$|E

5|$|Competitive video gamers and referees {{stress the}} game's {{high level of}} {{difficulty}} compared to other classic arcade games. Winning the game requires patience {{and the ability to}} accurately time Mario's ascent. In addition to presenting the goal of saving Pauline, the game also gives the player a score. Points are awarded for the following: leaping over obstacles; destroying objects with a hammer power-up; collecting items such as hats, parasols, and purses (presumably belonging to Pauline); removing rivets from platforms; and completing each stage (determined by a steadily decreasing bonus counter). The player typically receives three lives with a bonus awarded for the first 7,000 points, although this can be modified via the game's built in DIP switches. <b>One</b> <b>life</b> is lost whenever Mario touches Donkey Kong or any enemy object, falls too far through a gap or off the end of a platform, or lets the bonus counter reach zero.|$|E
5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} , Seeds of Evil is a first-person shooter where the player assumes {{the role of}} Turok from a first-person perspective. As Turok, the player can run, jump, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time. The player can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from bows and arrows to pistols, rifles, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a flamethrower, a speargun, and more advanced weapons such as the Cerebral Bore, which fires a homing projectile capable of latching onto enemy's heads, killing them by drilling into their skulls and exploding. Turok has {{a certain amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by enemies. If Turok's health is fully depleted, the player loses <b>one</b> <b>Life</b> Force point and has to continue the game from a previous checkpoint. If the player loses all Life Force points, the game will be over. Ammunition, health, and Life Force suppliers can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's resources.|$|E
5|$|The player's {{health is}} {{represented}} by a percentage starting at 100, which is diminished when they are shot or attacked by enemies. If the player's health falls to zero, they lose <b>one</b> <b>life</b> and start the level over with a knife, a pistol, and eight bullets. The player begins each episode with three lives and can gain more by finding extra-life tokens or by earning enough points. Points are scored by killing enemies or collecting treasures scattered throughout the levels. Points can also be scored by killing all enemies in a level, collecting all treasure, finding all secret areas, or completing a level under a par time; the player's completion ratio and speed is displayed when a level is completed. Secret areas containing treasure, health refills, or ammunition {{can be found in}} hidden rooms revealed by activating certain wall tiles that slide back when triggered. The original version of the game allows the player to save their progress at any point, though in many of its ports the player can only save between levels.|$|E
