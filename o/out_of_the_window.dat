5|$|At the {{airfield}} in the morning, Curt says goodbye to his parents, his sister Laurie, Steve, John and The Toad. As the plane takes off, Curt, gazing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> sees the white Ford Thunderbird {{belonging to the}} mysterious blonde driving down a country road.|$|E
5|$|A {{friend of}} Huseby helped {{the police in}} the negotiations. At 18:30, the {{aircraft}} was out of beer, so Huseby made an agreement that he would throw the gun <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> in exchange for more beer. This was delivered by a civilian police officer. The aircraft was then immediately stormed by special forces and Huseby arrested. No-one was injured in the hijacking.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} age, Reines {{exhibited}} {{an interest in}} science, and liked creating and building things. He later recalled that: The first stirrings of interest in science that I remember occurred during a moment of boredom at religious school, when, looking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> at twilight through a hand curled to simulate a telescope, I noticed something peculiar about the light; it was the phenomenon of diffraction. That began for me a fascination with light.|$|E
25|$|In 1618, rebel Protestant {{leaders in}} Prague defenestrate two Catholic Royal regents and their secretary, {{who survived the}} 68 feet fall <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> Prague Castle.|$|R
25|$|The flights usually {{operated}} {{at about}} 85% <b>of</b> capacity; <b>the</b> empty seats, usually the centre ones, allowed passengers {{to move more}} easily about the cabin to look <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
25|$|Riots {{and protests}} resumed the {{following}} day, 17 December. The rioters {{broke into the}} district committee building and threw party documents, propaganda brochures, Ceaușescu's writings and other symbols <b>of</b> communist power <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
5|$|The film often {{features}} shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows {{are present}} {{from the very}} first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the very end. More subtly, backlighting turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.|$|E
5|$|The jailer said that, after {{struggling}} for two hours, he escaped {{and raised the}} alarm at Moon's restaurant {{across the road from}} the jail. Sheriff Dunnegan sent out a search party to no avail. According to the Ledger, a fence post suspended on two chairs across a window was found in the jury room just after the lynching, near the cell where Laura had been held. It was thought that the men had intended to hang Laura <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> but were deterred by an electric light burning nearby.|$|E
5|$|Will and Jake {{enter the}} tower, where Will {{falls under the}} Queen's spell when the Queen takes the enchanted spike from Angelika's father and thrusts it into Will's chest. Jake {{shatters}} the enchanted mirror in the tower, preventing the Queen from completing the spell that will restore her youth. With {{the last of his}} strength, Angelika's father destroys the rest of the mirror by jumping <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> with it; and Will, attempting to save the Queen, tries to take back the mirror and falls with him, and both men are killed.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: This is {{the public}} [...] "dragons" [...] display at Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin's house in Blois, which {{has been turned into}} a museum. The [...] "dragons" [...] move in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> in a {{theatrical}} display. A statue of Robert-Houdin is at lower right.|$|R
50|$|On 16 May, {{rebels were}} forced to retreat when {{soldiers}} began throwing inmate's bodies <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> It was reported that rebel fighters took control of a building inside the prison after blowing up the main gate. Rebel fighters continued to hit the facility with rockets late into the night.|$|R
50|$|A defenestration (chronologically <b>the</b> second defenestration <b>of</b> Prague, {{sometimes}} called one-and-halfth defenestration) happened on 24 September 1483, when a violent overthrow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipal governments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old and New Towns ended with throwing the Old-Town portreeve and <b>the</b> bodies <b>of</b> seven killed aldermen <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respective town halls.|$|R
5|$|Bobby tells {{a fellow}} student, Lisa Baiocchi, {{that she must}} stand up to her {{overbearing}} father {{just as he had}} done with Phil. When Lisa returns home, a window explodes and a shadowy, arm-like appendage grabs her father by the throat after he demands she stop seeing Bobby. His lifeless body is discovered lying on the ground outside the house. Though Scully concludes that Mr. Baiocchi died as the result of being pushed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> Mulder discovers evidence suggesting he was pulled out by an outside force. Later, the agents learn that Lisa is another one of Karin Matthews' patients.|$|E
5|$|Brody visits Kristin and Stacie as they {{pack the}} last of her {{belongings}} before leaving for the airport. After giving their final goodbyes, Brody sees Kristin's limousine off while it drives off her street. As Kristin looks <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> a montage of archived footage from the series' earlier seasons is shown. In the final scene of the series, with the camera on Brody, the Hollywood Hills backdrop is pulled away, while the camera pans back to reveal that the entire scene was filmed on a backlot. In reality, the vehicle had not driven off and Kristin stepped out of the vehicle to hug Jenner.|$|E
5|$|Goldfinger {{was written}} in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in January and February 1958 and was the longest typescript Fleming had {{produced}} to that time. He initially gave the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World. Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's first encounter. Similarly, the depressurisation of Goldfinger's plane was another plot device he had intended to use elsewhere, but which {{found its way into}} Goldfinger. Some years previously a plane had depressurised over the Lebanon and an American passenger had been sucked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and Fleming, who was not a comfortable airline passenger, had made note of the incident to use it.|$|E
25|$|We do not {{understand}} exactly how Renaissance artists thought about the Oriental carpets they were depicting. We know that the Venetian Piazza San Marco was adorned with carpets hanging from <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surrounding palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>the</b> carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on. Similar to the inaccurate pseudo-kufic writing in contemporary paintings, the European artists borrowed something from another culture which they, essentially, did {{not understand}}.|$|R

5000|$|... "God Bless America, Really?" [...] was <b>the</b> title <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second set. Here Agitpop {{went back}} to <b>the</b> roots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian Revolution: Agitprop. Basically, this was a show that {{consisted}} of an American medley of [...] "noises in the ether" [...] penned and sung by Agitpop’s drummer Mark LaFalce. The stage setting designed by bassist, and B Movie freak Rick Crescini. It depicted the twin towers with American Indians falling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> in a general statement against <b>the</b> trend <b>of</b> violence in politics of yesterday and today. A monumental moment was reached when the trio sung out in unison <b>the</b> worst <b>of</b> choruses from [...] "The [...] "Fish" [...] Cheer / I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag" [...] with a hell-no-we-wont-go attitude, making bare bones <b>out</b> <b>of</b> naked patriotism. Model planes hit the towers in a 9/11-style and <b>the</b> Indians fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> One could say that this part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reunion was a true Dada homage to Dadaism ala Cabaret Voltaire.|$|R
5|$|Fatboy first {{appears in}} EastEnders at Lucy Beale's (Melissa Suffield) party, where he gets {{pleasure}} from watching {{a fight between}} two girls, and asks other girls to play Twister with him but nobody will. In EastEnders: E20, he helps his friend Mercy Olubunmi (Bunmi Mojekwu) with a project to encourage more young people to the church, but his ideas leave them both humiliated. They meet Leon Small (Sam Attwater) and ZsaZsa Carter (Emer Kenny) and start squatting in a flat. Fatboy tells ZsaZsa and Leon both his parents {{were killed in a}} drive-by shooting. He finds out Mercy is pregnant and accuses Leon of being the father. During an argument, Mercy reveals that Fatboy's parents are alive, angering ZsaZsa, who throws Fatboy's laptop <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> On their last night in the flat, he arranges a party but leaves before the police arrive. Knowing they can no longer stay there, he invites ZsaZsa, Mercy and Leon to stay at his house in Wanstead, but Mercy decides to go home to her grandmother.|$|E
5|$|The GWR {{attracted}} the attention of the artists from an early date. John Cooke Bourne's History and Description of the Great Western Railway was published in 1846 and contained a series of detailed lithographs of the railway that give readers a glimpse of what the line looked like in the days before photography. J. M. W. Turner painted his Rain, Steam and Speed - The Great Western Railway in 1844 after looking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of his train on Maidenhead Railway Bridge, and in 1862 William Powell Frith painted , a large crowd scene on the platform at Paddington. The station itself was initially painted for Powell by W Scott Morton, an architect, and a train was specially provided by the GWR for the painting, in front of which a variety of travellers and railway staff form an animated focal point.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{opens with a}} group of mob members {{plotting}} a scheme whilst Hauer is seen drinking an unspecified alcohol. Subsequently, the song starts and Minogue is seen on a diving board, jumping into a pool, presumably dead. Mob members look towards her body in distance, but then look away towards Hauer. She starts singing the track in the pool, gets out of it, and walks towards the mob members who seem disinterested of her presence. The singer undresses herself and throws the dress <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> which captures their attention. She subsequently drives in a limousine and puts on accessories whilst the driver takes her to a casino. The artist enters a large room, and plays poker with several members, eventually winning. Minogue appears in the limousine again, sporting the blue cocktail dress. Hauer, who is by himself at home, hears Minogue walking into the apartment, but she pushes over a large green vase and smashes it; disinterested, he looks towards in distance. The final scene has Minogue undressing herself and walking down steps.|$|E
50|$|On 30 June 1955 Drakos {{was arrested}} by the British with 14 other EOKA members and imprisoned in Kyrenia Castle but famously managed to escape 3 months later, by tying {{blankets}} together and abseiling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> A bounty <b>of</b> £5,000 was placed on his head {{but that did not}} deter him from taking part in more battles and acts of sabotage.|$|R
50|$|Torleif announces he will move, {{playing a}} funeral tune on his flute, {{as the entire}} band cheers. Torleif replies with kicking Åke out into the snow. All band members run out into the winternight, and the member throws {{themselves}} naked into the snow, shouting out loud. A female neighbour is awakened, watches <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> and calls <b>the</b> police.|$|R
50|$|Narrating {{that the}} {{authorities}} are suspicious of her, Rebecca is comfortable {{in the knowledge that}} Ernessa will not have left any remains. During her transportation to the police station she pulls a razor blade <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her diary and secretly drops it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car <b>window,</b> deciding that she will not do the same as Ernessa. Rebecca looks blankly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car <b>window</b> as <b>the</b> film fades to black.|$|R

25|$|In Watchmen (2009), a masked man kills Eddie Blake by {{throwing}} him <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of a high-rise apartment.|$|E
25|$|It {{tells the}} story of a young mother fleeing an abusive husband who moves into an {{apartment}} haunted by the previous occupants, a mother who had thrown her daughter <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> before jumping to her death herself.|$|E
50|$|At {{two o'clock}} on <b>the</b> night <b>of</b> June 5, 2008, a {{fire broke out}} on <b>the</b> third floor <b>of</b> Town Hall's west wing. It took up to 70 firefighters about three hours to control. The fire in the Town Hall was {{dramatic}} and, when emergency services arrived at the building, it was a fully developed fire, five- to 10-foot-high flames reached <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> <b>The</b> fire department estimated that the entire third floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south wing was destroyed by fire. Since renovation work was being carried out, the building was empty and no people were hurt.|$|R
5000|$|After <b>the</b> Communist Party <b>of</b> Czechoslovakia coup <b>of</b> February 1948, <b>the</b> Czechoslovak {{government}} {{launched a}} currency reform in 1953. This reform caused a wave <b>of</b> discontent, including <b>the</b> Plzeň uprising. On 1 June 1953 over 20,000 people, mainly {{workers at the}} Škoda Works, began protesting against the government. Protesters forced {{their way into the}} town hall and threw communist symbols, furniture and other objects <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> <b>The</b> protest caused a retaliation from the government; as part of their retaliation, they destroyed <b>the</b> statue <b>of</b> Thomas Garrigue Masaryk.

25|$|At 5:15 am on October 21, 1938, Hale {{threw herself}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of her apartment. She was found still wearing her {{favorite}} Madame X femme-fatale black velvet {{dress with a}} corsage of small yellow roses, given to her by Noguchi.|$|E
25|$|One common {{suggestion}} {{is to simply}} look <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the moving vehicle and to gaze towards the horizon {{in the direction of}} travel. This helps to re-orient the inner sense of balance by providing a visual reaffirmation of motion.|$|E
25|$|Moore {{drove to}} a wooded area in Fall Creek Corridor Park in Indianapolis. Ward made a U-turn after which Moore entered Ward's vehicle and shot Johnson and Coleman to death. Moore then {{dismantled}} the handgun and threw the pieces <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> The men then returned to Moore's home.|$|E
50|$|On 19 November 1546 a fire {{broke out}} at night before the new {{building}} had been occupied, which destroyed large parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old castle. According to legend, the fire was start with dry kindling by the castle firelighter under <b>the</b> stairs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old castle, after baptists had paid him with gold. The sleeping residents noticed the fire too late. The maids and servants fled onto <b>the</b> rooftops and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> and down <b>the</b> walls, but forgot their masters. The younger children were dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> by their nurses wrapped in blankets. Countess Magdalena of Regenstein was trapped by the flames. The countess asked her husband, Count Ulrich to leave her and save his life. The count escaped through <b>the</b> toilet <b>window</b> and hung from it on the outside before being rescued having been badly burnt. In memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fire and the dead, Count Ulrich had a plaque made with inscriptions in Latin and German. It portrays the count, the countess, their six sons and four daughters.|$|R
2500|$|Nolan and Company A were {{assigned}} to Fort Larned in Kansas in 1868 with other units. While on patrol with Company A, Nolan's Company barracks caught fire on January 2, 1869. <b>The</b> Sergeant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guard did not sound the alarm until flames were seen coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows.</b> Eventually <b>the</b> fire was put out, but very little was salvageable.

2500|$|... "If you 'look' at {{something}} you {{are attached to}} it. If you just SEE <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows,</b> your mind is free and unattached. If you 'look', you reduce <b>the</b> scope <b>of</b> information reaching your consciousness. You get more about what you are 'looking' at and a lot less about what you can SEE from the same position. In terms of Aikido as 'one against many', seeing is more valuable than looking....|$|R
