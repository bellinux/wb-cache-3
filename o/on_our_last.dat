Five singles total were released from the album including: [...] "It Never Ends", [...] "Anthem", [...] "Blessed with a Curse", [...] "Visions", and [...] "Alligator Blood", with music videos included {{for each of the}} songs. The band embarked on a headline tour in intimate venues across the United Kingdom with support from Cancer Bats and Tek-one. In December 2010, Bring Me the Horizon joined Bullet for My Valentine as the main support band, alongside Atreyu, in a short five date arena tour around the United Kingdom. To cope with high demand, Live Nation released extra standing tickets to all dates.|$|E

On June 25, 2016, the band announced on its website that the group would be breaking up after a final tour, stating: [...] "Please come and join us <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>last</b> trip around the globe. We hope to share this final record and tour with {{each and every one of}} you." [...] The tour continued to the United Kingdom in December 2016, an Australian tour in February 2017, then one last string of US dates on the west coast in March. The group announced that Jimmy Brunkvist from Like Torches would fulfill drumming duties for the final touring cycle. On March 21 and 22, the band played make-up shows to sold-out crowds in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Tempe, Arizona, respectively. The band played their final show on March 25, 2017, at the House Of Blues in Anaheim, California. [...] "Ocean Avenue" [...] was the last song the group ever played live. On April 12, 2017, the final music video, [...] "A Place We Set Afire" [...] was released.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I posit {{that our}} minds inevitably {{internalize}} the external {{in the process}} of metaphysical enquiry because they naturally rely on abstraction, categorization, simplification and association.

Second, I opine that both primary and secondary qualities are significantly dependent <b>on</b> <b>our</b> minds. <b>Last</b> but not least, I extend the shadow of relativity over the notion of motion. Finally, I postulate that even though there is certain external reality upon which our enquiry can converge, the external world is neither perfectly nor particularly closely knowable...|$|R

Then my people threw aside their useless rifles and arming themselves with spears and swords fell back to rest, leaving Harût and his company to take their place. For half an hour or more raged that awful struggle, since the spot being so narrow, charge as they would, the Black Kendah could not win through the spears of despairing warriors defending their lives and the sanctuary of their god. Nor, the encircling cliffs being so sheer, could they get round any other way.|$|R

They were dressed alike in some neutral-tinted fabric, and with one accord the riders of Carrington rose to their feet, and stood fast and motionless until with a queenly gesture Grace seated herself in the oaken chair. Grace was younger than myself by two full years, but there was no trace of diffidence about her as she looked down out of steady eyes at the men who, as it were, did homage before her.

Mr. Hethcote did not seem to feel it in the same way: on the contrary, he grew more {{familiar}} and confidential in his talk with me. He has some of the English stiffness, you see, and your American pace was a little too fast for him. <b>On</b> <b>our</b> <b>last</b> night on board, we had some more conversation about the Farnabys. You were not interested enough in the subject to attend to what he said about them while you were with us; but if you are to be introduced to the ladies, you must be interested now. Let me first inform you that Mr. and Mrs. Farnaby have no children; and let me add that they have adopted the daughter and orphan child of Mrs. Farnaby's sister. This sister, it seems, died many years ago, surviving her husband for a few months only. To complete the story of the past, death has also taken old Mr. Ronald, the founder of the stationer's business, and his wife, Mrs. Farnaby's mother. Dry facts these--I don't deny it; but there is something more interesting to follow. I have next to tell you how Mr. Hethcote first became acquainted with Mrs. Farnaby.

40|$|Linearity is a multi-faceted and {{ubiquitous}} notion in {{the analysis}} {{and the development of}} programming language concepts.

To entail a full abstraction result, we introduce some higher-order operators related to exception handling and parallel evaluation.

40|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the field of}} biology, the information supply in the field of chemistry is almost completely predominated by commercial information providers who market their databases to financially strong clients in the industrial sector. Although there have been several "academic programs" for such databases, this is a problematic situation for universities. During the last years, the providers have tried to enlarge their market share by means of an increase in coverage, integration of more databases, and an optimisation of the user interfaces. In light of that the question came up, if one or two of these costly and comprehensive resources would be sufficient for the end-users concerning their need for secondary or tertiary literature?

60|$|First of all, water, when at the coldest, is ice. Now, we philosophers---I {{hope that}} I may class you and myself {{together}} in this case--speak of water as water, whether it be in its solid, or liquid, or gaseous state,--we speak of it chemically as water. Water is a thing compounded of two substances, one of which we have derived from the candle, and the other we shall find elsewhere. Water may occur as ice; and you have had most excellent opportunities lately of seeing this. Ice changes back into water--for we had <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>last</b> Sabbath a strong instance of this change, by the sad catastrophe which occurred in our own house, {{as well as in}} the houses of many of our friends,--ice changes back into water when the temperature is raised: water also changes into steam when it is warmed enough. The water which we have here before us is in its densest state[11], and although it changes in weight, in condition, in form, and in many other qualities, it still is water; and whether we alter it into ice by cooling, or whether we change it into steam by heat, it increases in volume,--in the one case very strangely and powerfully, and in the other case very largely and wonderfully. For instance, I will now take this tin cylinder, and pour a little water into it; and seeing how much water I pour in, you may easily estimate for yourselves how high it will rise in the vessel: it will cover the bottom about two inches. I am now about to convert the water into steam, for the purpose of shewing to you the different volumes which water occupies in its different states of water and steam.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{customary}} to {{say that}} age should be considered, because it comes last. It seems just {{as much to the}} point that youth comes first. And the scale fairly kicks the beam, if you go on to add that age, in a majority of cases, never comes at all. Disease and accident make short work of even the most prosperous persons; death costs nothing, and the expense of a headstone is an inconsiderable trifle to the happy heir. To be suddenly snuffed {{out in the middle of}} ambitious schemes is tragical enough at best; but when a man has been grudging himself his own life in the meanwhile, and saving up everything for the festival that was never to be, it becomes that hysterically moving sort of tragedy which lies on the confines of farce. The victim is dead--and he has cunningly overreached himself: a combination of calamities none the less absurd for being grim. To husband a favourite claret until the batch turns sour, is not at all an artful stroke of policy; and how much more with a whole cellar--a whole bodily existence! People may lay down their lives with cheerfulness in the sure expectation of a blessed immortality; but that is a different affair from giving up youth with all its admirable pleasures, in the hope of a better quality of gruel in a more than problematical, nay, more than improbable, old age. We should not compliment a hungry man, who should refuse a whole dinner and reserve all his appetite for the dessert, before he knew whether there was to be any dessert or not. If there be such a thing as imprudence in the world, we surely have it here. We sail in leaky bottoms and on great and perilous waters; and to take a cue from the dolorous old naval ballad, we have heard the mermaids singing, and know that we shall never see dry land any more. Old and young, we are all <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>last</b> cruise. If there is a fill of tobacco among the crew, for God's sake pass it round, and let us have a pipe before we go! ...|$|E
