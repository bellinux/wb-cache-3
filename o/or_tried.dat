5|$|This {{still left}} the {{question}} of relations between the U.S. and the League. Hughes' State Department initially ignored communications from the League, <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> to bypass it through direct communications with member nations. By 1922, though, the U.S., through its consul in Geneva, was dealing with the League, and though the U.S. refused to participate in any meeting with political implications, it sent observers to sessions on technical and humanitarian matters.|$|E
5|$|As Japan {{began to}} re-establish itself diplomatically, the Hinomaru {{was used as}} a {{political}} weapon overseas. In a visit by the Emperor Hirohito and the Empress Kōjun to the Netherlands, the Hinomaru was burned by Dutch citizens who demanded that either he be sent home to Japan <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> for the deaths of Dutch prisoners of war during the Second World War. Domestically, the flag was not even used in protests against a new Status of Forces Agreement being negotiated between U.S. and Japan. The most common flag used by the trade unions and other protesters was the red flag of revolt.|$|E
5|$|Tillman as {{governor}} initially took a strong stand against lynching. The Shell Manifesto, in reciting {{the ills of}} Conservative government, had blamed the Bourbons for encouraging lynching through bad laws and poor administration. Although Governor Richardson, Tillman's predecessor, had taken action to prevent such murders, they still occurred, with no one being prosecuted for them. In {{about half of the}} lynchings in South Carolina between 1881 and 1895, there were claims that the black victim had raped <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> to rape a white woman, though studies have shown that lynchings were tied to economic and social issues. More lynchings took place in South Carolina in the 1890s than in any other decade, and in Edgefield and several other counties, such killings outnumbered lawful executions.|$|E

5|$|Trapped {{refugees}} began {{piling up}} bodies as barricades {{and tried to}} dig into the ground to hide. Some managed to escape that first night, while U.S. troops turned searchlights on the tunnels and continued firing, said Chung Koo-ho, whose mother died shielding him and his sister. By the second day, the gunfire was reduced to potshots and occasional fusillades when a trapped refugee moved <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> to escape. Some also recall planes returning that second day to fire rockets or drop bombs. Racked with thirst, survivors resorted to drinking blood-filled water from a small stream running under the bridge.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} after the Second World War, Protestants in the USSR (Baptists, Pentecostals, Adventists and others) {{were sent to}} mental {{hospitals}} <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> and imprisoned, often for refusal to enter military service. Some were deprived of their parental rights.|$|E

25|$|In Flanders, the {{situation}} was very stable, with the limited local publication possibilities all taken by the established authors of the 1940s and 1950s, leaving no room for new talents after the disappearance of most magazines. New artists either started working in the large Studio Vandersteen <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> to get into Spirou and Tintin, thereby strengthening the bond between the comics scenes of both language groups.|$|E

25|$|The {{kingdom of}} Khotan {{was one of}} the many small states found in the Tarim Basin that {{included}} Yarkand, Loulan (Shanshan), Turfan, Kashgar, Karashahr, and Kucha (the last three together with Khotan made up the four Garrisons during the Tang dynasty). To the west were Central Asian kingdoms of Sogdiana and Bactria. It was surrounded by powerful neighbours, such as the Kushan Empire, China, Tibet, and for a time the Xiongnu, all of which had exerted <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> to exert their influence over Khotan at various times.|$|E
25|$|The law {{provides}} 120 days of paid {{maternity leave}} {{to women and}} seven days to men. The law also prohibits employers from requiring applicants or employees to take pregnancy tests or present sterilization certificates, but some employers sought sterilization certificates from female job applicants <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> to avoid hiring women of childbearing age. Violations of the law are punishable by jail terms for employers of up to two years, while the company may be fined 10 times the salary of its highest-paid employee.|$|E
25|$|Arundell and Howard cleared {{themselves}} of De Vere's accusations, although Howard remained {{under house arrest}} into August, while Arundell was not freed until October or November. None of the three was ever indicted <b>or</b> <b>tried.</b> In the meantime De Vere was at liberty, and won a tournament at Westminster on 22 January. His page's speech at the tournament, describing De Vere's appearance as the Knight of the Tree of the Sun, was published in 1592 in a pamphlet entitled Plato, Axiochus.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Cold War in the late 1940s Big Diomede became a Russian military base and all its native residents were removed to mainland Russia. When people from Little Diomede went too close to the Russian side <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> to visit their relatives on the neighboring island during World War II, they were taken captive. According to one of the survivors, Oscar Ahkinga, after 52 days of internment and interrogation, the Iñupiat were banished and told not to come back.|$|E
25|$|On 4 December the Division {{was engaged}} in a {{textbook}} attack on Blerick to eliminate the remaining German bridgehead on the River Maas. The following day the regiment lost one of its best-known members, Gunner Frederick 'Paddy' Mills, a pre-war professional footballer for Leeds United, who dismounted from a vehicle while it was halted in a taped route through a minefield. It was unclear whether he stepped on a mine <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> to retrieve a booby-trapped box, but he was killed instantly.|$|E
25|$|On August 24, 1970, near 3:40am, a bomb {{exploded}} next to Sterling Hall, aimed at destroying the Army Math Research Center.

The physics department was severely damaged, while the intended target, the AMRC, was scarcely affected. Karleton Armstrong, Dwight Armstrong, and David Fine were found responsible for the blast. Leo Burt was identified as a suspect, but was never apprehended <b>or</b> <b>tried.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another way {{to prevent}} worker born larvae is that other workers or the queen may attempt to sting or push the ovipositing, egg laying, workers off of the cells. It is {{important}} to note that workers almost never acted aggressively towards the queen <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> to prevent her from laying eggs. This results in nearly all eggs that mature being queen produced. Even after the original queen in a colony dies and the new queens leave, workers may lay eggs but these eggs usually starve, rarely reaching maturity.|$|E
25|$|Kennedy {{connections}} and influence were turned directly into political capital for the senatorial and presidential campaigns of sons John, Robert and Ted. Historian Richard J. Whalen describes Kennedy's influence on John Kennedy's policy decisions in his biography of Joe. Joe was influential {{in creating the}} Kennedy Cabinet (Robert Kennedy as Attorney General although he had never argued <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> a case, for example). However, in 1961, Joe Kennedy suffered a stroke that placed even more limitations on his influence in his sons' political careers. Kennedy expanded the Kennedy Compound, which continues as a major center of family get-togethers.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, on 11 August, Rau's family officially {{reported}} her as {{a missing}} person to the New South Wales Police. The police launched a public appeal, advertising in newspapers and placing posters nearby. On 12 August, NSW police contacted DIMIA, to search their records for information about Rau. The search revealed nothing, {{and there was no}} further interstate cooperation. The police contacted DIMIA again six weeks later, on 24 September, in an attempt to discover whether Rau had left <b>or</b> <b>tried</b> to leave Australia. DIMIA replied that she had not left, and was still in the country.|$|E
