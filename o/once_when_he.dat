25|$|Sheffield {{was a good}} {{hitter in}} the Little Leagues.

25|$|Carlton Gary {{was born}} on September 24, 1950 in Columbus, Georgia. His father was a {{construction}} worker who {{wanted nothing to do}} with him and would accept no financial responsibility for him. Gary only met his father <b>once,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was twelve years old. Gary's mother was extremely poor and as a result, they moved around a lot. He was malnourished most of the time and was often left with his aunt or great aunt, both maids for elderly, wealthy, white women. In elementary school, Gary suffered serious head trauma when he was knocked unconscious in a playground accident, and in his teens, he was a heavy drug user. Between the ages of 14 and 18, he was arrested multiple times for robbery, arson, and assault. During that time, he also got married to a woman named Sheila, and had two children. In 1970, he moved to Albany, New York, where he had plans to become a singer, but he continued to carry out his criminal activities.|$|E

25|$|Johnson was {{an early}} example of the celebrity athlete in the modern era, {{appearing}} regularly {{in the press and}} later on radio and in motion pictures. He earned considerable sums endorsing various products, including patent medicines, and indulged several expensive hobbies such as automobile racing and tailored clothing, as well as purchasing jewelry and furs for his wives. He even challenged champion racer Barney Oldfield to a match auto race at the Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York one mile (1.6km) dirt track. Oldfield, far more experienced, easily out-distanced Johnson, ending any thoughts the boxer might have had about becoming a professional driver. <b>Once,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was pulled over for a $50 speeding ticket (a large sum at the time), he gave the officer a $100 bill; when the officer protested that he couldn't make change for that much, Johnson told him to keep the change, as {{he was going to make}} his return trip at the same speed. Johnson was also interested in opera (his favorite being Il Trovatore) and in history — he was an admirer of Napoleon Bonaparte, believing him to have risen from a similar origin to his own. In 1920, Johnson opened a night club in Harlem; he sold it three years later to a gangster, Owney Madden, who renamed it the Cotton Club.|$|E
25|$|Ethel lives above Doctor Legg's (Leonard Fenton) {{surgery and}} works as the cleaner in the pub. She is {{somewhat}} of a troublemaker and often spreads the most insane rumours about and gets her words mixed up with hilarious consequences. She is famous for her questionable ability to read-palms and tea-leaves, once even earning a living from it. After Lou's death in 1988 Ethel and Dot become an inseparable double-act and although the two argue constantly, they actually depend on each other a great deal. Despite the fact that Ethel appears totally barmy, she can be quite astute when she wants and she is always the first {{to point out the}} malicious ways of Dot's villainous son, Nick Cotton (John Altman). Ethel is never afraid to stand up to Nick, even kneeing him in the groin <b>once</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> attempts to mug her. She also correctly figures out that Nick is trying to poison Dot to get her money, and she refuses to back down, despite Dot falling out with her because of her accusations. Following several falls and a broken hip, Ethel is persuaded to move out of her residence above the surgery and into sheltered housing in 1988. Although she is strongly opposed to this initially, she eventually comes to enjoy her new home, though she would continue to show up in Albert Square regularly.|$|E
500|$|Singh always {{aspired to}} be an actor, {{participating}} in several school plays and debates. <b>Once</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had gone for a birthday party, his grandmother asked him to dance and entertain her. Singh remembers that he suddenly jumped in the lawn and started dancing to the song [...] "Chumma Chumma" [...] from the 1991 action film, Hum. He felt the thrill of performing and was interested in acting and dancing. However, after he joined H.R. College of Commerce and Economics in Mumbai, Singh realised that getting {{a break in the}} film industry was not at all easy, as it was mostly people with a film background who got these opportunities. Feeling that the idea of acting was [...] "too far-fetched", Singh focused on creative writing. He went to the United States where he received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University.|$|E

500|$|Australia {{were set}} {{a target of}} 60 runs for victory, and Hassett elected to not have the pitch rolled. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Hassett [...] "might have made an initial mistake in not having the pitch rolled because {{whenever}} there was rain about in England the heavy roller seemed to knock any nonsense [...] out of the pitch". Hassett and Hamence both fell with the score on 20 to leave Australia five down. Australia slumped to 6/31, effectively seven down with Loxton incapacitated by injury, but scraped home without further loss with Harvey and Tallon at the crease. Harvey was given two chances, <b>once</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was on one, and Tallon was also missed. It would have been their first defeat against an English county since 1912, but Harvey won {{the game with a}} straight drive over the fence. Wickets had fallen at less than 10 runs apiece, and at the rate of every four overs.|$|E
500|$|Since {{leaving for}} Spain at age 13, Messi has {{maintained}} {{close ties to}} his hometown of Rosario, even preserving his distinct Rosarino accent. He has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, {{as well as a}} family compound just outside the city. <b>Once</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was in training with the national team in Buenos Aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to Rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to Buenos Aires the next day in time for practice. Messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text {{with a small group of}} confidants in Rosario, most of whom were fellow members of [...] "The Machine of '87" [...] at Newell's Old Boys. Although considered a one-club man, he has long planned to return to Rosario to end his playing career at Newell's. He was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to Barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with Newell's embracing their ties with Messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.|$|E
500|$|Ron {{speaks in}} a deadpan tone of voice and seldom expresses any kind of emotion, {{although}} he is often shown to be very giddy {{when it comes to}} riddles and meat. He adheres to many stereotypically masculine traits. He claims to have only cried twice: <b>once</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was hit by a bus at age 7; secondly when miniature horse Li'l Sebastian died. Ron is an outdoor enthusiast who loves hunting, fishing, camping, and woodworking. For years, Ron has used a park ranger station in the woods as a lodge for private hunting trips with his male colleagues at city hall. He describes fishing as [...] "like yoga, except I still get to kill something." [...] He is particularly attracted to brunettes and what he describes as [...] "strong, self-possessed women {{at the top of their}} fields," [...] with professional athletes Steffi Graf and Sheryl Swoopes among his ideal women. He loves breakfast foods and red meats; among the types of food he enjoys are bacon-wrapped shrimp, fried turkey legs inside a grilled hamburger, and bacon-wrapped turkey legs, which are known in Pawnee as [...] "The Swanson." [...] He also drinks heavily but seldom feels the effects of alcohol or gets hung over. He primarily drinks scotch whisky, claiming that [...] "Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets." [...] He is an extremely private person, going so far as to redact his birthday from government documents to keep others from holding parties for him (though he did reluctantly provide it as [...] "springtime" [...] on a hospital admission form). Ron knows almost nothing about popular culture; he recognizes the name Julia Roberts only as the [...] "toothy gal from Mystic Pizza," [...] and he once confused the Star Wars film franchise with Harry Potter. He enjoys the music of Willie Nelson, being shown listening to [...] "Hello Walls" [...] and [...] "Buddy" [...] during the series. Ron is extremely concerned with the image people have of him and once refused to seek treatment for a hernia; he instead chose to remain immobile at his desk all day and night until April offered to take him to the hospital.|$|E
