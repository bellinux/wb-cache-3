The virgin queen leaves the nest in a mating flight and is inseminated by one or several males, and there is circumstantial evidence that males are chemically attracted to queens. She then looks for a new nest site and starts excavating a small nest, where she lays eggs and rears a small brood. The queens found new colonies independently and {{without the help of}} other queens or workers; this mode of colony founding is common in formicine ants.

Other plans, including one coordinated with the mosquito control district, have helped to safeguard the existing habitat from potential side effects from chemicals and pesticides. The Sybille Wildlife Research Unit has developed a captive-rearing program through the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. 16 toads are in captivity as of June 1991.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} sampling that has been developed for use on national household surveys in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The design and implementation of household surveys in BiH is particularly challenging {{for a number of}} reasons, including the absence of <b>population</b> registers <b>or</b> <b>other</b> sampling frames, the absence of relevant Census data <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>population</b> statistics, and continuing rapid change in the population of occupied dwellings (building, renovation, and associated population movement). The paper sets out the components of a sampling method that is both practical and statistically efficient. Both the practical and statistical arguments for each proposed component are presented. The results of a field test of the method are summarised. The sample design adopted for the BiH Household Budget Survey 2003 - 04, the first survey to use the new methodology, is described and the paper also sets out how the design can be adapted to the needs of other surveys. The sampling solutions adopted and described in this paper are likely to be applicable also to other situations in which analogous challenges exist...|$|R

In accordance with our hypothesis, we would predict that patterns of performance on a mental mathematics assessment would mirror performance on outcome measures of equivalence and relational thinking.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Anthropometry is used {{to assess}} health of {{individuals}} and communities. It is a tool that provides rapid and quantitative assessment of nutritional and clinical states in children, adults <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>population</b> groups. Height, weight, waist and hip circumferences in adults, Midarm Circumference (MAC) head and chest circumferences are common anthropometric measurements in children. Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist-To-Hip Ratio (WHR) and Waist-To-Height Ratio (WHtR) commonly used indices to identify adults for intervention and follow up. Anthropometry is a simple, noninvasive and inexpensive method used in community or clinic settings for screening for underlying disease or risk factors. Bihar state has a high population of rural poor. It was decided to study anthropometric patterns of low-income villagers and their vulnerability to CVD risk factors, which are generally associated with affluence and urbanisation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cross-sectional community-based study conducted on low-income adults aged thirty years and above residing in the villages of Phulwari Sharif Block of Patna district.

For inventory of large forests <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>populations,</b> it is common for no list of individual plants to exist, but it is common to have available a map of the area. When such a map is the only available sampling frame, methods are well established for drawing a simple random sample of fixed area plots. Less well-known methods are available if the sample is to consist of individual population members rather than groups of them in plots. Through simulation studies, the efficacies of two methods devised by Dr. K. Iles are considered for drawing a simple random sample of individuals given a map of the population area.|$|E
40|$|Halogenated organic {{compounds}} have had widespread and massive applications in industry, agriculture, and private households, for example, as degreasing solvents, flame retardants and in polymer production. They are {{released to the}} environment through both anthropogenic and natural sources. The most common chlorinated solvents present as contaminants include tetrachloroethene (PCE, perchloroethene) and trichloroethene (TCE). These chlorinated solvents are problematic because of their health hazards and persistence in the environment, threatening human and environmental health. Microbial reductive dechlorination is emerging as a promising approach for the remediation of chlorinated solvents in aquifers. In microbial reductive dechlorination, specialized bacteria obtain energy for growth from metabolic dechlorination reactions that convert PCE to TCE, cis- 1, 2 -dichloroethene (cDCE), vinyl chloride (VC), and finally to benign ethene. Field studies show incomplete dechlorination of PCE to ethene {{due to lack of}} electron donors <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>populations</b> competing for the electron donor. Mathematical models are good tools to integrate the processes affecting the fate and transport of chlorinated solvents in the subsurface. This thesis explores the use o...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for {{sunflower}} capitulum {{resistance to}} head rot (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) were studied on {{a population of}} recombinant inbred lines (RIL), by infection at flowering with suspensions of ascospores.

The inbred lines were genotyped with RFLP and SSR markers which were mapped to give correspondence between different widely published maps and so permit comparison of QTL results in different sunflower populations. Two or three QTL were shown for each character, generally each representing only 8 - 15 % of phenotypic variance.

40|$|Human Resource Planning (HRP) plays {{a pivotal}} role in {{organizations}} through providing the balance between supply and demand for qualified human resources; in times of crisis, especially those cases with large number of fatalities, HRP will become even more important. In the case of Bam earthquake in 2003, the public education system of the region, with around 32000 students and 2700 teachers, was heavily struck by loss of around 900 teachers. The present research, therefore, aims to investigate the various factors affecting the implementation of HRP in the studied case, through a qualitative method (case study), using semi-structured interviews as well as archived documents. Our findings delineate that a variety of factors affect human resource planning after large-scale natural disasters, the most outstanding of which being the access to reliable information and statistics, as well such social factors as immigrations to and from the region due to the disaster, <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>population</b> factors like birth rate during the decade after the disaster.

40|$|Intervening with {{persons in}} the {{immediate}} aftermath of potentially traumatic events poses a number challenges for clinicians. Particularly in clinics that serve military personnel <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>populations</b> whose livelihoods may depend on regaining functioning efficiently following trauma, there is a need for sensitive and effective psychotherapies for acute stress disorder (ASD), a diagnostic category which attempts to capture maladaptive responses to trauma within the initial four weeks. In this context, Palgi and Ben-Ezra (2010) developed “Back to the Future, ” a novel treatment for ASD guided by narrative and constructivist understandings of posttraumatic adjustment (e. g., Neimeyer, 2009; White & Epston, 1990). One of the distinctive aspects of Palgi and Ben-Ezra’s approach involves a departure from exposure-oriented models of psychotherapy so as not to strengthen the substantive core of the traumatic experience for the survivor—called the “traumatic nucleus”—in the early adjustment period. My discussion of Palgi and Ben-Ezra’s case of Mr. G and related general issues uses a framework of three common forms of narrative disruption after trauma.

Identification of social network factors associated with protection within the cultural context of these tight, close knit, and high density rural Yup’ik Alaska Native communities in southwest Alaska can help identify effective prevention strategies for suicide and alcohol use disorder risk. Using data from ego-centered social network and protective factors from suicide and alcohol use disorders surveys with 50 Yup’ik adolescents, we provide descriptive data on structural and network composition variables, identify key network variables that explain major proportions {{of the variance in}} a four principal component structure of these network variables, and demonstrate the utility of these key network variables as predictors of family and community protective factors from suicide and alcohol use disorder risk.
