Parents reported on their own adaptive style and PTS, as well as levels <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> in their child. Results Adaptive style was a significant correlate <b>of</b> <b>PTS.</b> Chil-dren identified as low anxious (LA) or repressors (REP) obtained lower levels <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> than did high anxious (HA) children, both by self-report and parent report. Parents identified as LA or REP self-reported lower levels <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> than HA and also reported lower levels <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> in their children.

Medical providers {{play an important role in}} the identification and treatment <b>of</b> <b>PTS,</b> as they are typically the initial point of contact for families in the wake of a PTE or during a PTE if it is medically related (eg, injury/illness). This paper offers a review of the literature focused on clinical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>PTS,</b> the assessment and diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>PTS,</b> and current effective treatments for PTS in school-age children and adolescents. The clinical presentation <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> is often complex as symptoms may closely resemble other internalizing and externalizing disorders. A number of screening and evaluation tools are available for medical providers to assist them in the accurate diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>PTS.</b> Treatment options are available for youth at minimal risk <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> as well as for those with more intensive needs. Additional training regarding trauma-informed medical care may benefit medical providers. By taking a trauma-informed approach, rooted in a solid understanding of the clinical presentation <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> in children and adolescents, medical providers can ensure PTS does not go undetected, minimize the traumatic aspects of medical care, and better promote health and well-being.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Postthrombotic {{syndrome}} (PTS) {{develops in}} 40 % to 60 % {{of patients with}} deep venous thrombosis. Factors {{that are important in}} the development <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> include venous reflux, deep vein obstruction, and calf muscle pump dysfunction (CMD). Methods: Reflux and CMD in relationship to the severity <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> were evaluated in a 2 -year follow-up study of patients with acute deep venous thrombosis. Duplex scanning was used to measure reflux. The supine venous pump function test (SVPT) measures CMD with strain-gauge plethysmography. The base-line examination was performed within 1 to 5 days after diagnosis. The next examinations were scheduled at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. Results: The study included 86 legs, and the 2 -year follow-up period was completed for 70 legs. Significantly more reflux was found in previously thrombosed vein segments, with an odds ratio of 1. 8 after 3 months, of 2. 1 after 6 months, of 2. 5 after 12 months, and of 3. 2 after 24 months. Multiple regression results showed that the most important risk factor for early clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> was superficial reflux in months 3, 6, and 12 (P ≤. 02). Deep reflux did not have a synergistic relationship with superficial reflux in correlation with the clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>PTS.</b> The SVPT was not able to predict the development <b>of</b> <b>PTS.</b> Conclusion: More reflux develops in previously thrombosed vein segments. As early as after the third month, patients with superficial reflux have an increased risk of development of the first clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>PTS.</b> Within 2 years, the SVPT shows no relationship with clinical signs <b>of</b> <b>PTS.</b> (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 1184 - 9. ...|$|R

After one, two and six years patients were evaluated for PTS using the clinical scale <b>of</b> the CEAP-classification (<b>PTS</b> present > or = 3 on a scale from 0 to 6). Area under the curves (AUC) were used to evaluate the predictive value of the non-invasive examinations at one and three months after diagnosis of DVT for future PTS. The cumulative incidence <b>of</b> <b>PTS</b> increased from 49 % (32 / 65) after one year to 55 % (36 / 65) and 56 % (27 / 48) after two and six years, whereas the incidence <b>of</b> patients with <b>PTS</b> class 4 progressed from 20 % after two years to 33 % after six years.

Rauch, Eftekhari and Ruzek conducted a study {{with a sample of}} 42 combat servicemen who were already diagnosed with chronic PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). These combat servicemen were pre-screened using several different diagnostic self-reports including the PTSD military checklist, a screening tool used by the military in the determination of the intensity of the diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>PTSD</b> by measuring the presence <b>of</b> <b>PTSD</b> symptoms. Although 22 of the servicemen dropped out of the study, {{the results of the study}} concerning the 20 remaining servicemen still has merit. The servicemen were given the same diagnostic tests after the study which consisted of multiple sessions of virtual reality exposure and virtual reality exposure therapy. The servicemen showed much improvement in the diagnostic scores, signaling a decrease of symptoms <b>of</b> <b>PTSD.</b> Likewise, a three-month follow-up diagnostic screening was also administered after the initial sessions that were undergone by the servicemen. The results of this study showed that 15 of the 20 participants no longer met diagnostic criteria for PTSD and improved their PTSD military checklist score by 50% for the assessment following the study. Even though only 17 of the 20 participants participated in the 3-month follow-up screening, 13 of the 17 still did not meet the criteria for PTSD and maintained their 50% improvement in the PTSD military checklist score. These results show promising effects and help to validate virtual reality therapy as an efficacious mode of therapy for the treatment <b>of</b> <b>PTSD</b> (McLay, et al., 2012).|$|E
