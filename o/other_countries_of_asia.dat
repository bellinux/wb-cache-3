Settling in New York in 1947, she took a number of jobs, including one at Time magazine. Gordon eventually returned to her primary interest, the performing arts. She had studied ballet, modern, ethnic, and folk dance, as well as piano and drama in Tokyo and at Mills. While raising her two young children, she joined the reactivated Japan Society in New York City in 1954 as Director of Student Programs, providing career and job counseling to Japanese students in New York. One of the students was Yoko Ono, with whom she maintained a lifelong friendship. She also worked with visual artists, arranging exhibits and lecture-demonstrations, including the first American visit of the renowned woodblock artist, Shikō Munakata. In 1958 she was appointed the Society's Director of Performing Arts. In this capacity she introduced a number of Japanese performing artists to the New York public, helping to develop many careers. Among these artists were Toshi Ichiyanagi, now one of Japan's foremost composers and Suzushi Hanayagi, whom she introduced to the theater director Robert Wilson, with whom Hanayagi collaborated on the Knee Plays, and other works.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} {{and design of}} coastal shore protection works for tsunamis assumed considerable importance following {{the impact of the}} 26 th December 2004 tsunami in India and <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>Asia.</b> The lack of proper guidelines made matters worse and resulted in the great damage that occurred. Subsequent surveys indicated that scour resulting from high water velocities was one of the prime reasons in the damage of simple structures. In some cases, it became apparent that sea walls were helpful in minimizing the degree of damage. The objective of the present study is to illustrate how proper design analysis for expected wave heights as well as the use of flexible systems such as geocells, are likely to provide better shoreline protection. Protective systems can be designed that can withstand wave forces that correspond to a variety of incidence probabilities. The present study illustrates such an analytical design approach that is necessary for a shoreline protection system and provides references to relevant wave height data for the east coast of India...|$|E

Government {{statistics show that}} 146 registered CBSPOs with 3, 500 members (households) were involved in rice seed production in 2009.

40|$|Direct farmer-consumer {{relationships}} {{are described in}} the literature as efficient forms of resistance to global distribution chains, in particular as regards farmer incomes and consumer trust in product safety. Research {{was carried out in}} Vietnam to measure the importance of this type of sales in the vegetable sector, and how farmers and consumers perceive it relative to other forms of supply. Consumer surveys and focus groups were conducted, as well as inventories of vegetable retail points of sales and a case study of a farmer group based on in-depth interviews with group leaders. Direct sales are especially observed in the case of safe vegetables sold in market stalls or in shops managed by farmer groups. Consumers buying directly from farmers value product freshness and specific information relative to product origin and safety. Farmers value direct retail sales because it enables quick cash delivery and a higher share of the final price. Yet only the wealthiest farmers have access to this type of sales by renting their own outlet shops or market stalls. Moreover, the guarantee of vegetable safety is not supported by a reliable government quality control system.

This is used in traditional medicine due to the wide spectrum of pharmacological activities associated with the biologically active chemicals present in this plant. In the present study, we report the chemopreventive effects of T. chebulaagainst DMH induced colon oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Colon toxicity was initiated by single i. p injection of DMH 20 mg/kg BW for 16 wk. To ascertain the molecular mechanism implicated in the anti-inflammatory activity of T. chebulaits effect was investigated on inflammation: iNOS and COX- 2 expression, and on levels of nitrite and myeloperoxidaes. Pretreatment of animals with T. chebula at both doses (50 and 100 mg/kg body weight) markedly inhibited all. Further, DMH enhances colonic lipid peroxidation, with concomitant reduction in colon glutathione content (GSH), antioxidant enzymes, and phase II metabolizing enzymes. Treatment with T. chebulaameliorate the damaging effects induced by DMH through a protective mechanism that may involve reduction of increased oxidative stress markers, alleviate the expressions, levels and activities ofCOX- 2, iNOS, TNFα, PCNA, MPO, NO and Mast cellinfiltration.

Groundwater samples (n = 70) were collected along the River Chenab and examined for F− concentrations. The average F−concentrations in groundwater of village Chhani Nikoani (1. 8 mg/L) and Dhool Khurd (2. 2 mg/L) were crossing the World Health Organization (WHO) permissible limit of 1. 5 mg/L, while village Kalra Khasa, Ghazi Chak and Kula Chor were below the WHO guidelines. About 64 % {{of the samples}} contain fluoride concentrations that exceed the 1. 5 mg/L drinking water standard set by WHO. Spatially F− concentrations in groundwater increased as {{moving away from the}} River Chenab because more residence time for water–rock interaction was available. High F− concentrations were associated with high electric conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), pH and Na+ values. The overall groundwater quality is controlled by silicate mineral weathering and less by evaporation. Fluoride originates from anion exchange (OH− for F−) on clays and weathered micas under high pH conditions. High fluoride levels are associated with NaCl- and NaHCO 3 -type water produced by calcite precipitation and/or base ion exchange. The groundwater with higher fluoride concentrations is accompanied by lower Ca+ 2 levels. This study enhances our understanding on geochemical behavior of F and highlights the importance of spatial variability on F release in aquifers of Punjab in Pakistan, as well as in <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>Asia</b> region...|$|E
