MaxOpus was relaunched earlier in 2009.|$|R
40|$|Control-synthesis {{techniques}} are developed for demand -driven production systems. The resulting policies are timeoptimal for a deterministic model, and approximately time-optimal for a stochastic model. Moreover, they are easily adapted {{to take into}} account a range of issues that arise in a realistic, dynamic environment. In particular, control synthesis {{techniques are}} developed for models in which resources are <b>temporarily</b> <b>unavailable.</b> This may be due to failure, maintenance, or an unanticipated change in demand. These conclusions are based upon the following development [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Fake {{access points}} {{are set up}} by {{configuring}} a wireless card {{to act as an}} access point (known as HostAP). They are hard to trace since they can be shut off instantly. The counterfeit access point may be given the same SSID and BSSID as a nearby Wi-Fi network. The evil twin can be configured to pass Internet traffic through to the legitimate access point while monitoring the victim's connection, or it can simply say the system is <b>temporarily</b> <b>unavailable</b> after obtaining a username and password.|$|R

When random customers are accumulated, the server is immediately turned on but is <b>temporarily</b> <b>unavailable</b> to the waiting customers. It needs a startup time before starting providing service. After all customers in the system are served exhaustively, the server is shut down by a closedown time.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} running a background job on a selected machine {{of a collection of}} machines. Each of these machines may become <b>temporarily</b> <b>unavailable</b> (busy) without warning. If the currently selected machine becomes unavailable, the scheduler is allowed to restart the job on a different machine. The behaviour of machines is characterized by a Markov chain, which can be compared to [6]. The objective is to minimize the expected completion time of the job. For several types of Markov chains, we present elegant and optimal policies...|$|R
