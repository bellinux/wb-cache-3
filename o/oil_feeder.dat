5000|$|An {{innovation}} was {{the motorcycle}} fork, patented by Joe Merkel as a [...] "truss fork" [...] and {{which could be}} seen as a predecessor of the telescopic fork. The Flying Merkel had an automatically dripping <b>oil</b> <b>feeder,</b> which was subsequently copied by Indian and Harley-Davidson. In 1913 a new model appeared: the engine had now an automatically controlled inlet valve and a spring-loaded kickstarter. Production ceased in 1915. The Flying Merkel achieved its iconic status through the shape of its tank and the colorful body paint.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph {{received}} his education in Sydney then indentured at the Sydney firm of John Fitzpatrick, coppersmith. One year after Sutton became a journeyman, {{he moved to}} Brisbane. In May 1870, he started business with his friend James Hipwood as Hipwood and Sutton. The partners, with others, started the Bulimba Smelting Works, Mr. Sutton taking the position of manager. To illustrate the language and sign of the times, the following advertisement of 9 June 1870 in The Brisbane Courier is provided.Notice.To all those interested in Sugar Making, Distilling, Brewing, Engineering, &c. Messrs. HIPWOOD & SUTTON will commence business as COPPERSMITHS, BRASSFOUNDERS, FINISHERS, PLUMBERS, &c. about MONDAY, June 13, and are prepared to execute any orders {{that they may be}} favored with.Vacuum, Wetzel, Bour, and Tache Pans, Clarifiers, &c.; Rum Stills from 100 to 2000 gallons; Wine and Whiskey Stills, 15 to 100 gallons; Brewing Coppers and Tinned Copper Pipes of all sizes; Copper and Iron Pipes, Lamps, <b>Oil</b> <b>Feeders,</b> &c., and every requisite for the Engine Room. Address: Hipwood & Sutton, Northern Copper Works, Eagle-street, Brisbane. 4858. - The Brisbane CourierThe company of Hipwood and Sutton did business as coppersmiths and brassfounders, and remained in business until 1877, at which time the company disbanded.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{whether there}} were periodically collapsing rational speculative bubbles in commodity prices over a 40 -year period from the late 1960 s. We apply a switching regression approach to {{a broad range of}} commodities using two different measures of fundamental values—estimated from convenience yields and from a set of macroeconomic factors believed to affect commodity demand. We find reliable evidence for bubbles only among crude <b>oil</b> and <b>feeder</b> cattle, showing the popular belief that the extreme price movements observed in commodity markets were caused by pure speculation to be unsustainabl...|$|R
2500|$|A {{network of}} {{gathering}} and feeder pipelines collects crude bitumen and SCO from Alberta's northern oil sands deposits (primarily Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River), and feeds them into two main collection points for southbound deliveries: Edmonton, Alberta and Hardisty, Alberta. Most of the feeder pipelines move blended bitumen or SCO southbound and diluent northbound, {{but a few}} move product laterally within the oil sands region. In 2012, {{the capacity of the}} southbound feeder lines was over 300,000 m³/d (2 million bbl/d) and more capacity was being added. [...] The building of new <b>oil</b> sands <b>feeder</b> pipelines requires only the approval of the Alberta Energy Regulator, an agency that deals with matters entirely within Alberta and is likely to give little consideration to interference from political and environmental interest from outside Alberta.|$|R
5000|$|The goldfinch's {{preferred}} food {{is small}} seeds {{such as those}} from thistles (the Latin name is from Carduus, a genus of thistles) and teasels, but insects are also taken when feeding young. It also regularly visits bird feeders in winter. In the winter goldfinches group together to form flocks of up to forty, occasionally more. Goldfinches are attracted to back gardens in Europe and North America by birdfeeders containing [...] (commercially described as nyjer) seed. This seed of an annual from South Asia is small, and high in <b>oils.</b> Special polycarbonate <b>feeders</b> with small oval slits at which the goldfinches feed are sometimes used.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{abundance}} carbon isotope {{analyses are}} sensitive tracers for fates {{and use of}} oil in aquatic environments. Use of oil carbon in estuarine food webs should lead to isotope values approaching those of oil itself, - 27 頦or stable carbon isotopes reflecting oil origins and - 1000 頦or carbon- 14 reflecting oil age. To test for transfer of oil from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill into estuarine food webs, filter-feeding barnacles (Balanus sp.) and marsh mussels (Geukensia demissa) were collected from Louisiana estuaries {{near the site of}} the oil spill. Carbon- 14 analyses of these animals from open waters and oiled marshes showed that oil use was < 1 % and near detection limits estimated at 0. 3 % oil incorporation. Respiration studies showed no evidence for enhanced microbial activity in bay waters. Results are consistent with low dietary impacts of <b>oil</b> for filter <b>feeders</b> and little overall impact on respiration in the productive Louisiana estuarine systems.

40|$|Oral and {{external}} dosing methods replicating field exposure were developed using the double crested cormorant (DCCO) {{to test the}} toxicity of artificially weathered Deepwater Horizon Mississippi Canyon 252 oil. The majority of previous oil dosing studies conducted on wild-caught birds used gavage methods to dose birds with oil and determine toxicity. However, rapid gut transit time of gavaged oil likely reduces oil absorption. In the present studies, dosing relied on injection of <b>oil</b> into live <b>feeder</b> fish for oral dosing of these piscivorous birds, or applying oil to body contour feathers resulting in transdermal oil exposure and oral exposure through preening. Both oral {{and external}} oil dosing studies identified oil-related toxicity endpoints associated with oxidative stress such as hemolytic anemia, liver and kidney damage, and immuno-modulation or compromise. External oil application allowed for controlled study of thermoregulatory stress as well. Infrared thermal images indicated significantly greater surface temperatures and heat loss in treated birds following external oil applications; however, measurements collected by coelomically implanted temperature transmitters showed that internal body temperatures were stable {{over the course of}} the study period. Birds exposed to oil externally consumed more fish than control birds, indicating metabolic compensation for thermal stress. Conversely, birds orally dosed with oil experienced hypothermia and consumed less fish compared to control birds...|$|R
