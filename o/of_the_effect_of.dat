The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight.

5|$|Evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> the Reformation {{was seen}} in early 1524. Candlemas was not celebrated, processions of robed clergy ceased, worshippers did not go with palms or relics on Palm Sunday to the Lindenhof, and triptychs {{remained}} covered and closed after Lent. Opposition to the changes came from Konrad Hofmann and his followers, but the council decided in favour of keeping the government mandates. When Hofmann left the city, opposition from pastors hostile to the Reformation broke down. The bishop of Constance tried to intervene in defending the mass and the veneration of images. Zwingli wrote an official response for the council {{and the result was}} the severance of all ties between the city and the diocese.|$|E
