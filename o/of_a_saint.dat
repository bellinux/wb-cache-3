5|$|Eleanor {{probably}} {{hoped that}} Henry would be recognised as a saint, as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been; indeed, Henry's final tomb resembled the shrine <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint,</b> complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics. When the King's body was exhumed in 1290, contemporaries {{noted that the}} body was in perfect condition and that Henry's long beard remained well preserved, {{which at the time}} was considered to be an indication of saintly purity. Miracles began to be reported at the tomb, but Edward was sceptical about these stories. The reports ceased, and Henry was never canonised. In 1292 Henry's heart was removed from his tomb and reburied at Fontevraud Abbey with the bodies of his Angevin family.|$|E
5|$|In Vagrant Story, the Iocus priesthood of {{the kingdom}} of Valendia is shown to use the Kildean rood as a symbol, {{although}} they follow the teachings <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint</b> named Iocus instead of the original Kildean teachings of the Kiltia religion of Leá Monde. Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia, and bore the rood on her back. The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic, seeing it as an abomination, and yet its higher members continue to use it behind the scenes. This hypocrisy is revealed {{over the course of the}} story, though it goes unresolved.|$|E

5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint</b> appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if having just momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} canonization {{procedures have}} begun for Richard, though the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette began collecting testimonials about reputed help obtained through her in 1991. Unlike the traditional support for canonization <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint,</b> which begins with popular devotion {{and is only}} later recognized by the Church, support for Richard began outside her immediate home area and was first promoted by the clergy, beginning with Brennan, Crowley, and Calais. The bishop of the Lafayette diocese {{at the time of}} her death, Maurice Schexnayder, visited her grave multiple times and referred to her as a saint. Another bishop of the diocese, Harry Flynn, presided at the thirtieth anniversary mass in 1989, along with sixteen other priests. The diocese also approved the creation of a private organization, the Friends of Charlene, to spread her story.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag was}} {{examined}} in the early 20th century by A.J.B. Wace of the Victoria and Albert Museum, who concluded that the silk was woven in either Syria or Rhodes, and the darns {{were made in the}} Near East. It was his opinion that the flag, in its original state, would have been quite precious, possibly a relic like the shirt <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint.</b> The belief {{at the time of this}} examination was the MacLeods were descended from Harald Hardrada, who spent some time in Constantinople in the 11th century. In line with this belief, it was suggested that the flag may have passed from Harald Hardrada down to the eponymous ancestor of the clan—Leod. The MacLeod Estate Office (Dunvegan Castle) website claims that experts have dated the flag to the 4th and 7th centuries—hundreds of years before the Crusades. The flag is currently held in Dunvegan Castle, along with other notable heirlooms such as the Dunvegan Cup and Sir Rory Mor's Horn.|$|E

5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like the figure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint,</b> is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|Cathedrals {{are places}} where the Christian rituals {{particular}} to a bishop, especially ordination and enthronement, can be performed, and are structured and furnished for these purposes. Each cathedral contains {{the seat of the}} local bishop, often literally a large throne. The bishop's throne is located towards the eastern end of the cathedral, near the high altar, which is main focus of worship. On the altar is served the Eucharist, a symbolic meal of bread and wine in memory of Jesus’ last supper with his disciples. In the early Medieval period, the altar always contained, or was associated with, the relics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint.</b> Sometimes the relics were held in a separate shrine, near the high altar. In this part of the church are often located the tombs of former bishops, typically arranged either side of the major shrine, so the worshipping congregation symbolically comprised the whole body of clergy of the diocese, both living and dead, in communion with their patron saint. Seats are provided for the other significant clergy of the cathedral: the dean who is the foremost priest at the cathedral, the precentor, sacristan, archdeacon and canons.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} of most Norfolk churches contain much pre-Reformation graffiti, {{unless they have}} been heavily limewashed or resurfaced. The churches of the Glaven ports in general, and Blakeney in particular, conform to this pattern. St Nicholas has an extensive array of prayers, merchant's marks and other symbols, but is notable for {{the large number of}} depictions of ships, at least 30, heavily concentrated in the nave towards the eastern end of the south aisle. There is a side altar there of unknown dedication, and an empty niche that would have once held the image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint.</b> The pillars were painted red in the Middle Ages, and ship images scratched into the soft, chalky stone would have been much more conspicuous than they are now. It is likely that the images, mostly of smaller ships, were created as votive offerings by the seafaring inhabitants of the port. The carving of ship graffiti in religious buildings is a tradition in ports going back to the Bronze Age, and has been found across Europe.|$|E
50|$|<b>Saint</b> Peulan was <b>a</b> Welsh {{holy man}} {{in the early part}} of the 6th century, the son <b>of</b> Paulinus, <b>a</b> <b>saint</b> from south Wales who taught <b>Saint</b> David. <b>A</b> {{follower}} <b>of</b> Cybi, <b>a</b> <b>saint</b> associated with the island of Anglesey in north Wales, Peulan is commemorated in the dedication of the church he reportedly founded, St Peulan's Church, Llanbeulan, on Anglesey.|$|R

5|$|The {{southern}} side of {{the church}} has nine bays, again divided by buttresses. In the third bay from the west is a porch. The other bays each contain a two-light window with trefoil heads. The porch is in two storeys, with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles. The lower storey contains a doorway with a pointed arch, and the upper storey has a two-light window. The doorway and window are set slightly {{to the west of}} the centre, as the east wall contains a stairway. Inside the porch are stone seats and the remains of two stoups (holy water fonts). The staircase leading to the upper storey is composed of old gravestones. On the outer wall of the upper storey is a sundial. The west end of the church is in Perpendicular style, and has five bays. At its centre is another porch, this one with three storeys. At the west front are diagonal buttresses, and in the bottom storey is a double doorway, over which is a canopied niche containing the weathered image <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint.</b> In the middle storey is a three-light window, in the top storey a two-light window, and at the summit is a battlemented parapet. There are windows in the north and south faces of the top stage, and on the north side is an octagonal stair turret. Inside the porch are four corbels (supporting brackets) carved with musicians. On each {{side of the}} porch is a four-light window. At the west end of the north aisle is a four-light window, and a five-light window is at the end of the south aisle.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the practice of the}} Orthodox Church, a particular hero of faith can initially be canonized only at a local level within local churches and eparchies. Such rights belong to the ruling hierarch and it can only happen when the blessing of the patriarch is received. The task of believers of the local eparchy is to record descriptions of miracles, to create the hagiography <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint,</b> to paint an icon, as well as to compose a liturgical text of a service where the saint is glorified. All of this is sent to the Synodal Commission for canonization which decides whether to canonize the local hero of faith or not. Then the patriarch gives his blessing and the local hierarch performs the act of canonization at the local level. However, the liturgical texts in honor <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint</b> are not published in all Church books but only in local publications. In the same way these saints are not yet glorified and venerated by the whole Church, only locally. When the glorification <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>saint</b> exceeds the limits of an eparchy, then the patriarch and Holy Synod decides about their canonization on the Church level. After receiving the Synod’s support and the patriarch’s blessing, the question of glorification of a particular saint on the scale of the entire Church is given for consideration to the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church.|$|E
