40|$|We have {{systematically}} examined nitrogen-rich silicon <b>oxynitrides</b> with a {{thickness of}} about 2 nm grown by rapid thermal nitridation in ammonia. In this paper the nitrogen incorporation {{as well as}} the electrical properties of the <b>oxynitrides</b> are discussed in detail. With the help of elastic recoil detection measurements it could be shown that the incorporated nitrogen concentration can be controlled precisely in a range between 20 and 60 %, which means that even pure silicon nitride can be thermally grown in ammonia. Depending on the process flow it is also possible to adjust the nitrogen and oxygen profiles across the dielectrics depth. Regarding the electrical properties of the grown <b>oxynitrides,</b> we examined the impact of the variation of the process parameters and the impact of postnitridation anneals. It was found that the dilution of the process gas ammonia by the inert gas argon has a big impact {{on the quality of the}} dielectric.

The reaction rate data was collected using specially designed micro-batch reactors. The Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }-supported Mo <b>oxynitrides</b> and oxycarbides were competitively active for quinoline hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), benzothiophene hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and benzofuran hydrodeoxygenation (HDO).
