5|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, {{the force}} became {{the topic of}} many radio {{broadcasts}} and films. Radio series such as the Renfrew of the Mounted and Challenge of the Yukon continued the portrayal of the mounted police as iconic heroes, Challenge later translating onto television in the 1950s as Sergeant Preston of the Yukon. Over 250 films were made about the force in the 20th century, including the highly successful 1936 musical Rose Marie. The popularity <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>films</b> finally waned in the 1970s, although this image of the force continued to influence late-20th century television portrayals of the modern Royal Canadian Mounted Police, such as the series Due South which centred on a mounted police constable from the Yukon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1940s Babb joined Cox and Underwood, {{a company that}} {{obtained}} the rights to poorly made or otherwise unmarketable films of subjects that were potentially controversial or shocking. It would often remove entire sections <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>films</b> and add material such as medical reels that lent itself to sensational promotion. Babb went {{on the road with}} a Cox and Underwood concoction titled Dust to Dust, a reworking of High School Girl with a childbirth scene added to the end. Its profits allowed Cox and Underwood to retire from the business, leaving Babb to start his own company, Hygienic Productions. He opened it near his childhood home in Wilmington, Ohio, and hired booking agents and advance salesmen along with out-of-work actors and comedians to present repackaged films and new features.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence's fame {{continued}} to grow with her starring role as Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games film series (2012–2015), which established her as the highest-grossing action heroine of all time. She went on to earn various accolades for her collaborations with director David O. Russell. Her performance as a depressed and bipolar widow in the romance film Silver Linings Playbook (2012) earned her an Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the second-youngest winner of the award. Lawrence subsequently won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for playing a troubled wife in the black comedy American Hustle (2013). She also received Golden Globe Awards for her roles in each <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>films,</b> and for her performance as Joy Mangano in the biopic Joy (2015).|$|E

40|$|Post-modernist film {{adaptations of}} Shakespeare often {{deconstruct}} the Shakespeare myth, as do Baz Luhrmann’s prolific Romeo + Juliet (1996), Lloyd Kaufman’s lowbudget Tromeo and Juliet (1996) and Fumitoshi Oizaki’s anime production, Romeo × Juliet (2007), {{all of which}} draw on pop pastiche. Reducing reality to an imitation <b>of</b> signs <b>these</b> <b>films</b> inflate signs that are deprived of their essence. Placing Romeo and Juliet into a world that continually references itself through an abundance <b>of</b> signs, <b>these</b> <b>films</b> ask how true, authentic love can be experienced...|$|R

5|$|To {{complete}} her {{contract with}} Paramount Pictures, Wong made {{a string of}} B movies in the late 1930s. Often dismissed by critics, the films gave Wong non-stereotypical roles which were publicized in the Chinese-American press for their positive images. These smaller-budgeted films could be bolder than the higher-profile releases and Wong used this to her advantage to portray successful, professional, Chinese-American characters. Competent and proud of their Chinese heritage, these roles worked against the prevailing U.S. film portrayals of Chinese Americans. In contrast to the usual official Chinese condemnation of Wong's film roles, the Chinese consul to Los Angeles gave his approval to the final scripts of two <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>films,</b> Daughter of Shanghai (1937) and King of Chinatown (1939).|$|E
5|$|Unofficial sequels to Cannibal Holocaust were {{produced}} {{in the years following}} its release. The titles <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>films</b> were changed following their original theatrical releases in order to associate the film with Cannibal Holocaust in different markets. In 1985, Mario Gariazzo directed Schiave bianche: violenza in Amazzonia, which was also released as Cannibal Holocaust 2: The Catherine Miles Story. In addition to the new title, Slater notes similarities between the score in The Catherine Miles Story and Riz Ortolani's score in Cannibal Holocaust. Previously known for his work in Mondo films, Antonio Climati directed Natura contro in 1988, which was released as Cannibal Holocaust II in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 Selznick {{returned}} to MGM, {{this time as}} a vice-president in charge of his own production unit. During his two years with the studio he produced elaborate versions of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina and Charles Dickens' David Copperfield and A Tale of Two Cities. In 1935, he left MGM to form his own production company, Selznick International Pictures, where he produced adaptations of Robert Smythe Hichens' The Garden of Allah (1936), Frances Hodgson Burnett's Little Lord Fauntleroy (1936), Anthony Hope's The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), and Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938). Selznick also became {{a pioneer in the}} use of Technicolor with the first and last <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>films</b> and also with his productions of A Star is Born and Nothing Sacred (both 1937). In 1939 Selznick brought Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman to the United States to star in Intermezzo and the following year he brought Alfred Hitchcock over from England to direct Rebecca. Also in 1939, Selznick produced his epic version of Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind, which became the most financially successful film of all time.|$|E

5|$|In late December 2009, The Walt Disney Company {{purchased}} Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. In October 2010, Walt Disney Studios {{bought the}} distribution rights for The Avengers and Iron Man 3 from Paramount Pictures, with Paramount's logo {{remaining on the}} films, {{as well as for}} promotional material and merchandise, although Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures is the only studio credited at the end <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>films.</b> Disney has distributed all subsequent Marvel Studios films. In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger from Paramount. The Incredible Hulk {{was not part of the}} deal, due to an agreement between Marvel and Universal, where Marvel owns the film rights and Universal owns the distribution rights, for this film as well as the right of first refusal to distribute future Hulk films. According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not bought the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Disney wants for its own theme parks.|$|E
