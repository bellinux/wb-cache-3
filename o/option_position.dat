2500|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{increase}} {{can buy the}} stock or instead sell, or [...] "write", a put. The trader selling a put {{has an obligation to}} buy the stock from the put buyer at a fixed price ("strike price"). If the stock price at expiration is above the strike price, the seller of the put (put writer) will make a profit in the amount of the premium. If the stock price at expiration is below the strike price by more than the amount of the premium, the trader will lose money, with the potential loss being up to the strike price minus the premium. A benchmark index for the performance of a cash-secured short put <b>option</b> <b>position</b> is the CBOE S 500 PutWrite Index (ticker PUT).|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of the equipoise points and the net value of the <b>option</b> <b>positions</b> has a dominant meaning for every investor in option instruments. Practically both terms are the bearer {{of the most important}} information for each investor – where the threshold between the profit and the loss is and how much exactly the concrete profit or loss is from every single position, which the particular investor has opened or intends to open. Compared to the simple option strategies, in specialized literature and scientific studies, the equipoise points and the net value of the advanced <b>option</b> <b>positions</b> (strategies) are not given the necessary treatment and comments. Due to this, even in practice, usually the specialists rely on approximate values for the current condition of their <b>option</b> <b>positions.</b> The present study specifies the techniques of determination the equipoise points and the net value of the compound and combined <b>option</b> <b>positions,</b> including also the multiplied such. ...|$|R

Conversely, <b>option</b> <b>positions</b> with implicit lending—such as warrants—are tax-advantaged.

Unlike stock trading, {{in which there is a}} fixed number of shares to be traded, option trading can involve the creation of a new option contract when a trade is placed. Open interest will tell you the total number of option contracts that are currently open—in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment.|$|E

50|$|Pin risk {{occurs when}} the market price of the {{underlier}} of an option contract {{at the time of}} the contract's expiration is close to the option's strike price. In this situation, the underlier is said to have pinned. The risk to the writer (seller) of the option is that they cannot predict with certainty whether the option will be exercised or not. So the writer cannot hedge his position precisely and may end up with a loss or gain. There is a chance that the price of the underlier may move adversely, resulting in an unanticipated loss to the writer. In other words, an <b>option</b> <b>position</b> may result in a large, undesired risky position in the underlier immediately after expiration, regardless of the actions of the writer.|$|E

40|$|The Canadian Income Tax Act induces {{individual}} investors {{to close their}} short equity option positions {{at the end of}} the year and, if necessary, reopen them at the beginning of next year. This article analyzes the conditions under which it is optimal to close or leave open a short <b>option</b> <b>position</b> over the tax year boundary. The analysis shows that the latter decision depends on transaction costs, the investor’s marginal tax rate, the interest rates, the initial and end-of-the-year option prices, as well as whether the <b>option</b> <b>position</b> is naked or covered. The article also examines the impact of tax regulations in Canada on the pricing of naked vs. covered call options and American vs. European options (JEL G 13, H 21, K 34).

40|$|We empirically {{study the}} {{economic}} benefits of giving investors access to index options in the standard portfolio problem, analyzing both expected-utility and nonexpected-utility investors {{in order to understand}} who optimally buys and sells options. Using data on S&P 500 index options, CRRA investors find it always optimal to short out-of-the-money puts and at-the-money straddles. The <b>option</b> <b>positions</b> are economically and statistically significant and robust to corrections for transaction costs, margin requirements, and Peso problems. Loss-averse and disappointment-averse investors also optimally hold short <b>option</b> <b>positions.</b> Only with highly distorted probability assessments can we obtain positive portfolio weights for puts (cumulative prospect theory and anticipated utility) and straddles (anticipated utility).

50|$|However, the {{international}} oil prices kept rising and losses expanded. On October 26, 2004, {{because of the}} awful pressure from Merm (Mutsui Energy Risk Management) CAOHC ordered CAO to begin closing its <b>options</b> <b>positions</b> when the oil market price was US$55.65, the highest price of the year. At the end of November, {{the international}} oil prices fell to $46.00/barrel and the average oil price was US$43/barrel {{for the month of}} December 2004. The average price of CAO’s total <b>options</b> <b>position</b> was US$48/barrel. CAO should have the opportunity to gain by hedging when the market price fell below US$48/barrel. Unfortunately by that time all the options were already closed due to the pressures from the counterparties of CAO and the decision to cut loss made by CAOHC, the parent company of CAO.|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of hedge fund returns, which reflect the {{contractual}} relationships between a hedge fund, its investors and its prime brokers. These relationships are modelled as short option positions held by the hedge fund, wherein the “funding option” reflects the short <b>option</b> <b>position</b> with prime brokers and the “redemption option” reflects the short <b>option</b> <b>position</b> with the investors. Given an alpha producing human capital, the hedge fund ′ s ability to deploy leverage is shown to be sharply constrained {{by the presence of}} these short options. We show that the hedge funds typically have an optimal level of leverage. Optimal leverage is shown to differ across hedge funds reflecting their de-levering costs, Sharpe ratios, correlation of assets, secondary market liquidity of their assets, and the volatility of the assets. Using a minimum level of unencumbered cash level as a risk limit, we show how a hedge fund can optimally allocate its risk capital across different risk-taking units to maximize alpha in the presence of these short option positions. Implications of our analysis for hedge fund investors and policy makers are summarized...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{information}} in option volume for the future volatility of underlying stocks. Using a unique data set from the Chicago Board Options Exchange, we construct non-market maker net demand for volatility over the 1990 through 2001 period. We find that this demand possesses information about the future volatility of underlying stocks. A natural interpretation of this result is that investors trade on volatility information in the option market. This interpretation is corroborated by our finding that demand constructed from transactions that open new <b>option</b> <b>positions</b> contains more information about future volatility than demand constructed from transactions that close existing <b>option</b> <b>positions</b> We also examine the asset pricing implications of option investors trading on volatility information. As predicted by theory, {{we find that the}} impact on option prices from each unit of demand increases as informational asymmetry intensifies {{in the days leading up}} to earnings announcements...|$|R
40|$|Contrary to the Black-Scholes paradigm, an option-pricing model which {{incorporates}} {{the possibility of}} jumps more accurately reflects the evolution of stocks in the real world.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the optimal hedging decision of a competitive exporting firm which faces concurrently hedgeable {{exchange rate risk}} and non-hedgeable price risk. We show that the hedging role of currency options is due to two distinct sources of non-linearity: (i) the multiplicative nature of the price and exchange rate risk; and (ii) the marginal utility function of the firm. In particular, we show that a long put <b>option</b> <b>position</b> is optimal when the price risk is negatively correlated with the exchange rate risk and/or the firm is prudent. © 2002 Elsevier B.
