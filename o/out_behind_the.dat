5|$|Gutiérrez lost ninth {{position}} on lap 30 {{when he was}} passed by Kvyat, who drove through standing water {{on the inside of}} the pit lane straight and used DRS. Vettel made his second pit stop for intermediate tyres that lap, rejoining in fifth behind Ricciardo but ahead of both Williams cars. Button recorded faster lap times than Rosberg, closing the gap to 12.8 seconds by the beginning of lap 31. Pérez overtook Gutiérrez to take over tenth {{position on}} the lap. Button made a second pit stop for new intermediate tyres at the end of lap 31; it took longer than expected because his pit crew changed his steering wheel, and he came out behind both Red Bull drivers. Vettel recorded a new fastest lap of the race at one minute and 51.915 seconds, 2.3 seconds quicker than Hamilton; Rosberg made his second pit stop (for new intermediate tyres) on lap 33, and came out behind Ricciardo. Magnussen experienced understeer and spun 360 degrees after running onto the run-off area. Hamilton made a pit stop at the end of lap 35 for new intermediate tyres. Heavy rain began to fall on lap 36. Ricciardo took the lead until his pit stop during that lap and came <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> two Mercedes drivers, Vettel and Button.|$|E

25|$|The {{bulk of the}} Ottoman army were encamped {{south of}} the Golden Horn. The regular European troops, {{stretched}} out along {{the entire length of}} the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from Anatolia under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the Mesoteichion, where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The Bashi-bazouks were spread <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> front lines. Other troops under Zagan Pasha were employed north of the Golden Horn. Communication was maintained by a road that had been constructed over the marshy head of the Horn.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Peck {{undertook}} studies {{once more}} at Cambridge University, making four further first-class appearances {{for the university}} in that season. In total, he made 26 first-class appearance for Cambridge University, scoring 483 runs {{at an average of}} 14.20, with a high score of 49 not <b>out.</b> <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> stumps he took 11 catches. He played Minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire until 1985, by which time he had made 33 Minor Counties Championship appearances and two MCCA Knockout Trophy appearances. He made a final List A appearance for Bedfordshire in the 1985 NatWest Trophy against Gloucestershire. In this match he captained Bedfordshire, scoring a single run before being dismissed by Kevin Curran, with Gloucestershire winning by 141 runs.|$|E

This result {{qualified}} them {{to take part in}} the World Twenty20 Qualifier in the United Arab Emirates in March 2012. He was selected as part of Italy's fourteen man squad for the qualifier. He made his Twenty20 debut during the tournament against Oman, with him making eight further appearances during the tournament, the last of which came against Kenya. In his nine matches, he scored 34 runs at an average of 6.80, with a high score of 10 not <b>out.</b> <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> stumps he took ten catches and made two stumpings. Italy finished the tournament in tenth place and therefore missed out on qualification for the 2012 World Twenty in Sri Lanka. In April 2013, he was selected in Italy's fourteen man squad for the World Cricket League Division Three in Bermuda.|$|E

25|$|On the January 26, {{episode of}} Raw, Goldberg {{came to the}} ring, and demanded a match between himself against Brock Lesnar, {{with whom he had}} {{problems}} over the past two months. The night before, Goldberg was entered in the Royal Rumble match, only to have Lesnar (who, as the reigning WWE Champion, was not entered into the match) interfered and hit an F-5, causing Goldberg to be eliminated by Kurt Angle. The following week on an episode of Raw, {{as a result of the}} rivalry extending between the two programs, sheriff Steve Austin gave Goldberg the option of attending No Way Out by giving him a front-row ticket. At No Way Out, Goldberg was seen arriving at the arena and being escorted to his front seat by security. Then SmackDown General Manager, Paul Heyman gave a promotional in-ring segment on how SmackDown! was the better program over Raw. Lesnar would come down to the ring to promote his match and to insult Goldberg. Goldberg immediately jumped over the barricade into the ring, where Lesnar performed a running shoulder block to Goldberg's stomach; however he recuperated and lifted Lesnar vertically in the air before slamming him down to perform the Jackhammer. Goldberg was then escorted out of the arena by security. During Lesnar's WWE title defense against Eddie Guerrero later that night, Goldberg returned to the arena and interfered by executing a spear, which caused Lesnar to lose the title after Guerrero nailed him with a Frog splash. On the February 22, 2004 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon named the Interpromotional singles match pitting Lesnar versus Goldberg for WrestleMania XX with Steve Austin as the special guest referee. During the match between McMahon and Eric Bischoff, Lesnar appeared on Raw and nailed Steve Austin with an F-5 then stole Austin's four-wheeler. A few days later on SmackDown!, Lesnar stated that he appeared on Raw just to get back at Austin for giving Goldberg the front-row seat ticket and suggesting that Goldberg would attack Lesnar at No Way <b>Out.</b> <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> scenes, it was widely known that the match would be Goldberg's last in WWE. Only a week before WrestleMania, however, rumors surfaced that Lesnar, too, was leaving in order to pursue a career in the National Football League. On the last episode of SmackDown! prior to WrestleMania, Steve Austin appeared to get his fourwheeler back from Lesnar only for the entire roster to get in his way by orders of SmackDown! General manager Paul Heyman. Moments later, the entire roster had decided to move aside and let Austin by to confront Lesnar in the ring. As Austin got to the ring, he and Lesnar traded punches with Austin attempting to nail Lesnar with the Stone Cold stunner only for Lesnar to escape, leaving Austin to finally get back his fourwheeler and closing in on the show with his trademark beer bash.|$|E

At 07:57, the Harwich Force encountered the outer German torpedo boats, which fled back to the German cruisers. In the ensuing Battle of Heligoland Bight, Stettin engaged the British force first, and was quickly reinforced by Frauenlob. At 09:47, Mainz was ordered to steam <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> British to cut off their line of retreat. She got under way by 10:00, and operated in conjunction with a floatplane used for reconnaissance.|$|E

500|$|Co-writer Howard Gordon {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Alex [...] and I made {{an effort}} to play to our own strength, which is character. We thought this was an {{interesting}} place to reiterate Mulder's quest for his sister. We set out to tell a simple abduction story, which was played <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> shadows. We wanted to create an air of tension. With everything that happened, we wanted to explain what it could be. At every point, everything can be explained. Was she taken or killed by her boyfriend, who she was seeing against her mother's wishes? Is it Twin Peaks or an alien abduction? That was the theme of the show." [...] Gordon and Gansa were afraid that series creator Chris Carter would not like the script, but Carter liked the script and approved the episode they wrote.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the first}} time that rules are known to have been {{formally}} agreed, their purpose being to resolve any problems between the patrons during their matches. The concept, however, was to attain greater importance in terms of defining rules of play as, eventually, these were codified as the Laws of Cricket. The Articles are a list of 16 points, many of which are easily recognised despite their wording as belonging to the modern Laws of Cricket, for example: (a) a Ball caught, the Striker is out; (b) when a Ball is caught out, the Stroke counts nothing; (c) catching <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Wicket allowed.|$|E
2500|$|Fielding {{records are}} {{incomplete}} during Yalden's career {{but he is}} credited with 64 catches and one stumping in his first-class record. Stumpings are difficult {{to find in the}} eighteenth century sources because they were often recorded as run outs, though there is one scorecard in which a dismissal is recorded as [...] "put <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> <b>The</b> Yold": i.e., st Yalden. Yalden's single first-class stumping was recorded in a Surrey v Hampshire match at Laleham Burway in October 1778, the victim being Henry Bonham. According to Scores & Biographies, this was the second-ever record of a stumping following one in 1744, though stumpings did occur but [...] "it was not written down as such in the score".|$|E

2500|$|The theatre {{is built}} {{in the style of}} a {{classical}} Roman theatre, but does have some Gallo-Roman modifications. Both the Orchestra and the Cavea (spectator seating) are nearly horseshoe shaped. The actual stage is a simple wooden platform. The scaenae frons or background wall had three doors leading to the relatively small (...) stage building (postscaenium) which is built projecting <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> wall. The scaenae frons was built with a gap in the wall which showed the Cigognier Temple to the audience. The theatre was used for comedies and tragedies, {{but there is also a}} [...] "cult niche" [...] at the foot of the audience's section with the stage forming an altar. This indicates that the theatre may have also been used for [...] "dedicating plays" [...] for religious ceremonies.|$|E
2500|$|A fourth model, the Bond Ranger {{light van}} was {{introduced}} in March 1960. This utilised the body with the cut <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> front seats from the Family Saloon and married it with a similar hardtop roof without side windows, but {{with the addition of}} an opening flap around the rear window. Very much an economy model, in standard form it came finished in primer with topcoat as an optional extra. A total of 39 cars of this type were recorded in factory production records as a Van rather than a Ranger. This is believed to denote that they were only fitted with a single driver's front seat to increase load capacity, much like the 1952 Minitruck. U.K. law at the time also meant that this type of lightweight, single-seat three-wheeler could be driven [...] unaccompanied on learner L-plates without the need to pass a driving test.|$|E

2500|$|Ferme Chappy, lacking {{long-range}} artillery, {{played no}} part in the artillery fire of May 1940 between the larger ouvrages and opposing German forces in Belgium. After the Germans broke <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Maginot Line in June, Ferme Chappy was threatened from the rear. The ouvrage was attacked during the Battle of France on June 21 by the German 161st Infantry Division. [...] The attack was repelled {{with help from the}} nearby gros ouvrage Fermont. Firing continued until the armistice of 25 June, but no further assault was launched by the Germans. Chappy's garrison surrendered to the Germans on 27 June after negotiations with German forces that were undertaken by Commandant Pophillat of Ouvrage Latiremont. Once the area was occupied, Chappy's machine gun turret was removed by the Germans, along with all of the interior fittings. The position saw no fighting in the 1944 Lorraine Campaign and remained abandoned after the war.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the opening}} of the Battle of France in May 1940 Fermont {{exchanged}} gunfire with the Wehrmacht. On 11 May Fermont's 75mm turret opened fire on the German 17th Infantry Division. On the 13th, Fermont provided covering fire for French forces retreating from Longwy, which was between the Maginot Line and the German border and was therefore regarded as indefensible against a determined attack. In late May and early June the German attack was focused farther to the west, eventually breaking <b>out</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Line. From June 15 to June 20, 1940, Fermont helped to repel attacks on the neighboring ouvrage Ferme Chappy, as well as firing to the north. On June 17, German artillery of the 183rd Infantry Division opened fire on the rear of Block 4 with 88mm guns. [...] By chance, the firing stopped after the last shot had weakened the concrete to the point that another shot would have pierced it. [...] The breach was repaired that night. The 161st Infantry Division under General Wilck then attacked Fermont and Latiremont on June 21 with 210mm and 305mm siege mortars, 105mm guns and 88mm high-velocity guns, causing a single death when a round penetrated a mortar cloche at Block 5.|$|E
