500|$|Critical {{response}} to <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End was generally positive. Many critics praised not only Yankovic's parodies, {{but also his}} originals. Barry Weber, of Allmusic, wrote, [...] "In addition to re-establishing his satirical craftsmanship, Deep End showcases some of Yankovic's best originals ever; [...] "Trigger Happy," [...] "When I Was Your Age," [...] and [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore" [...] {{prove to be the}} album's greatest songs." [...] Christopher Thelen, of the Daily Vault, wrote, [...] "In fact, it's strange to admit, but the originals on <b>Off</b> <b>The</b> <b>Deep</b> End actually are, at times, stronger than the parodies." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide, <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End was awarded 3.5 stars out of 5, denoting that the album averaged between good and excellent. Not all reviews were so positive, however. Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne noted that the video for <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End lead single [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] was [...] "an old-fashioned laugh riot", but that half of Yankovic's humor was merely visual, meaning that the songs without videos were not as funny.|$|E

50|$|The {{complete}} Chua K'a Bodywork procedure {{consists of}} a comprehensive massage of the 27 zones of the body, followed by a rolling of the skin (skin rolling), and ending with {{the application of the}} k'a stick. In the technique of skin rolling, developed by Ichazo, the skin and subcutaneous tissues are rolled over <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> structures, lifting <b>the</b> dermis and hypodermis <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>deeper</b> fascia. This technique is recognized to reduce pain, restore mobility, and to stimulate circulation and lymph drainage. The three-part Chua K'a Bodywork method integrates these physical aspects of bodywork with a systematic practice of 'conscious awareness' by directly applying the vital energy flow in the body, originating from the point in the lower belly recognized in Chinese medicine and martial arts as the tan t'ien (known in the Arica method as the Kath).|$|R

500|$|Yankovic's 1992 album <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End, his best-selling album since 1984's [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic in 3-D, had revived {{his career}} and {{displayed}} his [...] "credibility as an evolving artist" [...] after the commercial failures of his 1986 work Polka Party! and his feature film UHF. By the time production for <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End was nearing completion, Yankovic had already written all of the original songs that would be eventually included on Alapalooza. Fearing that his track [...] "I Was Only Kidding" [...] would be outdated {{by the time of}} his next album, he rearranged <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End to allow for the song to be released with the album, saving [...] "Waffle King" [...] for Alapalooza. Nevertheless, [...] "Waffle King" [...] was released as a B-side to <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> Ends [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] single, [...] "just in case there wasn't going to be a next album." [...] He recorded all of the album's original songs, except [...] "Talk Soup" [...] and [...] "Harvey the Wonder Hamster", by the end of 1992 and, in July 1993, recorded all of Alapaloozas remaining tracks, aside from [...] "Livin' In The Fridge". Yankovic eventually decided to title his new album Alapalooza, a reference to the Lollapalooza music festival.

500|$|The {{cover for}} <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End parodies the famous cover of Nirvana's album Nevermind, which depicts an infant {{in the deep}} end of a pool chasing after a dollar bill on a hook and line. The <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End cover shows Yankovic in the baby's place {{apparently}} chasing after a doughnut on a string. While the Nirvana cover has a fully nude baby, Yankovic instead wore a bathing suit {{in a way that}} his body position hid it; he later jokingly noted, [...] "I never really anticipated going full-frontal on any of my album covers." [...] The CD, liner notes, and artwork continue the parody of Nirvana's album, borrowing the same blue, wave-light graphics from the printed surface of Nevermind.|$|E
500|$|<b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews and peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard 200.

This song was Yankovic's second-highest charting single, after [...] "Eat It," [...] which was released in 1984. The cover also parodies the cover of Nirvana's album, Nevermind. The original had a naked baby in {{the water with a}} dollar bill cast by a fishing rod, Yankovic's replaced the baby with himself, and the dollar bill by a doughnut. <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End was Yankovic's fourth Gold record, and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the United States. In addition, the album was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1993.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{original}} songs recorded in the 1990 sessions was [...] "Waffle King."

[...] Originally, [...] "Waffle King" [...] was supposed to appear on <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End. However, {{by the time the}} recording of the parodies for this album began, Al had written all {{the original}} songs that were to appear on his next album, Alapalooza. Because he was concerned that one of the jokes from the song [...] "I Was Only Kidding" [...] might be dated by the time his next album would finally be released—a line that references the movie Wayne's World: [...] "I really love you... not!"—Yankovic included [...] "I Was Only Kidding" [...] on <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> End in place of [...] "Waffle King".
