So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I think we just need to, kind of, build on that..... with a nod to our past as well. It's our fourth record and we don't want to feel like we're doing the same thing again." ...|$|E

There's a song on the record, [...] "Dorothy", that was really influenced by the film Blue Velvet but it's a metaphor for someone and something else. Everything on the record is stuff that definitely hits close to home for us and we tried to communicate that in the songs.|$|E

2500|$|Stevens, {{writing for}} Brennan, Marshall and Blackmun, the same four justices who had dissented in McMahon, joined Kennedy in his {{criticism}} of the Fifth Circuit for overruling Wilko on its own., calling it [...] "indefensible judicial activism". He extended that criticism to the Court itself. [...] "When <b>our</b> <b>earlier</b> opinion gives a statutory provision concrete meaning, which Congress elects not to amend during the ensuing 3½ decades," [...] he wrote, [...] "our duty to respect Congress' work product is strikingly similar to the duty of other federal courts to respect our work product." ...|$|E

We might end up sacrificing our lives and this isn't a cause for concern, so does {{the loss of a}} son still mean anything?

Their sixth album and second release for Epitaph Records, No Devolución, was released on April 12, 2011. Vocalist Geoff Rickly commented on {{the style of the}} new album, stating, [...] "In style, this record feels like a radical departure from <b>our</b> <b>earlier</b> records but in substance it feels like a return. The songs are more vulnerable than they've been in a long time. [...] It's very atmospheric and mood oriented so far." [...] Rickly also stated that the primary lyrical theme is devotion.

And we basically – as you know, because you were invited – tried to put 200 {{of the people who were}} primarily responsible for us being inducted into the Hall of Fame in one room, in one place, for a couple of days. We got most of them over to Cleveland, where the ceremony was held, and it was a great trip down memory lane. In the wake of that, this whole thing – the Big Four tour – came up." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{financial}} crisis that originated in Thailand in 1997 was particularly unnerving {{because of its}} scope and severity.... By the beginning of 1997, {{it was clear to}} Soros Fund Management that the discrepancy between the trade account and the capital account was becoming untenable. We sold short the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit early in 1997 with maturities ranging from six months to a year. (That is, we entered into contracts to deliver at future dates Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit that we did not currently hold.) Subsequently Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia accused me of causing the crisis, a wholly unfounded accusation. We were not sellers of the currency during or several months before the crisis; on the contrary, we were buyers when the currencies began to decline—we were purchasing ringgits to realize the profits on <b>our</b> <b>earlier</b> speculation. (Much too soon, as it turned out. We left most of the potential gain on the table because we were afraid that Mahathir would impose capital controls. He did so, but much later.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Within {{the postwar}} British {{government}} {{there was some}} disquiet {{about the level of}} destruction that had been created by the area-bombing of German cities {{towards the end of the}} war. Harris retired on 15 September 1946 and wrote his story of Bomber Command's achievements in Bomber Offensive. In this book he wrote, concerning Dresden, [...] "I know that the destruction of so large and splendid a city at this late stage of the war was considered unnecessary even by a good many people who admit that <b>our</b> <b>earlier</b> attacks were as fully justified as any other operation of war. Here I will only say that the attack on Dresden was at the time considered a military necessity by much more important people than myself." [...] Bomber Command's crews were denied a separate campaign medal (despite being eligible for the Air Crew Europe Star and France and Germany Star) and, in protest at this establishment snub to his men, Harris refused a peerage in 1946; he was the sole commander-in-chief not to become a peer.|$|E
