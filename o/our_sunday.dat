500|$|In the American Catholic press, the {{migration}} was given front page coverage in diocesan newspapers. The accounts were often sensationalist, demonizing the communist Viet Minh as religious persecutors who committed barbaric atrocities against Catholics. <b>Our</b> <b>Sunday</b> Visitor called the [...] "persecution" [...] in Vietnam [...] "the worst in history", {{alleging that the}} Viet Minh engaged in [...] "child murder and cannibalism". San Francisco's Monitor told of a priest whom the Viet Minh [...] "beat with guns until insensible and then buried alive in a ditch". Newark, Ohio's The Advocate posted an editorial cartoon titled [...] "Let Our People Go!", depicting mobs of Vietnamese refugees attempting to break through a blood-laced fence of barbed wire. Milwaukee's Catholic Herald Citizen described two priests who had been chained together and [...] "suffered atrocious and endless agony". Other papers depicted the Viet Minh blowing up churches, torturing children and gunning down elderly Catholics. One paper proclaimed that [...] "the people of Vietnam became a crucified people and their homeland a national Golgotha". The Catholic media also ran stories about Buddhist refugees who converted, hailing it as proof of their religion's superiority.|$|E
