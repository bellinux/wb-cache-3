25|$|When a {{young worker}} leaves the nest {{for the first}} time, it will {{generally}} make 2 to 3 'orientation flights' in order to familiarize itself with {{the entrance to the}} colony amidst the surrounding landscape. In the first flight, the worker flies approximately 25nbsp&cm out of the nest at once and then quickly turns around to face the entrance. The wasp slowly flies {{back and forth to the}} nest several times, surveying an angle that is approximately 90 degrees, while facing the entrance. Then, the wasp promptly returns to the nest, the whole flight lasting only about one minute or less. Soon after returning from the first flight, the wasp will leave the nest in a similar fashion, but this time ventures out approximately 15 to 20 meters and covers an angle of approximately 280 degrees. Once 2 meters away, V. rufa will fly back and forth repeatedly in a figure-eight pattern, while facing the entrance to the nest. In some cases, after this second flight the wasp will have gathered all of the knowledge necessary to fly off. Other wasps must make a third <b>orientation</b> <b>flight</b> that is like the second one. At first, the worker may miss the entrance to the nest many times; however, after six to twelve trips, the wasp gains its bearings; flights become longer, and reentry into the colony becomes more precise.|$|E

2500|$|... 19 October 1959 â€“ A Braniff Boeing 707 {{crashed in}} Arlington, Washington. Although the {{aircraft}} was not officially a Braniff aircraft, {{it was due}} for delivery {{the very next day}} and was already wearing the Braniff logo and colors. The aircraft, a Boeing 707-227, registration number N7071, was on an <b>orientation</b> <b>flight</b> with two Boeing test pilots, and two Braniff Captains on board. The Braniff pilot performed a series of Dutch rolls; however, one of the rolls was executed beyond the maximum bank angle restrictions, resulting in a loss of control. The aircraft recovered from the maneuver, but, during the recovery, three of the engines (number 1, 2 and 4) were torn off. The aircraft crashed along the Stillaguamish River northeast of Arlington. The two pilots in the cockpit did not survive the emergency landing, the other two pilots who were sitting in the tail section did. A bare patch in the trees along the north bank of the river still exists today.|$|E

This means the queen does all of the foraging for about 30 days before workers take over. At the beginning she mainly focuses on collecting fiber for envelope construction, but as the colony begins to develop she allots more time for foraging for food including both flesh and liquid. Workers begin helping with larval feeding and nest development when just a few days old and take their <b>orientation</b> <b>flight</b> at about 5 days old. At this point they begin to take over food and material collection for the nest. These foraging trips can last between a few minutes to one hour, but most are less than 10 minutes in length. As D. media searches for prey it stops for a moment over each flower in contrast to other species such as V. flaviceps which quickly fly up and down each plant. They will fly up to a couple hundred meters to forage for food.|$|E

50|$|Pilots {{received}} about 80-90 {{hours of flight}} training, {{the number of hours}} was based on the needs overseas by the combat units. Some pilots received perhaps 60 hours.

The major part of their flight instruction included aerobatics, gunnery practice at Buckingham Field, and formation flying.|$|R
5000|$|Contributing {{factors in}} the crash were other pilot errors, a design that led to an overly optimistic {{pre-flight}} fuel-check estimate, a known defective (very hard to turn) fuel valve, and non-standard placement of the fuel selector valve by the kit plane's builder, at variance with Burt Rutan's specifications. Denver {{was aware of the}} relocated valve prior to take off and had previously flown the aircraft only for approximately thirty minutes in an <b>orientation</b> <b>flight</b> the day before the accident, although he was an experienced pilot. The NTSB cited Denver's unfamiliarity with the aircraft and his failure to have the aircraft refueled as causal {{factors in the}} accident. [...] The aerodynamics of this unusual aircraft did not play a role in Denver's crash.|$|E
50|$|After {{inspecting}} several sites, the U.S. War Department {{agreed to}} the lease June 14, 1917. Congress appropriated $10 million for its construction, and 2,000 laborers and carpenters were immediately put to work. The layout of Scott Field was typical of aviation fields built during World War I. Construction began in June 1917. The government gave the Unit Construction Company 60 days to erect approximately 60 buildings, lay a mile-long railroad spur, and to level off an airfield with a 1,600 foot landing circle. Construction was underway when the government announced, on July 20, 1917, that it would name the new field after Corporal Frank S. Scott, the first enlisted service member killed in an aviation crash. Scott had died after an unexpected engine failure had brought down the aircraft that Lieutenant Lewis Rockwell had been giving him an <b>orientation</b> <b>flight</b> in at College Park, Maryland, on September 28, 1912.|$|E
5000|$|The queen {{emerges from}} her cell after 15 days of {{development}} and she remains in the hive for 3-7 days before venturing out on a mating flight. Mating flight is otherwise known as [...] "nuptial flight". Her first <b>orientation</b> <b>flight</b> may only last a few seconds, just enough to mark {{the position of the}} hive. Subsequent mating flights may last from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, and she may mate with a number of male drones on each flight. Over several matings, possibly a dozen or more, the queen receives and stores enough sperm from a succession of drones to fertilize hundreds of thousands of eggs. If she does not manage to leave the hive to mateâ€”possibly due to bad weather or being trapped in part of the hiveâ€”she remains infertile and becomes a drone layer, incapable of producing female worker bees. Worker bees sometimes kill a non-performing queen and produce another. Without a properly performing queen, the hive is doomed.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the initial}} interviews, <b>orientation</b> <b>flights,</b> and {{selection}} for the [...] program, the new pilot undergoes approximately {{six months of}} extensive training, including [...] twenty sorties in the U-2.

50|$|X. pubescens {{use both}} visual and {{olfactory}} cues {{to recognize their}} own nests. Nest recognition is vital for foraging females to provision for their brood properly. X. pubescens use its vision to recognize the general location of its nest. Upon exit of the nest {{to embark on a}} foraging trip, a female will make an <b>orientation</b> <b>flight</b> for visual familiarity. In instances of nest disturbance, the frequency of these orientation flights increases. Because X. pubescens nests are often found in aggregation, it is important for females to recognize their own specific nests. This is accomplished by olfaction. X. pubescens females whose nests have been disturbed or misplaced among other nests will return to the general location of their nest but will not mistakenly enter another nest due to lack of scent recognition. The Dufour's gland, rectal fluid, or some oral source of odor may contribute to the recognizable nest entrance odor. It is likely that multiple glands are active in marking the nest entrance due to the high specificity required for the scent.|$|E
