5|$|Any <b>obvious</b> {{physical}} malformation.|$|E
5|$|The oystercatchers are large, <b>obvious,</b> noisy plover-like {{birds with}} strong bills used for smashing or prying open molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Admitting {{that plants}} {{generally}} have less <b>obvious</b> evidence of 'a designed and studied mechanism' than animals, still Paley adds some examples, {{as of the}} parts of the seed, the delicate germ being protected by a tough or spiny husk, and dispersed by wings or other appendages.|$|E
5|$|An {{order is}} a legal {{instrument}} that has an executive flavour and expresses an <b>obvious</b> command. Often, its effect {{is limited to a}} particular moment in time, rather than continuing.|$|E
5|$|As a {{composition}} with no <b>obvious</b> technical difficulty, {{it has been}} performed by church choirs and by professionals, often to celebrate church dedications.|$|E
5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an <b>obvious</b> system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, it was <b>obvious</b> to Augustus that Marcellus {{was not ready to}} take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure notwithstanding, they should continue to obey Agrippa.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{these two}} rows, the higher {{homotopy}} groups (i > n) {{appear to be}} chaotic, but in fact there are many patterns, some <b>obvious</b> and some very subtle.|$|E
5|$|During the post-launch news conference, NASA {{managers}} {{said the}} initial early {{review of the}} launch video showed no <b>obvious</b> debris events, but a thorough analysis would be performed to ensure the orbiter sustained no significant damage during ascent.|$|E
5|$|English jurist Jeremy Bentham was {{a critic}} of Blackstone's {{theories}}. Others saw Blackstone's theories as inaccurate statements of English law, using the Constitutions of Clarendon, the Tractatus of Glanville and the 1689 Bill of Rights as particularly <b>obvious</b> examples of laws Blackstone omitted.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} highway does {{not enter the}} City of Toronto proper, Toronto {{is used as a}} control city in Halton and Durham Regions due to the similar sizes of the {{suburban}} municipalities the highway passes through making selection of an <b>obvious</b> example among them difficult.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>obvious</b> dangers such as rodenticides, insecticides, and herbicides, cats may be poisoned by many chemicals usually considered safe by their human guardians, because their livers are less effective at {{some forms of}} detoxification than those of many other animals, including humans and dogs. Some {{of the most common}} causes of poisoning in cats are antifreeze and rodent baits. Cats may be particularly sensitive to environmental pollutants. When a cat has a sudden or prolonged serious illness without any <b>obvious</b> cause, it has possibly been exposed to a toxin.|$|E
5|$|In these {{examples}} the automorphisms {{are easy to}} identify, but in general automorphism is not always <b>obvious.</b> The table at right shows {{the number of the}} essentially different Sudoku solution grids for all existing automorphisms.|$|E
5|$|Long-standing rivalries {{result in}} {{numerous}} rematches, especially {{if one of}} the enforcers has to decline an invitation to fight during a given game. This {{is one of the reasons}} that enforcers may fight at the beginning of a game, when nothing <b>obvious</b> has happened to agitate the opponents. On the other hand, it is bad etiquette to try to initiate a fight with an enforcer who is near the end of his shift, since the more rested player will have an <b>obvious</b> advantage.|$|E
5|$|Robert Nathan's Portrait of Jennie, as novel, or film, {{is another}} <b>obvious</b> comparison, {{although}} Jennie, as a ghost, travels time in one direction, not randomly.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} young <b>obvious</b> lava flows {{exist in the}} area around Adams. Most of these flows are {{on the north side of}} the mountain and include the flow in the Mutton Creek area, Devils Garden, the Takh Takh Meadows Flow, and the much larger Muddy Fork Lava Flow to the north of Devils Garden. Only one <b>obvious</b> flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.|$|E
5|$|Terry Pratchett's 1988 Discworld novel Wyrd Sisters bears <b>obvious</b> {{reference}} to Shakespeare's three witches, {{as well as}} to a number of other plays by Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|The band's early {{sound was}} rooted in post-punk and pop but {{eventually}} grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music. In 2010, they began experimenting with acoustic music, (<b>obvious</b> in 2014 release Unbroken, Untied) a theme that would expand and develop their sound and audience.|$|E
5|$|The most <b>obvious</b> technology, the centrifuge, failed, but {{electromagnetic}} separation, gaseous diffusion, {{and thermal}} diffusion technologies were all successful {{and contributed to}} the project. In February 1943, Groves {{came up with the idea}} of using the output of some plants as the input for others.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} and <b>obvious</b> {{difference is the}} constant flicker of the ghosts, which is frequently cited as the game's primary flaw.|$|E
5|$|The nelicourvi weaver can be {{distinguished}} from the related sakalava weaver, which has streaked plumage. The somewhat related forest fody and Madagascar fody mostly have streaked upperparts and scarlet as the most <b>obvious</b> colour.|$|E
5|$|The <b>obvious</b> {{cause of}} the {{question}} is the diamonds in the satellite, which {{can be seen by}} Bond and Tiffany as a speck in the night sky.|$|E
5|$|The oystercatchers are large, <b>obvious</b> {{and noisy}} plover-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prising open molluscs.|$|E
5|$|The oystercatchers are large, <b>obvious</b> {{and noisy}} plover-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prying open molluscs. One species has been {{recorded}} in North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The oystercatchers are large, <b>obvious</b> {{and noisy}} wading birds with strong bills used for smashing or prising open molluscs. There are about 11 species {{worldwide}} with one recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|The oystercatchers are large, <b>obvious,</b> {{and noisy}} plover-like birds, with strong bills used for smashing or prying open molluscs. One species has been {{recorded}} in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The song is the namesake for the 2014 film <b>Obvious</b> Child; {{it appears}} in {{a scene in which}} two {{characters}} drunkenly dance together. Director Gillian Robespierre titled the film with hope that its meaning would be ambiguous.|$|E
5|$|The use of Groundskeeper Willie (Scottish character) and {{the flag}} of the English army (Union Flag of Great Britain) are <b>obvious</b> inaccuracies, as England and Scotland were {{separate}} states and many Scottish fought with France during the Hundred Years' War.|$|E
5|$|Variations are {{markedly}} different with each subspecies. The eastern subspecies has more distinct spots on its chest, more white along the tips and retraces and <b>obvious</b> wing bars. T.c. palmeri has less spotting on chest and tips and less <b>obvious</b> wing bars. Other examples include T.c. curvirostre possessing longer wings and a tail than T.c. oberholseri; T.c. insularum is paler with more grey than T.c. palmeri {{and has more}} visible spotting on its breast.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{describes}} the Dyak people, expressing surprise that despite Thomas Malthus's predictions {{for the human}} population of the world, {{and the lack of}} any <b>obvious</b> restraints, the Dyak population appeared to be stable.|$|E
5|$|Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, {{and their}} chicks and eggs {{may be taken}} by herons, crows or gulls. Less <b>obvious</b> nest predators include ruddy turnstones in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of their catch by avian kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds, skuas, other terns or large gulls.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} pathology was {{noticed by}} Parks, and {{from around the}} notch. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae, directly anterior to the notch, the neural spines were damaged. The fourth had an <b>obvious</b> fracture, {{with the other two}} possessing a swelling {{at the base of the}} break.|$|E
5|$|Cinema audiences {{could wear}} {{disposable}} polarized glasses {{to view the}} film, creating the illusion that elements from the film were penetrating the screen to come towards the viewers. The opening sequence makes <b>obvious</b> use of the technique, with the titles flying {{to the forefront of}} the screen, leaving a trail. There are more subtle instances in the film where props are meant to leave the screen. The more <b>obvious</b> examples are in the climactic sequence of the shark attacking the control room and its subsequent destruction. The glass as the shark smashes into the room uses 3D, as does the shot where the shark explodes, with fragmented parts of it apparently bursting through the screen, ending with its jaws. There were many difficulties in making the green screen compositing work in 3D, and a lot of material had to be reshot.|$|E
5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} been <b>obvious</b> to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been <b>obvious</b> on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} <b>obvious</b> {{deficiency}} of the Roman army remained its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. As Rome's borders expanded and its adversaries changed from largely infantry-based to largely cavalry-based troops, the infantry-based Roman army began to find itself at a tactical disadvantage, {{particularly in the}} East.|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks {{can easily}} be {{identified}} by their stocky body, <b>obvious</b> hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.|$|E
5|$|It {{is true that}} repeals by {{implication}} are not favored, but we cannot escape the conclusion that, tested by its scope, its <b>obvious</b> purpose, and its terms, the act of March 3, 1891, covers the whole subject-matter under consideration, and furnishes the exclusive rule in respect of appellate jurisdiction on appeal, writ of error or certificate.|$|E
