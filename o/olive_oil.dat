Quantification of glycerol in wines and <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> and moisture in <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> was accomplished by integration of the appropriate signals in the 31 P NMR spectra and the use of phosphitylated internal standards. The method was reproducible and accurate. A comparison study was conducted and the agreement between 31 P NMR and HPLC methods for the glycerol determination, and between NMR and Karl Fisher titration was evaluated by using the Bland & Altman statistical analysis. Also, 31 P NMR spectroscopy with no derivatization was employed for the quantification of phospholipids extracted from <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> This method was faster, simpler and more accurate than conventional analytical techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|Pigments are {{responsible}} for the color of <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> and are an important ingredient that {{is directly related to the}} quality of this food. However, the concentration of pigments can vary significantly depending on the climate conditions, harvesting time, and olive cultivars. In this work, we quantified the main pigments in several extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> produced from a blend of three cultivars (Moraiolo, Frantoio, and Leccino) typical of Tuscany (Italy) harvested in three different years: 2012, 2013, and 2014. Pigments—namely, β-carotene, lutein, pheophytin A, and pheophytin B—were quantified by a method based on the mathematical analysis of the near ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the oils. Data were analyzed by a multivariate statistical approach. The results show that the pigments’ content of extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> produced in 2014 can be well distinguished with respect to previous years. This can be explained by the anomalous climate conditions, which strongly affected Italy and, in particular, Tuscany, where the olives were harvested. This study represents an interesting example of how pigment content can be significant in characterizing <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> Moreover, this is the first report of pigment quantification in extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> produced in Tuscany...|$|R
