5|$|Maitland showed Napoleon {{the great}} cabin, {{which he had}} placed at his disposal, {{and gave him a}} tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m. the Superb {{anchored}} in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard the Bellerophon. He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon's retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on the Superb, and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS Myrmidon. A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed their hats and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, <b>only</b> <b>talking</b> with him if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as Bellerophon came in sight of Ushant, the last piece of French land visible {{for the remainder of the}} journey. He climbed up to the poop deck, attended by a midshipman, and spent the morning watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did not speak to any of them.|$|E
25|$|She {{mentions}} Extinction of {{her people}} like a species wiped out. Then she gets more explicitly into the denouncing of colonialism and (specifically) Manifest Destiny. She directly ties the colonizers to today’s white America by calling them the skullmongers who are excavating the skulls of the dead Indians. Her poetry sarcastically talks about how the colonials thought they had {{earned the right to}} the land because they traveled over the sea. The Indians believed that the Americans should have come over bearing gifts, but instead came <b>only</b> <b>talking</b> of land and money.|$|E
500|$|The AFL's {{experiment}} was largely derided by AFL personalities throughout Hunt's early Australian rules career. [...] Wayne Carey is quoted {{to have said}} that [...] "I just think he's really going to struggle. I'm just not sure a rugby player - {{as good as he}} is - can do it." [...] Tony Shaw was quoted in 2011 to have said [...] "he just cannot play the game naturally and it won't work. Just say to him, 'Take your money, you've been fantastic for us', maybe see the year out, but I wouldn't be playing him very often any more." [...] Paul Roos is quoted to have said that [...] "a player of Karmichael Hunt's current ability would probably be worth only $100,000 in the AFL". [...] Jason Akermanis is quoted to have said in reference to both Hunt and Israel Folau – who converted from rugby league to Australian rules football the year after Hunt – that [...] "if they can't run and they can't handball - and we're <b>only</b> <b>talking</b> basics like kick, run, chase, handball and get body-to-body collisions - and can't get up to speed its going to be such {{a waste of time and}} money." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "If we are <b>only</b> <b>talking</b> {{about an}} illegitimate {{access to a}} {{computer}} system, is that it. Now there could also be extortion, threats, computer damage ... {{and that we can}} make a sum of the penalties that the Code allows and eventually could reach a sentence of effective enforcement".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{corruption}} {{case involving}} Sócrates was the Face Oculta scandal. On 28 October 2009 the police began investigating a business group headquartered in Ovar.

Sócrates denied any involvement, claiming that he was <b>only</b> <b>talking</b> to a friend.|$|E
2500|$|In Thomas Pynchon's book V., the {{character}} Profane watches an unspecified Randolph Scott film and compares himself unfavorably with his hero, whom {{he describes as}} [...] "cool, imperturbable, keeping his trap shut and <b>only</b> <b>talking</b> {{when he had to}} – and then saying the right things and not running off haphazard and inefficient at the mouth".|$|E

2500|$|The rare {{depictions of}} {{chimpanzees}} as individuals rather than stock characters, and as central rather than incidental to the plot are generally found in works of science fiction. Robert A. Heinlein's short story [...] "Jerry Was a Man" [...] (1947) {{centers on a}} genetically enhanced chimpanzee suing for better treatment. The 1972 film Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, the third sequel of Planet of the Apes, portrays a futuristic revolt of enslaved apes led by the <b>only</b> <b>talking</b> chimpanzee, Caesar, against their human masters.|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2004, Leahy and Vice President Dick Cheney {{participated in}} the U.S. Senate class photo. After the vote, Cheney was <b>only</b> <b>talking</b> to Republicans. When Leahy {{asked him to come}} over and talk to the Democrats, Cheney upbraided Leahy for the Senator's recent excoriations of Halliburton's {{activities}} in Iraq. At the end of the exchange, Cheney told Leahy, [...] "Go fuck yourself". Leahy joked about the incident in 2007 when he escorted Bernie Sanders, Vermont's newly elected senator, to the well of the Senate where he was sworn in by Cheney: [...] "When it comes to the vice president, it's always better to be sworn in than to be sworn at." ...|$|E
2500|$|Curtis Hanson {{had read}} {{half a dozen}} of James Ellroy's books before L.A. Confidential and was drawn to its characters, not the plot. He said, [...] "What hooked me on them was that, as I met them, one after the other, I didn't like them - but as I {{continued}} reading, I started to care about them." [...] Ellroy's novel also made Hanson think about Los Angeles and provided him with an opportunity to [...] "set a movie at a point in time when the whole dream of Los Angeles, from that apparently golden era of the '20s and '30s, was being bulldozed." [...] Screenwriter Brian Helgeland was originally signed to Warner Bros. to write a Viking film with director Uli Edel and then worked on an unproduced modern-day King Arthur story. Helgeland was a long-time fan of Ellroy's novels. When he heard that Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to L.A. Confidential in 1990, he lobbied to script the film. However, at the time, the studio was <b>only</b> <b>talking</b> to well-known screenwriters. When he finally did get a meeting, it was canceled two days before it was to occur.|$|E
