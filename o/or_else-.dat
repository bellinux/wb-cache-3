40|$|The law {{profession}} {{is unique in}} {{the scope of the}} mandate it gives those within it to intervene in other people 2 Ì† 7 s affairs. As a result of this unique power of intervention, lawyers encounter a number of unique problems. This paper elucidates upon, and applies, the moral standards and intuitions to be used in approaching these problems. It argues that we should form our consciences in dialogue with our clients and that once they are formed we must follow them and limit our representation accordingly. If lawyer and client cannot agree on an agenda with which both are comfortable, the lawyer should withdraw. In any event, no client has the right to the assistance of a lawyer- <b>or</b> anyone <b>else-</b> in perpetrating an injustice...|$|R

There are two ways to achieve this, one negative, the other positive. The negative way is through the development of neurotic obsessions that compel us to such focus. The positive way is the kind of training that comes from the consistent practice of meditation. Of all the things that you can do to come to know yourself, nothing will serve you as well as developing the practice of meditation. Meditation is not Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, Muslim, or Satanic. It can be done in the name of any of these faiths, but it is owned exclusively by none of them. It does not even require religious affiliation. It is a single term defining many practices, some of which have no spiritual component whatever. The things these paths-whether Christian, Muslim, <b>or</b> something <b>else-</b> all have in common is they are designed to give practitioners a measure of focused control, which affects psycho-physiological processes, such as blood pressure, serotonin levels, and brain function. This is the same control that produces the placebo effect. It is a way of training oneself to open to nonlocal awareness, and this is why meditation is important to nonlocal awareness...|$|R
