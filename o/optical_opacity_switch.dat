40|$|The {{interaction}} of a radiation {{field with a}} dusty medium is a relevant issue in several astrophysical contexts. We use the time-dependent photoionization code in a dusty medium developed by Perna & Lazzati (2002), to study the modifications in the dust distribution and the relative <b>optical</b> <b>opacities</b> when a strong X-ray UV radiation flux propagates into a medium. We find that silicates are preferentially destroyed with respect to graphite, and the extinction curve becomes significantly flatter (hence implying less reddening), with the characteristic bump at lambda 2175 A highly suppressed, due {{to the destruction of}} the small graphite grains. This could explain the observational lack of such a feature in GRB afterglow and AGN spectra. For a very intense and highly variable source irradiating a compact and dense region, time variability in the <b>optical</b> <b>opacity</b> resulting from dust destruction can be observed on a relatively short timescale. We show that, under these circumstances, monitoring the time variability of the opacity can yield powerful clues on the properties of dust in the environment of the source.

Firstly, we extend the mathematical {{formulation of the}} time-dependent evolution of dust grains under an intense radiation flux with {{the inclusion of the}} process of ion field emission (IFE). We determine the relative importance of IFE with respect to X-ray and UV sublimation as a function of grain size, intensity and hardness of the incident spectrum. We then combine the processes of dust destruction with a photoionization code that follows the evolution of the ionization states of the metals and the relative radiative transitions. Our code treats, self-consistently, the gradual recycling of metals into gas as dust is sublimated away; it allows for any initial dust grain distribution and follows its evolution in space and time.

By analysis of the orbital photometry from publicly available Kepler data (0. 4 - 0. 9 microns), we determine a day-night contrast amplitude of (6. 5 +/- 1. 9 ppm), constituting the lowest amplitude orbital phase variation discovered. The signal is detected to 3. 7 sigma confidence and persists in six different methods of modelling the data and thus appears robust. In contrast, {{we are unable to}} detect ellipsoidal variations or beaming effects, but we do provide confidence intervals for these terms. If the day-night contrast is interpreted as being due to scattering, it corresponds to a geometric albedo of Ag = 0. 0253 +/- 0. 0072.

40|$|We develop {{atmosphere}} {{models of}} two of the three Kepler-field planets that were known {{prior to the start of}} the Kepler mission (HAT-P- 7 b and TrES- 2). We find that published Kepler and Spitzer data for HAT-P- 7 b appear to require an extremely hot upper atmosphere on the dayside, with a strong thermal inversion and little day-night redistribution. The Spitzer data for TrES- 2 suggest a mild thermal inversion with moderate day-night redistribution. We examine the effect of nonequilibrium chemistry on TrES- 2 model atmospheres and find that methane levels must be adjusted by extreme amounts in order to cause even mild changes in atmospheric structure and emergent spectra. Our best-fit models to the Spitzer data for TrES- 2 lead us to predict a low secondary eclipse planet-star flux ratio (~ 2 x 10 ^- 5) in the Kepler bandpass, which is consistent with what very recent observations have found. Finally, we consider how the Kepler-band optical flux from a hot exoplanet depends on the strength of a possible extra optical absorber in the upper atmosphere.

Planets in this mass-range are different from their more massive cousins in several ways {{that are relevant to}} their radiative properties and thermal structures. By analogy with Neptune and Uranus, they are likely to have metal abundances that are an order of magnitude or more greater than those of larger, more massive planets. This increases their opacity, decreases Rayleigh scattering, and changes their equation of state. Furthermore, their smaller radii mean that fluxes from these planets are roughly an order of magnitude lower than those of otherwise identical gas giant planets. Here, we compute a range of plausible radiative equilibrium models of GJ 436 b and HAT-P- 11 b.

This is not constant, {{but it can be}} calibrated using an observed relation between the brightness and the properties of the optical light curve (decline rate, width, shape), which indicates that brighter SNe have broader, slower light curves. However, the physical basis for this relation is not yet fully understood. Among possible causes are different masses of the progenitor white dwarfs or different opacities in Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We parametrise the Chandrasekhar-mass models presented by Iwamoto et al (1999), which synthesize different amounts of Ni, and compute bolometric light curves and spectra at various epochs. Since opacity in SNe Ia is due mostly to spectral lines, it should depend on the mass of Fe-peak elements synthesized in the explosion, and on the temperature in the ejecta. Bolometric light curves computed using these prescriptions for the <b>optical</b> <b>opacity</b> reproduce the relation between brightness and decline rate. Furthermore, when spectra are calculated, the change in colour between maximum and two weeks later allows the observed relation between M_B(Max) and Dm_{ 15 }(B) to be reproduced quite nicely.

40|$|The <b>optical</b> <b>opacity</b> of {{biological}} tissue {{has long been}} a challenge in biomedical optics due to the strong scattering nature of tissue in the optical regime. While most conventional optical techniques attempt to gate out multiply scattered light and use only unscattered light, new approaches in the field of wavefront shaping exploit the time reversible symmetry of optical scattering in order to focus light inside or through scattering media. While these approaches have been demonstrated effectively on static samples, it has proven difficult to apply them to dynamic biological samples since even small changes in the relative positions of the scatterers within will cause the time symmetry that wavefront shaping relies upon to decorrelate. In this paper we investigate the decorrelation curves of acute rat brain slices for thicknesses in the range 1 - 3 mm (1 /e decorrelation time on the order of seconds) using multi-speckle diffusing wave spectroscopy (MSDWS) and compare the results with theoretical predictions. The results of this study demonstrate that the 1 /L^ 2 relationship between decorrelation time and thickness predicted by diffusing wave spectroscopy provides a good rule of thumb for estimating how the decorrelation of a sample will change with increasing thickness. Understanding this relationship will provide insight to guide the future development of biophotonic wavefront shaping tools by giving an estimate of how fast wavefront shaping systems need to operate to overcome the dynamic nature {{of biological}} samples...|$|R

Generally, the problem is mathematically under-determined unless a set of closures (Eddington coefficients) is specified. We demonstrate that the hemispheric (or hemi-isotropic) closure naturally derives from the radiative transfer equation if energy conservation is obeyed, while the Eddington closure produces spurious enhancements of both reflected light and thermal emission.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study of the circumstellar gas and dust emission and their relation to the mass-loss in evolved stars. Considering the physical process of heating and cooling of the dust, a model to calculate the circumstellar dust emission is developed. The dust distribution is expressed in terms of the physical parameters of the envelope and the optical properties are assumed to be of a power-law type. Calculations for dust envelopes extending over a broad range of <b>optical</b> <b>opacities</b> are presented. There is special emphasis on calculations for IRAS fluxes at 12, 25, and 60 μm and the near infrared flux at 2. 2 μm. Their dependence on the parameters of the model, namely, the effective temperature and luminosity of the central star, the power-law index, and the dust absorption coefficient of the grains is presented. The results are combined in color-color diagrams and it is found that they have little dependence on the luminosity and effective temperature of the central star, thus making them solely dependent on the dust properties. The calculated colors and spectra for envelopes of carbon-rich and oxygen-rich stars agree with those observed in these types of stars. Using an available model for the circumstellar gas emission, an analysis of reported CO J = 1 - 0 and 2 - 1 observations of nearby carbon-rich stars is done. The observational data supports the validity of the gas emission model. The gas model is related to the dust model through the physical parameters they have in common.

We {{examine the effects of}} temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity for the generic planets as a guide to understanding transmission spectra in general. We find that carbon dioxide absorption at 4. 4 and 15 microns is prominent at high metallicity, and is a clear metallicity indicator. For HD 209458 b and HD 189733 b, we compute spectra for both one-dimensional and three-dimensional model atmospheres and examine the differences between them. The differences are usually small, but can be large if atmospheric temperatures are near important chemical abundance boundaries. The calculations for the 3 D atmospheres, and their comparison with data, serve as constraints on these dynamical models that complement the secondary eclipse and light curve data sets. For HD 209458 b, even if TiO and VO gases are abundant on the day side, their abundances can be considerably reduced on the cooler planetary limb. However, given the predicted limb temperatures and TiO abundances, the model's <b>optical</b> <b>opacity</b> is too high. For HD 189733 b we find a good match with some infrared data sets and constrain the altitude of a postulated haze layer. For this planet, substantial differences can exist between the transmission spectra of the leading and trailing hemispheres, which is an excellent probe of carbon chemistry. In thermochemical equilibrium, the cooler leading hemisphere is methane-dominated, and the hotter trailing hemisphere is CO-dominated, but these differences may be eliminated by non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing. It may be possible to constrain the carbon chemistry of this planet, and its spatial variation, with JWST. Comment: Revised for ApJ. Submitted 9 / 16 / 2009. 20 pages, including figure...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} IRAS maps at 60 and 100 -mu-m of {{the complex}} of dark clouds containing L 134, L 183 and L 1780. Regions were found that are bright at 100 -mu-m but not detected at 60 -mu-m. These regions exhibit high <b>optical</b> <b>opacities</b> and {{are associated with the}} dark clouds. The 60 -mu-m surface brightness is observed to decline in a narrow transition layer surrounding the cloud centers. In the outer environs the ratio I 60 /I 100 has a nearly constant value of 0. 2. The absence of 60 -mu-m emission yields an upper limit of 15 K for the temperature of the dust, assuming lambda- 1 dust emissivity. We have mapped the 60 -mu-m deficient regions using the quantity DELTA-I 100 = I 100 - I 60 /Kelvin, where Kelvin is the ratio I 60 /I 100 in the outer diffuse regions. We have found a linear correlation between DELTA-I 100 and both (CO) -C- 13 column density and blue extinction. The analysis suggests that the diffuse component of the cloud has been subtracted when constructing DELTA-I 100, and that DELTA-I 100 is tightly correlated with molecular material with densities in excess of n(H- 2) = 10 (3). We have derived an upper limit for the mass absorption coefficient of dust at 100 -mu-m of 4. 8 g cm- 2. This limit is consistent with earlier determinations. The sudden drop in the 60 -mu-m emission can only be explained when assuming a separate grain component at 60 -mu-m that undergoes a change in properties in a narrow transition region. We infer that condensation of a thin mantle on the grains in the transition layer can explain the observed infrared properties...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{is devoted}} to the {{application}} of the Tomographic PIV technique to study coherent structures in a swirling turbulent jet. The aim of the paper is to study the possibilities of caring out tomographic PIV measurements with the large depth of a volume configuration in the swirling jet setup. It is recognized that an extension of the Tomo PIV technique to a large depth of view along light deficiency gives a set of problems linked with the <b>optical</b> <b>opacity</b> limit, the uncertainty of reconstruction by few projections and the increasing of the ghost particles number. Thus, the paper reports results of comparative study of the mean flow characteristics by Tomo PIV and Stereo PIV. The measurements were carried out by Tomo PIV and Stereo PIV techniques for the same object and under the same experimental conditions. From the analysis of the obtained results, the volumetric to planar comparison showed acceptable correspondence through all common measurement points for mean velocity and satisfactory correspondence of the velocity fluctuations intensity. The comparison of coherent structures detected by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis of 3 D velocity distributions with large-scale vortices in a set of the instantaneous velocity fields with the decent spatial resolution (1. 5 mm) was performed. The instantaneous data revealed the presence of the double vortex helix at the inner shear layer and appearance of an additional secondary helical vortex in the outer mixing layer. The phase-averaged vortex structure from POD data resolves only one vortex helix in the outer shear layer and a thick screw or drill like structure at the axis of the jet without resolving distinct double helix of vortex filaments, detected in the instant 3 D velocity distributions...|$|R
