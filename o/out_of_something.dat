He often carried a hip flask in case he ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> to drink. Vainio's deteriorating family relationships {{are considered to be}} one reason for his drinking. Many of his friends were heavy drinkers as well but despite his drinking problem, he always managed to finish his lyrics on time.|$|E

2500|$|Behavior serves {{two major}} {{functions}} for an individual: (1) to obtain desired events, or (2) to escape/avoid undesired events. Put another way, individuals engage in behavior {{to get something}} or to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>something.</b> [...] When trying to identify the function of a behavior, it is often helpful to think, [...] "What purpose is this behavior serving the individual?"

2500|$|Among Schoenberg's {{teaching}} {{was the idea}} that the unity of a musical composition depends upon all its aspects being derived from a single basic idea; this idea was later known as developing variation. Berg passed this on to his students, one of whom, Theodor W. Adorno, stated: [...] "The main principle he conveyed was that of variation: everything was supposed to develop <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> else and yet be intrinsically different". The Piano Sonata is an example—the whole composition is derived from the work's opening quartal gesture and its opening phrase.|$|E

[...] In 2017, talking to Autosport podcast, David Richards {{confirmed}} that he and McRae had talked about McRae's comeback to Subaru for season 2008. Robert Reid was contacted by McRae who asked him to be his co-driver and the pair was due to test together, but unfortunately the test never happened because of McRae's fatal helicopter accident.|$|E

50|$|Partitive plural is a {{grammatical}} number {{that is used}} to modify a noun which represents a part of some whole amount, as opposed to the comprehensive plural, used when the noun represents the total amount <b>of</b> <b>something.</b> This plural form is used in the Finnish language, and its use in this language influenced J.R.R. Tolkien in inventing his fictional language Quenya. It refers to more than one object that is nevertheless only part of a larger number; for example, three <b>out</b> <b>of</b> four <b>of</b> <b>something.</b> It is one of four {{grammatical number}}s in Quenya, the others being singular, dual, and plural.|$|R

60|$|Well, {{there was}} a big outlandish parrot {{on each side of the}} clock, made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> like chalk, and painted up gaudy. By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery, and a crockery dog by the other; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open their mouths nor look {{different}} nor interested. They squeaked through underneath. There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things. On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk, or whatever it was, underneath.|$|E
60|$|It {{was shown}} abundantly, on many {{occasions}} {{in the course of}} Caesar's life, that he had no faith in omens. There are equally numerous instances to show that he was always ready to avail himself of the popular belief in them; to awaken his soldiers' ardor or to allay their fears. Whether, therefore, in respect to this story of the shepherd trumpeter, it was an incident that really and accidentally occurred, or whether Caesar planned and arranged it himself, with reference to its effect, or whether, which is, perhaps, after all, the most probable supposition, the tale was only an embellishment invented <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> or nothing by the story-tellers of those days, to give additional dramatic interest to the narrative of the crossing of the Rubicon, it must be left for each reader to decide.|$|E

60|$|It {{always is}} wretched weather {{according}} to us. The weather {{is like the}} government--always in the wrong. In summer-time we say it is stifling; in winter that it is killing; in spring and autumn we find fault with it for being neither one thing nor the other and wish it would make up its mind. If it is fine we say the country is being ruined for want of rain; if it does rain we pray for fine weather. If December passes without snow, we indignantly demand to know what has become of our good old-fashioned winters, and talk {{as if we had}} been cheated <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> we had bought and paid for; and when it does snow, our language is a disgrace to a Christian nation.

60|$|But a point I {{have been}} trying to bring out {{throughout}} all this argument so far is this--that when a European goes to the United States of America he finds a new sort of state, materially bigger and materially less encumbered than any European state. And he also finds an intensely patriotic people whose patriotism isn't really the equivalent of a European patriotism. It is historically and practically a synthesis of European patriotisms. It is numerically bigger. It is geographically ten times as big. That is very important indeed {{from the point of view}} of this discussion. And it is synthetic; it is a thing made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> smaller. People, I believe, talk of 100 per cent. Americans. There is no 100 per cent. American except the Red Indian. There isn't a white man in the United States from whose blood a large factor of European patriotism hasn't been washed out to make way for his American patriotism.|$|E
60|$|The time flew. But I {{observed}} - {{listen to}} this, I pray!

I think that I began to notice this when I was walking up hills by the carriage side, and master had gone on in front. At any rate, I remember that it impressed itself upon my mind one evening in the South of France, when she called to me to call master back; {{and when he came}} back, and walked for a long way, talking encouragingly and affectionately to her, with his hand upon the open window, and hers in it. Now and then, he laughed in a merry way, as if he were bantering her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>something.</b> By-and-by, she laughed, and then all went well again.|$|E

60|$|But he {{believed}} in the doctor's prescription as little as did the doctor himself, {{and when he was}} alone amused himself by lighting his cigar with it. He had to get amusement <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>something,</b> for his cigar tasted like nothing on earth, and he smoked only to persuade himself that he was not too ill to. That evening a couple of friends of his, masters of tramp steamers, hearing he was sick came to see him. They discussed his case over a bottle of whisky and a box of Philippine cigars. One of them remembered how a mate of his had been taken queer just like that and not a doctor in the United States had been able to cure him. He had seen in the paper an advertisement of a patent medicine, and thought there'd be no harm in trying it. That man was as strong as ever he'd been in his life after two bottles. But his illness had given Captain Butler a lucidity which was new and strange, and while they talked he seemed to read their minds. They thought he was dying. And when they left him he was afraid.|$|E
60|$|Did palæolithic man, that antique naked {{crouching}} savage who hunted the mammoth, the reindeer, and the cave-bear {{among the}} frozen fields of interglacial Gaul and Britain--did palæolithic man himself, in his rude rock-shelters, possess {{a knowledge of}} the art of pottery? That is a question which has been much debated amongst archæologists, and which cannot even now be considered as finally settled before the tribunal of science. He must have drunk <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>something</b> or other, but whether he drank out of earthenware cups is still uncertain. It is pretty clear that the earliest drinking vessels used in Europe were neither bowls of earthenware nor shells of fruits, for the cold climate of interglacial times did not permit the growth in northern latitudes of such large natural vessels as gourds, calabashes, bamboos, or coco-nuts. In all probability the horns of the aurochs and the wild cattle, and the capacious skull of the fellow-man whose bones he had just picked at his ease for his cannibal supper, formed the aboriginal goblets and basins of the old black European savage. A curious verbal relic of the use of horns as drinking-cups survives indeed down to almost modern times in the Greek word keramic, still commonly applied to the art of pottery, and derived, of course, from keras, a horn; while as to skulls, not only were they frequently used as drinking-cups by our Scandinavian ancestors, but there still exists a very singular intermediate American vessel in which the clay has actually been moulded on a human skull as model, just as other vessels have been moulded on calabashes or other suitable vegetable shapes.|$|E
