The NATO group subsequently recommended the 5.7×28mm cartridge, citing superior performance in testing, but the German delegation objected and the standardization process was indefinitely halted.|$|E

5|$|Test cricket {{is played}} between {{international}} cricket teams who are Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Unlike One Day Internationals, Test matches consist of two innings per team, having no limit in their number of overs. Test cricket is first-class cricket, so statistics and records set in Test matches are also counted toward first-class records. The duration <b>of</b> <b>Tests,</b> currently limited to five days, has varied through Test history, ranging from {{three days to}} timeless matches. The earliest match now recognised as a Test was played between England and Australia in March 1877; since then there have been over 2,000 Tests played by 11 teams. The frequency <b>of</b> <b>Tests</b> has steadily increased {{partly because of the}} increase in the number of Test-playing countries, and partly as cricket boards seek to maximise their revenue.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for embedding <b>of</b> <b>test</b> concepts into high-level synthesis. Symbolic test points declared by a test concept specification are mapped on physical registers. This {{is done by}} an assignment <b>of</b> <b>test</b> points to symbolic registers and by a usual register binding tool. The experiments show that this way of integration does not result in larger designs. 1 Introduction The use <b>of</b> built-in self <b>test</b> methods or partial scan paths requires the selection <b>of</b> <b>test</b> points. The selection <b>of</b> <b>test</b> points is a problem which is mostly considered after {{the design of the}} RT-structure. But it can be very difficult or even impossible to find a configuration <b>of</b> <b>test</b> points, which can realize a given test concept. In that cases, where it is impossible to find a configuration <b>of</b> <b>test</b> points, new registers are inserted in the design. These new registers are only used as test points.
