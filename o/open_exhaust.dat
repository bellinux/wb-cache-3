50|$|To {{eliminate}} the need of NOx and particulate treatment in contemporary diesel engines, the cylinder compression ratio is reduced to 14.0:1. Cold engine start is achieved via multi-hole piezo injectors with 3 programmable injection patterns, and adoption of ceramic glow plugs. Engine misfiring is prevented via variable valve lift at <b>exhaust,</b> which <b>opens</b> <b>exhaust</b> valves during the intake stroke, which increases engine air temperature. The SKYACTIV-D also uses a two-stage turbocharger, in which one small and one large turbo are selectively operated, according to driving conditions.|$|R

50|$|When the {{transfer}} is complete, the piston {{is on the}} compression stroke but the exhaust port is still open, an unavoidable problem with the two stroke piston port design. To help prevent the piston pushing fresh mixture out the <b>open</b> <b>exhaust</b> port the strong acoustic wave (produced by the combustion) from the expansion chamber is timed to arrive during {{the beginning of the}} compression stroke. The port blocking wave is created by reducing the diameter of the chamber. This is called the convergent section (or baffle cone). The outgoing acoustic wave hits the narrowing convergent section and reflects back a strong series of acoustic pulses to the cylinder. They arrive in time to block the exhaust port, still open during the beginning of the compression stroke and push back into the cylinder any fresh mixture drawn out into the header of the expansion chamber. The convergent section is made to converge at 16 to 25 degrees, depending on requirements.|$|E

5000|$|The race-bred {{engine bore}} no {{relation}} to the mass-produced units in Alfa's more mainstream vehicles. The engine is closely related to the V8 of the Alfa Montreal, albeit with smaller capacity and in a much higher state of tune. Both engines were derived from the 33 racers‘ but differed in many details. Both engines had chain driven camshafts as opposed to the racers‘ gear driven ones, but the Stradale kept the racing engine’s flat plane crankshaft, whereas the Montreal engine had a cross plane crank. Race engineer Carlo Chiti designed an oversquare (78 mm bore x 52.2 mm stroke) dry-sump lubricated all aluminum [...] V8 that featured SPICA fuel injection, four ignition coils and 16 spark plugs. The engine used four chain-driven camshafts to operate the valve train and had a rev-limit of 10,000 rpm. The engine produced [...] at 8,800 rpm in road trim and [...] in race trim. The engine valves are operated via chain-driven double-overhead cams and has a 10.5:1 compression ratio. Because every Stradale is hand built and unique the power levels can vary by car, used rpms etc., for example the first production Stradale (No. 750.33.101) has factory datasheet that claims [...] at 9,400 rpm with a [...] "street" [...] exhaust and [...] with <b>open</b> <b>exhaust.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first Salmson car proper used a {{four-cylinder engine}} {{designed}} by Petit with unusual valve gear: a single pushrod actuated both inlet and exhaust valves pushing to <b>open</b> the <b>exhaust</b> and pulling {{to open the}} inlet.

Later the same year the company built its first twin-overhead-cam engine, which was fitted to the 1922 D-type, although most production at first used the pushrod engine.|$|R
50|$|With {{the primary}} turbo {{continuing}} to supply manifold {{pressure and the}} secondary turbocharger essentially bleeding off the boost it makes during the transition, the ECU will determine when to close the pressure relief valve and fully <b>open</b> the <b>exhaust</b> control valve.

50|$|An engine {{requires}} {{large amounts}} of air when operating at high speeds. However, the intake valves may close before enough air has entered each combustion chamber, reducing performance. On the other hand, if the camshaft keeps the valves open {{for longer periods of}} time, as with a racing cam, problems start to occur at the lower engine speeds. <b>Opening</b> the <b>exhaust</b> valve while the intake valve is still open may cause unburnt fuel to exit the engine, leading to lower engine performance and increased emissions.|$|R

40|$|Flow-generated {{noise from}} in-duct strip {{spoilers}} was radiated from an <b>open</b> <b>exhaust</b> termination unit into a 70 m 3 reverberation chamber {{and have been}} measured in 1 / 3 octave bands using sound power spectra. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package was adopted to model the strip spoilers in the air duct.

A normalised spectrum has been produced for predicting the sound power level of flow-noise produced by the strip spoilers in a rectangular air duct. The data collapse for the strip spoilers is generally good at higher Strouhal numbers, but is less efficient at lower Strouhal numbers where considerable scatter is observed. Together with the normalised spectrum, the predictive equations of Mak and his co-investigators can be used to predict the flow-generated noise produced by in-duct strip spoilers in a ventilation system at design stage using CFD.

40|$|Measurements of flow-generated noise {{produced}} by {{two different types}} of strip spoilers in the air duct and radiated from an <b>open</b> <b>exhaust</b> termination unit into a reverberation chamber have been made in 1 / 3 octave bands using sound power spectra. The measured values are compared with the predicted values using CIBSE Guide B 5 method based on selected values of the constant C. It is found that the measured values agree well with the predicted values. The measured values are also compared with the predicted sound power levels using the generic equations given in the Appendix 5. A 2 of the CIBSE Guide. It is found that the predicted values using the generic formulae and the single normalised spectrum given in the Appendix 5. A 2 of CIBSE Guide do not agree well with the measured values, particularly at low frequencies. For very different in-duct elements, a single normalised spectrum for flow-generated noise may not be sufficient for all configurations of the in-duct elements. It is suggested that several representative normalised spectra for different types of in-duct elements should be given. Practical application: This study provides an evaluation of the accuracy of the CIBSE Guide B 5 method and the CIBSE Appendix 5. A 2 generic formulae for the prediction of flow-generated noise {{produced by}} in-duct spoilers in a ventilation system. It also gives comments on the method for improvements. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel Stagnation Point Reverse Flow (SPRF) combustor concept that can burn gaseous or liquid fuels in premixed or non-premixed modes of combustion with ultra low NOx emissions. The combustor {{consists of a}} tube with open and closed ends. Contrary to most combustors, the reactants and products enter and leave this combustor at the same (open) end. In the investigated configuration, the reactants are injected along the combustor center line, moving towards the closed end, where the flow velocity must be zero. This creates a low velocity region towards the closed end of the combustor that helps stabilize the combustion process. Furthermore, {{the presence of a}} closed end forces the generated combustion products and burning gas pockets to reverse their flow direction and move towards the <b>open</b> (<b>exhaust)</b> end of the combustor. Thus, a portion of the hot products, laden with radicals, are entrained back into the incoming reactants to form a more chemically reactive mixture. The presence of radicals in the mixture lowers its ignition temperature and, thus, the lean blowout limit of the combustor. Thus, the SPRF combustor’s geometry produces a combination of stagnation and reverse flow entrainment that allows this combustor to operate stably at very low temperatures with ultra low NOx emission in the 1 ppm range and below. It is also shown that these low NOx emissions can be attained with premixed or non-premixed modes of combustion. Finally, it is shown that the developed combustor can operate with high combustion intensities, in the 30 - 40 MW/m 3 range at atmospheric pressure, without experiencing combustion instabilities.

Considering the thermal conductivities of the material, space under the roof coverage will intent to occur thermal discomfort due to Malaysian ambient temperature. The roof plays an important role to ensure the house is in a state insulated from the hot sun and rain where the zinc roofing will radiated by the sun in noon and yet become the heat source for in-house area. Thermal discomfort will result due to zinc highly heat absorbing material property. The space under the covering will experience significant temperature increase proportional to the amount of supplied heat from sunlight radiated to the zinc roof, and will further be aggravated if ventilation is poor. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the temperature distribution by two alternatives methods to reduce the temperature inside a zinc-covered house. The main concept of this cooling system is by splashing water throughout the area of the zinc roofing, where heat exchange process will occur upon contact.
