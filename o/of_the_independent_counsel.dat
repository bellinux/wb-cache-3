5000|$|The Reagan {{administration}} posed {{an entirely}} different challenge for Cox, for he believed that it attempted to bring about radical politicization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> judiciary.

More overtly, Attorney General William French Smith called on the Court to [...] "follow the election returns." [...] Said in conjunction with a conservative push to strip <b>the</b> Court <b>of</b> jurisdiction over issues they disagreed with, the call was widely interpreted as a blatant interference with the judicial function. Together with the ACLU, the ABA and others, Cox on behalf of Common Cause pushed back against Smith's [...] "broadside attack upon <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> our judiciary" [...] and [...] "radical and unprincipled attempts to legislatively overturn Supreme Court decisions."

Although the law explicitly transfers {{much of an}} Attorney General 2 ̆ 7 s lawful power to an <b>independent</b> <b>counsel,</b> it does {{not go far enough}} in reallocating that power.

After an introduction in Part I, Part II of this article reviews the current legal provisions, including <b>the</b> allocations to <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> <b>of</b> powers that ordinarily would belong to the Attorney General and <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Justice. Part III considers some instances in which the powers that the law or custom reserves to the Attorney General have been exercised to complicate or impede <b>the</b> work <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel.</b> Part IV proposes statutory modifications that would allocate further power to <b>independent</b> <b>counsel.</b> Part V considers some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> challenges that would arise and the political consequences that might flow from these proposed statutory modifications. I conclude in Part VI that an empowered <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> might have better working interactions with an Attorney General and <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Justice, facilitating quicker and more satisfying outcomes to <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> investigations. In <b>the</b> alternative, even if empowering <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> vis-a-vis <b>the</b> Attorney General would result in more visible and frequent political showdowns—between Attorneys General and <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> or between Presidents and independent counsel—this too could be healthy for our larger governmental processes...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This report presents <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> our audit of expenditures reported by <b>the</b> Office <b>of</b> Special Counsel Patrick J.

Under 28 U. S.

The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 amended title 28 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Code to authorize <b>the</b> judicial appointment <b>of</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsels</b> when <b>the</b> Attorney General determines that reasonable grounds exist to warrant further investigation of high-ranking government officials for certain alleged crimes. <b>The</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> law, which expired on June 30, 1999, was intended to preserve and promote the accountability and integrity of public officials and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal government.

40|$|With <b>the</b> {{backdrop}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{impeachment trial}} <b>of</b> President William Jefferson Clinton, Congress {{was confronted with}} <b>the</b> quandary <b>of</b> whether to reauthorize <b>the</b> <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> statute. As <b>the</b> statute approached its June 30, 1999 lapse date, lawmakers grappled with and bandied about an array of proposals, including statutory abandonment, in <b>the</b> midst <b>of</b> tremendous political tension and public fervor over <b>the</b> actions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President, <b>Independent</b> <b>Counsel</b> Kenneth Starr, and members of Congress. Ultimately, Congress allowed the statute to expire, leaving <b>the</b> prosecution <b>of</b> high-ranking Executive Branch officials in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Department <b>of</b> Justice. Advocates of reauthorization could only hope that <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> reauthorization would be revisited at a later time. As noted by Senator Thompson, a persistent shortcoming associated with the statute “over the last 20 years” had been the failure to effect a statutory balance which preserved prosecutorial independence and latitude, yet provided sufficient safeguards against <b>the</b> runaway exercise <b>of</b> prosecutorial discretion. Indeed, this objective underlied the statute 2 ̆ 7 s enactment. With Watergate serving as the precipitous event, and after five years <b>of</b> legislative effort, <b>the</b> original version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute emerged in 1978. Perceived as a mechanism that would bolster public confidence with respect to <b>the</b> prosecution <b>of</b> high-ranking members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Executive Branch, the statute removed the prosecutive function from the Justice Department {{and placed it in}} <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> a judicially appointed <b>independent</b> <b>counsel.</b> However, despite repeated attempts at modification, many believed that <b>the</b> want <b>of</b> adequate safeguards with respect to <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> activity, inter alia, ultimately undercut <b>the</b> very purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislation. In this article, I dispute the contention that the statute 2 ̆ 7 s arguable failures with respect to <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> accountability mandate statutory abandonment. By allowing the statute to lapse, Congress has necessarily subjected the public to <b>the</b> observance <b>of</b> a prosecutorial process strewn with conflicts of interest, as well as individual defendants to investigations and prosecutions pursued by interested prosecutors. Instead, through statutory modification, the coveted balance between <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> liberty and accountability can be effectively achieved. I will demonstrate how, through a proposal I initially presented in <b>the</b> Harvard Journal <b>of</b> Law and Public Policy, this balance can be achieved and the statute salvaged. To this end, I commence with a historical retracing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statute, from its inception in 1978 through its last reauthorization in 1994. Thereafter, I will discuss and critique the leading argument presented in opposition to statutory renewal during the congressional reauthorization hearings in 1999. Finally, I will reintroduce my proposal for statutory reform and proceed to critique it in light of Morrison v. Olson, the United States Supreme Court case which upheld the statute 2 ̆ 7 s constitutionality. Through a detailed dissection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opinion, I will demonstrate not only the proposal 2 ̆ 7 s constitutionality, but also how the proposal effectively regulates <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> activity, preserves <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> liberty, and ensures appearances of propriety...|$|R
