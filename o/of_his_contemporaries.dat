5|$|The 1840s were a {{turbulent}} decade in the Church of England. Following the earlier German Higher Critics, who {{argued for a}} historical approach to religious texts, David Strauss published Leben Jesu or The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined which argued that {{the events of the}} New Testament were not historical but rather mythical. In 1846 George Eliot published an English translation of Leben Jesu which became a source of religious doubts for Froude and many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b> Critics have also identified Thomas Carlyle's novel Sartor Resartus and Spinoza as sources of Sutherland's doubts, and those of many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b>|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> Miller's {{sporting}} career was interrupted by World War II. On 20 August 1940, {{towards the end of the}} football season, almost a year after war broke out, Miller joined the Militia (army reserve), and was assigned to the 4th Reserve Motor Transport Company.|$|E

5|$|Nyuserre Ini is well attested in sources {{contemporaneous}} {{with his}} reign, {{for example in}} the tombs of some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> including Nyuserre's manicurists Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum, the high officials Khufukhaf II, Ty, Rashepses, Neferefre-ankh and Khabawptah, and the priests of his funerary cult Nimaatsed and Kaemnefert.|$|E
5|$|The {{attitude}} of Suetonius toward Germanicus' personality and moral temperament {{is that of}} adoration. He dedicates {{a good portion of}} his Life of Caligula to Germanicus, claiming Germanicus' physical and moral excellence surpassed that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b> Suetonius also says that Germanicus was a gifted writer, and that despite all these talents, he remained humble and kind.|$|E
5|$|After his release, Bo Xilai {{worked at}} the Hardware Repair Factory for the Beijing Second Light Industry Bureau. He was {{admitted}} to the Peking University by public examination in 1977. Unlike many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> in the Chinese leadership who studied engineering, Bo majored in world history. In the second year of his studies, Bo enlisted in a Master's program in international journalism at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, graduating with a master's degree in 1982. He joined the Communist Party in October 1980.|$|E

5|$|By fourteen, Sunday was {{shifting}} for himself. In Nevada, Iowa, {{he worked}} for Colonel John Scott, a former lieutenant governor, tending Shetland ponies and doing other farm chores. The Scotts provided Sunday a good home {{and the opportunity to}} attend Nevada High School. Although Sunday never received a high school diploma, by 1880 he was better educated than many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b>|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sources also {{differed}} on his status. Foreign visitors {{often called}} him a chief, especially during his capacity as royal governor, but most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> like Samuel Kamakau, missionary Hiram Bingham I, and even King Kamehameha III considered him a makaʻāinana or commoner. Kapeau {{was one of the}} first non-royal Hawaiians to receive a western education from the missionaries who arrived in Hawaii in 1820.|$|E
5|$|Shankar {{developed}} a style distinct from that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> and incorporated influences from rhythm practices of Carnatic music. His performances begin with solo alap, jor, and jhala (introduction and performances with pulse and rapid pulse) {{influenced by the}} slow and serious dhrupad genre, followed by a section with tabla accompaniment featuring compositions associated with the prevalent khyal style. Shankar often closed his performances with a piece inspired by the light-classical thumri genre.|$|E

5|$|The Nemesis of Faith is an epistolary {{philosophical}} {{novel by}} James Anthony Froude published in 1849. Partly autobiographical, the novel depicts {{the causes and}} consequences of a young priest's crisis of faith. Like many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> Froude came to question his Christian faith in light of early nineteenth century developments in history, theology, and science. Froude was particularly influenced by the Catholic teachings of the Oxford Movement and by the new approach to religious scholarship developed by the German Higher Critics.|$|E
5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination to the greatest effect.|$|E
5|$|An {{understanding}} of the artistic personality of Gasparo Cairano has to be mediated by a proper contextualization of the contemporary art scene of Brescia. He {{can be referred to}} as a novice artist at the beginning, when the Lombard migrant, like many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> arrived in Brescia during the innovative construction of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli and started a successful career. That historic moment, with the municipality in search of innovating artists, was also beneficial: he proved able to interpret in stone the boastful self-celebration of the high offices, public and private, of renaissance Brescia. He quickly became the leading innovator of sculptural practice in the region, continually outperforming the already weak competition, which appeared mainly in the shape of Sanmicheli and Antonio della Porta.|$|E

5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would alienate friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1874, Smetana {{had become}} {{completely}} deaf but, freed from his theatre duties and the related controversies, he began a period of sustained composition that continued for almost {{the rest of his}} life. His contributions to Czech music were increasingly recognised and honoured, but a mental collapse early in 1884 led to his incarceration in an asylum and subsequent death. Smetana's reputation as the founding father of Czech music has endured in his native country, where advocates have raised his status above that <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> and successors. However, relatively few of Smetana's works are in the international repertory, and most foreign commentators tend to regard Antonín Dvořák as a more significant Czech composer.|$|E
5|$|Edward had a {{reputation}} for a fierce temper, and he could be intimidating; one story tells of how the Dean of St Paul's, wishing to confront Edward over the high level of taxation in 1295, fell down and died once he was in the King's presence. When Edward of Caernarfon demanded an earldom for his favourite Gaveston, the King erupted in anger and supposedly tore out handfuls of his son's hair. Some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> considered Edward frightening, particularly in his early days. The Song of Lewes in 1264 described him as a leopard, an animal regarded as particularly powerful and unpredictable.|$|E

5|$|George was {{ridiculed}} by his British subjects; some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries,</b> such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, {{thought him}} unintelligent {{on the grounds}} that he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that he understood, spoke and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, MacArthur became Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, which Chief of Staff Peyton March felt {{had become}} {{out of date}} in many respects and was much in need of reform. Accepting the post allowed MacArthur to retain his rank of brigadier general, instead of being reduced to his {{substantive}} rank of major like many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries.</b> When MacArthur moved into the superintendent's house with his mother in June 1919, he became the youngest superintendent since Sylvanus Thayer in 1817. However, whereas Thayer had faced opposition from outside the Army, MacArthur had to overcome resistance from graduates and the academic board.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Æthelwulf's {{reputation}} among historians was poor: he {{was seen}} as excessively pious and impractical, and his pilgrimage {{was viewed as a}} desertion of his duties. Historians in the 21st century see him very differently, as a king who consolidated and extended the power of his dynasty, commanded respect on the continent, and dealt more effectively than most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>contemporaries</b> with Viking attacks. He is {{regarded as one of the}} most successful West Saxon kings, who laid the foundations for the success of his son, Alfred the Great.|$|E
