5|$|Half-Life: <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> is an {{expansion}} pack for Valve Software's science fiction first-person shooter video game Half-Life. The game {{was developed by}} Gearbox Software and Valve Corporation and published by Sierra Entertainment on November 19, 1999. <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> is the first expansion for Half-Life and was first announced in April 1999. Randy Pitchford, the lead designer on the game, later noted that he believed Gearbox was selected to develop <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> because Valve wanted to concentrate on their future projects. Over the course of development, Gearbox brought {{in a variety of}} outside talent from other areas of the video games industry to help bolster various aspects of design.|$|E
5|$|<b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> {{received}} a very favorable reception from critics, holding {{a score of}} 85.45% on the review aggregator site GameRankings. In the United States, the game sold 108,008 copies by April 2000. Although figures for the game's sales on Steam have not been released, <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> eventually sold over 1.1 million copies at retail.|$|E
5|$|As an {{expansion}} pack for Half-Life, <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> is a first-person shooter. The overall gameplay of <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> does not significantly differ {{from that of}} Half-Life: players are required to navigate through the game's levels, fight hostile non-player characters and solve a variety of puzzles to advance. The game continues Half-Lifes methods of an unbroken narrative. The player sees everything through the first person perspective of the protagonist and remains {{in control of the}} player character for almost all of the game. Story events are conveyed through the use of scripted sequences rather than cut scenes. Progress through the game's world is continuous; although the game is divided up into chapters, the only significant pauses are when the game needs to load the next part of an environment. <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> also features an extended multiplayer, incorporating the various new environments and weapons into the original deathmatch mode used in Half-Life. After release, a new capture the flag mode with additional levels, items and powerups, was created by Gearbox for the game.|$|E

5|$|<b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> was {{received}} well by critics, many describing {{it as the}} new benchmark title for expansion packs, {{in a similar fashion}} to how Half-Life revolutionized the first-person shooter genre. Other reviewers, however, thought that the game still had many of the negative aspects of other expansion packs, although it was still regarded as an exceptional add-on.|$|E
5|$|<b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> {{is set in}} {{the same}} {{location}} and timeframe as that of Half-Life, taking place at a remote New Mexico laboratory called the Black Mesa Research Facility. In Half-Life, the player takes on the role of Gordon Freeman, a scientist involved in an accident that opens an inter-dimensional portal to the borderworld of Xen, allowing the alien creatures of Xen to attack the facility. The player guides Freeman in an attempt to escape the facility and close the portal, ultimately traveling to Xen to do so. <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force,</b> however, shows the events of Half-Life {{from the perspective of a}} different protagonist. The player assumes the role of Adrian Shephard, a U.S. Marine Corporal assigned to the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit, a specialized unit sent in to Black Mesa by the government to quell the alien threat and silence all witnesses. However, after Shephard becomes isolated from his fellow Marines, he must ally with the Black Mesa personnel and attempt to escape the base.|$|E
5|$|<b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> {{returns to}} the same setting as Half-Life, but instead portrays the events from the {{perspective}} of a U.S. Marine, one of the enemy characters in the original game. The player character, Adrian Shephard, is sent in to neutralize the Black Mesa Research Facility when a scientific mishap causes it to be invaded by aliens, but quickly finds that the Marines are outnumbered and slowly being beaten back by a second alien race and black operations units.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game's development, Gearbox {{acquired}} various outside talent to assist in designing some aspects of the game. In June 1999, Gearbox announced that the successful level designer Richard Gray would be assisting in developing the multiplayer aspects of the game. Several other designers subsequently joined the project in September 1999, with collective experience from the development of Daikatana, Quake II, Doom and Shadow Warrior. In the subsequent two months, media releases displaying a variety of screenshots were unveiled. The game was released on November 19, 1999. Gearbox later released a multiplayer update in May 2000, adding a new capture the flag mode to the game, along with various new items to accompany the new mode. <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> was later released on Valve Software's Steam content delivery system. <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> was also published as part of Sierra's Half-Life: Generation compilation in 2002, and as part of Valve Software and Electronic Arts' Half Life 1: Anthology on September 26, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Blue Shift and the High Definition pack were {{initially}} {{absent from the}} launch of Valve's content delivery system Steam in September 2003, {{despite the presence of}} both Half-Life and <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> on the system. The game was released on Steam on August 29, 2005 along with the High Definition Pack. Blue Shift was also published as part of Sierra's Half-Life: Generation compilation in 2002, and as part of Valve Software and Electronic Arts' Half Life 1: Anthology on September 26, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Blue Shift {{returns the}} player to Half-Lifes Black Mesa {{timeline}} once more, {{this time as}} Barney Calhoun, one of the facility's security guards. The expansion was originally developed as a bonus mission for the canceled Dreamcast version. Blue Shift came with the High Definition Pack, that gave the player the option to update the look of Half-Life, <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force,</b> and the new Blue Shift content. Blue Shift had relatively little new content compared to Opposing Force: aside from a few variations on existing models, all content was already present in the original Half-Life.|$|E

Bush's second term, said the strike was a {{legitimate}} military action and did not run counter to the U.S.' self-imposed prohibition on assassinations:The killing is not prohibited by the long-standing assassination prohibition in executive order 12333 , because the action was a military action in the ongoing U.S. armed conflict with al-Qaeda, and it is not prohibited to kill specific leaders of an <b>opposing</b> <b>force.</b> The assassination prohibition does not apply to killings in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|When Kaiser Wilhelm II was {{commissioned}} into the fleet, she assumed {{the position of}} fleet flagship; she held this position until 1906. The other four ships joined her in the I Squadron of the Heimatflotte (Home Fleet), where they remained for ten years. The five ships took part in extensive training maneuvers in September 1902 {{with the rest of}} the fleet. Throughout the maneuvers the Kaiser Friedrich III-class ships operated as the <b>opposing</b> <b>force,</b> with the exception of Kaiser Wilhelm II. As the fleet flagship, Kaiser Wilhelm II hosted Wilhelm II during several of the mock engagements and served as the observation point for the senior staff.|$|E
5|$|Although the Dreamcast {{version of}} Half-Life was cancelled, Blue Shift persevered. Prior to the {{cancellation}} of the Dreamcast version, Sierra announced on March 29, 2001, that Blue Shift would be released for PC as well. The game would be released as a standalone expansion pack, a product that {{does not require the}} original Half-Life to run. The new models developed for the Dreamcast version of Half-Life would also be included in the PC version as the Half-Life High Definition pack. In addition, Gearbox announced that the High Definition pack would not be exclusive for Blue Shift, but could be applied to both Half-Life and <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> as well. At the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2001, Gearbox announced that development of Blue Shift had been completed, and exhibited a playable version of the end product. The game was released on June 12, 2001.|$|E

5|$|During gunnery {{trials in}} March 1880 shortly after {{entering}} service, one of Caio Duilios guns in her aft turret burst. After joining the fleet, both ships {{served in the}} Active Squadron, though they alternated {{between it and the}} Reserve Squadron throughout their careers. During this period, they were chiefly occupied with conducting training maneuvers. Italy joined the Triple Alliance with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary in 1882, shortly after the two Caio Duilios entered service; as a result, the country's most likely opponent became France. The exercises in which the ships took part therefore frequently simulated defensive operations against a hostile, numerically superior French Mediterranean Fleet. For the 1893 maneuvers, Caio Duilio was part of the squadron that simulated the defending Italian fleet, while Enrico Dandolo operated on the <b>opposing</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part the player battles through the single-player game alone, but is {{occasionally}} assisted by friendly non-player characters. Security guards and scientists will occasionally help the player in reaching new areas and convey relevant plot information. However, <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force</b> also features fellow U.S. Marines who will assist the player in combat to a far greater degree than security guards. Three types of Marines are featured in the game: the soldier will simply provide fire support for the player with a submachine gun, shotgun or machine gun, the combat medic is capable of healing the player and other non-player characters, while the engineer can cut through doors and remove obstacles, allowing the player and their squad to proceed unhindered. A selection of enemies from Half-Life populate the game, including alien creatures such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts.|$|E
5|$|In 1782, the British staged an {{invasion}} of Kentucky {{with the help of}} their Native American allies, including Wyandots, Ottawas and Ojibwas. When Trigg received word of their attack on Bryan Station, he was commanding the fort at Harrodsburg. He quickly assembled 135 local militiamen and met up with Colonel Daniel Boone and Major Levi Todd and more militia at Bryan Station. When they approached the Blue Licks, a salt lick next to the Licking River, officers suspected a trap and convened a war council, but unruly troops lost patience and crossed the river. The three leaders formed a column each, with Trigg commanding the right. When they met with the <b>opposing</b> <b>force,</b> Trigg's column was ambushed. Trigg was killed and his men fell back after only five minutes of battle. When troops returned to the scene of battle, Trigg's body was found quartered.|$|E

5|$|In December 2005, the USAF {{announced}} that the F-22 had achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC). During Exercise Northern Edge in Alaska in June 2006, in simulated combat exercises 12 F-22s of the 94th FS downed 108 adversaries with no losses. In the exercises, the Raptor-led Blue Force amassed 241 kills against two losses in air-to-air combat, with neither loss being an F-22. During Red Flag 07-1 in February 2007, 14 F-22s of the 94th FS supported Blue Force strikes and undertook close air support sorties. Against superior numbers of Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s, 6–8 F-22s maintained air dominance throughout. No sorties were missed because of maintenance or other failures; a single F-22 was judged lost against the defeated <b>opposing</b> <b>force.</b> F-22s also provided airborne electronic surveillance.|$|E
5|$|In Half-Life, players usually fight {{alone and}} only {{occasionally}} encounter friendly non-player characters who assist them, such as security guards and scientists. While Decay still features levels {{where this is}} the case, significant sections in Decay are dedicated to working with friendly non-player characters, usually escorting them to various objectives and protecting them in firefights. An array of enemy characters from Half-Life populate the game, including alien lifeforms such as headcrabs and Vortigaunts, as well as human soldiers sent in to contain the alien threat. The players {{have access to a}} limited selection of Half-Lifes weaponry to assist them in the game. Although developed after <b>Opposing</b> <b>Force,</b> no non-player characters or weapons from the earlier expansion appear in Decay.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-18th century, Zahir al-Umar, the {{autonomous}} Arab {{ruler of the}} Galilee became a dominant figure in Palestine. In order to build up his army, he strove to gain a monopoly over the cotton and olive oil trade of the southern Levant, including Jabal Nablus, which was a major producer of both crops. In 1771, during the Egyptian Mamluk invasion of Syria, Zahir aligned himself with the Mamluks and besieged Nablus, but {{did not succeed in}} taking the city. In 1773, he tried again without success. Nevertheless, from a political perspective, the sieges led to a decline in the importance of the city in favor of Acre. Zahir's successor, Jezzar Pasha, maintained Acre's dominance over Nablus. After his reign ended in 1804, Nablus regained its autonomy, and the Tuqans, who represented a principal <b>opposing</b> <b>force,</b> rose to power.|$|E
