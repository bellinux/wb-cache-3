5|$|According to our {{surviving}} narratives, {{the three}} kings of Rome during the Etruscan occupation were Tarquinius Priscus, Servius Tullius, and Tarquinius Superbus. During this period the army underwent a reformation into a centurial army based on socio-economic class. This reformation is traditionally attributed to Servius Tullius, {{the second of}} the Etruscan kings. Tullius had earlier carried out the first Roman census of all citizens. Livy tells us that Tullius reformed the army by transplanting onto it the structure derived originally for civil life {{as a result of this}} census. At all levels, military service was, at this time, considered to be a civic responsibility and a way <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> one's status within society.|$|E
5|$|After the Rove sediments were deposited, the Penokean orogeny {{added more}} land mass by {{accretion}} that occurred from the south. A few {{hundred million years}} later the proto-North American continent nearly split in half along the Midcontinent Rift zone, which is a bow-shaped rift extending from northeast Kansas, arcing through the present-day Lake Superior Basin and then angling southeast through Michigan. Then came a period <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> and retreating glaciers. The more resistant diabase sills and dikes remained, while the softer shales were bulldozed away by the glaciers. The north path of glaciation is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges.|$|E
5|$|By this time, however, North Korean {{logistics}} {{had been}} stretched to their limit, and resupply became increasingly difficult.

5|$|In 1954, the Brundage-headed IOC, in {{a narrow}} vote, {{recognized}} both committees, thus allowing both states to participate at Melbourne. Only the PRC's committee initially accepted, but when the Taiwanese NOC changed its mind and decided to send a team to the Games, the mainlanders withdrew in protest. Brundage took the position that despite similar concerns about state sponsorship as with the USSR, once the PRC's committee was recognized and reported to the IOC that all eligibility rules were observed, the international committee had to accept that unless it had evidence to the contrary. He was frustrated by the continuing controversy, considering the squabble a distraction from the goal <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> the Olympic movement.|$|E
5|$|In Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties, {{the three}} new civilizations must build a Wonder to advance from age to age, instead <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> from the Town Center. Unlike {{previous}} Age of Empires games, the player does not achieve victory {{by building a}} wonder. Players can choose from a selection of wonders, each having benefits unique to their civilization. Once built, this wonder provides an initial bonus of units or resources, while continuing to provide a benefit to the player's civilization. This initial bonus becomes larger, depending on which age is being advanced to. Since the wonder is a building, players can assign different numbers of villagers to build it, which affects the speed of advancement. Wonders that are destroyed cannot be rebuilt.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{present a}} model <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> nursing {{practice}} {{based on a}} narrative analysis <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice stories provided by nurses. Design: Using narratives depicting their clinical practice, nurses {{were asked to provide}} illustrations <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice. Analysis <b>of</b> fifty nine narratives enabled exploration <b>of</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice. Setting: Stories depicted contexts <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> nursing practice including mental health, child and family health, acute and aged care. Results: Findings revealed six themes: Knowticing; Getting a doctor; Trans-action; Taleoring care; Experiencing vulnerability and Transporting: facilitating comfort and control. Three narrative aspects representing advanced practice were described: Rescue; Recognition and Responsibility; and Respect. The stories were of complex care situations relating to diverse areas of work highlighting critical incidents. Some incidents gave nurses great satisfaction whilst others were challenging. Conclusions: The findings are presented as a model <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice. Both the world <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice a diagrammatic representation of the findings, and the futures model <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> nursing practice incorporate the themes that emerged from the study. They highlight the central, often invisible place of the nurse in patient care. Advanced practice nurses assume responsibility for optimising care. They believe they make a difference and they call for recognition. The models reflect the multi-dimensional nature <b>of</b> <b>advanced</b> practice, its inherent complexity, dynamism and the potential for amplification of practice roles and functions...|$|R

The four modifications were the ability to launch AGM-28 Hound Dog standoff nuclear missiles and ADM-20 Quail decoys, an advanced electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite, and upgrades to perform the all-weather, low-altitude (below 500feet or 150m) interdiction mission in the face <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> Soviet missile-based air defenses.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat.

Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E
5|$|Although {{originally}} the whole 20th Infantry Brigade {{had been assigned}} the task <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> through the Australian centre towards Nongora, in the end only one infantry battalion, the 2/15th, and a platoon from the Papuan Infantry Battalion was committed. Stepping off on 30 November, this force struck north from Nongora towards the Song River. The lead company crossed the river west of a fjord and shortly after completing this manoeuvre, a force of Japanese engaged them with machine gun fire, killing one and wounding three others. Still in contact, the Australian company secured the crossing enabling two other companies from the 2/15th to come across. While the lead company fixed the Japanese position, the other two conducted a passage of lines manoeuvre and bypassed the Japanese machine gun position as they continued the advance towards Nongora. The lead company then also broke contact and followed them, {{and in the early}} afternoon, finding themselves confronted by a high feature to their front which blocked their path east towards Nongora, they established a defensive position short of their objective; meanwhile, the 2/15th's fourth company, following up in reserve, found the Japanese machine gun position abandoned and subsequently occupied it.|$|E

5|$|During the First World War, Manstein {{served on}} both the German Western and Eastern Fronts. At the {{beginning}} of the war he was promoted to lieutenant and participated in the invasion of Belgium with the 2nd Guard Reserve Infantry Regiment. In August 1914 he took part in the capture of Namur, the site of a massive citadel surrounded by outlying forts. In September, Manstein's unit was one of two transferred to East Prussia and attached to the Eighth Army, commanded by Hindenburg. After seeing action in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes, his unit was soon reassigned to the Ninth Army, which was in the process <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> from Upper Silesia to Warsaw. Overstretched, the Ninth Army was forced to withdraw in the face of a Russian counterattack, and on 16 November Manstein was wounded during the retreat when he was among a detachment that stormed a Russian entrenchment. He was shot in the left shoulder and the left knee; one bullet hit his sciatic nerve, causing the leg to be numb. Recovery took six months in hospital in Beuthen and Wiesbaden.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, it {{was found}} that the {{handling}} of armoured forces during the campaign left much to be desired. During the beginning of Guderian's attack in northern Poland, his corps was held back to coordinate with infantry for quite a while, preventing a faster advance. It was only after Army Group South had its attention taken from Warsaw at the Battle of Bzura that Guderian's armour was fully unleashed. There were still lingering tendencies to reserve Germany's armour, even if in independent divisions, to cover an infantry advance or the flanks <b>of</b> <b>advancing</b> infantry armies. Although tank production was increased to 125 tanks per month after the Polish Campaign, losses forced the Germans to draw further strength from Czech tank designs, and light tanks continued to form the majority of Germany's armored strength.|$|E

He passed his Bachelor of Music (BMus) exams, at his second attempt, in December 1928. Rather than continuing to study for a doctorate, Tippett {{decided to leave the}} academic environment. The RCM years had brought him intense and lasting friendships with members of both sexes, in particular with Francesca Allinson and David Ayerst.|$|E
