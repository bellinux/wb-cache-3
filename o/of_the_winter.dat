Fearful of Soviet designs, during the 1920s and 1930s, the Finns were constantly attempting to align themselves with Scandinavian neutrality, {{particularly with regard to}} Sweden. Furthermore, the Finns engaged in secret military co-operation with Estonia in the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|At {{positions}} west of Hill 881 South {{and north}} of Co Roc Ridge, {{across the border in}} Laos, the North Vietnamese established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its ground operations. The NVA 130mm and 152mm artillery pieces, and 122mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105mm and 155mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by the North Vietnamese to avoid counter-battery fire. They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> monsoon.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{is closer}} to the north {{celestial}} pole than any other first magnitude star. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are {{on opposite sides of the}} pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> sky in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the success}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Winter</b> Classic and its predecessor, outdoor games have been held during {{subsequent}} seasons, and the Winter Classic has become an annual NHL tradition. The next Winter Classic was held on January 1, 2009, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, matching the Detroit Red Wings against the Chicago Blackhawks. Winter Classics have been held in every year since, except for 2013, which was interrupted by the 2012–2013 NHL lockout. Three Heritage Classics, one in 2011, one in 2014, and one in 2016 have been held since. The league expanded its offerings of outdoor games {{with the introduction of}} the NHL Stadium Series in 2014. Since the inaugural Winter Classic, the NHL has held 13 additional outdoor games.|$|E
5|$|During the 1935 offseason, Day {{traveled}} to Puerto Rico {{to participate in}} the country's winter ball league. Beginning with his first trip in 1935, he played six seasons of winter ball in Puerto Rico, spending most of his time with the Aguadilla Sharks. Like with the Negro leagues, records of games were poorly documented, but some statistics show Day went 34–26 in his career with the team, and he established the league's record for most strikeouts in a game, posting 19 in 1939. In 1940, Day spent parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> playing in the Venezuelan League, and for the Veracruz Red Eagles of the Mexican Baseball League, where he finished the season with a record of 6–0.|$|E

Neuner ended the season with her 19th World Cup win in Khanty-Mansiysk's mass start, which ensured her the 2009–10 Overall World Cup, making her the first German woman to win the Biathlon World Cup for a second time. She also won the pursuit and mass start discipline World Cups.
