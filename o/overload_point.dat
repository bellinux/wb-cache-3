40|$|This Masters Thesis {{was carried}} out in {{cooperation}} with Syntronic AB. The purpose was to determine what was possible in terms of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server performance on selected hardware platforms for embedded systems. The results should be valuable for those who are about to select a hardware platform for an embedded system that will contain a HTTP server, and the evaluation therefore included load limits, performance characteristics and system resource usage. The required data was gathered with performance measurements, and a pre-study was performed to decide on platforms, functionality and performance parameters to include in the study. Three hardware platforms with different levels of performance - BeagleBoard-xM, STK 1000 and Syntronic Midrange - were selected. A simulated web application was used during the tests and a total of five HTTP server software were tested. BeagleBoard-xM with BusyBox [URL] had the best overall performance when running the test application. It had a high <b>overload</b> <b>point,</b> low connection durations when not overloaded, and a superior overload behavior. However, Midrange with a modified version of a server made by Stefano Oliveri performed better when not overloaded. STK 1000 was far behind the other two platforms in terms of performance. The overload behavior and efficiency of system resource usage differed greatly between the servers. The test results also showed that the performance varied significantly between HTTP server software running on the same hardware platform, and generally the software with limited feature sets performed best. Detta examensarbete utfordes i samarbete med Syntronic AB. Syftet var att utrona vilken prestanda som kunde uppnas med Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) servrar pa utvalda hardvaruplattformar for inbyggda system. Resultatet skulle vara anvandbart for den som ska valja en hardvaruplattform till ett inbyggt system med en HTTP-server, och utvarderingen inneholl darfor beteende under belastning, belastningsgranser, samt anvandning av systemresurser. Prestandamatningar anvandes for att generera data for analys, och en forstudie utfordes for att bestamma vilka plattformar, funktionalitet och prestandaparametrar som skulle inga i studien. Tre hardvaruplattformar med olika prestandanivaer - BeagleBoard-xM, STK 1000 och Syntronic Midrange - valdes ut. En simulerad webapplikation anvandes under testen och totalt testades fem HTTP-serverprogramvaror. BeagleBoard-xM med BusyBox [URL] hade totalt sett den basta prestandan vid korning av testapplikationen. Den hade en hog overbelastningspunkt, korta behandlingstider samt overlagset beteende under overbelastning.

40|$|Compost toilets {{are used}} for sewage {{treatment}} at remote sites, however there are often problems with anaerobic conditions creating smell. The composting process is well understood, thanks to large scale composting, but {{the applicability of the}} research to small scale compost toilets is uncertain. The heat flows and evaporative performance of a Soltran Compost Toilet at Routebum Falls Hut on the Routebum Track in Mount Aspiring National Park, New Zealand, were assessed. Up to 8 kg of liquid were evaporated from the evaporator during a hot day, but 2 kg of this were condensed in the compost room. This condensation reduced net evaporation, but improved the heat transfer performance of the toilet. The heat released by the condensing water exceeded the heat transferred by hot air. Overall the amount of heat transferred was small and what was transferred was quickly lost from storage by evaporation. Separation of urine and faeces at source has been identified as the factor that could most improve composting performance in an existing toilet. Auxiliary heating improves compost performance in existing toilets, by a combination of increased rate of composting and increased evaporation of urine from the compost. Separation of urine is likely to achieve good composting without the need for auxiliary heating. The high air flows, needed in compost toilets to ensure odours do not reach the users' nostrils, result in evaporative cooling. This ensures the compost, in existing toilet designs, will remain close to ambient temperatures; any surplus heat (biological or auxiliary) will be quickly removed by evaporation. In addition, only the recent (less than one month) additions to the compost will contribute heat. The remaining mass (one to two years of compost) contributes no heat. The conduction losses through the walls of the large container necessary to hold this mass, eliminate the possibility of maintaining high temperatures in the pile without extremely good insulation. However composting will initiate at temperatures above 4 °C, although the rate of composting is affected by temperature. A formula relating compost temperature, daily usage, surface area of compost, and oxygen penetration depth is proposed as a means of identifying the <b>overload</b> <b>point</b> within a compost toilet. This research concludes that successful compost toilets can take one of two paths: a. 	high temperature (high speed) composting - to achieve this will require a small, sophisticated composting chamber. b. 	ambient temperature composting - a vault/pit composter with separation of urine. Because composting occurs at ambient temperatures, the rate of composting will vary as temperature varies. Design considerations for these toilets will need to take ambient temperature into account by sizing the surface area of the receiving chamber accordingly. Existing compost toilet designs do not get hot, so do not fit into category (a) and have a restricted surface area, so do not fit into category (b). In many ways they are more like an ambient temperature compost toilet, but are susceptible to overloading because of the restricted surface area and addition of urine. Composting systems occur on a continuum from the ambient temperature, adequate airflow system (double vault compost toilets) which can be likened to a 'forest floor ecosystem', to the high rate 'bacterial' dominated composting system. The design considerations for the two are totally different and one cannot be easily transferred to the other. High use sites in colder areas will need a design based on the high rate system...|$|E

We evaluate three placement schemes of DINCast. Our simulation results show that DINCast is effective in optimizing the multicast delay over the shared-tree multicast and the reduced rate of multicast delay may be up to 50 %.

The paper introduces the theoretical states individual situational awareness and shared situational awareness and claim that the collective sensemaking process is the bridge which makes shared situational awareness possible. It is stated that collective sensemaking is a vulnerable process which is dependent upon favourable conditions in several domains simultaneously.

30|$|The {{proposed}} adaptive framework {{improves the}} availability of the published web services through reacting to failures on the servers of the consumed services. The adaptation is realized by automatically replicating the failed services on another server. Then, the incoming requests would be transparently redirected to that server. Remarkably, the requests of a consumer will not be replicated; they will just be forwarded to the free replicas. The framework enhances the performance of the published services by using a centralized dynamic load balancing process (Alakeel 2010). The dynamic load balancing process is needed to make request balancing decisions at runtime. And the load balancing process, being centralized, will execute the utilized load balancing algorithm, e.g. the Round-Robin algorithm (Silberschatz et al. 2010), as a single service, called Load balancer. For example, if the server that publishes a particular web service becomes <b>overloaded</b> at some <b>point</b> in time, the suggested replication framework will make the required decision immediately to replicate the published web service on another server and balance the incoming requests between the original and the copied services.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In modern {{wireless}} networks, {{fairness of}} user throughputs is often important to efficiently utilize the available network bandwidth. Association control—control of user associ-ations to reduce <b>overloading</b> of access <b>points</b> (APs) —has been the standard approach {{to address this}} problem. However, in the recent paradigm of shared wireless networks in both, community and commercial space, access points are increasingly managed without any central coordination. As a result, achieving user level fairness in these settings remains a challenging task. In this paper, we consider the global utility of proportional fair-ness. Specifically, we propose a distributed approach to association control, in which each user makes association decisions {{based on the information}} gathered from probe responses from its nearby APs. Two solutions are presented: (i) a randomized approach, in which users update their associations probabilistically, and (ii) a deterministic association rule that converges quickly. We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of both approaches. Our simulation results show that the proposed solutions can significantly improve fairness and overall throughput compared to other association heuristics. I...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we develop}} and examine {{decision}} models intended for traffic engineering analysis of multiservice networks. Two important issues are addressed, namely call admission and routing control in multiservice broadband networks, and overload control in distributed-memory systems. Multiservice broadband networking generally {{refers to the}} ability to handle widely disparate traffic streams such as voice, data and multimedia services on a single platform architecture. We study call admission and routing control in such networks adopting the well known multi-rate circuit-switched network model. The various services are distinguished by their bandwidth requirements, call characteristics, and performance objectives. The optimal control problem is formulated and examined using the theory of Markov Decision Processes. Some novel structural properties of the optimal call admission policy are revealed, but it is concluded that the general control problem is impractical to solve for any realistic system. Therefore, based on the structural knowledge of the optimal policy, a novel algorithm is formulated through which a reasonably accurate call admission policy can be calculated. It is demonstrated how this algorithm may be embedded into a fixed point network traffic approximation, leading to an efficient state-dependent least cost routing strategy for multiservice broadband networks. The second study in this thesis is devoted to overload control in distributed systems. The architectures considered are distributed-memory, message-passing systems, which essentially are collections of computers that communicate by sending explicit messages to one another. Typically, in order to serve a call, one or several, possibly physically distributed resources will be needed. From an <b>overload</b> control <b>point</b> of view, this poses a complex problem, since it is generally unknown in advance which resources the call will have to involve in order to complete successfully.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 20 th Annual South African Transport Conference 16 - 20 July 2001 "Meeting the transport challenges in Southern Africa", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: Overloaded heavy vehicles decrease {{the life span of}} the road structure with added costs for maintenance and rehabilitation of the road pavement. The management and protection of the road network is necessary, while maintaining the economic base of the freight industry. While hauliers profit from weak law enforcement, overloaded vehicles are damaging roads, the annual road budget in real terms is diminishing and the condition of roads is deteriorating. The premature deterioration of infrastructure inevitably compromises road safety, and adds to the high fatality rate on South African roads. As this continues, the long-term consequences are serious {{and its impact on the}} economy is the irony. Pavement Management Systems data for the City of Tshwane revealed significant deterioration of the road infrastructure, considerably at the road freight generators such as industrial areas. In 1998, the pre-feasibility study on the Strategy of Freight Transport Impact Management in the Greater Pretoria Metropolitan Council Area GPMC (now Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality) was completed. Twenty-two sites were identified to function as heavy vehicle <b>overloading</b> control <b>points.</b> In 1999 a pre-feasibility study on the Construction and Operation of Truck Control Stations in the GPMC Area on a Public Private Partnership basis was completed. It was initially intended for the feasibility and implementation phases to be carried out on a public- private partnership basis. However,the Municipal Infrastructure Investment Unit advised that without the feasibility study the project was not financially viable. The paper discusses the way forward which includes the administration of the feasibility planning, and a strategy to optimise the existing infrastructure and resources. The paper then describes the procurement procedure as stipulated in the Procedural Guidelines for Implementation and Processing of Municipal Service Partnerships for the GPMC.

40|$|With {{proliferation}} of the IEEE 802. 11 WLAN and the emerging 802. 11 n standard, the WLAN is poised as a promising ubiquitous networking technology to support VoIP services, which is gaining popularity {{due to their}} high cost efficiency. However, the 802. 11 WLAN is not designed to support delay sensitive traffic such as VoIP. This problem is magnified during a handover as user roam the WLAN network resulting in excessive handover latency and consequently packet loss. In addition, a 802. 11 WLAN handover process is predominantly based on the physical layer detection without QoS considerations. This often causes <b>overloading</b> of access <b>points</b> and consequently all its associated connections would suffer from high delay, resulting in unacceptable QoS for the VoIP services. The former can be resolved by reducing handover latency to achieve seamless handover and the latter can be mitigated by employing link layer detection in the 802. 11 WLAN handover process and having an appropriate admission control scheme. In this paper, we proposed an integrated load balancing scheme incorporating (i) QoS-based fast handover to support seamless handover by eliminating both detection and scanning phases from the 802. 11 WLAN handover process; and (ii) soft admission control to protect QoS of existing voice connections when resources are low. This synergy guarantees service QoS during and after handover respectively. Simulations showed that our proposed integrated load balancing scheme is capable of providing seamless handover and QoS enhancements in terms of increased throughput, reduced packet loss and bounded delay when considering heterogeneous voice traffic of different packetization intervals. Particularly, our proposed scheme effectuate QoS balance of both delay and throughput which jointly optimize overall system utilization...|$|R

40|$|Rise of {{the global}} {{environmental}} awareness and climate change impacts caused by greenhouse gases emissions brings about {{a revolution in the}} power and energy industries to reduce fossil fuels and promote low-carbon and renewable distributed generation (DG). The new dimensions, mainly encouraged by the governments’ legislative targets and incentives, have allowed the development of DG worldwide. In the U. K., renewable DG especially wind is being connected on distribution networks and ranges widely in scales. Despite the growing number of potential DG sites, the surplus generation present on the passive networks can lead to some technical problems. In particular, rural networks where wind farms exist are prone to voltage rise and line thermal constraints. In order to accommodate new DG and ensure security of supply and network reliability, active management to mitigate these issues are required. In addition, the duties to provide cost-effective DG connections at avoided expensive investment incurred from conventional solutions, e. g., reinforcement and maintain robust network are a major challenge for Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). This thesis endeavours to develop an adaptive control scheme that provides local and real-time management against voltage variations and line capacity <b>overload</b> at the <b>point</b> of wind connections on rural distribution networks. Taking into account maximising power exports and providing an economically-viable control scheme, the wind turbine’s capability, comprising reactive power control and active power curtailment, is used. Whilst the thesis concentrates on the decentralised control applying several different algorithms, in addition, semi-coordinated and centralised approaches that adopt on-load tap changing transformers’ regulation and Optimal Power Flow tool are developed. Comparisons of these approaches based upon measures, i. e., economics, DG penetration and performance are determined. As an outcome, the developed scheme can enable growing integration of renewable DG on distribution networks and can be seen as an interim solution for the DNOs towards Smart Distribution Networks.

40|$|AbstractUrban {{and rural}} intersections differ {{in terms of}} functionality. They support traffic which differs in terms of travel goals and motivations. In urban areas, these goals are mainly related to work, home, {{shopping}} and recreation. On the other hand, rural intersection mainly support through traffic between towns and cities and regions, with a small admixture of local traffic. Comparison {{of the characteristics of}} traffic flows indicates that towns and cities have heavier traffic flows, mainly of light vehicles, and frequent congestion states, while rural areas reveal smaller traffic flow and its structure is more diverse and involves vehicles travelling at higher speeds. The structure of traffic directions at rural intersections, usually dominated by traffic moving along one of the intersecting roads, differs substantially from the structure of the same at urban intersections. In order to control traffic, rural intersections increasingly rely on varied in time traffic signals, with a preference strategy whenever there is absence of excitation of motion detectors by the participants. The scope of intersections expansion and traffic control algorithms are more varied at urban intersections. Rural intersections are mainly controlled based on three major driving phases. Differences in intersections locations and the specificity of traffic conditions and traffic control imply drivers’ different needs and behaviour. Hence it is important to conduct comparative analyses of urban and rural intersections. The paper will present analysis of variability of saturation flows and capacity and traffic performance based on empirical studies of intersections in 2008 – 2012, both in urban and rural areas. Differences in drivers’ needs and behaviour in rural areas, the specific distribution of types of vehicles and directions on the lanes (single carriageway and dual carriageway) translate into slower vehicle service processes. Smaller values of saturation flow and capacity in rural areas mean that significant periodic increases in traffic flow lead to congestion states much faster than in urban areas. Although in rural areas these states are rather rare for the main direction, they are much more common at entries to the main road. The seasonal variability of traffic makes the functioning of these intersections differ between business (non-recreational) and recreational traffic (e. g. during the holiday season). The paper will also address the issue of acceptance of difficult traffic conditions in the states of traffic <b>overload</b> from the <b>point</b> of view of the road managers and the driver, referring to the reliability of intersection entries in urban and rural areas...|$|R
