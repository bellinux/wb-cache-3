5|$|The congregation's {{building}} was expropriated and demolished {{to make way}} for the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in the 1950s. It combined with another congregation in a similar situation, and, as Congregation Beth Jacob Ohev Sholom, constructed a new building at 284 Rodney Street, just south <b>of</b> <b>Broadway,</b> in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Although most of Wodehouse's {{fiction is}} set in England, {{he spent much of}} his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as {{settings}} for some of his novels and short stories. During and after the First World War, together with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, he wrote a series <b>of</b> <b>Broadway</b> musical comedies that were {{an important part of the}} development of the American musical. He began the 1930s writing for MGM in Hollywood. In a 1931 interview, his naïve revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak.|$|E
5|$|As the 20th century dawned, {{builders}} and architects concentrated their {{efforts in the}} northern half of the district, primarily on commercial structures as the downtown area was no longer popular as a place for new residences. Monument Square, created in 1891 when a statue of Columbia was erected atop the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in the triangular area formed by the intersection <b>of</b> <b>Broadway,</b> River and Second streets, became a new focal point of development. There the McCarthy Building on Monument Square, and the similar National State Bank and Ilium buildings on Broadway, all built in 1904, show the decorative influence of the era's revival styles. Proctor's Theater, ten years later on Fourth Street, continued the tradition.|$|E

5|$|Due {{at least}} in part to the {{presence}} of the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks offers a variety of arts and cultural events. The North Dakota Museum of Art, on the UND campus, brings many nationally touring exhibits to Grand Forks as well as the work of regional artists. In addition to the Museum of Art, UND offers other gallery space for student art. UND also has Theater Arts and Music departments. Students stage theater productions each year at the Burtness Theater on campus. UND's Chester Fritz Auditorium also brings music and theater events to Grand Forks, including national touring companies <b>of</b> <b>Broadway</b> musicals.|$|E
5|$|Galveston {{is home to}} six {{historic}} {{districts with}} over 60 structures listed representing architectural significance in the National Register of Historic Places. The Silk Stocking National Historic District, between Broadway and Seawall Boulevard and bounded by Ave. K, 23rd St., Ave. P, and 26th St., contains a collection of historic homes constructed from the Civil War through World War II. The East End Historic District on both sides <b>of</b> <b>Broadway</b> and Market Streets, contains 463 buildings. Other historic districts include Cedar Lawn, Denver Court and Fort Travis.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette Square is one {{of three}} squares laid out in Joseph Ellicott's city plan. The square is located three blocks east of Niagara Square and is the second most {{important}} space in downtown Buffalo. The block is surrounded by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's Metro Rail light rail rapid transit to the west, which runs above-ground along Main Street in what is called the Free Fare Zone, Washington Street to the east, Lafayette Square to the north (a one-way westbound continuation <b>of</b> <b>Broadway)</b> and Lafayette Square to the south (a one-way eastbound connection to Clinton Street).|$|E

5|$|North of Bedford, M-37 meanders through rural Barry County. The road {{passes through}} mixed {{agricultural}} and forest lands near several small lakes in the area. On its path to Hastings, the trunkline runs through Dowling and meets the western terminus of M-79. The highway follows Hanover Street {{through the south}} side of Hastings into downtown, where it turns west on Green Street and north on Broadway Street. At the intersection <b>of</b> <b>Broadway</b> and State streets, M-37 meets and joins M-43. West of Hastings, M-43 separates and heads south toward Kalamazoo while M-37 turns northwesterly and runs parallel to the Thornapple River. The highway follows the river west and north to the community of Middleville through mixed farms and forests.|$|E
5|$|The B, D, and Q trains {{were all}} rerouted from the express tracks of the BMT Broadway Line to the express tracks of the IND Sixth Avenue Line {{as part of}} Manhattan Bridge reconstruction. No more express service was to be run on the Broadway Line, since these {{services}} comprised the entirety <b>of</b> <b>Broadway</b> express service. This also eliminated the divided B and D services (the Sixth Avenue Line B/D services were separate from the Broadway Line B/D services, as the Sixth Avenue services had originated at 34th Street–Herald Square and continued to upper Manhattan and the Bronx via the IND Eighth Avenue Line and the IND Concourse Line).|$|E
5|$|The Broadway {{business}} district on Capitol Hill was developed between 1900 and 1930, along new city streetcar lines connecting Downtown Seattle to the University District. Urban planner Virgil Bogue's rejected 1911 comprehensive plan for Seattle envisioned a citywide subway system, including an underground loop on Capitol Hill and Broadway that would connect with an east–west line on Pike Street. The Forward Thrust Committee's planned regional rapid transit system, rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included a {{station at the}} intersection <b>of</b> <b>Broadway,</b> Union Street, and Madison Street, as well as additional stations in eastern Capitol Hill.|$|E

One box office juggernaut was the musical The Producers, which won a record 12 Tony Awards in 2001.|$|R
5|$|The Guthrie Theater, {{opened in}} 1963, was {{the brainchild of}} Sir Tyrone Guthrie, who wanted to found a {{regional}} theater without the commercial constraints <b>of</b> <b>Broadway.</b> The high cost of staging Broadway productions meant that shows had to be immediately successful and return a high amount of revenue. This discouraged innovation and experimentation, and made it difficult to stage important works of literature. These ideas were first disseminated in a 1959 article in the drama section of the New York Times, and citizens in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area were eager to support the idea. The theater served as a prototype for other resident non-profit theaters.|$|E
5|$|The early 20th century {{also saw}} the growth <b>of</b> <b>Broadway,</b> a group of theatres specializing in musicals. Broadway {{became one of the}} preeminent {{locations}} for musical theater in the world, and produced a body of songs that led Donald Clarke to call the era, the golden age of songwriting. The need to adapt enjoyable songs to the constraints of a theater and a plot enabled and encouraged a growth in songwriting and the rise of composers like George Gershwin, Vincent Youmans, Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern. These songwriters wrote songs that have remained popular and are today known as the Great American Songbook.|$|E
5|$|Vehicular {{access to}} the Quays has been {{improved}} by the construction <b>of</b> <b>Broadway</b> Link Road, which links the site to the M602 motorway at junction 2, and by the provision of car parking. The high-rise 2116 space multi-storey car park was completed in August 2009. It is a pre-cast curved structure clad {{in a mixture of}} aluminium mesh panels and shaded aluminium tiles, comprising 11 floors of parking above the development's energy centre and commercial units.|$|E

5|$|Victoria {{is roughly}} {{described}} as the area around Victoria station. It includes the conservation areas <b>of</b> <b>Broadway</b> and Christchurch Gardens, Grosvenor Gardens and the environs of Westminster Cathedral. Particularly noteworthy examples of architectural sculpture {{can be found at}} 55 Broadway, where in 1928–1929 sculptors including Eric Gill and Henry Moore were engaged on representations of the Four Winds; two further figures, Night and Day, were carved by Jacob Epstein. A great deal of public art by recent graduates of art schools in London was incorporated into Cardinal Place, a development of 2005.|$|E
5|$|Waxworks {{impressed}} Carl Laemmle, the German-born {{president of}} Universal Pictures. Laemmle {{was struck by}} Leni's departure from expressionism by the inclusion of humor and playfulness during grotesque scenes. Meanwhile, in the United States, D. W. Griffith's One Exciting Night (1922) began a Gothic horror film trend that Laemmle wanted to capitalize on; subsequent films in the genre like Alfred E. Green's now lost The Ghost Breaker (1922), Frank Tuttle's Puritan Passions (1923), Roland West's The Monster (1925) and The Bat (1926), and Alfred Santell's The Gorilla (1927)—all comedy horror film adaptations <b>of</b> <b>Broadway</b> stage plays—proved successful.|$|E
5|$|A {{project to}} convert the former southbound-only Richards Boulevard access {{just south of the}} American River to a {{standard}} signalized intersection was completed in August 2007; this improves access to existing and future development in the area, including redevelopment of a former rail yard, while slowing northbound traffic heading for the bridge and freeway. Another project converting Freeport Boulevard and 21st Street south <b>of</b> <b>Broadway</b> into two-way streets was also completed. 21st Street has carried northbound traffic since 1974, when Caltrans took it over. This will calm traffic while improving the intersection {{at the south end of}} the former one-way pair, which the RT Light Rail now crosses 21st Street just to the north of. In addition, the three blocks of F Street that carried southbound SR 160 from 12th Street to 15th Street have been calmed by the addition of a roundabout at 13th Street.|$|E
