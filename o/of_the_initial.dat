5|$|Lyapunov exponents use {{logarithms}} {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval billiard table, even small changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E

5|$|The {{arterial}} bubble assumption {{also provides}} {{an explanation for}} the criticality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> ascent phase. Bubbles associated with symptoms are not necessarily generated on site. There is a growth process {{at the beginning of the}} ascent that may last for several cycles until the bubbles have reached a critical size when they are either filtered in the lung or stopped at the tissue level. It is postulated that the production of a shower of small arterial bubbles during the first minutes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> ascent is a precursor for DCS symptoms.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} by British staff officers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> {{period of the}} Normandy campaign found that 7% of all German tanks destroyed by British forces were knocked out by PIATs, compared to 6% by rockets fired by aircraft.

5|$|Before Croatia's {{independence}} distinct Croatian football federations {{and teams}} were occasionally formed {{separately from the}} official Yugoslavian organisations. Ivo Kraljević served as the manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>initial</b> federation, established in 1939, and organised non-sanctioned matches played by unofficial national squads up to 1956. These temporary sides, playing non-competitive fixtures, were led by seven different managers.|$|E

In 1937, the highway was completely hard-surfaced for the first time. Its routing has been largely unchanged since designation. The original bridge over the Brule River was built in 1922. In a joint project with the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (WisDOT), MDOT funded a replacement in 2003. WisDOT supervised construction of the new span in a project that ran between July 14 and November 4, 2003.|$|E

After the War of 1812 many veterans of the Western theater were granted land in central Indiana. These soldiers were mostly from Kentucky and the South. They also moved into Indiana, bringing more Southern influence to the state.|$|E
