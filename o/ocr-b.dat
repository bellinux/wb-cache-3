50|$|Optical {{character}} recognition has better accuracy with monospaced fonts. Examples are OCR-A and <b>OCR-B.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} {{characters}} are mapped from fonts specific to MICR, OCR-A or <b>OCR-B.</b>|$|E
50|$|Special fonts like OCR-A, <b>OCR-B,</b> or MICR fonts, with {{precisely}} specified sizing, spacing, {{and distinctive}} character shapes, allow a higher accuracy rate during transcription. These were {{often used in}} early matrix-matching systems.|$|E
50|$|Having coupon {{barcodes}} in a human-readable {{format is}} important when the bar code does not scan and manual entry is required. It {{is recommended that}} the GS1 Company Prefix and offer code, separated by a dash, is stated on top of Expanded Stacked bar code. Although <b>OCR-B</b> is widely used as a human readable font, any font that clearly states the human readable part will be sufficient.|$|E
5000|$|<b>OCR-B</b> is a monospace font {{developed}} in 1968 by Adrian Frutiger for Monotype {{by following the}} European Computer Manufacturer's Association standard. Its function was to facilitate the optical character recognition operations by specific electronic devices, originally for financial and bank-oriented uses. It was accepted as the world standard in 1973. It follows the ISO 1073/II-1976 (E) standard, refined in 1979 ("letterpress" [...] design, size I). It includes all ASCII symbols, and other symbols included for the bank environment. It is widely used for the human readable digits in UPC / EAN barcodes. It is also used for machine-readable passports. [...] It shares that purpose with OCR-A, but {{it is easier for}} the human eye and brain to read and it has a less technical look.|$|E
50|$|Old {{data from}} remote sensing is often {{valuable}} {{because it may}} provide the only long-term data for a large extent of geography. At the same time, the data is often complex to interpret, and bulky to store. Modern systems tend to store the data digitally, often with lossless compression. The difficulty with {{this approach is that}} the data is fragile, the format may be archaic, and the data may be easy to falsify. One of the best systems for archiving data series is as computer-generated machine-readable ultrafiche, usually in typefonts such as <b>OCR-B,</b> or as digitized half-tone images. Ultrafiches survive well in standard libraries, with lifetimes of several centuries. They can be created, copied, filed and retrieved by automated systems. They are about as compact as archival magnetic media, and yet can be read by human beings with minimal, standardized equipment.|$|E
40|$|As {{from the}} 1 July 1985 {{applicants}} can either file their applications {{in a conventional}} manner together with a floppy-disk containing {{the text of the}} application or in machine-readable <b>OCR-B</b> characters. This article describes the idea behind the DATIMTEX system and how the system will operate as well as the effects for applicants/representatives when using the system. The following is an account in some detail of the ideas underlying DATIMTEX and how it will operate, as well as an explanation of the effects of its introduction for applicants and their representatives and for the European Patent Office. ...|$|E
