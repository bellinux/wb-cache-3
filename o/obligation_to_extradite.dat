40|$|The <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> prosecute or <b>extradite</b> is {{a growing}} {{sensitive}} issue in international law. In the recent case Questions Relating <b>to</b> the <b>Obligation</b> <b>to</b> Prosecute or <b>Extradite</b> (Belgium v. Senegal), the International Court of Justice was confronted with determining a breach <b>to</b> the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> prosecute or <b>extradite</b> in relation <b>to</b> acts of torture set forth in Article 7 (1) of the 1984 UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Departing from this pronouncement, the author inquires whether the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> prosecute or <b>extradite</b> correlative <b>to</b> the prohibition of torture can be claimed only pursuant to a treaty norm or by virtue of customary international law alike. Additionally, the author examines what the quid pluris is, in terms of obligations, of defining the prohibition of torture as jus cogens. In an attempt {{to shed light on}} these issues, the author will consider fundamentals of international criminal law, in particular whether an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> prosecute or <b>extradite</b> is established for certain international crimes which constitute violations of jus cogens norms...|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of Soering v.

Ultimately, the Commonwealth of Virginia itself had to offer assurances to the federal government, which passed those assurances on to the United Kingdom, which <b>extradited</b> the individual <b>to</b> the United States.|$|R

40|$|Extradition {{as an act}} of {{international}} cooperation for the repression of criminal activities of the criminal offenders is one of the various models whereby one sovereign state delivers up the alleged accused criminals found within its jurisdiction, on demand, to another sovereign state, so that they might be dealt with according to the penal laws. Extradition has evolved among states because they are vitally interested in the repression of crimes and punishment of criminals who violate their national laws and thus disturb the general peace of the society. This article aims to describe the problems with which extradition is faced, especially with the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>extradite</b> and with the obligation {{to take care of her}} own citizens in situations when the Constitution does not allow extradition of own nationals and in the absence of an extradition treaty...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} I explore a narrow {{question}} that was raised, but not fully addressed, in the Questions relating to the Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite (Belgium v Senegal) case: does {{a state that has}} custody over a person who is suspected of the crime of torture, but that is unwilling or unable to prosecute that person itself, have an <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>extradite</b> that person to a state that seeks extradition, and that is able and willing to prosecute the suspect? The International Court of Justice (ICJ or Court) answered the question in the negative. The Court’s judgment exposes the fundamentally weak legal position of states that may have the strongest links with a suspect, and that may be best capable of prosecuting that person. The emergence of an absolutist obligation to prosecute of the custodial state has annihilated competing claims, whether or not these are based on a stronger link or better enforcement capabilities. Paradoxically, the result may be that a suspect may not be prosecuted at all...|$|E
40|$|Globalisation causes {{crime to}} become {{increasingly}} transnational, thus compelling states to increase cooperation to suppress crime. New Zealand’s outdated extradition laws require reform. The Government {{agrees with the}} February 2016 Law Commission Report proposing {{the need for new}} legislation to replace the Extradition Act 1999. This paper analyses the relationship between the traditional treaty-based approach to extradition and contemporary domestic extradition legislation, and how these approaches protect requested persons’ post-surrender rights. This paper argues the Commission’s proposal to replace s 11 of the Act (which states that bilateral extradition treaties override the Act where they are inconsistent) with a narrower provision giving treaties limited scope to “supplement” or add to domestic extradition legislation, places too much focus on domestic efficiencies while overlooking the international significance of extradition. Allowing the Act to override existing treaties will cause New Zealand to breach its international <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>extradite</b> under those treaties and remove the international plane as a mechanism to protect a requested person’s rights. This paper concludes that New Zealand should retain s 11 in its current iteration and renegotiate treaties to reflect international human rights obligations to ensure extradition only occurs where fundamental principles of justice will be upheld...|$|E

The paper concludes by considering ASEAN progress in adopting cooperative mechanisms to combat terrorism thus far...|$|R

40|$|The thesis gives a brief {{introduction}} {{into the}} theoretical foundation of transnational criminal co-operation and the customary law status of "terrorism”. Within this contextual background the thesis analyses {{twelve of the}} 13 international counter-terrorism instruments currently in force and the legal mechanisms provided hereunder, {{as well as their}} application. It illustrates that all the agreed instruments adopted to date essentially follow the same structure, first established in the Hague Convention, requiring the criminalisation of specific conduct, establishing a clear basis of extra-territorial prescriptive and adjudicative jurisdiction under international law as well as providing associated obligations of co-operation in relation the prosecution of the alleged offender. The thesis analyses the inherent weaknesses of the established regime focusing inter alia on the common principle of aut dedere aut judicaré, the imperfection of the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>extradite,</b> the normative status of the political offence exception and the influence of human rights principles. The study illustrates that although in formal terms the international accomplishments are considerable the analysed treaties have been inefficacious in obtaining their expressed aims of preventing and punishing international terrorism, and that their practical application has been negligible. The thesis, nevertheless, concludes that the established system represents the highest attainable level of international criminal co-operation since the lack of common values prevent more effective transnational co-operation...|$|E
40|$|The International Law Commission {{held its}} sixty-fifth session in Geneva from May 6 to June 7 and from July 8 to August 9, 2013. The Commission devoted {{most of the}} sixty-fifth session to {{discussing}} three topics: immunity of state officials from foreign criminal jurisdiction; subsequent agreements and subsequent practice {{in relation to the}} interpretation of treaties; and protection of persons in the event of disasters. Notably, the Commission adopted three draft articles and commentary identifying three senior governmental officials as entitled to immunity ratione personae from foreign criminal jurisdiction – heads of state, heads of government, and foreign ministers – for their public or private acts, an immunity that ceases once they leave office. Work also continued on four other topics already on the Commission’s current program of work (identification of customary international law, provisional application of treaties, the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>extradite</b> or prosecute, and the most-favored-nation clause), while new topics on protection of the environment in relation to armed conflicts and on protection of the atmosphere were added to the program. At the prior (sixty-fourth) session, the Commission had adopted thirty-two draft articles, together with commentaries, on the topic of expulsion of aliens, and is awaiting the comments and observations of governments on those draft articles to be submitted by 2014. Therefore, that topic was not addressed at the sixty-fifth session...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{the idea}} that treaty {{obligations}} to extradite or prosecute embody or even mandate a principle of universal jurisdiction has increasingly met with weighty support in scholarship. Although this view has not gone unchallenged, {{in the wake of}} the ICJ’s judgement in the Habré case, it is gaining ground, as can be seen, for example, in the International Law Commission’s final report on treaty obligations to extradite or prosecute and the debate on universal jurisdiction at the UN General Assembly and its Sixth Committee. Indeed, this case is increasingly spoken of as if the ICJ was affirming the existence of the principle of universal jurisdiction and providing meaningful guidance on its relationship with the <b>obligation</b> <b>to</b> <b>extradite</b> or prosecute. This article brings new insight to an important topic by examining the relationship between jurisdiction in treaty obligations to extradite or prosecute and universal jurisdiction and providing some much needed conceptual and legal clarification. It argues that treaty obligations to extradite or prosecute should not be conceptualised as, or used to infer the existence of, universal jurisdiction. An alternative conceptualisation of jurisdiction, as a form of “treaty-based jurisdiction”, is offered. The purpose of such jurisdiction is to enable states parties to a treaty regime to obtain the custody of the accused, or have such persons prosecuted on their behalf, failing extradition, for the protection of national vital interests. This argument is informed by engaging with a wide range of primary sources, including a comprehensive empirical analysis of state and treaty practice since the end of World War II to the present, including the actual trials conducted on the basis of extraterritorial jurisdiction. The article concludes that treaty obligations to extradite or prosecute do not provide a legal source of universal jurisdiction proper and characterising these obligations as such is conceptually confused and inconsistent with actual state practice. Evidence of actual state practice in support of universal jurisdiction in customary international law is virtually nonexistent, while much of the verbal practice and opinio juris in support of “universal jurisdiction”, though lacking uniformity, is really support for treaty-based jurisdiction. The universal jurisdiction concept is in urgent need of substantial revision...|$|E
