A person only needs to be 18 to own a liquor license, or to sell or serve alcohol (for example, a waiter or supermarket cashier). State law also prohibits an underage person from misrepresenting their age in a licensed establishment.|$|E
5|$|The deputies {{turned their}} {{attention}} to Cripple Creek itself. They arrested and imprisoned hundreds of citizens without cause. Many inhabitants of the town were seized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> pulled from their homes, then clubbed, kicked or beaten. The deputies formed a gauntlet and forced townspeople to pass through it, spitting, slapping and kicking them. With Bull Hill in his possession, Gen. Brooks began detaining the deputies. By nightfall, Brooks had seized the town and corralled all of Bowers' men.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> stood at the windows of their homes or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E

50|$|The Vagrancy Act 1824 {{makes it}} an offence to sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> to beg. In essence, therefore, it is a crime in England and Wales to be {{homeless}} or to beg for subsistence money. When the Act was passed, criticism of it centred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fact that it created a catch-all offence. To sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> to beg became a crime, whatever reason an individual might have had for being in such a predicament. That provision still pertains today in England and Wales. So far as it extended to Scotland, it was repealed by the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.|$|R
50|$|Under Taeb's command, the Basij {{have been}} very active in suppressing protest over the {{controversial}} 2009 Iranian presidential elections. The suppression has seen the death of at least dozens of protesters <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> in prison.|$|R

25|$|American Apparel images often display {{subjects}} with their blemishes, imperfections and asymmetrical features highlighted and attached with brief, personal descriptions. Many {{of the models}} in American Apparel's advertising are recruited by Charney and his colleagues <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>or</b> company stores; others are selected after sending their photos directly to the company website.|$|E
25|$|Taxicab {{service in}} the city is {{provided}} by private companies regulated by the Metropolitan Taxicab Commission. Rates vary by vehicle type, size, passengers and distance, and by regulation all taxicab fares must be calculated using a taximeter and be payable in cash or credit card. Solicitation by a driver is prohibited, although a taxicab may be hailed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> at a stand.|$|E
50|$|MOPC {{reached a}} peak {{population}} of about 160 children around 2005, but has since stepped up efforts to have relatives take in the children. However, many come through police channels, abandoned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> in hospitals by their destitute, AIDS-ridden parents, without trace.|$|R
50|$|Commercial sexual {{exploitation}} {{of children is}} found especially in urban centers and in areas where there are large numbers of men who are separated from families due to work. Children are involved in commercial {{sexual exploitation}} either <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> in private establishments such as bars, brothels, or massage parlors.|$|R
2500|$|On {{a recent}} trip to Sydney, Australia, I noticed that the city has placed hotel-style {{ashtrays}} filled with sand <b>on</b> sidewalks throughout <b>the</b> central business district and the historic area called [...] "the Rocks." [...] Smokers obviously use them; I almost never saw cigarette butts crushed out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> sidewalks in this delightfully clean and friendly city.|$|R
25|$|A daring new fashion arose {{for having}} one's {{portrait}} painted in undress, wearing a loosely fastened gown called a nightgown over a voluminous chemise, with tousled curls. The style is epitomized by the portraits of Peter Lely, which {{derive from the}} romanticized style originated by Anthony van Dyck in the 1630s. The clothing in these portraits is not representative of what was worn <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> at court.|$|E
25|$|Taxis {{are popular}} in Miami's urban neighborhoods such Downtown Miami, Brickell and Miami Beach, {{the most popular}} routes being those from Downtown Miami to South Beach, Miami Design District or to Coconut Grove. Since many Downtown {{residents}} choose to not have cars, taxis are also popular for rides within Downtown neighborhoods, especially after midnight when the Metromover trains stop running. Taxis can be hailed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>or</b> phoned or at taxicab stands.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{the number}} of {{proficient}} speakers of Occitan is dropping precipitously. A tourist in the cities in southern France is unlikely to hear a single Occitan word spoken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> (<b>or,</b> for that matter, in a home), {{and is likely to}} only find the occasional vestige, such as street signs (and, of those, most will have French equivalents more prominently displayed), to remind them of the traditional language of the area.|$|E
50|$|On June 20, 1911, Compton’s first curfew {{ordinance}} {{was passed}} imposing {{a fine of}} $25 or a sentence of 25 days in jail, or both, for parents or guardians who allowed minors to go unaccompanied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>or</b> in alleys or other public places. The available record does not indicate the hours when the curfew was in effect.|$|R

500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy held that Drayton and Brown were not seized and their consent to the search was voluntary. He explained that [...] "aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching individuals <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen". Additionally, Justice Kennedy emphasized that [...] "f a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter, then he or she has not been seized". Citing the Court's analytic framework established in Florida v. Bostic, Justice Kennedy concluded that a reasonable person would have felt free to [...] "leav the bus or otherwise terminat the encounter". Justice Kennedy noted that the officers did not brandish weapons, they did not make [...] "intimidating movements", they left the aisle clear, and they [...] "spoke to passengers one by one and in a polite, quiet voice". He noted that [...] "t is beyond question that had this encounter occurred on the street, it would be constitutional", {{and the fact that the}} encounter occurred on a bus does not make it illegal.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, Article 7 of the Animal Protection Act {{does not}} {{explicitly}} prohibit {{the slaughter of}} dogs for food, however, it [...] "prohibits killing animals in a brutal way". [...] In addition, it [...] "forbids killing the dogs in open areas such as <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> in front of other animals of the same species".|$|E
50|$|An {{increasing}} number of Filipino workers became frustrated due to unemployment and low standards {{of living in the}} country. Thousands of Filipinos left the country every day to seize better income opportunities. Moreover, around five million Filipino children were unable to go to school and are forced to work <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> in other various workplaces where they could find some food.|$|R
50|$|The {{publishing}} of libelous {{and illegal}} books was often done outside France since the networking of hacks was fairly significant.It {{acted as a}} grapevine circuit in which publishing houses would print and manufacture the literature and then networks of workers would smuggle it into France. The booksellers would then distribute the books by selling them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> in small stores.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani stated: [...] "The {{reality is}} that {{immigrants}} are here, and they're going to remain here. The choice becomes for a city what do you do? Allow them to stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> {{allow them to be}} educated? The preferred choice {{from the point of view}} of New York City is to be educated".|$|R
2500|$|While the {{majority}} of street children in India {{have been found to}} use positive coping mechanisms to deal with the stress of their lives, some choose maladaptive strategies, such as drinking alcohol, using drugs, and visiting prostitutes. When questioned about their substance use, many street children in Bombay reported that the cause was frustration concerning living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> conflicts in their family which caused them to leave home.|$|E
2500|$|A housing {{shortage}} existed throughout the Eastern Bloc, especially after a severe cutback in state resources available for housing starting in 1975. [...] Cities became filled with large system-built apartment blocks [...] Western visitors {{from places like}} West Germany expressed surprise at the perceived shoddiness of new, box-like concrete structures {{across the border in}} East Germany, along with a relative greyness of the physical environment and the often joyless appearance of people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> in stores. Housing construction policy suffered from considerable organisational problems. Moreover, completed houses possessed noticeably poor quality finishes.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{parents have}} since stopped me <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> in {{airports}} to {{thank me for}} helping them to raise fine children, and they've often added, [...] "I don't see any instant gratification in Baby and Child Care" [...] I answer that they're right--I've always advised parents to give their children firm, clear leadership and to ask for cooperation and politeness in return. On the other hand I've also received letters from conservative mothers saying, in effect, [...] "Thank God I've never used your horrible book. That's why my children take baths, wear clean clothes and get good grades in school." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the last}} {{pages of the}} 2008 {{hardcover}} edition there {{is a list of}} addresses, phone numbers and web sites that are listed as Resources.

[...] These resources are for teenage runaways and their families.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2007, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development {{reported}} {{that the number of}} chronically homeless individuals living <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>or</b> in shelters dropped by an unprecedented 30 percent, from 175,914 people in 2005 to 123,833 in 2007.

2500|$|This man, Special Branch or MI5 agent Colin [...] "Lamb", takes Sheila {{into his}} care. He is {{investigating}} a clue from a note {{found in a}} dead agent's pocket; letter M, number 61, and a sketch of a crescent moon written on a bit of hotel stationery (sketched in the book). At 19 Wilbraham Crescent, home of the blind Miss Pebmarsh, a police investigation begins into the murder. The dead man's business card proves false. His clothing reveals nothing else, as all labels have been removed. He was killed with an ordinary kitchen knife. Colin and Inspector Hardcastle interview the neighbours. Their homes adjoin the murder site <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> from the back gardens in this unusually arranged Victorian housing development. Colin takes a liking to Sheila.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, {{architects and}} acousticians {{have begun to}} address the {{problems}} faced by people who rely primarily on acoustic wayfinding to navigate urban spaces. [...] The primary work on the architectural implications of acoustic wayfinding comes from a collaboration between Christopher Downey, an architect who went blind in 2008 and has since worked to improve architectural design for the visually impaired, and Joshua Cushner, who leads the Acoustic consulting practice for engineering design firm Arup in San Francisco. [...] Their work focuses on how to plan new facilities to include sensible systems of sound markers and architectural spaces which provide orientation through acoustic cues. [...] On 20 September 2011, the San Francisco chapter of the American Institute of Architects organized an acoustic wayfinding discussion and walking tour, led by Chris Downey and Joshua Cushner. [...] The purpose of the tour was to highlight the ways that visual impaired people associate sounds with particular buildings and locations, creating [...] "sound markers" [...] that help them find their way <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>or</b> indoors, and to discuss implementing more unique sound markers into urban design projects.|$|E
2500|$|Often, ticket booths are walk-up windows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> <b>or</b> {{are located}} inside {{restaurants}} and bakeries throughout a given Chinatown community, {{although it is}} not uncommon for tickets to be sold on the street directly. Some lines even simply collect cash payment after passengers have boarded the bus. However, tickets are often sold online, either by the bus companies themselves or by portals and print-outs of confirmation emails are used as tickets. Except in Boston, the lines rarely use stations of their own. Passengers are usually directed to wait along a given curbside for the arrival of the bus, although many companies offer waiting areas at or near the pickup points. [...] Several bus stops are also near major hotels and in the parking areas of major Chinese supermarkets. In New York, several bus lines pick up passengers on a stretch of Forsyth Street at the foot of the Manhattan Bridge in the Little Fuzhou neighborhood within Manhattan's Chinatown. Since 1998, when the New York City Department of Transportation marked the strip a bus layover area, the sidewalk between Division Street and East Broadway has served as a de facto terminal for the Chinatown buses.|$|E
