25|$|Joseph Barnett (c. 1858–1927) was {{a former}} fish porter, and victim Mary Kelly's lover from 8 April 1887 to 30 October 1888, when they quarrelled and {{separated}} after {{he lost his job}} and she returned to prostitution to make a living. Inspector Abberline questioned him for four hours after Kelly's murder, and his clothes were examined for bloodstains, but he was then released without charge. A century after the murders, author Bruce Paley proposed him as a suspect as Kelly's scorned or jealous lover, and suggested that he'd committed the other murders to scare Kelly <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>and</b> out of prostitution. Other authors suggest he killed Kelly only, and mutilated the body {{to make it look like}} a Ripper murder, but Abberline's investigation appears to have exonerated him. Other acquaintances of Kelly's put forward as her murderer include her landlord John McCarthy and her former boyfriend Joseph Fleming.|$|E
