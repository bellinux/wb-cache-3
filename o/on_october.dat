5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed over the western Caribbean Sea <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 8, and it persisted until October 11, when a tropical wave reached {{the area and}} caused the convection to organize, resulting {{in the development of a}} low-level circulation. Convection increased and organized around the circulation's center late <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 12, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 13 off the north coast of Honduras. The depression continued to organize over the favorable conditions present in the Caribbean Sea, and attained tropical storm status later <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 13, when it was assigned the name Irene. Operationally, the system remained a tropical wave until it already reached tropical storm strength.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} organized into a tropical depression {{off the coast}} of Nicaragua <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 9. After drifting to the southeast, it turned to the north-northwest and organized into a tropical storm <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 10. Subsequent to crossing western Cuba, Floyd accelerated to the northeast, and attained hurricane status late <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 12. It passed through the Florida Keys before entraining cooler, drier air from a stationary frontal boundary. Its convection became very disorganized, and Floyd weakened back to a tropical storm early <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 13 to the southeast of Miami; the storm crossed the Bahamas, and becoming an extratropical cyclone before being absorbed by the frontal boundary <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 14.|$|E
5|$|A {{cold front}} and an upper level trough interacted <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 10 {{to the south}} of Bermuda, and formed an extratropical storm. The storm passed near Bermuda <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 12, {{producing}} hurricane-force winds on the island. It then organized, becoming a subtropical cyclone <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 12 and a tropical cyclone <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 13. Karen strengthened to reach 80mph (130km/h) winds as a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale, and after weakening over cooler waters, it made landfall on Nova Scotia as a tropical storm. It quickly became extratropical.|$|E

5|$|A {{cold front}} stalled {{a couple hundred}} miles {{southeast}} of Bermuda <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 10. During that day, a strong upper-level trough moved southeastward off the southeast coast of the United States. Due to several factors, including upward motion and strong diffluence—the rate at which a fluid moves—the area became baroclinically unstable. This caused {{the interaction between the}} trough and the front to develop into an extratropical low about 345miles (555km) southeast of Bermuda <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 11. The low moved quickly northward, then northwestward, strengthening quickly due to the instability of the atmosphere. Late <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 11, the system slowed, and the upper-level circulation became aligned with the low-level circulation. The extratropical storm began to develop tropical characteristics late <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 11, including surface temperatures warmer than the surrounding environment, and vertical wind characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Based on its organization, the system developed into Subtropical Storm One early <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 12 while located about 35miles (55km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|A {{disturbance}} possibly {{associated with}} a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 22. It strengthened into a tropical storm that same day and a hurricane <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 23. The next day, Kenna became the third Category5 hurricane of the season. A trough over Mexico recurved the hurricane, and it started accelerating towards Mexico. Despite moving over waters that were still warm, wind shear weakened the system to a minimal Category4 {{by the time of}} its landfall over Mexico late <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 25. Mountainous terrain rapidly weakened Kenna, and the system dissipated early <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 26.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} storm formed <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 15, and {{passed through the}} southern Bahamas.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm {{was believed to}} have formed from a low-pressure area, possibly on {{the tail end of}} a cold front <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 14. The storm moved westward; however, it began to curve west-southwestward <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 15, as it reached its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm continued to trek towards the west-southwest <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 16, later making landfall in eastern Florida <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 17 as a tropical depression.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave in {{the western}} Caribbean organized into Tropical Depression Twenty <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 1. Off {{the coast of the}} Yucatán Peninsula, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Stan <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 2. Stan made landfall on the Yucatán and weakened to a tropical depression, but upon reemerging into the Bay of Campeche it quickly strengthened into a hurricane <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 4. Stan made landfall later that morning on the east-central coast of Mexico, south of Veracruz, as a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 21, moving across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little development. <b>On</b> <b>October</b> 1 it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, and continuing westward it developed an area of persistent convection <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 5. Initially the system was disorganized, although gradual development was expected as conditions in the upper-levels of the atmosphere were expected to become more favorable. <b>On</b> <b>October</b> 7 it developed a broad low pressure area, and by the next day it was located in the eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather; the western portion of the system later developed into Tropical Storm Olivia. The eastern system developed organized convection near its center, and developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at 0000UTC <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 9, about 765mi (1235km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|After re-attaining {{tropical}} storm status, Kyle turned {{more to the}} northeast and parallel to the coastline, making landfall near McClellanville, South Carolina as a minimal {{tropical storm}}. The storm briefly moved over open waters before again making landfall near Long Beach, North Carolina late <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 11. By early <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 12, the storm had weakened to tropical depression status. At the time of it moving ashore, there was a separate non-tropical low to the northeast of the depression, and shear had greatly increased, which made re-intensification unlikely. However, convection redeveloped baroclinically with the approaching cold front, and Kyle attained tropical storm status {{for the fifth time}} over the eastern Pamlico Sound. The restrengthening was short-lived, as the wind field expanded while the convection transitioned into that of a frontal band. After emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean, Tropical Storm Kyle merged with a cold front late <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 12. The remnants of Kyle continued eastward, executing a loop <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 14 before turning northeastward and impacting the Azores <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 17. The next day, the remnants of Kyle were absorbed by an extratropical cyclone to its northwest, which continued northeastward and moved near the British Isles <b>on</b> <b>October</b> 23.|$|E
