5|$|Ski orienteering {{is a form}} of {{cross-country}} skiing competition that requires navigation in a landscape, making optimal route choices at racing speeds. Standard orienteering maps are used, but with special green overprinting <b>of</b> <b>trails</b> and tracks to indicate their navigability in snow; other symbols indicate whether any roads are snow-covered or clear. Standard skate-skiing equipment is used, along with a map holder attached to the chest. It is one of the four orienteering disciplines recognized by the International Orienteering Federation. Upper body strength is especially important because of frequent double poling along narrow snow trails.|$|E
5|$|Wawona was an Indian encampment {{in what is}} now {{the southwestern}} part of the park. Settler Galen Clark {{discovered}} the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoia in Wawona in 1857. He had simple lodgings built, and roads to the area. In 1879, the Wawona Hotel was built to serve tourists visiting Mariposa Grove. As tourism increased, so did the number <b>of</b> <b>trails</b> and hotels developed by people intending to build on the trade.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side, the Midway High Lakes Area, which lies mostly outside the {{wilderness}} area, {{is one of}} the more popular areas around Mount Adams. The area is made up of four large lakes, Council Lake, Takhlakh Lake, Ollalie Lake, and Horseshoe Lake; one small lake, Green Mountain Lake; and a group of small lakes, Chain of Lakes. The area offers developed and primitive camping as well as a good number <b>of</b> <b>trails</b> for hiking and backpacking. Most trails are open to horses and many outside the wilderness are open to motorcycles. More scenery similar to what is encountered in the Mount Adams Wilderness abounds. The area also offers boating and fishing opportunities on several of the lakes.|$|E
40|$|Tumour {{necrosis}} factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or Apo 2 ligand (TRAIL/Apo 2 L) is {{a member}} of the turnout necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of cytokines that induces apoptosis upon binding to its death domain-containing transmembrane receptors, death receptors 4 and 5 (DR 4, DR 5). Importantly, TRAIL preferentially induces apoptosis in cancer cells while exhibiting little or no toxicity in normal cells. To date, research has focused on the mechanism of apoptosis induced by TRAIL and the processes involved in the development <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> resistance. TRAIL-resistant tumours can be re-sensitized to TRAIL by a combination <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> with chemotherapeutics or irradiation. Studies suggest that in many cancer cells only one of the two death-inducing TRAIL receptors is functional. These findings as well as the aim to avoid decoy receptor-mediated neutralization <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> led to the development <b>of</b> receptor-specific <b>TRAIL</b> variants and agonistic antibodies. These molecules are predicted to be more potent than native TRAIL in vivo and may be suitable for targeted treatment of particular tumours. This review focuses on the current status <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> receptor-targeting for cancer therapy, the apoptotic signalling pathway induced by TRAIL receptors, the prognostic implications <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> receptor expression and modulation <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> sensitivity <b>of</b> turnout cells by combination therapies. The mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> resistance and the potential measures that can be taken to overcome them are also addressed. Finally, the status of clinical trials <b>of</b> recombinant <b>TRAIL</b> and DR 4 -/DR 5 -specific agonistic antibodies as well as the pre-clinical studies <b>of</b> receptor-selective <b>TRAIL</b> variants is discussed including the obstacles facing the use of these molecules as anti-cancer therapeutics.

5|$|City {{recreation}} facilities {{include two}} ice hockey arenas, a curling rink, an indoor swimming pool, an outdoor ice rink, and a speed skating oval. The South Peace Community Multiplex, {{a new facility}} completed in 2010, boasts a pool, indoor rodeo grounds and ice rink. Voters approved building the Multiplex in a 2004 referendum which projected its cost at C$21.6 million. The project became controversial when construction began and the cost projection was raised to $35 million. The facility is located close to the city's exhibition grounds, away from residential uses. It features an indoor rodeo arena and a 4,000-seat convention centre/ice arena with skyboxes. Nearby Bear Mountain, located south of the city, provides over 20km (12mi) of snowshoeing and cross-country skiing trails, as well as areas for downhill skiing and about 500km (300mi) <b>of</b> <b>trails</b> for snowmobiles, mountain bikes, and all-terrain vehicles. The city was once home to a North American Hockey League team, the Dawson Creek Rage, beginning in the 2010–11 season until it ceased operations in 2012 due to financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Ski touring {{takes place}} off-piste {{and outside of}} ski resorts. Tours may extend over {{multiple}} days. Typically, skis, bindings, and boots allow for free movement of the heel to enable a walking pace, as with Nordic disciplines and unlike Alpine skiing. Ski touring's subgenre ski mountaineering involves independently navigating and route finding through potential avalanche terrain and often requires familiarity with meteorology along with skiing skills. Ski touring can be faster and easier than summer hiking in some terrain, allowing for traverses and ascents that would be harder in the summer. Skis {{can also be used}} to access backcountry alpine climbing routes when snow is off the technical route, but still covers the hiking trail. In some countries, organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross-country skiers in wintertime. For example, the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres <b>of</b> <b>trails</b> which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1943, the 3rd Battalion {{landed at}} Cape Torokina {{with the rest}} of 3rd Marines, just east of the Koromokina River. While {{resistance}} was extremely light, the rough surf and dense jungle (which in many places extended {{all the way to the}} water) resulted in numerous landing craft being lost or damaged beyond repair. For the next two weeks, the battalion helped construct a series <b>of</b> <b>trails</b> that linked the beachhead with the advancing units, and made supply much easier. On 16 November the battalion reached the Numa Numa Trail and began probing for Japanese units On 18 November after a sharp firefight near a Japanese roadblock the battalion recovered a Japanese map with valuable intelligence on Japanese defenses. From 19–21 November 3rd Battalion continued probing for Japanese units, which had been identified as elements of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, and engaging in sporadic firefights. In the lead-up to the Battle of Piva Forks, 3rd Battalion was able to seize critical high terrain that would give the Marines the advantage in the upcoming fight. The actual battle, from 22–26 November, saw some of the most vicious close combat experienced in the Pacific War as of that date. 3rd Battalion additionally suffered many casualties from unusually accurate Japanese mortar and artillery fire. Two days later, after 27 days of continuous action, 3rd Battalion was moved to a relatively quiet sector on the 3rd Division's flank where it remained for the remainder of the operation.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Tumor {{necrosis}} factor-related apoptosis¿inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo 2 L) exhibits potent antitumor {{activity on}} systemic administration in nonhuman primates without deleterious side effects for normal tissue. However, {{there is a}} controversy about the potential toxicity <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> on human hepatocytes. The use <b>of</b> different recombinant <b>TRAIL</b> forms only partially explains the contradicting reports on TRAIL sensitivity in primary human hepatocytes (PHH). Experimental Design: To clarify this issue, we comprehensively tested four different recombinant forms <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> for their apoptosis-inducing capacity on PHH obtained from a total of 55 human livers between day 1 and day 8 of in vitro culture. Results: One day after single-cell isolation, all but one recombinant form <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> [i. e., an untagged form <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> (TRAIL. 0) ] induced apoptosis in PHH. Apoptosis induction by TRAIL in these cells could only be fully inhibited by concomitant blockade <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> receptor 1 and TRAIL receptor 2. At day 4 of in vitro culture, when surrogate markers indicated optimal hepatocyte in vitro function, only high doses of cross-linked FLAG-TRAIL killed PHH whereas the other three recombinant TRAIL forms did not. Strikingly, cotreatment of day 4 PHH with cisplatin sensitized for TRAIL-induced apoptosis whereas 5 -fluorouracil, etoposide, gemcitabine, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin, which are commonly used {{in the treatment of}} gastrointestinal cancers, did not. Conclusion: Our data show that whereas TRAIL alone or together with selected chemotherapeutic drugs seems to be safe, the combination <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> with cisplatin is toxic to PHH...|$|R

5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through a canopy of hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) <b>of</b> <b>trails</b> start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E

40|$|TRAIL {{may be a}} {{potential}} anti-tumor agent due to its high killing specificity towards malignant cells and the low toxicity to normal cells. In MDS, TRAIL was able to induce apoptosis of dysplastic progenitor cells and inhibited the growth of CFU-GM colonies. The increased expression <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> in bone marrow cells from MDS patients suggests its contribution to the regulation <b>of</b> dysplastic hematopoiesis. <b>TRAIL</b> also induced apoptosis in hematopoietic cell lines and it was tested in vitro on normal human primary progenitor cells. Normal BFU-E and CFU-GM progenitor cells were resistant to TRAIL in methylcellulose cultures. To confirm the differential effects <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> on an in vivo model, a NON-SCID mice model was used and {{it was determined that}} TRAIL also did not effect normal human repopulating stem cells. Consequently, MDS, AML and CML cells were cultured in the presence of corresponding concentrations <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> and a significant inhibition of colony formation were observed compared to healthy controls. Apart <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> specific application in MDS and leukemia, the study <b>of</b> <b>TRAIL</b> may also have a therapeutic utility in other hematologic malignancies including lymphoma and myeloma.
