5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally unstable, and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result <b>of</b> <b>star</b> <b>formation.</b> A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E

5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations <b>of</b> <b>star</b> <b>formation,</b> galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
5|$|The rate <b>of</b> <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> in the Milky Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy {{producing}} {{only about}} one solar mass per year compared to 3–5 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy.

Should this continue, the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E

40|$|Galaxy mergers {{are capable}} <b>of</b> {{triggering}} both <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> and active galactic nuclei (AGN) and therefore may represent an important pathway in the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, correlated enhancements <b>of</b> merger-induced <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> and AGN triggering may be {{hidden by the}} variable conditions and timescales during which they occur. In Paper I, we presented evidence of merger-triggered AGN {{in a sample of}} six late-stage galaxy mergers (2 - 8 kpc nuclear separations). In this follow-up work, we use multi-wavelength Hubble Space Telescope imaging and additional archival data to examine their star-forming properties to test for merger-triggered <b>star</b> <b>formation,</b> and if it is correlated with SMBH growth. We find that the morphological asymmetries are correlated with enhanced specific <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> rates, indicating the presence <b>of</b> merger-triggered <b>star</b> <b>formation.</b> Additionally, the stellar populations become younger with increasing radius from the nucleus, indicating that the merger-induced <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> primarily occurs on global scales.

5|$|These {{injected}} elements ultimately {{enrich the}} molecular clouds {{that are the}} sites <b>of</b> <b>star</b> <b>formation.</b> Thus, each stellar generation has a slightly different composition, going from an almost pure mixture of hydrogen and helium to a more metal-rich composition. Supernovae are the dominant mechanism for distributing these heavier elements, which are formed in a star during its period of nuclear fusion. The different abundances of elements in the material that forms a star have important influences on the star's life, and may decisively influence the possibility of having planets orbiting it.|$|E
5|$|These two {{populations have}} been {{observed}} in many galaxies, especially massive elliptical galaxies.

Many scenarios have been suggested to explain these subpopulations, including violent gas-rich galaxy mergers, the accretion of dwarf galaxies, and multiple phases <b>of</b> <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> in a single galaxy.

5|$|Hydroxyl megamasers {{occur in}} the nuclear regions of LIRGs, and {{appear to be a}} marker in the stage of the {{formation}} of galaxies. As hydroxyl emission is not subject to extinction by interstellar dust in its host LIRG, hydroxyl masers may be useful probes of the conditions where star formation in LIRGs takes place. At redshifts of z ~ 2, there are LIRG-like galaxies more luminous than the ones in the nearby universe. The observed relationship between the hydroxyl luminosity and far infrared luminosity suggests that hydroxyl megamasers in such galaxies may be tens to hundreds of times more luminous than observed hydroxyl megamasers.

5|$|The {{formation}} of globular clusters remains a poorly understood phenomenon {{and it remains}} uncertain whether the stars in a globular cluster form in a single generation or are spawned across multiple generations {{over a period of}} several hundred million years. In many globular clusters, most of the stars are at approximately the same stage in stellar evolution, suggesting that they formed at about the same time. However, the star formation history varies from cluster to cluster, with some clusters showing distinct populations of stars. An example of this is the globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that exhibit a bimodal population. During their youth, these LMC clusters may have encountered giant molecular clouds that triggered a second round <b>of</b> <b>star</b> <b>formation.</b> This star-forming period is relatively brief, compared to the age of many globular clusters.|$|E
5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect {{their potential for}} habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are the location <b>of</b> <b>star</b> <b>formation,</b> but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a spiral arm, it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.|$|E
5|$|Hoag's Object, located 600 {{million light-years}} from Earth, {{is a member}} of the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies. The outer ring is largely {{composed}} of young blue stars while the core is made up of older yellow stars. The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a barred spiral galaxy whose arms had velocities too great to keep the galaxy's coherence and therefore detached. Arp 220 is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy, Arp 220 is somewhat closer than Hoag's Object at 250 million light-years from Earth. It consists of two large spiral galaxies in the process of colliding with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive star formation throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more than a billion stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies' core. Another interacting galaxy pair, albeit in an earlier stage, consists of the galaxies NGC 5953 and NGC 5954. In this case, both are active galaxies, with the former a Seyfert 2 galaxy and the latter a LINER-type galaxy. Both are undergoing a burst <b>of</b> <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> triggered by the interaction.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{evolution of}} interstellar clouds in Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) {{in the context}} <b>of</b> their observed <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> histories. The Local Group dSphs generally experienced initial bursts <b>of</b> <b>star</b> <b>formations</b> in their formation epochs (∼ 15 Gyr ago), when hot gas originating from the supernovae can make the cold interstellar clouds evaporate. We find that the maximum size of evaporating cloud is 10 pc. Thus, clouds larger than 10 pc can survive during the initial <b>star</b> <b>formation.</b> These surviving clouds {{can contribute to the}} second <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> to produce "intermediate-age (∼ 3 [...] 10 Gyr ago) stellar populations. " Assuming that collisions between clouds induce <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> and that the timescale <b>of</b> the second <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> is a few Gyr, we estimate the total mass of the clouds. The total mass is about 10 ^ 4 M_, which is 1 [...] 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the typical stellar mass of a present dSph. This implies that the initial <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> is dominant over the second <b>star</b> <b>formation,</b> which is broadly consistent with the observed <b>star</b> <b>formation</b> histories.
