After describing working conditions in the sector, we present the main characteristics of logistics struggles.

40|$|Most {{requirements}} engineering (RE) {{research and practice}} embodies a philosophy that we will call abstractionism, which involves the building of simplified models of domains of discourse and proposed systems. Abstractionists make much use of formal models, such as goal dependency networks.

Contextualists use qualitative methods to uncover and help interpret these particularities. In this paper, we analyze {{what it would mean}} to combine the best features of abstractionism and contextualism, and we ground <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> illustration of abstractionist and contextualist thinking about RE through goal refinement (GR).

40|$|How can social {{psychological}} research {{contribute to}} the development of increasingly powerful marital therapies? This question is of interest to both social psychologists and clinical researchers. The natural partnership between social and clinical psychology has a long past (cf. Morton Prince and Floyd Allport’s establishment of Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology in 1921) and has been reiterated on many occasions (e. g., Brehm, 1976; Kanfer & Scheft, 1988; Snyder & Forsyth, 1991 among many others). However, in the marital area it is a partnership that has been strained for several years by the view of many marital therapy researchers that theory may be irrelevant to the advancement of treatment efficacy. Because the partnership between social psychology and marital therapy research is one that neither side can afford to abandon, it is prudent to examine this view carefully in terms of its origins, various forms, and accuracy. Agenda and Rationale The chapter begins by situating <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> broader literature on the interface between social and clinical psychology.

40|$|Problem: In {{society of}} today {{corporate}} competence {{is an important}} factor for survivor and development. IT is developing rapidly and can not be ignored by companies. Then need for people with IT-competence is conquent increasing. A survey of corporate IT-competence is therefore of interest for companies as well as for local authorities. To determine the IT competence within an organisation, this competence has to be measurable. Therefore, it is necessary to define the concept of IT competence. In agreement with our principal, we are focusing on the manufacturing industry. Purpose: To develop a measuring instrument which can be used to survey the IT competence within a manufacturing sector. Method: Our development of the measuring instrument is divided into four steps. In the first step, we have made a definition of IT competence, relevant literature and research. This definition is used in the second step, where we connect <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> matrix <b>in</b> order to illustrate our reasoning regarding IT competence. In the third step, and based this discussion, we are outlining questions, which all together form the measuring instrument itself. In the last step, we deal with the obscurities and ideas for improvement that have arisen through the test investigation along with our own reflections about what could have been done better. Conclusion: We are using the ideas for improvement to change the measuring instrument. When all the changes have been made, the final measuring instrument has emerged, which means our assignment is completed. Based on our studies, we can establish {{that it is possible to}} measure the IT competence within an organisation, and thus, to survey the IT competence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> local authority...|$|R
30|$|The {{phase-shift}} (or phase) of the neuronal voltage {{response to}} subthreshold oscillatory input currents has received less attention that the corresponding amplitude response [11, 14, 29]. This {{despite the fact}} that phases are expected to play <b>a</b> major role <b>in</b> determining the synchronization properties of neuronal networks [30].

We use the term phase-resonance to refer to the ability of neurons to exhibit a zero-phase response to oscillatory inputs at a non-zero (phase-resonant) frequency. The resonant and phase-resonant frequencies do not generally coincide [29] for neuronal models (they do so for circuits in parallel but not for circuits in series as neuronal models are).

40|$|First paragraph: What {{happens when}} (so-called) {{analytic}} philosophy is brought {{face to face}} with (so-called) continental philosophy? In its present form, this question is too nebulous to deserve serious attention, since any answer that achieves more than unhelpful over-generalization will depend on which particular lines of thought within these two great philosophical traditions are selected to represent them. So we need to replace our opening question with one that limits the range of views under consideration, and is correspondingly more tractable. Here goes. What happens when scientifically oriented philosophy of mind in the analytic tradition is brought {{face to face with}} phenomenological thought in the continental tradition? Given that both these modes of inquiry seek to investigate human experience, one might reasonably think that there must be some sort of overlap between them. So what happens when they are brought together? Do we end up with a meeting of minds or a clashing of heads? Is it a case of friends reunited or of mortal combat? Is there any prospect that the interactions in question will provide the platform for a productive overcoming of the apparent divisions that are standardly thought to separate the two traditions? These are the programmatic questions that ultimately concern us in this paper. To anchor <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> concrete issue, we propose to address them by way of a significant challenge that confronts research in artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive science.

Also, we assume that we are provided with a black box, such that given any two points x and y, we can compute the distances dM(x, y) in constant time. For example of a metric, IR 2 with the regular euclidean distance is a metric space. Another standard example is a graph G with non-negative weights ω(·) defined on the edges, and let dG(x, y) denote the shortest path (under the given weights) between any x, y ∈ V(G).

It is important {{to take into account}} the phenomenon of dangerous irrelevance: over long times or large field ranges, physics can become sensitive to higher scales than the input energies. This pertains in inflationary cosmology (and possibly other aspects of horizon physics). String theory also contributes to our understanding of observational constraints and search strategies at the level of low energy field theory. We illustrate this with a current example concerning a new form of non-Gaussianity generated by very massive degrees of freedom coupling to the inflaton. New constraints on such fields and couplings can be obtained from existing data, increasing our empirical knowledge of the universe.

40|$|AbstractThe {{field of}} Participatory Design (PD) has greatly diversified {{and we see}} a broad {{spectrum}} of approaches and methodologies emerging. However, to foster its role in designing future interactive technologies, a discussion about accountability and rigour across this spectrum is needed. Rejecting the traditional, positivistic framework, we take inspiration from related fields such as Design Research and Action Research to develop interpretations of these concepts that are rooted in PD׳s own belief system. We argue that unlike in other fields, accountability and rigour are nuanced concepts that are delivered through debate, critique and reflection. A key prerequisite for having such debates is the availability of a language that allows designers, researchers and practitioners to construct solid arguments about the appropriateness of their stances, choices and judgements. To this end, we propose a “tool-to-think-with” that provides such a language by guiding designers, researchers and practitioners through a process of systematic reflection and critical analysis. The tool proposes four lenses to critically reflect on the nature of a PD effort: epistemology, values, stakeholders and outcomes. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> subsequent step, the coherence between the revealed features is analysed and shows whether they pull the project in the same direction or work against each other. Regardless of the flavour of PD, we argue that this coherence of features indicates the level of internal rigour of PD work and that the process of reflection and analysis provides the language to argue for it. We envision our tool to be useful at all stages of PD work: in the planning phase, as part of a reflective practice during the work, and as a means to construct knowledge and advance the field after the fact. We ground <b>our</b> theoretical <b>discussions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specific PD experience, the ECHOES project, to motivate the tool and to illustrate its workings...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In early 2006 the Irish Government {{announced}} a Pilot Initiative for Collaborative Projects from Industry-Led Networks, the latest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of policies on ‘business networking’ that {{date back to}} the mid- 1980 s. The purpose of this chapter is to describe and comment on those policies by reviewing the previous literature (both academic and policy documents). What we stress is that over the years and across different policies, the precise focus has varied, in terms of networking aims and objectives and networking forms. 1 We appreciate that there is considerable confusion <b>in</b> the wider <b>discussions</b> as to the meaning of ‘networks’ and ‘networking’ <b>in</b> <b>a</b> business context, and indeed this has been recognized before in analysis of Irish policy (for example, in Forfás (2004)). However, our approach is to avoid much of that confusion by simply centring discussion on those (inter-related and overlapping) areas of policy that the literature on Ireland consistently addresses when considering ‘business networking’, namely: ‘linkages’ between ‘local’ firms and transnational/multinational corporation (TNCs); training networks; research and development (R&D) networks; inter-firm cooperation processes more widely. These four topics are respectively the prime focus of successive Sections <b>in</b> this Chapter. <b>Our</b> <b>discussion</b> culminates <b>in</b> <b>a</b> consideration of the prospects for the successful impact of the 2006 Pilot. We welcome the initiative as seeming to represent <b>a</b> welcome seed-change <b>in</b> policy, and offer preliminary insights into how it might be evaluated. In doing so we introduce the notion of ‘public interest evaluation’ (PIE), intended to assess the extent to which public interests are served by a particular policy. Part of the idea is that whilst the Pilot is focused on (to some extent) measurable benefits to participating enterprises from networking projects, it might also be desirable to consider other effects on wider publics.

40|$|Why {{would an}} {{economic}} actor {{want to own}} an asset? The standard reason (applicable, say, to a share of stock) is that the asset is expected to yield <b>a</b> high return. <b>In</b> this note, however, we explore a second reason: to stop someone else from owning the asset. Obviously, this second reason applies only if the first party cares what the second would do with the asset (so a share of stock does not usually fit in this category, but might if one considered something like <b>a</b> proxy vote <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hostile takeover bid). When one party cares what another might do with an asset, we will say that “control rights ” to the asset matter. As will become clear, the key idea is actually the control right, not the asset. For example, we will see that control rights can be moved from one firm to another via contract, {{even if there is}} no physical asset to be moved. We will conduct much of <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> terms of <b>a</b> supply transaction involving an upstream party (supplier), a downstream party (user), and an asset (production equipment). The upstream party uses the asset to produce a good {{that can be used in}} the downstream party’s production process. If the upstream party owns the asset, we will call her an independent contractor (i. e., someone who works with her own tools) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} meaning and {{mechanics}} of belonging with a particular focus {{on the role of}} place and place-making. It explores the ways people come to achieve a sense of belonging with reference to recent theoretical treatments of place, territory, and mobility. We ground <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>in</b> analysis of <b>an</b> ethnographic case of Ecuadorian families who have migrated to Trentino in northern Italy. Most families miss the social relationships and places they left behind, but have decided to stay permanently in Italy, giving up the "myth of return" (Anwar 1979). Trentino offers more opportunities in term of employment, education, and access to services than Ecuador. Yet the decision to stay in Trentino is based on more than a simple assessment of economic advantage. Participants spoke of a slowly unfolding sense of belonging to Trentino, with strong affective dimensions born of a specific attachment to the very materiality of place in Trentino. This attachment may be regarded as an assemblage of social, material and affective resonances, experiences and resources, revealing something of the place and feeling of belonging. Hence, the Ecuadorian sense of belonging does not rely on an abstract conception of cultural affiliation, nor is it a purely psychological response. Rather, belonging accrues in particular practices and material attachments. We unpack these practices by documenting the work participants put into inhabiting an unfamiliar place as "their" place, {{while at the same time}} questioning the ontological status of space...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the study of higher order generalization. More specifically, we study the {{conditions}} under which the least higher order generalization exist and unique. The most closely related works are [10] [3]. [10] studied generalization <b>in</b> <b>a</b> restricted form of calculus of constructions [2], where terms are higher-order patterns, i. e., free variables can only apply to distinct bound variables. One problem of the generalization in higher-order patterns is the over generalization. For example, the least generalization of Aa and Ba would be a single variable x instead of fa or fx, where we suppose A, B, a are constants, and f, x are variables. Another problem of higher-order pattern is that it is inadequate to express some problems. In particular, it can not represent recursion in its terms. This motivated the study of generalization in M [3]. In M, free variables can apply to object term, which can contain constants and free variables in addition to bound variables. In this sense, M extends L. On the other hand, it also added some restrictions. One restriction is that M is situated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> simply typed calculus instead of calculus of constructions. Another restriction is M does not have type variables, hence it can only generalize two terms of the same type. The result is not satisfactory in that the least general generalization is unique up to substitution. That means any two terms beginning with functional variables are considered equal. Unlike the other approaches, which mainly put restrictions on the situated language, we mainly restrict the notion of the ordering between terms. <b>Our</b> <b>discussion</b> is situated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> restricted form of the language 2 [1]...|$|R
