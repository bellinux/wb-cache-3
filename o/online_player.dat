5|$|Bounty Hunter: A new mode {{introduced}} in the game. If an <b>online</b> <b>player</b> creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E
5|$|The {{television}} {{version of}} the game {{was based on a}} popular online version from GSN's website. In this version, the <b>online</b> <b>player</b> has five minutes to make as many hands of 21 as they can using four columns. The player can play a card in any of their columns as long as the subsequent total is 21 or less; if the card cannot be played in any column, it must be discarded. Playing exactly five cards in a column earns the player a bonus, while the jacks of spades and clubs allow any column to be cleared no matter what.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to make the game online-only was {{based in part on}} the success of Age of Empires II and the popularity of its online integration with MSN Gaming Zone. Since <b>online</b> <b>player</b> interaction through the game was made a priority by the studio, two iterations of the game had to be created; a server version and a client version. This resulted in a heavily modified version of the BANG engine used in previous games of the series, along with requiring large amounts of additional server code and infrastructure to be implemented. Excluding the tools, Age of Empires Online contains over 1.2 million lines of code.|$|E

500|$|The {{series has}} been reissued many times for various markets, and was {{eventually}} shown {{on television and}} posted on the Internet. Four-volume VHS versions were released in France and Italy in 1996: the French version (also called [...] ) was dubbed by Chinkel and released by Dynamic Visions (now known as Dybex), and the Italian (...) was released by Dynamic Italia (now Dynit). Toei re-released the entire series on DVD on May 21, 2004 as the New Cutie Honey Complete Pack. The release included a drama CD called [...] based on a script for an unfilmed ninth episode. ADV reissued the series on two DVD collections in November and December 2000, as a single two-disc Essential Anime edition on May 25, 2004, and on a three-DVD bundle with the Kekkō Kamen OVA in April 2008. The series was published on two DVDs in the United Kingdom, released on September 20 and November 15, 2004, by ADV Films UK. Madman Entertainment followed with a two-DVD collection, released in Australia on February 2, 2007 and in New Zealand on March 14.

2500|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} features {{that appeared to be}} absent from the release version of No Man's Sky was its multiplayer capabilities. Hello Games had stated during development that No Man's Sky would include multiplayer elements, though the implementation would be far from traditional methods as one would see in a massive multiplayer online game, to the point where Murray has told players to not think of No Man's Sky as a multiplayer game. Because {{of the size of the}} game's universe, Hello Games estimated that more than 99.9% of the planets would never be explored by players, and that the likelihood of meeting another player through chance encounters is nearly zero. Murray had stated in a 2014 interview that No Man's Sky would include a matchmaking system that is similar to that used for Journey when such encounters do occur; each <b>online</b> <b>player</b> would have an [...] "open lobby" [...] that any players in their in-universe proximity would enter and leave. This approach was envisioned to provide [...] "cool moments" [...] for players as they encounter each other, but not meant to support gameplay like player versus environment or fully cooperative modes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background and aims: With {{the growing}} number of virtual sites and easy access to them, as well as {{increasing}} popularity of the game, online poker could foster addiction. The aim of the current inquiry was to gauge susceptibility to behavioural addiction in online and traditional poker <b>players.</b> Methods: Ninety-six <b>online</b> poker <b>players</b> and 35 traditional players were tested {{on the basis of the}} “Components model” for addiction (Griffiths, 2005). Using a Likert scale, ratings on six components were examined: salience, conflict, mood modification, withdrawal symptoms, tolerance, and relapse. Results: The traditional players scored higher than <b>online</b> <b>players</b> on measures of conflict, mood modification, and relapse. While none of the traditional players were at risk, the majority of them (94. 7 %) were symptomatic. Two <b>online</b> <b>players</b> were at risk, 67. 7 % symptomatic and 30. 2 % asymptomatic. No significant correlations have emerged between the amount and history of poker playing and the addiction scores. Conclusions: The current findings suggest that most traditional players are prone to behavioural addiction while the majority of the <b>online</b> <b>players</b> are also symptomatic...|$|R
