40|$|Visual {{elements}} of food products {{can play an}} important role in determining food choice through shaping the attributes perception of consumers. Symbols and logos have the role of conveying information, but they can be interpreted in different ways. The product used as a case study is Extra-Virgin Olive Oil. The elements tested are: color of the bottle, sensory quality claims, <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> <b>logos,</b> country of origin (COO), and cold processing. An online questionnaire was completed by a sample of Dutch and Italian consumers in order to have cross-national results. Consumers' healthiness perception toward packaging alternatives with combinations of these elements were related to consumer traits through a contingent ranking method. Healthiness perception was enhanced by elements on the label such as: organic production, COO and by traits of the consumers such as familiarity and sustainability concern; while it was lowered by sensory indications of pungent properties. Somewhat unexpectedly, the color of container was the only element differently interpreted by the two nationalities. Practical applications: Most of the packaging elements were perceived similarly by the Dutch and Italian consumers, this suggests that there is no need to create different labels for products sold in different countries. The exception relies in the indication to use dark bottles for products sold in Italy and transparent for products sold in The Netherlands. Pungent features, even if tied with superior healthy properties, are preferred by a small share of consumers. Label and packaging can be used to better communicate the healthiness of the products, so indicating the origin and the organic production can be useful for companies, regardless of the country in which they operate. A positive trend of preference toward olive oil in emerging consuming countries, as The Netherlands, is expected, as the use of this product is spreading within the population as healthy concerns about diet is becoming increasingly important...|$|E

40|$|<b>Organic</b> <b>production</b> {{is carried}} out under an {{extensive}} regulatory setup because organic products are sold as value-added products with certified organic labelling in developed countries. Production is strictly monitored at every step in <b>production</b> chain. <b>Organic</b> <b>production</b> apart from being eco-friendly offers higher net returns per unit area compared to conventional agriculture. <b>Organic</b> <b>production</b> uses traditional tillage systems, crop rotations, crop residues, animal manures, legumes, green manures, off-farm organic wastes, mineral bearing rocks, and biological pest and weed control to maintain soil productivity. Thus, an organic farm should be a self contained system of production with minimal dependence on external inputs. Those farms having dairy {{as one of the}} active components will have to convert to organic livestock management so that manures supplied are as per requirements for <b>organic</b> <b>production.</b> The dairy products can also be certified organic to fetch higher prices. Organic farming is a highly labour intensive enterprise. Some of the major organic accreditation agencies are IFOAM (International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements), FiBL, Demeter and many more. APEDA has also developed national standards for <b>organic</b> <b>production.</b> Indian farmers face many challenges in adoption of certified <b>organic</b> <b>production.</b> Some of the important <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> requirements as per national standards for <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> have been developed by APEDA.

The results of this study showed that <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> is not dependent on conventional production. Education was found to be positively correlated to <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> and consumption while income actually had an opposite effect. <b>Organic</b> <b>production</b> and consumption were also linked to the political liberalness of a state.

40|$|Money {{is usually}} {{one of the}} strongest reasons {{influencing}} decision making when choosing between <b>organic</b> and conventional <b>production</b> or usage, both in case of producers and decision makers of municipalities. The results of the survey directed to organic producers in Finland implied that the contribution to profitability of organic farming would be {{the most effective way to}} get more farmers to make the decision to convert from conventional to <b>organic</b> <b>production.</b> Naturally there are also many other reasons that affect the decision to make the conversion, for example environmental and health issues. According to the survey targeted to municipalities’ decision makers, municipalities would use more organic products if they had more financial resources in use. The model calculations showed that the economic impacts of <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> in Finland are already meaningful and the impacts will increase while the share of <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> rises. However, the increase in <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> would lead to minor negative economic effects as the share of conventional production would simultaneously decrease.

40|$|Aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} the effects of turning from conventional to <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> systems on the reproductive performance of native Romanian Turcana sheep breed reared for lamb-meat production under highlands conditions.

40|$|The article {{examines}} the current state and prospects of development of the national regulatory system {{in the sphere of}} <b>organic</b> agricultural <b>production.</b> It is shown that the existing state control system of <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> in Ukraine, built {{on the basis of the}} combined (public-private) European model, tends to be rather complicated and entangled, while the powers and responsibilities of the state authorities are too dispersed and the procedures of conversion to <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> and its certification are not clearly determined.
