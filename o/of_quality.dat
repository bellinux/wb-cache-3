40|$|A notable {{way that}} social change affects {{personal}} <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life would {{rely on the}} person’s experience with social change. This experience may influence societal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work life, which may in turn affect personal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. Additionally, the experience of social change is possibly less detrimental to personal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life later {{in the presence of}} higher existing personal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. These influences over time become transparent through a three-wave panel study of 531 working people in Hong Kong, China. Findings show that although social change experienced did not generally impair subsequent <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life, it tended to be more detrimental to the person with lower <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life before. In addition, social change experienced tended to erode societal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work life experienced, which appeared to be predictors <b>of</b> personal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. Hence, there are possible ways for social change to predict personal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B.
