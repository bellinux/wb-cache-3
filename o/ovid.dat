5|$|According to <b>Ovid,</b> Myrrha was the {{daughter}} of King Cinyras and Queen Cenchreis of Cyprus. It is stated that Cupid was not to blame for Myrrha's incestuous love for her father, Cinyras. <b>Ovid</b> further comments that hating one's father is a crime, but Myrrha's love was a greater crime. <b>Ovid</b> therefore blamed it on the Furies.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route36, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Owego to Seneca Falls via <b>Ovid.</b> From <b>Ovid</b> north to Seneca Falls, Route36 followed {{what is now}} NY414 (via NY96 and County Route148 or CR148 in Romulus). The portion of modern NY414 between Watkins Glen and <b>Ovid</b> became Route45 on June16, 1911; however, the route was realigned one year later to use what is now NY96A from Lodi to Interlaken instead. When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Owego–Interlaken and Ovid–Romulus segments of legislative Route36 became part of NY15, which continued northwest from Romulus to Rochester. From Interlaken to <b>Ovid,</b> NY15 initially followed the post-1912 alignment of legislative Route45 to Lodi and the pre-1912 routing of Route45 to <b>Ovid.</b>|$|E

5|$|The most {{complete}} and extant {{rendering of the}} story of Philomela, Procne, and Tereus can be found in Book VI of the Metamorphoses of the Roman poet <b>Ovid</b> (Publius Ovidius Naso) (43 BC – AD 17/18), where the story reaches its full development during antiquity. It is likely that <b>Ovid</b> relied upon Greek and Latin sources that were available in his era such as the Bibliotheca of Pseudo-Apollodorus (2nd century BC), or sources that are no longer extant or exist today only in fragments—especially Sophocles' tragic drama Tereus (5th century BC).|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} Christianity did not curb {{the popularity of}} the myths. With the rediscovery of classical antiquity in the Renaissance, the poetry of <b>Ovid</b> became a major influence on the imagination of poets, dramatists, musicians and artists.* L. Burn, Greek Myths, 75 From the early years of Renaissance, artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, portrayed the Pagan subjects of Greek mythology alongside more conventional Christian themes. Through the medium of Latin and the works of <b>Ovid,</b> Greek myth influenced medieval and Renaissance poets such as Petrarch, Boccaccio and Dante in Italy.|$|E
5|$|While Ovid's {{retelling of}} the myth is the more famous version of the story, he had several ancient sources on which to rely before he {{finished}} the Metamorphoses in A.D. 8. Many of these sources were doubtless available to <b>Ovid</b> during his lifetime but have been lost or come to us at present only in fragments. In his version, <b>Ovid</b> recast and combined many elements from these ancient sources. Because his is the most complete, lasting version {{of the myth}}, it {{is the basis for}} many later works.|$|E

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper will}} seek to explain the popularity of <b>Ovid's</b> Heroides in Sweden of the late 18 th century.

40|$|<b>Ovid’s</b> rededication of the Fasti to Germanicus, and its {{possible}} connection with Germanicus’ Latin ‘translation’ of Aratus’ Phaenomena, is worth further consideration. This thorny issue {{is important to}} our understanding of Germanicus’ presentation in <b>Ovid’s</b> poetry. If a connection can be made, it adds a more personal dimension to his panegyrical passages, and to his choice of Germanicus as a potential patron, even if this was not in itself <b>Ovid’s</b> primary reason for composing his calendrical, astrological confection. Furthermore, our understanding of Germanicus’ reputation during his lifetime would be altered significantly, particularly in terms of his political and poetic identity, independent of his role in the schematic tableaux of the domus Augusta. The astrological elements of <b>Ovid’s</b> treatment of Germanicus in his exilic poetry may have been included partly to draw attention to <b>Ovid’s</b> consciousness of Germanicus’ apparent personal interest in astrology, as well as being part of a wider trend of Callimachean astral panegyric which was applied to the entire domus...|$|R
