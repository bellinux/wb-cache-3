500|$|Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett {{approached}} Maxwell [...] "out of the blue" [...] {{and wanted}} to join the band. Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out {{and the search for}} a new drummer began. The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music {{after the death of his}} brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18-month hiatus: [...] "It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be apart of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [...] and Tom , they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?' First couple <b>of</b> <b>times,</b> <b>I</b> told them, 'No, I don't think I'm ready to do this yet.' And they just were real persistent, they kept calling me. And one night, I had been drinking some red wine and listening to some KISS on 12" [...] vinyl record and I said, 'You know what, lets take a shot at this, lets see what happens.'" ...|$|E
500|$|With Somerset runners-up in the English 2009 Twenty20 Cup, Trescothick and his county {{travelled}} to India {{to partake}} in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. Though both Kieswetter and Hildreth were anticipated as successes, it was Trescothick who {{was described as}} having [...] "been in sparkling form all season" [...] and began the tournament under media scrutiny given his previous difficulties playing on tour. There was much speculation regarding any [...] "recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006", as {{this was to be}} his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the BBC World Service which read [...] "I know the risk and I know what happens when it goes wrong. In the last couple <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> have tried to go on tour it's failed, so of course ... Let's try and break the tradition of what has happened over the last few times... I can only try. It's a big competition for the players and for the club. I have got to try and make it happen." [...] Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was dismissed for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, [...] "after offering a fleeting glimpse of his talent" [...] according to ESPNcricinfo.|$|E

2500|$|Other former {{students}} {{took a different}} view, some citing experiences of anti-Semitism. Graham Fraser, [...] The Globe and Mails Washington Bureau Chief, who attended UCC between 1960 and 1964, recalled: [...] "Anti-Semitism was generally an unspoken undercurrent at UCC, but a couple <b>of</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> witnessed overt anti-Semitism.... Before 1960, Toronto was a pretty narrow, close-minded, little Victorian town and Upper Canada College reflected that reality." [...] At the same time, Peter C.

In opera you can combine the two and, apart from Domingo, there aren't that many singers who are good actors." [...] He spent four years at his father's school in Reykjavík and then won a scholarship to the , or University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna, but left after six months to study privately with Professor Andrei Orlowitz in Copenhagen. For the next five years he spent two weeks in Denmark, then flew home to earn enough to pay the tuition and the airfares. He sang at funerals and weddings, appeared as Tony in West Side Story at the National Theatre in Reykjavík in 1995, and for five summers worked with disabled people. At the opera he was the toilet cleaner, the usher and the doorman. Recalling his father's advice about the hardships of a musical career, Garðar has commented: [...] "Even though he told me it was difficult, I still wanted to pursue this road. But looking back, you realise he was right, it is bloody difficult! Excuse the language." ...|$|E

40|$|Contemporary {{philosophy}} {{discussions on}} the nature <b>of</b> <b>time</b> begin with McTaggart, who introduces two ways of describing temporal relation between events: the A-series, focusing on the past, present and future, is about positions of time; and the B-series, which an event’s position in the series is described only {{in relation to other}} events: “earlier than,” “later than,” or “simultaneous with. ” Along with McTaggart’s objection to the reality <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> provide a detailed exposition of why change can be expressed within the A-series and why the A-series contains a contradiction. In addition, I demonstrate step by step that time does not flow from one moment to the next in the “B-series” <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> expound upon the concept to sketch the objective and subjective time perceptions from Kant’s logical perspectives. Then, by identifying objective and subjective temporal concept types, based on Smart’s and Sartre’s arguments regarding the incapability of applying physical reductionism on time and the absence of passage in human definitions <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> argue for a new approach in contemporary {{discussions on the}} predominantly subjective nature <b>of</b> <b>time...</b>|$|R
