40|$|Steady state {{dendritic}} cells (DC) {{found in}} non-lymphoid tissue sites under normal physiologic conditions play {{a pivotal role}} in triggering T cell responses upon immune provocation. CD 11 b+ and CD 103 + DC have received considerable attention in this regard. However, still unknown is whether such CD 11 b+ and CD 103 + DC even exist in the <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa,</b> and if so, what functions they have in shaping immune responses. We herein identified in the <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa</b> of normal wild-type (WT) and Flt 3 -/- mice the presence of a CD 11 b+ DC (i. e., CD 11 c+ MHCII+ CD 11 b+ CD 103 - F 4 / 80 + Sirp-a+). CD 103 + DC (i. e. CD 11 c+ MHCII+ CD 11 b low CD 103 + CD 8 a+ DEC 205 + Langerin+) were also present in WT, but not in Flt 3 -/- mice. These CD 103 + DC expressed high levels of Id 2 and Flt 3 mRNA; whereas CD 11 b+ DC expressed high Irf 4, Csfr, and Cx 3 cr 1 mRNA. Additionally, the functions of these DC differed in response to allergic immune provocation. This was assessed utilizing a previously validated model, which includes transferring specific populations of exogenous DC into the <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa</b> of ovalbumin (OVA) /alum-primed mice. Interestingly, in such mice, topical OVA instillation following engraftment of exogenous CD 11 b+ DC led to dominant allergic T cell responses and clinical signs of ocular allergy relative to those engrafted with CD 103 + DC. Thus, although CD 11 b+ and CD 103 + DC are both present in the normal <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa,</b> the CD 11 b+ DC subset plays a dominant role in a mouse model of ocular allergy...|$|E
40|$|Trachoma, {{caused by}} the {{intracellular}} bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), remains the world's leading preventable infectious cause of blindness. Recent attempts to develop effective vaccines rely on modified chlamydial antigen delivery platforms. As the mechanisms engaged in the pathology of the disease are not fully understood, designing a subunit vaccine specific to chlamydial antigens could improve safety for human use. We propose the delivery of chlamydia-specific antigens to the <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa</b> using particulate carriers, bacterial ghosts (BGs). We therefore characterized humoral and cellular immune responses after conjunctival and subcutaneous immunization with a N-terminal portion (amino acid 1 - 893) of the chlamydial polymorphic membrane protein C (PmpC) of Ct serovar B, expressed in probiotic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 bacterial ghosts (EcN BGs) in BALB/c mice. Three immunizations were performed at two-week intervals, and the immune responses were evaluated {{two weeks after the}} final immunization in mice. In a guinea pig model of ocular infection animals were immunized {{in the same manner as}} the mice, and protection against challenge was assessed two weeks after the last immunization. N-PmpC was successfully expressed within BGs and delivery to the <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa</b> was well tolerated without signs of inflammation. N-PmpC-specific mucosal IgA levels in tears yielded significantly increased levels in the group immunized via the conjunctiva compared with the subcutaneously immunized mice. Immunization with N-PmpC EcN BGs via both immunization routes prompted the establishment of an N-PmpC-specific IFNγ immune response. Immunization via the conjunctiva resulted in a decrease in intensity of the transitional inflammatory reaction in conjunctiva of challenged guinea pigs compared with subcutaneously and non-immunized animals. The delivery of the chlamydial subunit vaccine to the <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa</b> using a particulate carrier, such as BGs, induced both humoral and cellular immune responses.

For the study, 54 ewes were used. They were randomly divided into two groups: FAMACHA and chemical treatments. The ewes in the first group received selective treatment depending on the <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa</b> coloration (FAMACHA) and body condition score (BCS), while in the second group (chemical) all the animals remained under routine deworming every 30 days. Fecal nematode egg counts, proportion of third-stage trichostrongylid larvae, body condition, coloration of the <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa,</b> and packed cell volume in the ewes were determined, while in lambs only body weight (BW) was recorded. No significant differences (p> 0. 05) were observed in any of the studied variables between groups; however, the use of antiparasitic drugs was reduced during the experimental period in the FAMACHA group and no deaths of lambs or ewes were recorded. The results indicate that during the lactation of ewes, a strategy of selective treatments can be implemented without showing deterioration in major health and productive parameters of these animals. cub...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Immunoreactive {{lysozyme}} was readily detectable in canine histiocytic disorders including systemic histiocytosis, {{malignant histiocytosis}} and granulomatous panniculitis. Lysozyme was less reliable as a histiocytic marker in cutaneous histiocytoma; {{forty percent of}} these tumors were negative for lysozyme expression. The marked heterogeneity in lysozyme expression in cutaneous histiocytoma may indicate that a proportion of these tumors show relatively primitive histiocytic differentiation and do not express lysozyme. Alternatively, this same proportion may exhibit a phenotype akin to cutaneous Langerhans cells which do not contain lysozyme. Lysozyme was not detectable in the tumor cells in lymphomatoid granulomatosis, atypical cutaneous histio-cytoma, and histiocytic lymphosarcoma. Other evidence that these three disorders do not represent true his-tiocytic proliferative disorders is discussed. The potential value of immunoreactive lysozyme as a histiocytic marker in normal canine tissues was eval-uated in a previous paper. Lysozyme occurred within macrophages, although it was also found in monocytes, neutrophils, serous cells in exocrine glands associated with respiratory, alimentary and <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosae,</b> an...|$|R

The exocrine manifestations and systemic involvement significantly impact the patient’s perception of health-related quality of life.

40|$|Transmucosal drug {{administration}} across nasal, buccal, and <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosae</b> is noninvasive, eliminates hepatic first-pass metabolism and harsh environmental conditions, allows rapid onset, and further, mucosal surfaces are readily accessible. Generally, however, hydrophilic drugs, such as peptides and proteins, are poorly permeable across the epithelium, {{which results in}} insufficient bioavailability. Therefore, reversible modifications of epithelial barrier structure by permeation enhancers are required. Low molecular weight enhancers generally have physicochemical characteristics favoring their own absorption, whereas polymeric enhancers are not absorbed, and this minimizes the risk of systemic toxicity. The above considerations have warranted the present survey of the studies on polymeric transmucosal penetration-enhancers that {{have appeared in the}} literature during the last decade. Studies on intestinal permeation enhancers are also reviewed as they give information on the mechanism of action and safety of polymers. The synthesis and characterization of polymers, their effectiveness in enhancing the absorption of different drugs across different epithelium types, their mechanism of action and structure-efficacy relationship, and the relevant safety issues are reviewed. The active polymers are classified into: polycations (chitosan and its quaternary ammonium derivatives, poly-L-arginine (poly-L-Arg), aminated gelatin), polyanions (N-carboxymethyl chitosan, poly(acrylic acid)), and thiolated polymers (car-boxymethyl cellulose-cysteine, polycarbophil (PCP) -cysteine, chitosan-thiobutylami-dine, chitosan-thioglycolic acid, chitosan-glutathione conjugates) ...|$|R

Exposure to 1 -octen- 3 -ol, one of the known MVOCs, {{has been reported to}} reduce nasal patency and increase nasal lavage myeloperoxidase, eosinophil cationic proteins, and lysozymes in both experimental and field studies. We reported in a previous paper that 1 -octen- 3 -ol exposure at home is associated with mucosal symptoms. In this study, our aim was to investigate the relationship between asthma and allergies and MVOC exposure in single-family homes. The subjects were 624 inhabitants of 182 detached houses in six regions of Japan. Air samples were collected using diffusive samplers, and the concentrations of eight selected MVOCs were analyzed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in selected-ion-monitoring mode. Each inhabitant of each of the dwellings was given a self-administered questionnaire. Among the 609 subjects who answered all of the questions about allergies, history of the medical treatment for asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and allergic conjunctivitis within the preceding two years was 4. 8 %, 9. 9 %, 18. 2 %, and 7. 1 %, respectively. A significant association between 1 -octen- 3 -ol (per log 10 unit) and allergic rhinitis odds ratio (OR) : 4. 10, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 71 to 9. 80 and conjunctivitis (OR: 3. 54, CI: 1. 17 to 10. 7) was found after adjusting for age, sex, tobacco, wall-to-wall carpeting, signs of dampness, history of treatment for hay fever, and other potentially relevant environmental factors. No relationships were found between any MVOCs and asthma or atopic dermatitis after the adjustment. The levels of MVOCs and airborne fungi were only weakly correlated.

Being of fertile age, they were treated with oral contraceptives, which determined a marked increase in plasminogen levels. Moreover, a palpebral pseudomembrane stopped growing in one patient and disappeared completely in the other while on the estroprogestinic treatment. In patient n. 2, who also suffered from von Willebrand's disease, prior Cushing's disease induced an increase in both von Willebrand factor and plasminogen levels, which dropped after curative hypophysectomy. Genetic plasminogen study showed a 19 Lys>Glu mutation in a heterozygous state in the first proposita and in a homozygous state in the second proband. In addition, both index patients were homozygous for a new intron F- 14 T>G mutation, which was found to reduce the acceptor splicing site prediction score.

The count of adult nematodes (females and males) in the higher dose of FCT was similar to chemical treatment. Dose of 37. 5 mg kg− 1 of BW decreased the parasite infection and improved the lamb performance. Therefore, this dose {{could be used as}} a nutraceutic product in sheep production.

40|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of {{upper respiratory tract}} and ocular irritation is critical for identifying and remedying problems related to overexposure to volatile chemicals, {{as well as for}} establishing parameters of irritation useful for regulatory purposes. This paper (a) describes the basic anatomy and physiology of the human upper respiratory tract and <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa,</b> (b) discusses how airborne chemicals induce irritative sensations, and (c) reviews practical means employed for assessing such phenomena, including psychophysical (e. g., threshold and suprathreshold perceptual measures), physiological (e. g., cytology), electrophysiological (e. g., event-related potentials), and imaging (e. g., magnetic resonance imaging) techniques. Although traditionally animal models have been used as the first step in assessing such irritation, they are not addressed here since (a) there are numerous reviews available on this topic and (b) many rodents and rabbits are obligate nose breathers whose nasal passages differ considerably from those of humans, potentially limiting generalization of animal-based data to humans. A major goal of this compendium is to inform the reader of procedures for assessing irritation in humans and to provide information of value in the continued interpretation and development of empirical databases upon which future reasoned regulatory health decisions can be made...|$|E
40|$|Chitosan is {{a natural}} polycationic {{copolymer}} consisting of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine units. The polymer has valuable properties as a biomaterial because it {{is considered to be}} biocompatible, biodegradable and non-toxic. The purpose of this review article is to provide detailed information about thiolated chitosans which are gaining popularity because of their high mucoadhsiveness and extended drug release properties. The derivatization of the primary amino groups of chitosan with coupling reagents bearing thiol functions leads to the formation of thiolated chitosans. Various properties of chitosan are improved by the immobilization of thiol groups. Due to the formation of disulfide bonds with mucus glycoproteins, mucoadhesiveness is augmented. The permeation of paracellular markers through mucosa can be enhanced by utilizing thiolated instead of unmodified chitosan. Moreover, thiolated chitosans display in situ gelling features due to the pH-dependent formation of inter- as well as intra-molecular disulfide bonds. This latter process provides, strong cohesion and stability of carrier matrices, being based on thiolated chitosans. The in situ gel formation within the pH range of 5 to 6. 8 makes the application of thiolated chitosans on vaginal, nasal and <b>ocular</b> <b>mucosa</b> also possible. Thiolated chitosans can guarantee prolonged controlled release of embedded therapeutic ingredients...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{and genetic}} {{correlates}} of Chlamydia trachomatis infection were examined prospectively in 124 male and 361 female adolescents {{at high risk}} for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection. Seventy percent of subjects were African American, and 68 % had HIV- 1 infection. As expected, younger age (! 17 years), multiple sex partners (2), and prior chlamydial infection predicted chlamydial infection during a 6 – 56 -month follow-up period (,, and, respectively). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) Pp. 02 Pp. 02 Pp. 03 class II variant DQB 1 * 06 (mostly * 0602 and * 0603) was associated with chlamydial infection (49 % vs. 34 %; adjusted relative odds [RO], 1. 8;), as was HLA class I haplotype B* 44 -Cw* 04 (10 % vs. 4 %; RO, 3. 2;Pp. 005). DQB 1 * 06 was found in 9 (75 %) of 12 female adolescents with chlamydial pelvic inflammatoryPp. 009 disease. In contrast, sex, ethnicity, and HIV- 1 infection did not predict chlamydial infection. These findings suggest that antigen presentation in adaptive immune responses may serve as a major factor in effective control of C. trachomatis infection. The underlying mechanisms remain to be experimentally elucidated. Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bac-terial pathogen with clear tropism for epithelial cells in the <b>ocular</b> and genital <b>mucosa.</b> Chlamydial infection re-mains the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States, with an esti...|$|R
40|$|On {{behalf of}} the host-pathogen "arms race," a {{cutting-edge}} approach for elucidating genotype-phenotype relationships relies on the identification of positively selected loci involved in pathoadaptation. We studied the obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, for which same-species strains display a nearly identical core and pan genome, while presenting {{a wide range of}} tissue tropism and ecological success. We sought to evaluate the evolutionary patterns underlying species separation (divergence) and C. trachomatis serovar radiation (polymorphism) and to establish genotype-phenotype associations. By analyzing 60 Chlamydia strains, we detected traces of Muller's ratchet as a result of speciation and identified positively selected genes and codons hypothetically involved in the infection of different human cell types (e. g., columnar epithelial cells of <b>ocular</b> or genital <b>mucosae</b> and mononuclear phagocytes) and also events likely driving pathogenic and ecological success dissimilarities. In general, these genes code for proteins involved in immune response elicitation, proteolysis, and the subversion of host-cell functions, and also for proteins with unknown function(s). Several genes are potentially involved in more than one adaptive process, suggesting multiple functions or a distinct modus operandi for a specific function, and thus should be considered as crucial research targets. In addition, six of the nine genes encoding the putative antigen/adhesin polymorphic membrane proteins seem to be under positive selection along specific serovars, which sustains an essential biological role of this extra-large paralogue family in chlamydial pathobiology. This study provides insight into how evolutionary inferences illuminate ecological processes such as adaptation to different niches, pathogenicity, or ecological success driven by arms races...|$|R
40|$|Transmission of Chagas {{disease is}} {{realized}} through contamination of <b>ocular</b> conjunctiva, <b>mucosa</b> or skin with infected dejections eliminated by the insect vectors of Schizotrypanum cruzi (Triatoma infestans, Panstrongylus megistus and Rhodnius prolixus). The triatomid bugs live in holes and craks in the walls, in beds, behind trunks, etc. Found in primitive mud huts covered with thatched roofs, {{and so the}} human dwellers have many chances to contract the disease, reinfections being reasonably more to expect than a single inoculation. Experimental work reproducing those natural conditions is welcomed as some important features in the pathologic picture of the disease such as the extensive myocardial fibrosis seen in chronic cases are still incompletely known. Microscopic changes were studied in the heart muscle of seven Cebus monkeys infected by S. cruzi. This animal survives the acute stage {{of the disease and}} so is particularly suited to experiments of long duration in which several inoculations of S. cruzi are performed. Three different strains of S. cruzi isolated from acute cases of Chagas' disease were employed. One monkey was injected in the skin with infected blood and necropsied after 252 days. Two monkeys were three times, and one, eight times infected in skin, one of them with contaminated blood, and two with contaminated blood and dejections from infected bugs. The necropsies were performed after 35, 95 and 149 days. One monkey was three times inoculated through the intact ocular conjunctiva (one time with infected blood, two times with dejections from infected bugs), and one time through the wounded buccal mucosa, and necropsied after 134 days. Another monkey was six times inoculated, four times through the intact ocular conjunctiva (one time with contaminated blood, three times with dejections from infected bugs) and two times injected in the skin with infected blood, and necropsied after 157 days. Finally, another monkey was nine times inoculated, four times through the intact ocular conjunctiva (one time with infected blood, and three times with dejections from infected bugs), and five times injected in the skin (four times with contaminated blood, and one time with dejections from infected bugs), and necropsied after 233 days. The microscopic picture was uniform presenting, however, considerable individual variations, and was represented by diffuse interstitial myocarditis, frequently more (marked in the right ventricle base of the heart), accompanied by lymphatic stasis. The infiltration consists of macrophages, plasma cells and lymphocytes, the cellular reaction having sometimes a perivascular distribution, involving the auriculo-ventricular system of conduction, endocardium, epicardium and cardiac sympathetic gangliae. The loss of cardiac muscle fibers was always minimal. Leishmanial forms of S. cruzi in myocardial fibers are scanty and, in two cases, absent. Fatty necrosis in the epicardium was noted in two cases. Obliterative changes of medium-sized branches of coronary arteries (hypersensitivity reaction?) and multiple infarcts of the myocardium was found in one instance. The diffuse myocarditis induced by S. cruzi in several species of monkeys of the genus Cebus observed after 233 days (several inoculations) and 252 days (single inoculation) is not associated with disseminated fibrosis such as is reported in chronic cases of Chagas' disease. Definite capacity of reversion is another characteristic of the interstitial myocarditis observed in the series of Cebus monkeys here studied. The impression was gained that repeated inoculation with S. cruzi may influence the myocardial changes differently according to the period between the reinoculations. A short period after the first inoculation is followed by more marked changes, while long periods are accompanied by slight changes, which suggests an active immunisation produced by the first inoculation. More data are required, however before a definite statement is made on this subject considering that individual variations, the natural capacity of reversion of the interstitial myocarditis and the employement of more than a species of Cebus monkeys probably exerts influence also in the results here reported...|$|R
