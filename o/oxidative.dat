5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant <b>oxidative</b> stress in the mitochondria with high mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and <b>oxidative</b> stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. A vicious cycle was thought to occur, as <b>oxidative</b> stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further <b>oxidative</b> stress.|$|E
5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} <b>oxidative</b> stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of <b>oxidative</b> stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had no effect on aging.|$|E
5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is <b>oxidative</b> stress. Here, {{processes}} including <b>oxidative</b> phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide. These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oxidative</b> {{damage in}} DNA can cause cancer. Several {{antioxidant}} enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from <b>oxidative</b> stress. It {{has been proposed}} that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with DNA damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oxidative</b> {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is {{the metabolic}} pathway in which cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out <b>oxidative</b> phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Ustilago maydis is a {{pathogenic}} plant fungus {{that causes}} smut disease in maize and teosinte. Plants have evolved efficient defense systems against pathogenic microbes such as U. maydis. A rapid defense reaction after pathogen attack is the <b>oxidative</b> burst where the plant produces {{reactive oxygen species}} {{at the site of}} the attempted invasion. U. maydis can respond to the <b>oxidative</b> burst with an <b>oxidative</b> stress response, regulated by the gene YAP1. The response protects U. maydis from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen’s virulence. Furthermore, U. maydis has a well-established recombinational DNA repair system which acts during mitosis and meiosis. The system may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host plant’s <b>oxidative</b> defensive response to infection.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against <b>oxidative</b> stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} <b>oxidative</b> phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide. As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.|$|E
5|$|Because {{they are}} {{strongly}} <b>oxidative,</b> many oxygen-xenon compounds are toxic; {{they are also}} explosive (highly exothermic), breaking down to elemental xenon and diatomic oxygen (O2) with much stronger chemical bonds than the xenon compounds.|$|E
5|$|Increased dietary {{selenium}} {{reduces the}} effects of mercury toxicity, although it is effective only at low to modest doses of mercury. Evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms of mercury toxicity includes the irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse <b>oxidative</b> damage in brain and endocrine tissues. An antioxidant, selenoneine, which is derived from selenium and {{has been found to}} be present in the blood of bluefin tuna, is the subject of scientific research regarding its possible roles in inflammatory and chronic diseases, methylmercury detoxification, and <b>oxidative</b> damages.|$|E
5|$|<b>Oxidative</b> {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. In many of these cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of <b>oxidative</b> stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} CO are {{beneficial}} and enzymes exist that produce it {{at times of}} <b>oxidative</b> stress. Drugs are being developed to introduce small amounts of CO during certain kinds of surgery, these drugs are called carbon monoxide-releasing molecules.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{released}} by <b>oxidative</b> phosphorylation is high, compared with the amount produced by anaerobic fermentation. Glycolysis produces only 2 ATP molecules, but somewhere between 30 and 36 ATPs are produced by the <b>oxidative</b> phosphorylation of the 10 NADH and 2 succinate molecules made by converting one molecule of glucose to carbon dioxide and water, while each cycle of beta oxidation of a fatty acid yields about 14 ATPs. These ATP yields are theoretical maximum values; in practice, some protons leak across the membrane, lowering the yield of ATP.|$|E
5|$|The main {{difference}} between eukaryotic and prokaryotic <b>oxidative</b> phosphorylation is that bacteria and archaea use many different substances to donate or accept electrons. This allows prokaryotes to grow under {{a wide variety}} of environmental conditions. In E. coli, for example, <b>oxidative</b> phosphorylation can be driven by a large number of pairs of reducing agents and oxidizing agents, which are listed below. The midpoint potential of a chemical measures how much energy is released when it is oxidized or reduced, with reducing agents having negative potentials and oxidizing agents positive potentials.|$|E
5|$|To {{balance the}} <b>oxidative</b> state, {{plants and animals}} {{maintain}} complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as glutathione and enzymes (e.g., catalase and superoxide dismutase) produced internally or the dietary antioxidants: vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E.|$|E
5|$|UV damage, alkylation/methylation, X-ray {{damage and}} <b>oxidative</b> damage are {{examples}} of induced damage. Spontaneous damage can include {{the loss of a}} base, deamination, sugar ring puckering and tautomeric shift.|$|E
5|$|While {{antioxidant}} supplementation {{is widely}} used in attempts to prevent the development of cancer, antioxidants may interfere with cancer treatments, since the environment of cancer cells causes high levels of <b>oxidative</b> stress, making these cells more susceptible to the further <b>oxidative</b> stress induced by treatments. As a result, by reducing the redox stress in cancer cells, antioxidant supplements (and pharmaceuticals) could decrease the effectiveness of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. On the other hand, other reviews have suggested that antioxidants could reduce side effects or increase survival times.|$|E
25|$|Elevated copper levels {{inside a}} cell causes <b>oxidative</b> stress and the {{generation}} of hydrogen peroxide. Under these conditions, copper participates in the so-called Fenton-type reaction — a chemical reaction causing <b>oxidative</b> damage to cells.|$|E
25|$|Memory {{capabilities}} decline with age, {{evident in}} human degenerative {{diseases such as}} Alzheimer's disease, which is accompanied by an accumulation of <b>oxidative</b> damage. Current studies demonstrate that the accumulation of ROS can decrease an organism's fitness because <b>oxidative</b> damage is a contributor to senescence. In particular, the accumulation of <b>oxidative</b> damage may lead to cognitive dysfunction, as demonstrated in a study in which old rats were given mitochondrial metabolites and then given cognitive tests. Results showed that the rats performed better after receiving the metabolites, suggesting that the metabolites reduced <b>oxidative</b> damage and improved mitochondrial function. Accumulating <b>oxidative</b> damage can then affect the efficiency of mitochondria and further increase the rate of ROS production. The accumulation of <b>oxidative</b> damage {{and its implications for}} aging depends on the particular tissue type where the damage is occurring. Additional experimental results suggest that <b>oxidative</b> damage is responsible for age-related decline in brain functioning. Older gerbils were found to have higher levels of oxidized protein in comparison to younger gerbils. Treatment of old and young mice with a spin trapping compound caused a decrease in the level of oxidized proteins in older gerbils but did not have an effect on younger gerbils. In addition, older gerbils performed cognitive tasks better during treatment but ceased functional capacity when treatment was discontinued, causing oxidized protein levels to increase. This led researchers to conclude that oxidation of cellular proteins is potentially important for brain function.|$|E

25|$|People with G6PD {{deficiency}} {{are therefore}} {{at risk of}} hemolytic anemia in states of <b>oxidative</b> stress. <b>Oxidative</b> stress can result from infection and from chemical exposure to medication and certain foods. Broad beans, e.g., fava beans, contain high levels of vicine, divicine, convicine and isouramil, all of which create oxidants.|$|E
25|$|La2O3 {{has been}} {{examined}} for the <b>oxidative</b> coupling of methane.|$|E
25|$|Following her discovery, Bernheim {{predicted}} that tyramine oxidase {{was important for}} the <b>oxidative</b> deamination of tyramine, thus allowing for the detoxification of extra amines absorbed from the intestines. This prediction was proven correct by later research, which showed that patients treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors had toxic reactions to the consumption of food rich in tyramine. However, subsequent research indicated that the enzyme {{was involved in the}} <b>oxidative</b> deamination of additional monoamine neurotransmitters, including catecholamines and histamine, as shown in the figure. The enzyme was eventually renamed as monoamine oxidase, indicating that the enzyme catalyzed the <b>oxidative</b> deamination of the class of monoamines.|$|E
25|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown that the Plasmodium falciparum is very {{sensitive}} to <b>oxidative</b> damage. This is the basis for another theory, that is that the genetic defect confers resistance due to the fact that the G6PD-deficient host has a higher level of <b>oxidative</b> agents that, while generally tolerable by the host, are deadly to the parasite.|$|E
25|$|There is {{significant}} evidence that <b>oxidative</b> stress {{plays a role}} in schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Due to its <b>oxidative</b> {{instability}} it {{is possible}} to add antioxidants to improve stability.|$|E
25|$|It {{was shown}} that {{endogenous}} sulfur dioxide {{plays a role}} in diminishing an experimental lung damage caused by oleic acid. Endogenous sulfur dioxide lowered lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, <b>oxidative</b> stress and inflammation during an experimental lung damage. Conversely, a successful lung damage caused a significant lowering of endogenous sulfur dioxide production, and an increase in lipid peroxidation, free radical formation, <b>oxidative</b> stress and inflammation. Moreover, blockade of an enzyme that produces endogenous SO2 significantly increased the amount of lung tissue damage in the experiment. Conversely, adding acetylcysteine or glutathione to the rat diet increased the amount of endogenous SO2 produced and decreased the lung damage, the free radical formation, <b>oxidative</b> stress, inflammation and apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Formaldehyde {{inhalation}} {{has also}} shown to cause <b>oxidative</b> stress and inflammation in animals. Mice studied over an exposure to a high dose of formaldehyde (3ppm), showed increased NO levels in plasma. This result suggests that FA inhalation either decreased NO production or increased NO scavenging, which may be an anti-stress mechanism in the body. Formaldehyde inhalation changes the sensitivity of immune system, which influences <b>oxidative</b> stress.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin E is a {{membrane}} antioxidant {{that protects}} against <b>oxidative</b> damage and also provides protection against harmful UV rays.|$|E
25|$|Acetaldehyde {{may also}} {{influence}} glutathione peroxidase, a key antioxidant enzyme, {{and increases the}} susceptibility to <b>oxidative</b> stress.|$|E
25|$|Muscle strength, {{and stamina}} for {{sustained}} physical effort, decline in function with age in humans and other species. Skeletal muscle is a tissue composed largely of multinucleated myofibers, elements {{that arise from}} the fusion of mononucleated myoblasts. Accumulation of DNA damage with age in mammalian muscle {{has been reported in}} at least 18 studies since 1971. We will mention here only two of the more recent studies in rodents plus one in humans. Hamilton et al. reported that the <b>oxidative</b> DNA damage 8-OHdG accumulates in heart and skeletal muscle (as well as in brain, kidney and liver) of both mouse and rat with age. In humans, increases in 8-OHdG with age were reported for skeletal muscle. Catalase is an enzyme that removes hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species, and thus limits <b>oxidative</b> DNA damage. In mice, when catalase expression is increased specifically in mitochondria, <b>oxidative</b> DNA damage (8-OHdG) in skeletal muscle is decreased and lifespan is increased by about 20%. These findings suggest that mitochondria are a significant source of the <b>oxidative</b> damages contributing to aging.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxidative</b> stress {{following}} PAH exposure {{could also}} result in cardiovascular disease by causing inflammation, {{which has been}} recognized as an important factor in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Biomarkers of exposure to PAHs in humans have been associated with inflammatory biomarkers that are recognized as important predictors of cardiovascular disease, suggesting that <b>oxidative</b> stress resulting from exposure to PAHs may be a mechanism of cardiovascular disease in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxidative</b> stress induces the {{activation}} of NEDD4 transcription via the FOXM1B transcription factor. Ras signalling also up-regulates NEDD4 transcription.|$|E
25|$|Many acids undergo <b>oxidative</b> decarboxylation. Enzymes that {{catalyze}} these {{reactions are}} known as carboxylases (EC6.4.1) and decarboxylases (EC4.1.1).|$|E
25|$|Reactions of chloroamine include radical, nucleophilic, and electrophilic {{substitution}} of chlorine, electrophilic {{substitution of}} hydrogen, and <b>oxidative</b> additions.|$|E
