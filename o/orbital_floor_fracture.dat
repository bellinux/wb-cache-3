Gami herself was also a former Catch the Wave winner from 2010, but decided not to put herself in the title tournament. On December 16, Misaki Ohata won the Zan-1 tournament to earn the fourth and final spot in the title tournament. On January 23, 2013, a random draw decided {{that in the first}} round of the tournament on February 17, Ayumi Kurihara would face Kana, while Misaki Ohata would face Yumi Ohka. The finals of the tournament were set to take place on March 17. On February 16, Wave {{announced that}} Kurihara had suffered a nasal and <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fracture</b> and would be forced to pull out of the tournament. She would be replaced by Mio Shirai, who had finished second in the Zan-1 tournament. In the following day's semifinal matches, Kana defeated Shirai, while Ohka defeated Ohata. However, it was announced that if Kurihara was able to return to the ring by March 17, she would get to wrestle Kana for a spot in the finals. On March 7, Kurihara announced that she was going to make her return for the match against Kana. In order to prevent Ohka from having the advantage of having to wrestle only one match on March 17, she was put in a non-tournament match against Gami. On March 17, Kana defeated Kurihara to hold on to her spot in the finals of the tournament. Later that same day, Ohka defeated Kana in the finals to win the tournament and become the inaugural Wave Single Champion.|$|E

The appearance marked Nozaki's first professional wrestling appearance in thirteen months. Dubbing herself [...] "Nozabitch", Nozaki began working in WNC as a villain {{for the first}} time in her career, adopting the shinai as her signature weapon. The following day, Nozaki managed Ohara at another WNC event, where he was victorious over El Hijo del Pantera in a singles match. Nozaki made her in-ring debut for WNC on August 30 in Korakuen Hall, defeating Makoto via referee stoppage with the sleeper hold. The two had two rematches the following day days; Nozaki was also victorious in both of them with the sleeper hold. During the weekend, Nozaki and Ohara were also joined by rookie Jiro Kuroshio. On September 17, Nozaki earned yet another sleeper hold win over Makoto in a tag team match, where she teamed with Kuroshio and Makoto with Yusuke Kodama. On October 19, Nozaki, Ohara and Kuroshio named their stable [...] "Kabushiki gaisha DQN" [...] On November 27, Nozaki returned to Pro Wrestling Wave, teaming with Hikaru Shida in a five-way tag team match, which was used to determine the number one contenders to the Wave Tag Team Championship and won by Makoto and Moeka Haruhi. The following day, after receiving a first round bye, Nozaki entered the WNC Women's Championship tournament in the semifinal stage, defeating Kana with help from Jiro Kuroshio. Following the upset win, Nozaki began using Kana's nickname, [...] "World Famous". Prior to the final match, Nozaki began making appearances wearing crutches, claiming that she had broken her leg, having fallen over drunk. During the tournament final on December 27, Nozaki revealed that her supposed injury had been a bluff as she started the match off by attacking her opponent, Syuri, from behind. Despite this, Nozaki was eventually defeated, suffering her first direct loss in WNC. Nozaki suffered her second loss in a row at WNC's first event of 2013 on January 4, when she was defeated by Makoto. On January 25, Nozaki was, for the second time in her career, sidelined with an <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fracture,</b> suffered during a six-person tag team match, where she, Hajime Ohara and Jiro Kuroshio defeated Lin Byron, Yo-Hey and Zeus.

40|$|Background: Orbital blowout {{fractures}} can {{be managed}} by several surgical specialties including plastic and maxillofacial surgery, otolaryngology, and ophthalmology. Recommendations for surgical fracture repair depend {{on a combination of}} clinical and imaging studies to evaluate muscle/nerve entrapment and periorbital tissue herniation. Methods: The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the applicability of regional anesthesia when repairing <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fractures.</b> A retrospective chart review was performed for isolated <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fractures</b> treated at the Department of Maxillofacial Surgery in Florence between May 2011 and July 2012. The study included 135 patients who met the inclusion criteria: 96 subjects were male (71 %) and 39 were female (29 %). The mean age was 45. 3 years, ranging from 16 to 77 years. Results: The results revealed that isolated anterior <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fractures</b> can be safely repaired under regional and local anesthesia. Regional and local anesthesia should be combined with intravenous sedation when the fracture involves the posterior floor. The surgical outcome was comparable to the outcome achieved under general anesthesia. There was a lower rate of surgical revisions due to concealed malposition or entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle (19 % vs 22 %). However, this result was not statistically significant (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: There are several advantages to surgically repairing isolated <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fractures</b> under regional and local anesthesia that include the following: surgeons can check the surgical outcome (enophthalmos and extrinsic ocular muscles function) intraoperatively, thereby reducing the reoperation rate; patient discomfort due to general anesthesia is eliminated; and the hospital stay is reduced, thus decreasing overall healthcare costs...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of time elapsed between the occurrence of <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fracture</b> and management on improvement of complications. Patients and methods This is a prospective comparative interventional study that including 17 patients with pure <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fracture</b> (without involvement of the orbital rim) who presented to Mansoura Ophthalmic Center from January 2012 to September 2012; they presented with diplopia with or without enophthalmos. For all cases, computed tomography-coronal cuts were performed. For all cases, repair of the <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fracture</b> was performed using a titanium mesh. For cases that had persistent diplopia after repair because of restrictive myopathy, adjustable inferior rectus recession was performed. Those who did not achieve correction after recession were corrected by prisms. Cases were followed for 6 months after surgery. Results This study included 17 cases with pure <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fracture.</b> They {{were divided into two}} groups according to the time of presentation after trauma: group A included seven (41. 2 %) patients who were operated within 3 weeks of trauma and group B included 10 (58. 8 %) patients who were operated after 3 weeks up to 6 months of trauma. In group A, all cases presented with diplopia in up gaze; however, one (14. 3 %) case presented with enophthalmos more than 2 mm. In group B, all cases presented with diplopia in up gaze and three (30 %) of them presented with enophthalmos more than 2 mm. In group A, diplopia and enophthalmos were completely resolved after surgical repair of orbital floor fracture; however, in group B, diplopia improved only in two (20 %) cases, but cases of enophthalmos were completely resolved. Among the remaining eight (80 %) patients with persistent diplopia who underwent adjustable inferior rectus recession, seven (70 %) patients improved and only one (10 %) patient had persistent diplopia that was corrected with prisms. Conclusion Early repair of <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fracture</b> (within 3 weeks) leads to complete improvement in diplopia; however, late repair in most of the cases needs inferior rectus recession and sometimes prism correction.

40|$|Introduction. Orbital floor blowout {{fracture}} is {{a common}} traumatic lesion of the craniofacial complex, but rarely in children population, consequently representing challenge in surgical treatment.

The predominant symptoms were: ocular bulb motility disorder with consecutive strabismus and double vision. Orbital floor reconstruction was made by an autogenous mandibular symphyseal graft. A year after the orbital floor reconstruction additional correction of strabismus was performed due to functional disorder of the bulbomotor muscles. Conclusion. Delayed surgical treatment of blowout <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fracture</b> in children leads to unsatisfactory functional results in the majority of cases.

40|$|It is {{essential}} to reduce and reconstruct bony defects adequately in large <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fracture</b> and defect. Among many reconstructive methods, alloplastic materials have attracted attention because of their safety and ease of use.

This causes enophthalmos and diplopia. Infraorbital rim {{is not involved}} in pure blow out fracture, it is also involved then it should be considered as an impure blow out fracture [3]. Entrapment of inferior rectus muscle between the fracture fragments will cause diplopia in these patients. This article discusses a novel endoscopic internal reduction of fractured fragments. Main advantage of endoscopic approach is the lack of facial skin incision. It is cosmetically acceptable. <b>Orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fractures</b> were first described by MacKenzie in Paris in 1884 [1]. Smith was the first to describe entrapment of inferior rectus between the fracture fragments. He was also the first to coin the term “Blow out fracture ” [2]. Blow out fracture causes an increase in the intraorbital volume, this causes enopthalmos. Entrapment of inferior rectus muscle causes diplopia. These patient...|$|R
40|$|Thirty {{cases of}} <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> {{blow-out}} <b>fractures</b> proven by tomography were retro· spectively reviewed {{to determine the}} accuracy of the plain films. Using the maximum diameter from the tomograms, the area and volume of the fractures were calculated and correlated with the presence of diplopia and enophthalmos at the time of presen-tation and at subsequent follow-up. Nine of the 30 cases underwent surgical repair. <b>Orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fractures</b> were recognized in 29 of 30 cases using only the 28 ° Caldwell and Waters views. Routine tomography is unnecessary and should be reserved as a preoperative evaluation in patients with enophthalmos to establish the presence of a significant associated medial wall prolapse. In 1889, Lang [1] described a case of traumatic enophthalmos and suggested that this was due to a depressed internal orbital wall fracture. In 1943, Pfeiffer [2] reported 24 cases of internal orbital fractures with development of enophthal-mos. He postulated the mechanism of injury as a blow transmitted through the eyeball to the orbital walls with fracture, the orbital rim remaining intact. In 1957, Smith et al. [3, 4] confi rmed this mechanism with a cadaver experiment and thes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Orbital</b> <b>floor</b> <b>fractures</b> are {{a serious}} {{consequence}} of craniofacial trauma and account for approximately 60 - 70 % of all orbital fractures. Unfortunately, the body’s natural response to <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> defects generally does not restore proper function and facial aesthetics which {{is complicated by}} the thin bone and adjacent sinuses. We propose using a tissue engineering strategy to regenerate <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> bone. To this end, a functional biomaterial was investigated to enhance <b>orbital</b> <b>floor</b> regeneration. First, a bone marrow stromal cell population was isolated and differentiation assessed via coculture with chondrocytes and osteogenic media supplements. A cyclic acetal biomaterial composed of the cyclic acetal monomer 5 -ethyl- 5 -(hydroxymethyl) -β,β-dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxane- 2 -ethanol diacrylate (EHD) and poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) was then developed for cell encapsulation. The previously investigated bone marrow stromal cells were then used {{to determine the effects of}} the ammonium persulfate/N,N,N’,N’-tetramethylethylenediamine initiator system used to crosslink the EH-PEG hydrogels on cell viability, metabolic activity, and osteogenic differentiation. Next, EH-PEG hydrogels were implante...|$|R
