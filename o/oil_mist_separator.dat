In 1977, Günter Röttgering, the {{son-in-law}} of Walter Hengst, joined the company, later becoming his successor, {{as a result}} of which the company was rebranded as Ing. Walter Hengst GmbH & Co. KG.Following the introduction of the first service-friendly cup oil filters with automatic drain system and plastic screw cap in 1988, the filter plant Hengst Filterwerke Berlin GmbH & Co. KG was founded in Berlin in 1990. In 1992, Walter Hengst’s daughter, Wera Röttgering, founded the national registered association Herzenswünsche e. V. (Heart’s Desires).In 1993, Hengst launched the environmentally-friendly ENGERGETIC® filter system, which was the first metal-free filter insert. In 1995, the first cup oil filter with an integrated centrifuge was introduced, followed by the first fluid management module in 1996. In 1997, a highly efficient <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> <b>separator</b> system (cyclones for Otto and diesel engines) was introduced.|$|E
40|$|Blowby {{emissions}} {{contribute a}} significant part of total hydrocarbon emission by an automobile, but no effort has so far been made in our country to control the same. The diesel engineers have, so far, neglected investigations in this held and the literature available on blowby emissions investigation is very scarce. This paper deals with investigations on the control of blowby emissions in high power turbocharged diesel engine by installing positive crank case ventilation (PCV) system. The lubricating oil mist escaping with blowby gases is also quite significant. Feasibility of recovering this mist by installing in the PCV system a lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> <b>separator,</b> designed and fabricated for the purpose has been established. The results obtained clearly show that the blowby emissions can be effectively controlled with the help of PCV system. However, the cross-section area of the PCV pipe has to be adjusted according to the amount of blowby gases and the inflow of ventilating air through the breather. It was possible to separate the lubricating oil mist in the blowby gases and return the lubricating oil back to sump {{with the use of a}} mist separator installed in the PCV system. The PCV system and lubricating <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> <b>separator</b> both can be retrofitted even on engines in service. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Oil</b> <b>mist</b> {{lubrication}} {{is currently}} widely {{used as a}} lubrication method now. It has some advantages as follows: low fuel consumption, uniform lubrication and high efficiency. In job site, <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> condensation occurs in the pipeline, and this will not only reduce the efficiency, but also lead to accidents.

40|$|Abstract. Minimum {{quantity}} lubrication (MQL) is {{a technique}} which sprays {{a small amount of}} lubricant to the cutting zone with the aid of compressed air. MQL has become an attractive option to dry and flood cutting in terms of being able to increase tool life and reduce the cost of the product. However, machining under MQLseems to be limited by cutting temperature, this is because at high speeds, the <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> becomes evaporated. Therefore, in this study the use ofnitrogen gas and air as cooling mediumin combination with <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> as a lubricant was compared in order to improve the machining performance when turning hardened stainless tool steel (STAVAX ESR) with hardness 48 HRCusingwiper coated carbidecutting inserts.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{relation}} between measured levels of exposure to soluble <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> in a plant manufacturing ball bearings, and both respiratory symptoms and airway responsiveness in the workforce. METHODS: 114 male workers exposed to <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> and 55 unexposed male controls from nearby factories were studied. Soluble <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> concentrations were measured with area samplers. Respiratory symptoms were assessed by questionnaire and measurement of airway responsiveness to methacholine with an abbreviated method. Subjects were labelled positive to methacholine airway challenge (MAC+) if forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) fell by > or = 20 %. The linear dose-response slope was calculated as the percentage fall in FEV 1 at the last dose divided by the total dose given. RESULTS: Geometric mean concentrations of <b>oil</b> <b>mists</b> ranged from 0. 65 mg/m 3 (GSD 1. 29) to 2. 20 mg/m 3 (GSD 1. 55) based on 92 measurements obtained from 1979 - 93. The prevalence of chronic cough or phlegm, bouts of bronchitis, and dyspnoea was greater among exposed workers than among controls (odds ratio (OR) 4. 64, P = 0. 002 for chronic cough and phlegm). After adjustment for smoking and age, dyspnoea {{was significantly related to}} an index of cumulative exposure to <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> (OR 1. 44, P = 0. 006 / 10 y. mg/m 3). The proportion of MAC+ subjects was similar in the two groups. However, after adjustment for baseline FEV 1 and age, the dose-response slope was significantly steeper among exposed workers than among controls (P = 0. 01), a finding indicating airway hyperresponsiveness in the exposed workers. Furthermore, the dose-response slope was significantly related to baseline FEV 1, age, and, after adjustment for FEV 1, the index of cumulative exposure to oil (P = 0. 004). CONCLUSION: Subjects with exposure to soluble <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> in the metal industry are at risk of developing both respiratory symptoms and airway hyperresponsiveness...|$|R

50|$|In many vehicles, a {{crankcase}} breather pipe feeds {{into the air}} intake to vent the crankcase without releasing raw hydrocarbon vapors into the atmosphere. In a highly worn engine, hot gases, including unburnt fuel can blow past the piston rings and into the crankcase. This creates an excess <b>oil</b> <b>mist,</b> which is then drawn from the crankcase into the air intake via the breather. A diesel engine will readily burn this <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> as fuel, since engine oil has similar energy content and combustion properties as diesel fuel. The extra fuel causes the engine revolutions to increase, causing still more <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> to be {{forced out of the}} crankcase and into the engine, and a positive feedback loop is created. The engine quickly reaches a point where it is generating so much fuel from its own crankcase oil that it can sustain operation even with the normal fuel supply shut off, and it will run faster and faster until it is destroyed.|$|R

40|$|A part of {{lubrication}} oil stored in an oil sump of a refrigeration compressor becomes fine <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> in a compressor shell. Although {{some of the}} <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> is separated from refrigerant in the compressor shell, {{a certain amount of}} the <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> is discharged with refrigerant into a refrigeration cycle. The oil circulated with refrigerant in the cycle degrades the heat transfer efficiency of heat exchangers, increases pressure drop in lines and the heat exchangers and sometimes reduces reliability of the compressor when an oil return from the cycle to the compressor is insufficient. It is therefore important to reduce the oil discharge from the compressor to the cycle. In order to decrease the oil amount discharged from the compressor, development of a superior oil separator should be done and many researches were focused on it. More basically, since the separation efficiency of the oil separator strongly depends on droplet size of the <b>oil</b> <b>mist,</b> factors associated with the droplet size such as generation mechanism of the <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> in the compressor, the droplet behavior on solid surface in the compressor and surface tension of the oil in which the refrigerant is dissolved should be clarified. However, the surface tension of the oil mixed with refrigerant and wettability of solid surface with the oil/refrigerant mixture which influences the droplet behavior have not been reported sufficiently. In this study, the surface tension of the PAG oil/CO 2 mixture is measured by a pendant drop method and the wettability of the solid surface is evaluated as the fundamental study for discussing the generation mechanism of the <b>oil</b> <b>mist</b> in the compressor. The measurements of the surface tension of the oil/refrigerant mixture and contact angle of the mixture on the solid surface are achieved under high pressure and temperature condition. It is found that the surface tension of oil/refrigerant mixture decreases steeply with increasing the refrigerant concentration in the oil. The contact angle on solid surface decreases with the refrigerant concentration due to the reduction of surface tension. The contact angle on Aluminum surface is smaller than that on the PTFE surface and decreases with elapsed time. With using Ohnesorge number which is a ratio of viscous force to inertia force and surface tension force to evaluate the oil droplet behavior on the metal surface, Ohnesorge number is estimated to be very small under discharge condition in the compressor and it suggest that the oil droplet of oil/refrigerant mixture will spread immediately on the metal surface...|$|R
