5|$|The {{pastor of}} Mt. St. Peter Parish is {{appointed}} to the position by the Bishop and {{is the leader of}} the parish. When one steps down, is transferred to another church, passes away, or retires, another is appointed. He is in charge <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> everything goes smoothly with the priests and administration of the church. The pastor works in collaboration with the Parish Staff, the Parish Pastoral Council, and the Parish Finance Council. His mission is to proclaim and help facilitate the building of the Kingdom of God among the parishioners of Mt. St. Peter Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{termination}} of the operation caught the CIA by surprise, and King quickly attempted to salvage what he could. The freighter was redirected to Panama, where the arms were unloaded; King kept the weapons there {{in the hope that}} the project could be rejuvenated. Castillo Armas was paid a retainer of $3000 a week, which allowed him to maintain a small force. The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The CIA found it difficult to end the operation without drawing attention to it. Peréz Jimenez opened a line of credit that would allow Castillo Armas to purchase airplanes, and Trujillo and Somoza continued to support the operation, although they acknowledged that it would have to be postponed. The money paid to Castillo Armas has been described as a way <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he did not attempt any premature action. Even after the operation had been terminated, the CIA received reports from Seekford that the Guatemalan rebels were planning assassinations. Castillo Armas made plans to use groups of soldiers in civilian clothing from Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador to kill communist leaders in Guatemala. King continued to explore the CIA's ability to move arms around Central America without the approval of the State Department.|$|E
25|$|If {{the rate}} of {{absorption}} (and/or excretion) of certain nutrients can be experimentally measured then this information can be added as a constraint on the flux rate {{at the edges of}} a metabolic model. This ensures that nutrients that are not present or not absorbed by the organism do not enter its metabolism (the flux rate is constrained to zero) and also means that known nutrient uptake rates are adhered to by the simulation. This provides a secondary method <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the simulated metabolism has experimentally verified properties rather than just mathematically acceptable ones.|$|E

The CIA remained in contact with him, and continued to provide support to the rebels. The money paid to Castillo Armas {{has been described as}} a way <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he did not attempt any premature action.

2500|$|The {{explosion}} {{was investigated}} separately by Apache Energy, the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority (NOPSA) and other agencies. The WA State Opposition {{called for a}} Royal Commission, with Energy Spokesperson John Day saying, [...] "It's a matter <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> this major disaster, which is now facing WA, does not happen again". Western Australian Premier Alan Carpenter said this was unnecessary because the National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority was investigating and it could compromise their inquiry. Carpenter said their investigation will take 10–12 weeks to complete and its findings will be released to the public. State Opposition Leader, Troy Buswell, said that NOPSA had {{a conflict of interest}} as it helped perform safety inspections on the island, and therefore [...] "are conducting an investigation which will in part be an investigation into themselves".|$|E
2500|$|The third One-Shot, Item 47, had {{a bigger}} scope and budget than the {{previous}} shorts. Marvel approached Christopher Lennertz to provide a [...] "big and fun and funny" [...] score; Lennertz described the One-Shots as [...] "a little quirkier than the movies, in terms <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> they’re fast and they usually {{have a little bit}} more of a comedic bent to it". Lennertz' score for the short is [...] "rock-based", with a lot of electronics and guitars. For the opening bank robbery, [...] "We had a big twangy low guitar theme, almost like a Jack White kind of a thing on guitar". At the end of the short, when money 'rains down', Lennertz paid homage to Ennio Morricone with vocals in a [...] "classic spoofy" [...] way.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{important}} factor in creating admissible entomological evidence is creating a clear and consistent chain of custody. [...] This means that any samples taken from a body or {{the scene of the}} crime in question must have been labeled correctly and the identity of those persons who had access to it must be recorded. [...] This record should show the location and custody of the samples at all times – from collection to analysis. [...] Typically, an entomologist on the scene will collect their samples and lock them in their scene kit as a way <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> no one else has access to them to tamper with the evidence, ensuring that the information gathered in the field is viable in court. [...] If an accurate record of custody is not kept, then the presentation of this evidence could provide a reason for appeal.|$|E
2500|$|Obama stated on March 15, 2007, that [...] "I do not agree...that {{homosexuality}} is immoral." [...] During the July 23, 2007 CNN/YouTube debate, Obama further stated that [...] "... we've {{got to make}} sure that everybody is equal under the law. And the civil unions that I proposed would be equivalent in terms <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> all the rights that are conferred by the state are equal for same-sex couples as well as for heterosexual couples." [...] Obama supports expanding the protections afforded by hate crimes statutes to cover crimes committed against individuals because of sexual orientation or gender identity. Obama also called for full equality for gays during his second inaugural address on January 21, 2013: [...] "Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law — for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well." [...] This was the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word gay in an inaugural address.|$|E
2500|$|Offa's Dyke largely {{remained}} the frontier between the Welsh and English in later centuries. By the 9th century, the expanding power of Mercia led to it gaining control over Ergyng and nearby Hereford. The system of shires which was later {{to form the}} basis of local administration throughout England and eventually Wales originated in Wessex, where it became established during the 8th century. Wessex and Mercia gradually established an occasionally unstable alliance, with Wessex gaining the upper hand. According to Asser, the southern Welsh kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of Glywysing, commended themselves to Alfred the Great of Wessex in about 885. Alfred's son Edward the Elder also secured homage from the Welsh, although sporadic border unrest continued. In the early 10th century, a document known as The Ordinance Concerning the Dunsaete records procedures for dealing with disputes between the English and the Welsh, and implies that areas west of the Wye in Archenfield were still culturally Welsh. It stated that the English should only cross into the Welsh side, and vice versa, in the presence of an appointed man who had the responsibility <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the foreigner was safely escorted back to the crossing point. In 926, Edward's successor Athelstan, [...] "King of the English", summoned the Welsh kings including Hywel Dda of Deheubarth to a meeting at Hereford, and according to William of Malmesbury laid down the boundary between England and Wales, particularly the disputed southern stretch where he specified that the eastern bank of the Wye should form the boundary.|$|E

6000|$|The bee-hunter {{was glad}} to hear that all the family had not this man's vice, for he now plainly foresaw that the {{accidents}} of his position must bring him and these strangers much in contact, for some weeks, at least. Le Bourdon, though not absolutely [...] "afraid of a jug," [...] as Whiskey Centre had expressed it, was decidedly a temperate man; drinking but seldom, and never to excess. He too well knew the hazards by which he was surrounded, to indulge in this way, even had he the taste for it; but he had no taste that way, one small jug of brandy forming his supply for a whole season. In these days of exaggeration in all things, exaggeration in politics, in religion, in temperance, in virtue, and even in education, by putting [...] "new wine into old bottles," [...] that one little jug might have sufficed to give him a bad name; but five-and-thirty years ago men had more real independence than they now possess, and were not as much afraid of that croquemitaine, public opinion, as they are to-day. To be sure, it was little to le Bourdon's taste to make a companion of such a person as Whiskey Centre; but there was no choice. The man was an utter stranger to him; and the only means he possessed <b>of</b> <b>making</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he did not carry off the property that lay so much at his mercy, was by keeping near him. With many men, the bee-hunter would have been uneasy at being compelled to remain alone with them in the woods; for cases in which one had murdered another, in order to get possession of the goods, in these remote regions, were talked of, among the other rumors of the borders; but Gershom had that in his air and manner that rendered Ben confident his delinquencies, at the most, would scarcely reach bloodshed. Pilfer he might; but murder was a crime which he did not appear at all likely to commit.|$|E
