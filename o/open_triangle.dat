2500|$|The {{national}} British {{signs were}} now a red disc (prohibition), a red <b>open</b> <b>triangle</b> (warning/hazard), a red ring (an order), {{and a red}} <b>open</b> <b>triangle</b> in a ring for the new (1933) warning with order 'SLOW - MAJOR ROAD AHEAD' and 'HALT AT MAJOR ROAD AHEAD' plates (the predecessors of 'GIVE WAY' and 'STOP' respectively). All signs were to carry information plates mounted below them, the warnings or hazards being illustrated {{with a wide range}} of prescribed symbols, but with a text panel below, being only text where no symbol existed. Lettering and symbols were black on a white ground except for orders (like 'TURN LEFT') which were white on blue. New to the UK were the first combination sign, which incorporated information on the sign itself, the 30 miles per hour speed restriction (introduced in 1934), with '30' in black letters on a white disc (the information) surrounded by a red ring (the order sign). It was accompanied by its 'derestriction' a white disc with a diagonal black band bisecting it. Neither of these signs required separate information plates. The 1934 RTA also clarified direction and distance signage which also remained in that form until 1964. All signs were mounted on posts painted in black and white stripes, and their reverse sides were finished black, green, or more rarely (usually after repainting) white. The 'HALT' plate was unique in being T-shaped; orders were mainly landscape and warnings always portrait. Sizes were strictly prescribed, the warning plate being [...] with the surmounting triangle [...] equal.|$|E
2500|$|The rise of {{motoring}} after 1896 saw {{the pattern}} repeated. The larger motoring clubs, notably The Automobile Association (AA) and the Royal Scottish Automobile Club (RSAC) erected their own, idiosyncratic warning boards and direction signs {{on a wide}} scale. In addition, under the Motor Car Act 1903, four national signs were created, supposed to be set at least [...] {{from the ground and}} [...] from the reference point. These signs were interesting in being based on shape, rather than text or image; a white ring (speed limited as marked on a small information plate below it); a white (sometimes red) diamond (a [...] "motor notice" [...] such as a weight restriction, given on a plate below); a red disc (a prohibition); and a red <b>open</b> <b>triangle</b> (a hazard or warning). These latter two could be given detail by the attachment of an information plate below, but often it was left to the motorist to guess what the sign was referring to and local variations as to the definition of what was a prohibition or just a [...] "notice", for instance, were common. In spite of this confusing beginning, this format of sign was to develop into the British road sign that was standard from 1934 until 1964. Before this time, until 1933, when regulations for traffic signs were published under powers created by the Road Traffic Act 1930, [...] "national" [...] road signage specifications were only advisory.|$|E

50|$|A {{navigation}} marker {{consists of}} {{a black and white}} ringed pole surmounted by a red <b>open</b> <b>triangle.</b> The configuration of the markers is made up of two pairs, each pair having one pole behind the other, and the pairs being separated by a set distance along the bank. Timing starts when the first two markers line up, and ends when the second pair line up. For a craft to be within the speed limit, it should take a minute or more to reach the second pair of markers after passing the first pair of markers. On {{the upper reaches of the}} Thames, the speed limit is 8 km per hour or 133.3m per minute, and so the markers are set 133.3m apart.|$|E
5000|$|One {{approach}} {{comes from}} combinatorial geometry. The open interval (0, 1) has an Euler characteristic of &minus;1, so its power set 2(0, 1) {{should have an}} Euler characteristic of 2&minus;1 = 1/2. The appropriate power set to take is the [...] "small power set" [...] of finite subsets of the interval, which consists of the union of a point (the empty set), an open interval (the set of singetons), an <b>open</b> <b>triangle,</b> and so on. So the Euler characteristic of the small power set is 1 − 1 + 1 − · · ·. James Propp defines a regularized Euler measure for polyhedral sets that, in this example, replaces 1 − 1 + 1 − · · · with 1 − t + t2 − · · ·, sums the series for |t| < 1, and analytically continues to t = 1, essentially finding the Abel sum of 1 − 1 + 1 − · · ·, which is 1/2. Generally, he finds χ(2A) = 2χ(A) for any polyhedral set A, and {{the base of the}} exponent generalizes to other sets as well.|$|E

5000|$|Based on {{intelligence}} {{derived from a}} shot down kikusui No. 1 enlisted flight petty officer named Sata Omaichi who boasted of a massed attack set for 11 April, Admiral Kelly Turner, ordered Admiral Mort Deyo, to bring the entire beach gunfire force consisting of ten battleships, seven cruisers, and twelve destroyers out to what was being called Kamikaze Gulch. Kamikaze Gulch an <b>open</b> <b>triangle</b> of ocean bounded by Ie Shima, the Kerama Retto, and the shore of Okinawa was the most direct route for kamikazees to reach the Hagushi beachhead. [...] On the afternoon of 12 April, Tennessee, {{was one of the}} fire-support battleships, steaming in the Kamikaze Gulch air-defense screen when five kamikazes from kikusui No. 2 picked her, and dove in through puffs of shell bursts and the heavy smoke from the burning destroyer [...] Four were shot down, the last three only hundreds of yards from the battleship. The last one came down on the bow at a 45-degree angle, was set aflame by 5 in gunfire, and then plunged into the water. At the same time, an Aichi D3A [...] "Val" [...] dive bomber, flying low on the starboard bow, headed directly for Tennessees bridge. Lookouts spotted the [...] "Val" [...] at 2500 yd away, and every automatic weapon that could be brought bear opened up. One of the plane's fixed wheels was torn off, and its engine began to smoke. Heading at first for Tennessees tower foremast, the Japanese pilot swerved slightly and crashed into the signal bridge. The burning wreck slid aft along the superstructure, crushing antiaircraft guns and their crews, and stopped next to Turret three. It had carried a 250 lb bomb which, with {{what was left of the}} plane, went through the wooden deck and exploded. Twenty-two men were killed or mortally wounded, with another 107 injured. This was not enough to put Tennessee out of action. The dead were buried at sea, and the wounded transferred the following day to the casualty-evacuation transport [...] The ship's company turned to on emergency repairs; and, by 14 April, the ship was back on the firing line. Tennessee remained off Okinawa for two more weeks.|$|E
5000|$|Burbank auto customizer George Barris {{was given}} four weeks to supply {{vehicles}} {{for the film}} that was made from a left over Munster Koach fiberglass body. The top was removed, the rear engine was moved back in the square tube frame, then the second engine was {{placed in front of}} the rear engine. The body after finished altering it, was channeled over frame. The body was cut after the first doors, then the rear section of the body was moved forward. They had to make both slender doors buy using the third rear doors and the front doors. After getting the right measurements they made the new doors. Then they put gold Naugahyde on the doors and spare tire carriers. The top in back is just side pieces, so a lid had to go over them to get the side pieces to fit. They put pompoms around this rectangular lid. The windshield frame was angled forward, with another frame to meet the top of windshield frame to make an <b>open</b> <b>triangle.</b> The car was called the ZZR that was equipped with a variety of weapons in the manner of James Bond's customized Aston Martin DB-5 in Goldfinger. The $22,000 ZZR featured two 425 CID Buick engines bored out to 440 CID, mounted in tandem with an Ansen Posi-shift Powerglide transmission with two carburetors per engine with a four holed Hilborn injector scoop. The rear scoop was higher because it had a Cadillac air cleaner underneath it. M/T tires mounted on 12" [...] Raders Star Mags front and One Ribbed in the rear. M/T Dirt Tires were used for traction on the beach sand, a Cal-Automotive kick channeled is mounted on rectangular tube frame with dual radiators. The brass custom grill cost $5,000 to make. The French Cibie headlights are mounted vertically between the fenders in specially designed nose with headlight shell, painted lilac to match the rear fenders. The rest of the body is in gold. A complete arsenal in the rear trunk area is stocked with handguns, tear gas, hand grenades, telescopic machine gun, tar squirter, feather blow gun, and “skid juice” spray nozzle. Rear fenders house flame throwers, while bullets are fired from the front fenders. A model kit of the ZZR was made by AMT.|$|E
