5|$|Beryllium is {{a health}} and safety issue for workers. Exposure to {{beryllium}} in the workplace {{can lead to a}} sensitization immune response and can over time develop chronic beryllium disease (CBD). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the United States researches these effects in collaboration with a major manufacturer of beryllium products. The goal of this research is to prevent sensitization and CBD by developing {{a better understanding of the}} work processes and exposures that may present a potential risk for workers, and to develop effective interventions that will reduce the risk for adverse health effects. NIOSH also conducts genetic research on sensitization and CBD, independently of this collaboration. The NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods contains methods for measuring <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> to beryllium.|$|E

50|$|<b>Occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> banding, {{also known}} as hazard banding, is a process {{intended}} to quickly and accurately assign chemicals into specific categories (bands), each corresponding {{to a range of}} exposure concentrations designed to protect worker health. These bands are assigned based on a chemical’s toxicological potency and the adverse health effects associated with exposure to the chemical. The output of this process is an <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> band (OEB). <b>Occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> banding has been used by the pharmaceutical sector and by some major chemical companies {{over the past several decades}} to establish exposure control limits or ranges for new or existing chemicals that do not have formal OELs. Furthermore, <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> banding has become an important component of the Hierarchy of <b>Occupational</b> <b>Exposure</b> Limits (OELs).|$|R
25|$|Miscarriage {{may occur}} for many reasons, {{not all of}} which can be identified. Risk factors are those things that {{increase}} the likelihood of having a miscarriage but don't necessarily cause a miscarriage. Up to 70 conditions, infections, medical procedures, lifestyle factors, <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures,</b> chemical exposure, and shift work are associated with increased risk for miscarriage. Some of these risks include endocrine, genetic, uterine, or hormonal abnormalities, reproductive tract infections, and tissue rejection caused by an autoimmune disorder.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 NHIS-OHS found {{elevated}} {{prevalence rates}} of several <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector which may negatively impact health. These workers often worked long hours. The prevalence {{rate of working}} more than 48 hours a week among workers employed in these industries was 37%, and 24% worked more than 60 hours a week. Of all workers in these industries, 85% frequently worked outdoors compared to 25% of all U.S. workers. Additionally, 53% were frequently exposed to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes, compared to 25% of all U.S. workers.|$|E
25|$|Chemical and <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> {{may have}} some affect in {{pregnancy}} outcomes. A cause and effect relationship almost can never be established. Those chemicals that are implicated in increasing the risk for miscarriage are DDT, lead, formaldehyde, arsenic, benzene and ethylene oxide. Video display terminals and ultrasound have not {{been found to have}} an affect on the rates of miscarriage. In dental offices where nitrous oxide is used with the absence of anesthetic gas scavenging equipment, there is a greater risk of miscarriage. For women who work with cytotoxic antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agents there is a small increased risk of miscarriage. No increased risk for cosmetologists has been found.|$|E

Adherence to standard precautions, awareness about post exposure prophylaxis is poor in developing countries. This retrospective study analyzes the self-reported cases of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> in a tertiary care hospital. During the study period, 105 HCWs sustained <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to blood and body fluids.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10% of all birth defects are caused by prenatal exposure to a teratogenic agent. These exposures include, {{but are not limited}} to, medication or drug exposures, maternal infections and diseases, and environmental and <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures.</b> Paternal smoking use has also been linked to an increased risk of birth defects and childhood cancer for the offspring, where the paternal germline undergoes oxidative damage due to cigarette use. Teratogen-caused birth defects are potentially preventable. Studies have shown that nearly 50% of pregnant women have been exposed to at least one medication during gestation. During pregnancy, a female can also be exposed to teratogens from the contaminated clothing or toxins within the seminal fluid of a partner. An additional study found that of 200 individuals referred for genetic counseling for a teratogenic exposure, 52% were exposed to more than one potential teratogen.|$|E
25|$|Firefighting {{has long}} been {{associated}} with poor cardiovascular outcomes. In the United States, {{the most common cause}} of on-duty fatalities for firefighters is sudden cardiac death. In addition to personal factors that may predispose an individual to coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular diseases, <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> can significantly increase a firefighter's risk. Historically, the fire service blamed poor firefighter physical condition for being the primary cause of cardiovascular related deaths. However, over the last 20 years, studies and research has indicated the toxic gasses put fire service personnel at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular related conditions and death. For instance, carbon monoxide, present in nearly all fire environments, and hydrogen cyanide, formed during the combustion of paper, cotton, plastics, and other substances containing carbon and nitrogen. The substances inside of materials change during combustion their bi-products interfere with the transport of oxygen in the body. Hypoxia can then lead to heart injury. In addition, chronic exposure to particulate matter in smoke is associated with atherosclerosis. Noise exposures may contribute to hypertension and possibly ischemic heart disease. Other factors associated with firefighting, such as stress, heat stress, and heavy physical exertion, also increase the risk of cardiovascular events.|$|E
500|$|Smoking {{has been}} shown to be an {{independent}} risk factor for MS. [...] Stress may be a risk factor although the evidence to support this is weak. Association with <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures</b> and toxins—mainly solvents—has been evaluated, but no clear conclusions have been reached. Vaccinations were studied as causal factors; however, most studies show no association. Several other possible risk factors, such as diet and hormone intake, have been looked at; however, evidence on their relation with the disease is [...] "sparse and unpersuasive". Gout occurs less than would be expected and lower levels of uric acid have been found in people with MS. This has led to the theory that uric acid is protective, although its exact importance remains unknown.|$|E

2500|$|The {{non-human}} primate models of AIDS, using HIV-2, SHIV, and SIV in macaques, {{have been used}} as a complement to ongoing research efforts against the virus. The drug tenofovir has had its efficacy and toxicology evaluated in macaques, and found longterm-highdose treatments had adverse effects not found using short term-high dose treatment followed by long term-low dose treatment. This finding in macaques was translated into human dosing regimens. Prophylactic treatment with anti-virals has been evaluated in macaques, because introduction of the virus can only be controlled in an animal model. The finding that prophylaxis can be effective at blocking infection has altered the treatment for <b>occupational</b> <b>exposures,</b> such as needle exposures. Such exposures are now followed rapidly with anti-HIV drugs, and this practice has resulted in measurable transient virus infection similar to the NHP model. Similarly, the mother-to-fetus transmission, and its fetal prophylaxis with antivirals such as tenofovir and AZT, has been evaluated in controlled testing in macaques not possible in humans, and this knowledge has guided antiviral treatment in pregnant mothers with HIV. [...] "The comparison and correlation of results obtained in monkey and human studies is leading to a growing validation and recognition of the relevance of the animal model. Although each animal model has its limitations, carefully designed drug studies in nonhuman primates can continue to advance our scientific knowledge and guide future clinical trials." ...|$|E

A self-administered questionnaire was used to capture information on knowledge of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV infection. A total of 401 healthcare workers responded to a self-administered questionnaire. High proportion of healthcare workers (96. 3 %) understood that they are at risk of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> to HIV. The majority of healthcare workers trained on post exposure prophylaxis procedure and use of personal protective equipment were clinicians (87. 1 % and 71. 4 % respectively) and nurses (81. 8 % and 74. 6 % respectively). Over a quarter of the healthcare workers were not aware of whom to contact in the event of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure.</b> One third of healthcare workers did not have comprehensive knowledge on causes of occupational HIV transmission and did not know when post exposure prophylaxis is indicated.

40|$|In Sweden, as {{in other}} industrialised nations, <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> limits are {{considered}} to be an important tool for chemical risk management, although many other factors also play a role in occupational safety and health management. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> limits in relation to information about, and the risk perception of, chemicals. An interview study was performed at four Swedish process industry workplaces in order to investigate these issues. For each workplace, the range of informants covered at least one person who spent most of their working time in the production process; one person in a managerial position; one person in the site health, safety and environment department; the main safety ombudsman; and the site manager. The results show that informants' understanding of <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> limits and their use is quite poor, although they do understand that there is epistemic uncertainty in determining the toxicological effects of hazardous substances. The risk perception and safety behaviour of the informants were not affected by the <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> limits, nor did <b>occupational</b> <b>exposure</b> limits have any role as sources of information.
