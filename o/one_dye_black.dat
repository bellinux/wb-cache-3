40|$|High {{strength}} refractory organic {{stream is}} produced during {{the production of}} 2 -phenylamino- 3 -methyl- 6 -di-n-butylaminofluoran (<b>One</b> <b>Dye</b> <b>Black</b> 2, abbr. ODB 2), a novel heat-sensitive material with a promising market. In this study, a combination of acidification-precipitation, primary biological treatment, Fenton&# 39;s oxidation and another biological treatment was successfully used {{for the removal of}} COD from 18000 - 25000 mg/L to below 200 mg/L from the ODB 2 production wastewater in a pilot experiment. A COD removal of 70 %- 80 % was achieved by acidification-precipitation under a pH of 2. 5 - 3. 0. The first step biodegradation permitted an average COD removal of 70 % under an hydraulic residence time (HRT) of 30 h. By batch tests, the optimum conditions of Fenton&# 39;s oxidation were acquired as: Fe 2 + dose 6. 0 mmol/L; H 2 O 2 dose 3000 mg/L; and reaction time 6 h. The second step biological treatment could ensure an effluent COD below 200 mg/L under an HRT of 10 h following the Fenton&# 39;s treatment...|$|E
