5|$|By late 1961, Hawker {{had been}} able to {{demonstrate}} the validity of its design concept, despite a lack of support from the RAF and little from the Her Majesty's Civil Service. In early 1962, official support emerged {{in the form of the}} Operational Requirements branch of the Ministry of Aviation, which approached the Treasury seeking its sanction of a batch of nine production-standard aircraft to be operated by an evaluation unit to be administered by the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham. In light of <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> expressed by figures within the U.S. and West Germany, the British government approached these nations with an offer to collaborate on the project and to seek contributions towards the cost involved. Following the acceptance of all three nations, on 22 May 1962, Hawker received a formal Instruction to Proceed with the procurement of materials for the construction of the nine aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the market}} opens {{on the first}} day of trading a new futures contract, there is a {{specification}} but no actual contracts exist. Futures contracts are not issued like other securities, but are [...] "created" [...] whenever <b>Open</b> <b>interest</b> increases; that is, when one party first buys (goes long) a contract from another party (who goes short).

2500|$|When {{a credit}} event occurs {{on a major}} company on {{which a lot of}} CDS {{contracts}} are written, an auction (also known as a credit-fixing event) may be held to facilitate settlement {{of a large number of}} contracts at once, at a fixed cash settlement price. [...] During the auction process participating dealers (e.g., the big investment banks) submit prices at which they would buy and sell the reference entity's debt obligations, as well as net requests for physical settlement against par. [...] A second stage Dutch auction is held following the publication of the initial midpoint of the dealer markets and what is the net <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> to deliver or be delivered actual bonds or loans. [...] The final clearing point of this auction sets the final price for cash settlement of all CDS contracts and all physical settlement requests as well as matched limit offers resulting from the auction are actually settled. [...] According to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), who organised them, auctions have recently proved an effective way of settling the very large volume of outstanding CDS contracts written on companies such as Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. Commentator Felix Salmon, however, has questioned in advance ISDA's ability to structure an auction, as defined to date, to set compensation associated with a 2012 bond swap in Greek government debt. For its part, ISDA in the leadup to a 50% or greater [...] "haircut" [...] for Greek bondholders, issued an opinion that the bond swap would not constitute a default event.|$|E

60|$|Another {{means of}} {{securing}} the personal attachment of boys, is to notice them,--to {{take an interest}} in their pursuits, and the qualities and powers which they value in one another. It is astonishing what an influence is exerted by such little circumstances, as stopping at a play ground a moment, to notice with interest, though perhaps without saying a word, speed of running,--or exactness of aim,--the force with which a ball is struck,--or the dexterity with which it is caught or thrown. The teacher must, indeed, in all his intercourse with his pupils, never forget his station, nor allow them to lay aside the respect, without which authority cannot be maintained. But he may be, notwithstanding this, on the most intimate and familiar footing with them all. He may take a strong and <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> in all their enjoyments, and thus awaken on their part, a personal attachment to himself, which will exert over them a constant and powerful control.|$|E

Three years later, during the Carter administration, the U.S. and Cuba simultaneously <b>opened</b> <b>interests</b> sections in each other's capitals. In 1980, after 10,000 Cubans crammed into the Peruvian embassy seeking political asylum, Castro stated that any who wished to do so could leave Cuba, in {{what became known as}} the Mariel boatlift.

In terms of minimizing expiration-day effects, the average price is better than the opening price, which in turn is better than the closing price settlement. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that foreign institutional traders' trading activities increase expiration-day effects.

50|$|Many {{technical}} {{analysts believe}} that a knowledge of <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> can prove useful {{toward the end of}} major market moves. For some option traders, <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> indicates the intensity of trading in a financial instrument. If <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> increases suddenly, it is likely that new information about the underlying security has been revealed, which may indicate a near-term rise in the underlying security's volatility. However, neither an increase in volatility nor <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> necessarily indicate anything about the direction of future price movements. A leveling off of <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> following a sustained price advance is often an early warning of the end to an uptrending or bull market.|$|E
50|$|An {{increase}} in <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> {{along with an}} {{increase in}} price is said to confirm an upward trend.

50|$|<b>Open</b> <b>interest</b> {{also gives}} you key {{information}} regarding the liquidity of an option. If there is no <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> for an option, there is no secondary market for that option. When options have large <b>open</b> <b>interest,</b> it means they have {{a large number of}} buyers and sellers, and an active secondary market will increase the odds of getting option orders filled at good prices. So, all other things being equal, the bigger the <b>open</b> <b>interest,</b> the easier it will be to trade that option at a reasonable spread between the bid and ask.|$|E
50|$|One {{way to use}} <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> {{is to look at}} it {{relative}} to the volume of contracts traded. When the volume exceeds the existing <b>open</b> <b>interest</b> on a given day, this suggests that trading in that option was exceptionally high that day. <b>Open</b> <b>interest</b> can help you determine whether there is unusually high or low volume for any particular option.|$|E

Using trade data over a window of six months we find evidence that, after the migration, the bid-ask spread of the futures contract decreases and the contribution of the futures price in information transmission increases. Furthermore, the asymmetry in volatility spillover reduces and the <b>open</b> <b>interests</b> of the futures market become smaller. These results suggest that the anonymity in trading and the higher speed of order execution in the electronic trading system attract informed traders to the futures market and increase the information flow...|$|R
