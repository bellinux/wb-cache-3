40|$|This case {{reported}} a female patient aged 30 years {{was treated with}} <b>orthognathy</b> surgery in Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung. Based on clinical and radiological examinations, model study and photography, diagnosis of skeletal dysgnathy class II was established. The orthodontic treatment is a preparation before surgical operation to achieve stability in optimal dental interdigitation. In operation, BSSO, chinplasty, and V-Y plastic upper lip as well as intermaxillary fixation (IMF) ligation was carried out at the dentofacial position class I. At day- 16, radiography was carried out to evaluate the surgical outcome and the bone position. At day- 21, the opening of jaws was 1. 5 cm; and at day- 42, the patient was reconsulted to orthodontist, and to {{physical medicine and rehabilitation}} In month- 3, occlusion, facial profile and harmony, and jaw functions showed the satisfying outcome, though for the interdigitation stabilization, the rubber elastics was still installed...|$|E
40|$|Fossil {{remains of}} the cercopithecoid Victoria-pithecus {{recently}} recovered from middle Miocene deposits of Maboko Island (Kenya) provide evidence of the cranial anatomy of Old World monkeys prior to the evolutionary divergence of the extant subfamilies Colobinae and Cercopithecinae. Victoria-pithecus shares a suite of craniofacial features with the Oligocene catarrhine Aegyptopithecus and early Miocene hominoid Afropithecus. All three genera manifest supraorbital costae, anteriorly convergent temporal lines, {{the absence of a}} postglabellar fossa, a moderate to long snout, great facial height below the orbits, a deep cheek region, and anteriorly tapering premaxilla. The shared presence of these features in a catarrhine generally ancestral to apes and Old World monkeys, an early ape, and an early Old World monkey indicates that they are primitive characteristics that typified the last common ancestor of Hominoidea and Cercopithecoidea. These results contradict prevailing cranial morphotype reconstructions for ancestral catarrhines as Colobus- or Hylobates-like, characterized by a globular anterior braincase and <b>orthognathy.</b> By resolving several equivocal craniofacial morphocline polarities, these discoveries lay the foundation for a revised interpretation of the ancestral cranial morphology of Catarrhini more consistent with neontological and existing paleontological evidence...|$|E
