40|$|Objectives Developing {{compassion}} towards oneself {{has been}} linked to improvement in many areas of psychological well-being, including psychosis. Furthermore, developing a non-judgemental, accepting way <b>of</b> relating to <b>voices</b> is associated with lower levels of distress for people who hear voices. These factors have also been associated with secure attachment. This study explores associations between the constructs <b>of</b> mindfulness <b>of</b> <b>voices,</b> self-compassion, and distress from hearing voices and how secure attachment style related to each of these variables. Design Cross-sectional online. Method One hundred and twenty-eight people (73 % female; Mage = 37. 5; 87. 5 % Caucasian) who currently hear voices completed the Self-Compassion Scale, Southampton Mindfulness <b>of</b> <b>Voices</b> Questionnaire, Relationships Questionnaire, and Hamilton Programme for Schizophrenia Voices Questionnaire. Results Results showed that mindfulness <b>of</b> <b>voices</b> mediated the relationship between self-compassion and severity <b>of</b> <b>voices,</b> and self-compassion mediated the relationship between mindfulness <b>of</b> <b>voices</b> and severity <b>of</b> <b>voices.</b> Self-compassion and mindfulness <b>of</b> <b>voices</b> were significantly positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with distress and severity <b>of</b> <b>voices.</b> Conclusion Mindful relation to voices and self-compassion are associated with reduced distress and severity <b>of</b> <b>voices,</b> which supports the proposed potential benefits of mindful relating to voices and self-compassion as therapeutic skills for people experiencing distress by voice hearing. Practitioner points Greater self-compassion and mindfulness <b>of</b> <b>voices</b> were significantly associated with less distress from voices. These findings support theory underlining compassionate mind training. Mindfulness <b>of</b> <b>voices</b> mediated the relationship between self-compassion and distress from voices, indicating a synergistic relationship between the constructs. Although the current findings do not give a direction of causation, consideration is given to the potential impact of mindful and compassionate approaches to voices...|$|R

Ryōtarō Okiayu was chosen as Terra's Japanese voice actor as the staff wanted one actor similar to Chikao Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor, and Akio Ōtsuka, Xehanort's voice actor while using Terra's body. The staff found Chikao's was a dry sort <b>of</b> <b>voice,</b> Akio's a deep, resonating sort <b>of</b> <b>voice,</b> and liked how Okiayu bore elements from both actors.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{technological}} {{limitations of the}} Game Boy Advance cartridge size, voice acting was kept to a minimum. Though many characters from Kingdom Hearts were voiced by the cast from before, the Japanese version used the following voice actors: Keiji Fujiwara as Axel; Tatsuya Kando as Vexen, Marluxia, and Lexaeus; and Rieko Katayama as Larxene. A limited amount <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> acting was added only for the battle sequences. Voice clips from the first Kingdom Hearts were inserted into Chain of Memories. The English version is absent of dialogue; voices during Organization battles are replaced with simple grunts, laughter, and other battle cries.|$|E

5|$|GameSpot and GameSpy {{called the}} dialog sharply written, with many memorable lines.

The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control of how to play their character. PC Zone opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was often the most obvious. The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality and the amount <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> work, due to the many dialog options.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{have high}} {{marks on the}} game's cast of characters, but were divided in their {{opinions}} of the choice <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> actors. GameTrailers's reviewer disliked that several famous X-Men and Brotherhood characters were not playable, but appeared only as side characters. They also cited issues with voice acting and a convoluted story. Unlike the critic from GameTrailers, G4's reviewer praised the overall story, and further praised the selection of characters for the cast. Greg Mueller of GameSpot also praised the game's vast cast of characters.|$|E
5|$|Some active subwoofers use a servo {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} voice coil. The servo feedback signal is derived from {{a comparison of the}} input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns <b>of</b> <b>voice</b> coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented servo subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E
