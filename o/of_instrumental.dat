5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces <b>of</b> <b>instrumental</b> and vocal music.|$|E

5|$|Bach was in {{his second}} year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, where the feast was the only {{occasion}} during Lent when festive music was permitted. The theme of the hymn suits both the Annunciation and Palm Sunday, in a spirit of longing expectation of an arrival. An unknown poet retained, as in the other chorale cantatas of Bach's second cantata cycle, the hymn's first and last stanza unchanged, but paraphrased the themes of the inner stanzas to a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the cantata for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes da caccia, two solo violins, strings and continuo. All instruments play in the opening festive chorale fantasia, while the soprano carries the hymn tune and the lower voices answer in counterpoint <b>of</b> <b>instrumental</b> motifs. An oboe da caccia accents the first aria, the solo violins and strings return in the second aria, and an independent horn part crowns the closing chorale.|$|E
5|$|Dangerous or not, Bache {{soon began}} a lifelong crusade to win {{popularity}} for Liszt's works in England. In 1865 {{he began a}} series of annual concerts in conjunction with singer Gustave Garcia. They began modestly, in Collard's Rooms, Grosvenor Street. As they increased in popularity, they were relocated to the more spacious Beethoven Rooms in Cavendish Square, then to the Queen's Concert Rooms in Hanover Square, and finally to St. James's Hall in Regents Square. At first these concerts were <b>of</b> <b>instrumental</b> and chamber works and piano arrangements. In 1868, they had grown to include choral works, which allowed pieces such as Liszt's Soldatenlied and choruses from Wagner's Tannhäuser and Lohengrin to be programmed. By 1871, the concerts had been changed to an orchestral format.|$|E
5|$|The Cascadia {{subduction}} zone rarely influences the western portion of Washington state, but the November 1873 M7.3 shock near the California–Oregon border {{may have been}} associated with it. Although activity in the Pacific Northwest (especially west of the Cascades in Washington) has occasionally been located near the {{subduction zone}}, earthquakes there (1949 Olympia, 1965 Puget Sound, 2001 Nisqually) have mostly been intraslab events. A large M7 earthquake on the Seattle Fault in 900 C.E. may have generated a tsunami in Puget Sound. The 1872 event east of the Cascades is not understood well due to the lack <b>of</b> <b>instrumental</b> records and reliable felt intensity reports.|$|E

5|$|The symphony had {{established}} itself {{by the end}} of the 18th century as the most prestigious <b>of</b> <b>instrumental</b> genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.|$|E
5|$|South Asian music {{places a}} special {{emphasis}} on drumming, which is freed from the primary time-keeping function of drumming found in {{other part of the}} world. In North India, secular processional bands {{play an important role in}} civic festival parades and the bārāt processions leading a groom's wedding party to the bride's home or the hall where a wedding is held. These bands vary in makeup, depending on the means of the families employing them and according to changing fashions over time, but the core instrumentation is a small group of percussionists, usually playing a frame drum (ḍaphalā), a gong, and a pair of kettledrums (nagāṛā). Better-off families will add shawms (shehnai) to the percussion, while the most affluent who also prefer a more modern or fashionable image may replace the traditional ensemble with a brass band. The Karnatic music of southern India includes a tradition <b>of</b> <b>instrumental</b> temple music in the state of Kerala, called kṣētram vādyam. It includes three main genres, all focussed on rhythm and featuring unpitched percussion. Thayambaka in particular is a virtuoso genre for unpitched percussion only: a solo double-headed cylindrical drum called chenda, played with a pair of sticks, and accompanied by other chenda and elathalam (pairs of cymbals). The other two genres, panchavadyam and pandi melam add wind instruments to the ensemble, but only as accompaniment to the primary drums and cymbals. A panchavadyam piece typically lasts about an hour, while a pandi melam performance may be as long as four hours.|$|E

40|$|<b>Instrumental</b> <b>of</b> {{affirmation}} {{in selected}} Slavic languages In {{the present article}} I argue that apart from the genitive of negation, Slavic also makes use <b>of</b> the <b>instrumental</b> <b>of</b> affirmation – but its recognition requires a more sophisticated, function-oriented analytic model, firmly grounded in the real linguistic usage and sensitive to semantic conditioning – such as cognitive semantics. The discussion offered {{seems to suggest that}} the Slavic instrumental is an inherently affirmative case, as opposed to genitive which has specialized in expressing partition, disjunction and negation, e. g. compare Pol. ciasto z orzechami/ Srb. kolač sa orasima ‘a cake with nuts INSTR’ vs. Pol. ciasto bez orzechów/ Srb. kolač bez oraha ‘a cake without nuts GEN’. Furthermore, because of its semantic properties, the instrumental case is attracted by positive contexts and acts as an intensifier <b>of</b> affirmation. Slavic <b>instrumentals</b> can be classified, {{on the basis of the}} positive meanings they imply, as <b>instrumentals</b> <b>of</b> completeness, <b>instrumentals</b> <b>of</b> conjunction and <b>instrumentals</b> <b>of</b> existence. The proposed semantic classification becomes more refined when image-schemas of CONTAINER, PATH, SURFACE and conceptual metaphors related to the physical relation of COVERAGE are included in the model...|$|R
