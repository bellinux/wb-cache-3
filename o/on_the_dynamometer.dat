40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 45) The {{problem of}} this investigation was to determine if participation in strength developing exercises during a state of fatigue has a different effect on strength gains than when participating in the same exercise in a nonfetigued state. Thirty-eight male volunteers enrolled at San Fernando Valley State College physical education activity classes served as subjects for the study. Prior {{to the beginning of the}} seven week training period each subject went through a group-equating test period. This consisted one maximum repetition <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench press three days a week for two weeks. The percentage of strength gain was determined between the first and sixth-test. All subjects were- then ranked according to their percentage of strength gains for this two week period and were then randomly assigned to Group I or Group II. Group I trained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hand <b>dynamometer</b> 1 n a nonfatatigued state then became fatigued on a bicycle ergometer and immediately trained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench press while fatigued. Group II trained in the reverse order using the bench press exercise while in a nonfatigued state, then became fatigued <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bicycle ergometer, and immediately trained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hand <b>dynamometer.</b> <b>The</b> training program consisted of two training sessions a week for six and one- half weeks.

50|$|Initial test running {{was carried}} out without a {{supercharger}} fitted and an improvised carburettor and induction system. The engine did not run well with this arrangement due to poor fuel distribution, however when a supercharger and matched carburettor were fitted (borrowed from the Kestrel development unit) the engine ran and performed well, producing 500 hp (373 kW) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamometer.</b> Despite this the engine was not received well by the aircraft industry where {{it was felt that}} the unusual layout would block the pilot's forward view in a typical fighter aircraft installation.

50|$|Ultimately, {{development}} on the engine was abandoned in favour of focusing on the FPF engine, which was already proven competitive in 1.5L form with side-draft Weber carburetors in the F2 races, and the entire stock of parts were sold to Andrew Getley in the mid-1960s. When the Formula One regulation changed to 3 Litres for 1966, Mr. Getley permitted Paul Emery to rebuild one FPE to 3 Litre format, and fit it to a one-off Shannon steel monocoque chassis to make the Shannon F1 car named SH1 driven by Trevor Taylor at 1966 British Grand Prix.

40|$|Ceramic matrix {{composites}} (CMC) {{are promising}} materials for friction applications. Typically, C/SiC rotors are combined with organic pads (Low Met). Within this work, {{two types of}} CMC brake pads were studied, C/SiC SF as well as C/SiC SF 11 Coke with 11 vol. % coke as filler, accompanied with the Low Met reference pads. Small brake pads (400 mm 2) were applied on a lab-scale and larger pads (12, 000 mm 2) on a full-scale inertia dynamometer. In both cases, the corresponding rotor was a C/SiC disc with a SiC-rich friction layer. Sliding speeds up to 42. 6 m/s and braking pressures up to 8 MPa were applied. The smaller CMC pads show lower wear and higher coefficient of frictions (COF), compared to the reference. This frictional behavior was confirmed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> full-scale <b>dynamometer</b> with mean COFs up to 0. 45.

5000|$|The GBA {{engine was}} first road tested by Haas Lola's lead driver, [...] World Champion Alan Jones {{in the new}} Lola THL2 at the Boreham Circuit in Essex just {{north-east}} of London on 21 February 1986. In freezing, snowy conditions (-6° Celsius) at approximately 10 AM, the V6 turbo, running a conservative 2.5 BAR boost setting, ran cleanly although the engine management electronics developed by Motorola in the United States and Cosworth {{had not yet been}} finalised and the engine ran with the same electronics that were used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamometer.</b> Also present at the test were Duckworth, Goddard, the THL2's designer Neil Oatley, the teams #2 driver Patrick Tambay and other staff from both Haas Lola, Ford and Cosworth.|$|E
5000|$|The GBA was {{designed}} by Keith Duckworth, though many in Formula One doubted his ability to design another truly competitive engine due to his known distaste for turbocharging in general. Rather than design an entirely new engine, Duckworth instead chose to originally try and develop an old, modified 4 cylinder BDA sports car engine as he believed 4 cylinder engines were more compact and economical than a V6 (Cosworth's chief race engine designer Geoff Goddard was against {{the idea of the}} straight 4, but reluctantly let Duckworth go down that path). However, after numerous failures of the test engines <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamometer</b> which were eventually traced to an incurable vibration at the crankshaft, Duckworth designed an all new 120° V6 engine instead, the same configuration as the Ferrari V6 turbo engine used from 1981-1986. The BDA engine was originally limited to 10,000 RPM in sports car racing, but with a turbo its failures generally happened at around 11,000 RPM. The first 4 cylinder test engine was so badly damaged that it actually changed the shape of the engine block {{to the point where the}} crankshaft would not move. As around 4 months had been lost in trying to get the 4 cylinder engine to work, Ford and Cosworth's plan for the engine to debut with Haas Lola in [...] was pushed back to the 1986 season.|$|E

The competition consisted of acceleration, braking distance, and road race course lap-times. Each test was run several times including 10 attempts at a fastest road course time. The H2 was the fastest accelerating machine, posting the fastest 1/4 mile {{run on a}} drag strip. Experts were surprised at the other results. Despite an uncomfortable feel and slight front wheel hop under hard braking and not giving the sensation of stopping particularly fast it had the shortest stopping distance and highest braking G load of all the bikes. On the road course, despite what had been heard and written about its ill handling, frame flexing and the supposed tendency to speed wobble exiting high speed turns, it was tied for the fastest lap time with the Kawasaki Z-1 to the tenth of a second.

Here, we test three diesel-hybrid cars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road and benchmark our findings with two cars against tests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chassis <b>dynamometer</b> and model simulations. The pollutant emissions of the two cars tested <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chassis <b>dynamometer</b> were in compliance with the relevant Euro standards over the NEDC and WLTP. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> road, all three diesel-hybrids exceeded the regulatory NOX limits (average exceedance for all trips: + 150 % for the Volvo, + 510 % for the Peugeot and + 550 % for the Mercedes-Benz;) and they also showed elevated on-road CO 2 emissions (average exceedances of certification values: + 178 %, + 77 % and + 52 %, respectively). These findings point to a wide discrepancy between certified and on-road CO 2 and suggest that hybridisation alone is insufficient to achieve low NOX emissions of diesel powertrains. Instead, our simulation suggests that properly calibrated selective catalytic reduction filter (SCRF) and lean-NOX trap (LNT) aftertreatment technologies can reduce the on-road NOX emissions to 0. 023 g/km and 0. 068 g/km on average, well below the Euro 6 limit (0. 080 g/km).

40|$|Traditionally, the {{performance}} maps and emissions of a diesel engine are obtained empirically through many testes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>dynamometers</b> because no exact mathematical engine model exists. In the current literature, many artificial-neural-network- (ANN-) based approaches {{have been developed}} for diesel engine modelling. However, the drawbacks of ANN would make itself difficult to be put into some practices including multiple local minima, user burden on selection of optimal network structure, large training data size, and overfitting risk. To overcome the drawbacks, this paper proposes to apply one emerging technique, relevance vector machine (RVM), to model the diesel engine, and to predict the emissions and engine performance. With RVM, only a few experimental data sets can train the model due to the property of global optimal solution. In this study, the engine speed, load, and coolant temperature are used as the input parameters, while the brake thermal efficiency, brake-specific fuel consumption, concentrations of nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter are used as the output parameters. Experimental results show the model accuracy is fairly good even the training data is scarce. Moreover, the model accuracy is compared with that using typical ANN. Evaluation results also show that RVM is superior to typical ANN approach. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The University of Canterbury chassis {{dynamometer}} exists to enable specific and repeatable motor vehicle testing {{to be carried}} out in the University’s Department of Mechanical Engineering. Dynamometer testing is invaluable in the development of new vehicle technologies, such as electric and hybrid configurations, and the assessment of existing vehicles’ performance. This thesis includes a description of <b>the</b> <b>dynamometer,</b> and of <b>the</b> recalibration and software work that has been carried out to enable computer-controlled vehicle testing of a flexible and reliable nature. In order to exert a known force at the wheels of a vehicle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chassis <b>dynamometer,</b> <b>the</b> appropriate equations of motion must be applied to the known inertial mass and frictional characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>dynamometer</b> system. These equations of motion are discussed in terms of <b>the</b> chassis <b>dynamometer</b> and their application in the simulation of realistic on-road vehicle forces.
