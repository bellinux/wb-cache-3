It is not here that we must look for cause of the death rate".|$|E

50|$|Holland Furnace Company {{manufactured}} home furnaces. The company's {{marketing strategy}} involved door-to-door sales, which employed a large workforce. This model, if {{not unique to}} Holland Furnace, was nevertheless unusual. From the standpoint of Arnold Maremont, a businessman who had been purchasing Holland Furnace stock, it was unprofitable. These practices also implicated Holland Furnace in charges of unfair trade practices. (An investigation of these practices by the Federal Trade Commission had already been pending for {{a year at the}} time of the events underlying the decision in Cheff.) Sales representatives for Holland would go door to door posing as <b>official</b> <b>inspectors.</b> Claiming to be employed by the homeowner's utility or by the local government, these salesmen would dissassemble the furnace, refusing to reassemble it for lack of spare parts. Holland's core business lay in replacement boilers.|$|R

However, Wu Song manages to {{overpower}} and kill all the assailants before returning to Mengzhou to settle the score. He tracks down Jiang Zhong, Instructor Zhang and Inspector Zhang at Mandarin Ducks Tower (鴛鴦樓), and kills them and Inspector Zhang's entire family. He writes [...] "Wu Song is the killer" [...] in blood on a wall near the scene and flees from Mengzhou. He arrives at Cross Slope, where he meets Zhang Qing and Sun Erniang again.

5000|$|Aside {{from the}} crusades, Alphonse stayed {{primarily}} in Paris, governing his estates by <b>officials,</b> <b>inspectors</b> who reviewed the officials work, and {{a constant stream}} of messages. His main work was on his own estates. There he repaired the evils of the Albigensian war and made a first attempt at administrative centralization, thus preparing the way for union with the crown. The charter known as [...] "Alphonsine," [...] granted to the town of Riom, became the code of public law for Auvergne. Honest and moderate, protecting the middle classes against exactions of the nobles, he exercised a happy influence upon the south, in spite of his naturally despotic character and his continual and pressing need of money. He is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of Jews, when he did so in Poitou in 1249.|$|R

5000|$|Child labour was {{not seen}} as a problem {{throughout}} most of history, only disputed {{with the beginning of}} universal schooling and the concepts of labourers' and children's rights. Use of child labour was commonplace, often in factories. In England and Scotland in 1788, about two-thirds of persons working in water-powered textile factories were children. Child labour can be factory work, mining or quarrying, agriculture, helping in the parents' business, operating a small business (such as selling food), or doing odd jobs. Children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants (where they may also work). Other children do jobs such as assembling boxes or polishing shoes. However, rather than in factories and sweatshops, most child labour in the twenty-first century occurs in the informal sector, [...] "selling on the street, at work in agriculture or hidden away in houses — far from the reach of <b>official</b> <b>inspectors</b> and from media scrutiny." ...|$|R

40|$|Finnish food {{business}} operators' (FBOs) {{opinions of the}} food control inspections performed by local authorities were evaluated, using a questionnaire. The production types of FBOs included were slaughterhouses, meat, fish and milk plants, egg-packing plants and storage facilities dealing with foods of animal origin. Based on a total of 459 responses, we noted that the impacts of official controls were considered valuable for food safety, since 78. 8 % of the respondents saw that the actions taken based on inspections had enhanced {{the safety of the}} products. The results also highlighted the importance of inspectors being familiar with the production processes to increase the efficacy of food control. More frequent visits by <b>official</b> <b>inspectors</b> correlated positively with FBOs' conceptions of noncompliances being relevant for food safety. The FBOs saw local inspectors as the most important sources of new information concerning food safety legislation and 89. 1 % of the respondents confirmed that discussions with local inspectors had helped them understand the food safety risks within their processes. We also noted that the bigger the FBO, the more clearly they seem to perceive the risks associated with their processes (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0. 127, P = 0. 009) ...|$|R
5000|$|The Manor of Melford {{was given}} to the Abbey of St.Edmundsbury by Earl Aflric c. 1050. The village is {{recorded}} in the Domesday Book of 1086, which lists the manor of Long Melford as an estate of 600 hectares. The neighbouring Manor of Kentwell is also recorded. During the Middle Ages the village grew and gained a weekly market and an annual fair in 1235. [...] Long Melford survived the Black Death in 1348-9, and was a brief stop-off in the peasants' revolt in 1381.By the early 15th century, the manor of Kentwell belonged to the Clopton family. John Clopton was arrested in 1461 and charged with treason. Clopton was spared execution and he was released and returned to Kentwell. There he organised and largely helped to pay for the rebuilding of the parish church, a notable example of a wool church. During this time the wealth of the parish was increasing, with most of the inhabitants being free men, renting their homes and lands. Guilds were founded, and weaving cloth became {{a key part of the}} village's economy. In the <b>official</b> <b>inspector's</b> returns for the year 1446, there were as many as 30 named weavers in Long Melford, who between them produced 264 finished [...] "cloths".|$|R
