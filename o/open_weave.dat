50|$|You {{would make}} a very light weight nuno fabric by laying one layer of loose fiber onto an <b>open</b> <b>weave</b> fabric base, thus being {{suitable}} for a summer dress. A much heavier nuno fabric results from laying 3-4 layers of loose fibers onto an <b>open</b> <b>weave</b> base making fabric suitable for a winter coat. A pair of boots could be made using even more layers of fibers.|$|E

50|$|The nuno felting {{process is}} {{particularly}} suitable for creating lightweight fabrics {{used to make}} clothing. The use of silk or other stable fabric in the felt creates fabric that will not stretch out of shape.

50|$|Needlepoint {{is a form}} of counted thread {{embroidery}} {{in which}} yarn is stitched through a stiff <b>open</b> <b>weave</b> canvas. Most needlepoint designs completely cover the canvas. Although needlepoint may be worked in a variety of stitches, many needlepoint designs use only a simple tent stitch and rely upon color changes in the yarn to construct the pattern.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the SK-1 was of light-alloy {{stressed}} skin, {{with single}} plate web spar wings skinned with light-alloy sheet, smoothed to mirror finish accurate profiles using marquisette fabric, cork dust, <b>open</b> <b>weave</b> and adhesive as filler. Initially the wing was of NACA 23014.5 profile with slotted Vlasov style flaps, and fabric covered ailerons. The tail-unit also had fabric covered control surfaces, and trim tabs, with all controls 100% mass balanced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Pollinator {{exclusion}} {{bags for}} small herbaceous plants {{are much more}} convenient to apply and remove if their bottom edge {{is made in the}} form of a cloth tunnel loaded with sand to conform to the terrain. Damage and inadvertent selfing of flowers are minimized. Many experiments in pollination ecology require that pollinators be excluded from flowers. “Pollination bags ” are usually used for this: an open-ended bag of fabric is slid over a shoot and closed by pulling a drawstring or gathering the fabric and using something like a wire tie to keep it snug around the stem. Kearns & Inouye (1993, pp. 13 - 19) discuss this method and some of its problems. There is an acknowledged trade-off involving the mesh size of the fabric: more <b>open</b> <b>weaves</b> may not exclude small visitors such as thrips, but less permeable fabrics tend to cause overheating or condensation. Nevertheless, this technique is widely used. Our lab has adopted polyolefin soil sample bags (Hubco, Inc. ...|$|R
50|$|The sheet {{is usually}} held against the dryers by long felt loops {{on the top}} and bottom of each dryer section. The felts greatly improve heat transfer.

5000|$|... {{the fact}} that each fabric and fibre type {{responds}} differently to the dye also produces a “deconstructed” effect, whereby the consumer’s attention is drawn to the construction techniques of the jacket. For example: a more densely woven fabric absorbs the colour less intensely than a more <b>open</b> <b>weave,</b> the polyester stitching used for a cotton garment does not absorb any dye colour, producing a contrast colour stitch etc.|$|E
50|$|Metal fibre, metal foil, {{and metal}} wire {{have a variety}} of uses, {{including}} the production of cloth-of-gold and jewellery. Hardware cloth (US term only) is a coarse woven mesh of steel wire, used in construction. It is much like standard window screening, but heavier and with a more <b>open</b> <b>weave.</b> It is sometimes used together with screening on the lower part of screen doors, to resist scratching by dogs. It serves similar purposes as chicken wire, such as fences for poultry and traps for animal control.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} nd {{the right balance}} between exibility and expressive-ness, current aspect-oriented {{technologies}} provide a predened set of se-lection and combination mechanisms to drive the weaving process. If a programmer wants to use specialized mechanisms beyond the possibili-ties of this set, he must resort {{to a combination of}} mapping onto existing mechanisms and hand coding into the application. Establishing a xed set of mechanisms considerably limits the usefullness of aspect-oriented programming both at weave-time and at run-time. As a result, building advanced reusable systems becomes hard. In this position paper we propose a rst step towards a more <b>open</b> <b>weaving</b> process for AspectJ by introducing a generic way to describe joinpoints through a two step process of enumeration and restriction. By means of some examples, we show that this technique enables very exible deployment decisions. And although the ideas are not fully mature yet, we also try to discuss {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the approach...|$|R

50|$|The Canadian Handicrafts Guild is a {{significant}} organization in Canadian history whose impact extended well beyond the promotion of arts and culture. During the Depression, for instance, the Guild <b>opened</b> a <b>weaving</b> school in Montréal to train instructors to teach weaving to farmers in Manitoba and Alberta. Crop failures in these provinces left land workers with no money to purchase clothing. The instruction program initiated by the Guild enabled workers in Manitoba and Alberta to weave their own fabric for clothing.|$|R
5000|$|Anti-pilling finish alleviates pilling, an {{unpleasant}} phenomenon associated with spun yarn fabrics, {{especially when they}} contain synthetics. Synthetic fibers are more readily brought {{to the surface of}} a fabric due to their smooth surface and circular cross-section, and due to their higher tensile strength and abrasion resistance. With knit [...] "picking" [...] also occurs: by abrasion, individual fibers work themselves out of yarn loops onto the surface, and the garment catches on a pointed or rough object. Knitting is susceptible to these effects due to the <b>open</b> <b>weave</b> and bulky yarn.|$|E
5000|$|Gauze is a thin, {{translucent}} fabric with a [...] <b>open</b> <b>weave.</b> In {{technical terms}} [...] "gauze" [...] is a weave structure {{in which the}} weft yarns are arranged in pairs and are crossed before and after each warp yarn keeping the weft firmly in place. [...] This weave structure is used to add stability to fabric, which is important when using fine yarns loosely spaced. However, this weave structure {{can be used with}} any weight of yarn, and can be seen in some rustic textiles made from coarse hand-spun plant fiber yarns.|$|E
50|$|The {{materials}} used in the manufacturing of gauze sponges for medical purposes include cotton and non-woven materials. In addition to its many sizes, plys, and fabrics, gauze sponges can also be sterile and non-sterile. The <b>open</b> <b>weave</b> design of gauze sponges assists with the removal of dead tissue from the skin surface as well as vertically wick fluid from the wound onto any secondary dressing to assist with preventing maceration of skin tissue. In order to avoid leaving gauze sponges in bodies, some kinds of gauze sponge are woven with X-ray detectable thread.|$|E
50|$|Tawney's weavings {{fall into}} three categories: the solid {{straight}} <b>weaving,</b> the <b>open</b> warp <b>weave,</b> and the mesh or screen woven as background for solid areas. Tawney often went beyond traditional definitions of weaving, including needlework to add action {{to the line}} of a woven design. Furthering her experimentation, Tawney began creating what she called “woven forms”. These totem-like sculptural weavings abandoned the rectangular format of traditional tapestries, and were suspended from the ceiling off the wall. She sometimes incorporated found objects such as feathers and shells into these pieces.|$|R

[...] The original Flemish family name was 'de Witte'. The word 'witte' means 'white' in Flemish and that is why the family adopted the Italian family name' Candido' in Italy, an Italian word which also means 'white'.

The typically geometric designs also included drawings of plants, animals such as fish, cats, birds, monkeys and dogs (most notably the hairless Peruvian dog) as well as human figures. Birds and deities wearing crescent-like headdresses were one of the more common decorative features. They produced a variety of goods such as clothing, bags, and funeral masks.|$|E
5000|$|Owing to its durability, <b>open</b> <b>weave,</b> {{naturally}} non-shiny refraction {{and fuzzy}} texture, Ghillie suits for 3-D camouflage are often made of hessian.
