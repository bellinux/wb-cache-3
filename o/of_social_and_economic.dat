5|$|A {{more recent}} theory, with broad support among archaeologists, is that Celtic culture and {{language}} arrived in Ireland {{as a result}} of cultural diffusion. This theory proposes that the Celticisation of Ireland may have been the culmination of a long process <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> interaction between Ireland, Britain and adjacent parts of Continental Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} governing {{institutions of}} medieval Birmingham – including the Guild of the Holy Cross and the lordship of the de Birmingham family – collapsed between 1536 and 1547, leaving {{the town with}} an unusually high degree <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> freedom and initiating a period of transition and growth. By 1700 Birmingham's population had increased fifteenfold and the town was the fifth-largest in England and Wales.|$|E

5|$|The full {{understanding}} {{of the history of}} the late Soviet Union and of its successor, the Russian Federation, requires the assessment of the legacy of Leonid Brezhnev, the third General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and twice Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Leonid Brezhnev was the leader of the CPSU from 1964 until his death in 1982, whose eighteen-year reign was recognised as the time <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> stagnation in the late Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Deckham {{is an area}} <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> deprivation, in the top ten {{per cent}} of such areas {{according}} to the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Housing stock is predominantly council housing and is, in many places, outdated {{and in need of}} modernisation. Whilst once the site of a coal mine, there is today no major employer in Deckham, which is considered a residential suburb of Gateshead. The main economic activity is in a commercial development on Old Durham Road. Deckham has a number of public houses, one of which, the Plough Inn, is more than 150 years old. The only education provision is at South Street Primary School, which is a good school according to OFSTED. There are two churches, one of which, the Church of St George, is a Grade II listed building, and community facilities are provided by Deckham Community Centre and the Elgin Centre in Carr Hill.|$|E

25|$|Overall, Nunn was a moderate-to-conservative Democrat {{who often}} broke with his party {{on a host}} <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> issues.

25|$|In {{response}} to the religious transformation hypothesis, Ronald Inglehart piloted the renewal of the secularization hypothesis. His argument hinges {{on the premise that}} religion develops to fill the human need for security. Therefore, the development <b>of</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> <b>economic</b> security in Europe explains its corresponding secularization {{due to a lack of}} need for religion. However, religion continues in the third world where social and economic insecurity are rampant. The overall effect is expected to be a growing cultural disparity.|$|E
25|$|The process {{continued}} also in post-Trianon era.
