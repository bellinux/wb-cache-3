5|$|About a {{third to}} a half of {{individuals}} with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from {{the first year of}} life, and may include delayed onset of babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests <b>or</b> <b>share</b> experiences, {{and are more likely to}} simply repeat others' words (echolalia) or reverse pronouns. Joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on <b>or</b> <b>share</b> an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.|$|E
5|$|Mid-year of 1967, Imelda {{started the}} Seed Disposal Program <b>or</b> <b>Share</b> for Progress, {{a project that}} {{suggested}} making vegetable gardens out of idle lots all over the country. 309,392 kits containing seeds were distributed in over 1,500 towns by 1968.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{faithful}} {{are obliged to}} attend Mass {{unless there is a}} grave impediment, pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept.... Yet more than a precept, the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of Christian life. It is crucially important that all {{the faithful}} should be convinced that they cannot live their faith <b>or</b> <b>share</b> fully {{in the life of the}} Christian community unless they take part regularly in the Sunday Eucharistic assembly.|$|E

In senior houses, boarding students share rooms for four people, and in the sixth form students either have single rooms <b>or</b> <b>share</b> with one other person. Students have a personal tutor to discuss their progress, and boarding students have a house parent who communicates with parents at home.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Navy {{became the}} first team other than Hopkins to defeat Maryland since 1954. That same year marked the start of Navy's eight-year {{national}} championship streak that lasted through 1967. That season, Navy beat Maryland 10–8, before traveling to Homewood Field. There, Johns Hopkins upset Navy, 9–6, {{for the first time}} in their last ten meetings. The Blue Jays and Terrapins met for the season finale where Hopkins needed a victory to win the national title outright. Maryland acted as a spoiler, however, and beat Johns Hopkins, 9–5, to take a share of the championship. Hopkins went on to win <b>or</b> <b>share</b> the next four national titles.|$|E
5|$|In 613 Laurence consecrated {{the monastery}} church built by Augustine in Canterbury, and {{dedicated}} it to saints Peter and Paul; {{it was later}} re-consecrated as St Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury. Laurence also wrote to the bishops in the lands held by the Scots and by the Britons, urging them to hold Easter {{on the day that}} the Roman church celebrated it, instead of their traditional date, part of the Easter controversy. The letter is also preserved in Bede's history. Laurence in 609 stated that Dagan, a native bishop, would not eat with Laurence <b>or</b> <b>share</b> a roof with the archbishop, due to {{the differences between the two}} Churches.|$|E

5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or non-metal) is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), have low elasticity, and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, {{they tend to have}} high ionization energy and electronegativity values, and gain <b>or</b> <b>share</b> electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E
5|$|The Assembly was {{strictly}} {{under the control}} of Parliament, and was only to debate topics which Parliament directed. Assembly members were not permitted to state their disagreements with majority opinions <b>or</b> <b>share</b> any information about the proceedings, except in writing to Parliament. Parliament chose William Twisse, an internationally respected theologian, to be the Assembly's prolocutor or chairman. Due to Twisse's ill health, Cornelius Burges, whom Parliament appointed as one of several assessors, served as prolocutor pro tempore for most of the Assembly. Twenty-two appointed members of the Assembly died before 1649, and they along with those who did not attend for other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members. Three non-voting scribes were also added in 1643.|$|E
5|$|Roguelike-likes are {{generally}} much shorter games {{intended to be}} winnable within a single gaming session, in contrast to traditional roguelikes that are designed for multiple sessions of gameplay. Associated with their short length, many roguelike-likes feature a metagame, whereby achieving certain goals will unlock features {{such as the ability}} to select a new character {{at the start of the}} game or the addition of new items and monsters in the procedural generation of the game's levels. Several roguelike-likes feature daily challenges, in which a preset random seed is used to generate the game's levels in a deterministic fashion so that each player will have the same encounters; players attempt to complete the game through those levels or otherwise get the highest score through online leaderboards. Roguelike-likes may also allow the player to enter the random seed directly as to be able to rechallenge the same set of levels <b>or</b> <b>share</b> a difficult set of levels with other players.|$|E

5|$|Siddhaya was a {{local tax}} levied on {{agriculture}} and pottondi was a tax levied on merchandise by the local feudal ruler. Based on context, pottondi also meant 1/10, aydalavi meant 1/5 and elalavi meant 1/7. Mannadare literally meant land tax and was levied together with shepherds tax (Kurimbadere) payable to the chief of shepherds. Bhaga meant a portion <b>or</b> <b>share</b> of the produce from land or the land area itself. Minor taxes such as Kirudere (due to the landlords) and samathadere (raised by the army officers or samantha) are mentioned. In addition to taxes for maintenance of the local officer's retinue, villages were obligated to feed armies on the march to and from battles. Bittuvatta or niravari taxes comprised usually of {{a percentage of the}} produce and was collected for constructing irrigation tanks.|$|E
5|$|Players can add non-Steam {{games to}} their libraries, {{allowing}} {{the game to}} be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam Overlay features. The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way, third-party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some modifications free-of-charge; and modifications that use Steamworks can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game. For most games launched from Steam, the client provides an in-game overlay that can be accessed by a keystroke. From the overlay, the user can access his or her Steam Community lists and participate in chat, manage selected Steam settings, and access a built-in web browser without having to exit the game. Since the beginning of February 2011 as a beta version, the overlay also allows players to take screenshots of the games in process; it automatically stores these and allows the player to review, delete, <b>or</b> <b>share</b> them during or after his or her game session. As a full version on February 24, 2011, this feature was reimplemented so that users could share screenshots on websites of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit straight from a user's screenshot manager.|$|E

25|$|A {{dividend}} is {{a payment}} {{made by a}} corporation to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, the corporation is able to re-invest the profit in the business (called retained earnings) and pay a proportion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Distribution to shareholders may be in cash (usually a deposit into a bank account) or, if the corporation has a dividend reinvestment plan, the amount can be paid by the issue of further shares <b>or</b> <b>share</b> repurchase.|$|E
