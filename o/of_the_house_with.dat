5|$|Throughout the years, {{the unusual}} nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>with</b> Chimaeras {{has given rise}} to a number of stories {{occasionally}} repeated in guide-books or newspapers, which are however either untrue or lacking any verifiable source.|$|E
5|$|After {{attempts}} to persuade Muchlisin {{to keep the}} original design fail, Sakera overhears that the house is on disputed land. Maida uses the information, as well as feedback from a traditional musical group distantly related to Pahing, {{to discover that the}} house has a secret underground bunker, in which she and Sakera– with whom she has begun to fall in love– find documents showing the history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>With</b> the help of her mother's former lover Kuan (Henky Solaiman), she discovers the true ownership of the house.|$|E

5|$|The {{house at}} Valley View is a two-story brick Greek Revival-style {{structure}} with a rectangular architectural plan. The front entrance {{is covered by}} a small portico, topped with a pediment supported by wooden Doric columns. The rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>with</b> a two-story (double) wood porch stretching across it, faces the South Branch Potomac River valley and Mill Creek Mountain. Each of the original eight large rooms of the 1855 structure contains a fireplace framed by a wooden trabeated mantelpiece with classical elements. The original windows, wooden trim, and materials in the main section of the house are intact. In 2012, Valley View was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its locally significant architecture.|$|E
5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the issue to the senators, who discussed the matter by order of seniority. Unimportant matters could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands, while important votes resulted in a physical division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>with</b> senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E

5|$|After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother's {{personal}} {{photographs and}} belongings removed {{and some of}} them destroyed, especially material relating to John Brown, whom he detested. Queen Victoria had intended the house to be a private, secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life. However, the new King had no need for the house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a convalescent home, opening the state apartments to the public, and constructing a Naval College on the grounds. His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Queen Victoria had bequeathed them houses on the estate, and the privacy promised to them by their mother was threatened. When Edward discussed the fate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.|$|E
5|$|Decatur House (748 Jackson Place NW) is {{allegedly}} {{haunted by}} the ghost of Stephen Decatur. In 1820, Commodore James Barron challenged Commodore Decatur to a duel over comments Decatur had made regarding Barron's conduct in the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair of 1807. The two men duelled on March 20, and Decatur was mortally wounded in the stomach. Decatur was rushed back to his home, and died there on March 22. A year after Decatur's death, his ghost reportedly began appearing at the house—standing in a second floor window looking out at H Street NW or leaving the back door <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> a box of dueling pistols. So many witnesses saw the specter of Decatur that the window was walled up. Some people have also claimed that they can hear his widow, who became hysterical at his death, weeping in the house.|$|E
5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>with</b> a separate entrance and staircase leading up to it. At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E

5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank {{for the next}} twenty years. The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth of}} Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys bought their first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who noticed that the house was on fire. He pounded on the door until Glen awoke and rushed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.|$|E
5|$|The formal {{gardens and}} {{pleasure}} grounds are situated {{close to the}} house, with an area of informal pleasure grounds extending to the south-east. Two features are the Cedar Walk and the Lime Walk, both majestic avenues {{to the south of}} the house, as well as a plantation known as Blind Wood. There is a terrace in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>with</b> urns and vases, overlooking an extensive lawned area. Other features include a Victorian fernery and a sunken garden. To the west of the house, there is a rose garden with a central circular lawn. The kitchen garden lies to the south of the pleasure grounds and is now a commercial nursery. The house and gardens {{are open to the public}} and in 2012 received about 230,000 visitors.|$|E
5|$|The tariff fight {{continued}} into the 50th Congress, which opened in 1887, in which Democrats retained control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> <b>with</b> a reduced majority. By that time, Cleveland had openly sided with the tariff reformers and backed the proposals introduced in 1888 by Representative Roger Q. Mills of Texas. Mills had replaced Morrison at Ways and Means after the latter's defeat for reelection, and was as {{much in favor of}} tariff reform as the Illinoisan had been. Mills's bill would make small cuts to tariffs on raw materials, but relatively deeper cuts to those on manufactured goods; Randall, representing a manufacturing district, opposed it immediately. Randall was again ill and absent from the House when the Mills tariff passed by a 162 to 149 vote. The Senate, now Republican-controlled, refused to consider the bill, and it died with the 50th Congress in 1889.|$|E

5|$|William Moreton III used what {{is today}} {{known as the}} Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the {{adjoining}} Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style tempera painting, thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>with</b> a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.|$|E

25|$|Nancy Russell's will bequeathed both {{structures}} (but not their contents) {{to the city}} of Great Falls, and the city parks commission operated them until 1991 (when they were turned over to the museum).

Nash Edwards-Vaughan added several other features to the parkland. A chapel (later demolished) had been built, overlooking the lake, and substantial ornamental tree planting in the park from the period still survives.|$|E
