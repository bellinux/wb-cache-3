40|$|Higher {{education}} (HE) {{has changed}} from elite to mass education (HSV 2006 : 26 R, Leathwood & Read 2009). In the last few decades, {{the number of women}} in higher education has increased substantially in most OECD countries. Sweden ́s reform of HE in 1993 encourages university institutions to develop new degree programs (SFS 1993 : 100). This opened opportunities for the development of programs designed to attract women and men in equal numbers but the result was disappointing. According to a Swedish study, an increasing number of new degree programs attract almost exclusively one gender (Witt 2009, Nelson et al 2009). It is a well- established fact that technical educations are male-dominated while care-related educations are predominantly chosen by women. This paper investigates the motivations for choice reported by 620 students in 17 programs. We have categorized these motives as follows: knowledge seeking; working life orientation; shoulder responsibility for society; program design; second choice and “follow the map”. Moreover, the paper discusses how gender-segregated educational choices may affect the future opportunities of student in terms <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> careers, <b>income</b> development and, consequently, social standing and life styles. To study gender segregation within HE is like looking at a three dimensional picture.

He thinking so, and being a man of good courage, took a resolution to follow his game, and to see whether even yet he might not obtain the good things which had made his eyes glisten and his mouth water. He knew that there was very much against him in the race that he was desirous of running, and that an heiress with--he did not know how much a year, but it had been rumoured among the Stumfoldians that it was over a thousand--might not again fall in his way.

30|$|The {{remuneration}} {{system of}} a PSF determines how its professionals are paid. The simplest type of remuneration system pays every <b>professional</b> a fixed <b>income</b> {{according to his}} or her position. For incentive reasons, at least part <b>of</b> a <b>professional’s</b> <b>income</b> will often be contingent on performance, even if the professional is not an owner of the firm. We differentiate between three different types of contingent income. First, lockstep remuneration divides the income that is contingent on firm performance according to seniority. The lockstep remuneration system is considered the traditional profit sharing system for PSFs with internal ownership, especially partnerships. Historically, partnerships in the US were required to have profit-sharing rules close to equal sharing (Levin and Tadelis 2005, 156). Under this system, all partners of a certain seniority level (i.e., who have been partners for the same number of years) receive the same profit share, irrespective of their billings or any other performance measure. However, the concept of dividing contingent income according to seniority is applicable to non-partner professionals as well. The lockstep system is thought to facilitate collegial interaction among professionals, such as internal referrals, knowledge sharing, and teamwork, since “the only way to improve individual remuneration is to improve overall profitability” (Angel 2007, 204). A drawback of the lockstep system is that free-riding and shirking are encouraged if collegial controls among profit-sharing professionals fail (e.g., Fama and Jensen 1983 a; Leibowitz and Tollison 1980). Second, eat-what-you-kill remuneration awards contingent income according to some measure of individual output that makes a direct contribution to firm profits, such as client charges or hours billed. More and more firms have introduced performance-based elements into their remuneration system in recent years, both on the partner level (e.g., Griffiths 2005) and on the non-partner level (e.g., Williams 2007), although the elite British law firms especially have been reluctant to abandon the lockstep system (Angel 2007; Begum 2007). The eat-what-you-kill system discourages free-riding and shirking and makes it easier to retain “star” professionals that contribute disproportionately strongly to total firm profits (Levin and Tadelis 2005), possibly at the expense of collegiality, since time spent supporting other professionals may not be counted as own contribution to firm profits and thus may not be incentivized financially. While lockstep and eat-what-you-kill remuneration have been the focus of the PSF literature, we will introduce a third type of remuneration system: Scorecard remuneration determines contingent income according to some measure of individual behavior, such as feedback on client interaction, leadership skills, etc. provided by other professionals or even clients. Of course, all three systems can be combined in the compensation <b>of</b> a single <b>professional,</b> yet they represent conceptually distinct remuneration systems.|$|R

60|$|Nor is {{this mode}} of {{appointment}} the only evil that has been adopted in the State judicatures. The judges {{in most of the}} States are not appointed for life, nor even during good behavior. They enter their places for a certain term of years, varying from fifteen down, I believe, to seven. I do not know whether any are appointed for a term of less than seven years. When they go out they have no pensions; and as a lawyer who has been on the bench for seven years can hardly recall his practice, and find himself at once in receipt <b>of</b> his old <b>professional</b> <b>income,</b> it may easily be imagined how great will be the judge's anxiety to retain his position on the bench. This he can do only by the universal suffrages of the people, by political popularity, and a general standing of that nature which enables a man to come forth as the favorite candidate of the lower orders. This {{may or may not be}} well when the place sought for is one of political power--when the duties required are political in all their bearings. But no one can think it well when the place sought for is a judge's seat on the bench--when the duties required are solely judicial. Whatever hitherto may have been the conduct of the judges in the courts of the different States, whether or no impurity has yet crept in, and the sanctity of justice has yet been outraged, no one can doubt the tendency of such an arrangement. At present even a few visits to the courts constituted in this manner will convince an observer that the judges on the bench are rather inferior than superior to the lawyers who practice before them. The manner of address, the tone of voice, the lack of dignity in the judge, and the assumption by the lawyer before him of a higher authority than his, all tell this tale. And then the judges in these courts are not paid at a rate which will secure the services of the best men. They vary in the different States, running from about 600l. to about 1000l. per annum. But a successful lawyer, practicing in the courts in which these judges sit, not unfrequently earns 3000l. a year. A <b>professional</b> <b>income</b> <b>of</b> 2000l. a year is not considered very high. When the different conditions of the bench are considered, when it is remembered that the judge may lose his place after a short term of years, and that during that short term of years he receives a payment much less than that earned by his successful professional brethren, it can hardly be expected that first-rate judges should be found. The result is seen daily in society. You meet Judge This and Judge That, not knowing whether they are ex-judges or in-judges; but you soon learn that your friends do not hold any very high social position on account of their forensic dignity.|$|R
