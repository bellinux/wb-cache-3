40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> marks a {{milestone}} in international climate policy. Though, the positive appraisal was not unanimous. This article will argue that <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> embraces a new paradigm. Climate change is no longer seen as a clear-cut environmental problem, nor as a developmental issue, but {{as a challenge to}} fundamentally transform global societies. While criticism through the lens of the former paradigms is worthwhile, <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> should be acknowledged as a pacemaker for the transformation processes that lay ahead of us...|$|R
5000|$|Another key {{difference}} between <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> and <b>the</b> Kyoto Protocol is their scopes. While the Kyoto Protocol differentiated between Annex-1 and non-Annex-1 countries, this bifurcation is blurred in <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement,</b> as all parties {{will be required}} to submit emissions reductions plans. While <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> still emphasizes <b>the</b> principle of [...] "Common but Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities"—the acknowledgement that different nations have different capacities and duties to climate action—it does not provide a specific division between developed and developing nations.|$|R

50|$|Article 28 of the {{agreement}} enables parties to withdraw from {{the agreement}} after sending a withdrawal notification to the depositary, but notice can be given no earlier than three years after the agreement goes into force for the country. Withdrawal is effective one year after the depositary is notified. Alternatively, the Agreement stipulates that withdrawal from the UNFCCC, under which <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> was adopted, would also withdraw the state from <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement.</b> <b>The</b> conditions for withdrawal from the UNFCCC are the same as for <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} of <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> is its “enhanced transparency framework”, set out in Article 13. Transparency of action and support is of crucial importance for the functioning of <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement,</b> as it can: help build trust and confidence among Parties; foster shared understandings by clarifying the information underlying Parties’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs); help mobilise domestic support for stronger climate action and further support; improve efficacy of action through enhanced learning; and hold Parties accountable for implementing their actions and maintaining and increasing their levels of ambition. This paper offers an analysis {{of some of the}} major questions raised by <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> with regard to transparency, {{in the form of a}} commentary on Article 13 as well as other provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> and Decision 1 /CP. 21 that pertain to the issue. On the basis of our analysis, we identify several areas where <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> has left gaps in building a comprehensive and coherent transparency system, and offer recommendations. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Implementation of <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> {{would require}} {{transformative}} technologies, {{policies and measures}} to stabilize warming in the range 1. 5 - 2 degrees C. Operationalization of <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement</b> would necessitate large-scale estimation, monitoring, modelling, reporting and verification of GHG inventories, mitigation actions and their implications and co-benefits, along with reporting on climate change impacts and adaptation. This article highlights the need for research, modelling, monitoring, reporting and data requirements for India, keeping in mind the need for transparency, accuracy, completeness, consistency and comparability. Further, India will have to initiate largescale research and data generation for operationalization of <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> <b>Agreement...</b>|$|R
