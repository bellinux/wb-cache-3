2500|$|A recent {{trend has}} been to reframe Jewish {{theology}} {{through the lens of}} process philosophy, more specifically process theology.

[...] According to this notion, what people commonly think of as concrete objects are actually successions <b>of</b> these <b>occasions</b> <b>of</b> experience. <b>Occasions</b> <b>of</b> experience can be collected into groupings; something complex such as a human being is thus a grouping <b>of</b> many smaller <b>occasions</b> <b>of</b> experience. In this view, everything in the universe is characterized by experience (not to be confused with consciousness); there is no mind-body duality under this system, because [...] "mind" [...] is simply seen as a very developed kind of experiencing entity.|$|R
