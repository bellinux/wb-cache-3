40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the {{constitutional}} roles <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> in Nigeria: issues and challenges. The creation <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> in Nigeria is meant to support the locals on their budding future in a platform purposely created for representation in the political administration of a State and the Federal Government. The aim of the paper is to discuss the roles <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> as provided by the 1999 Constitution of the federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended 2011. In addition, to examine the laws <b>of</b> the <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> and further analyses the loopholes in the legal relations between the <b>Local</b> <b>Governments</b> in Nigeria and the States. The methodology adopted by the paper is content analysis approach wherein related literatures were discussed and analysed, particularly the local laws and other relevant documents. The findings of the paper reveal that firm control <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> by the States especially through the Joint Accounts negates the developmental purposes <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>government’s</b> creation in Nigeria. In view of this, therefore, the paper suggests that for the realisation of the ultimate purpose of creation and maintaining the system, the silent constitutional lacuna <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>government’s</b> autonomy and other related issues highlighted in the paper should be address...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} mutual {{reference}} behavior <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> in Japan. The Japanese public education system was decentralized {{in the previous}} decade. For example, actual fixed number of classes was relaxed in 2001 and 2003. This relaxation of regulations caused {{an increase in the}} expenditure <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> on Japanese public education. After national regulation relaxed under the condition <b>of</b> children decline, <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> tended to reference the decision making <b>of</b> other <b>local</b> <b>governments.</b> Consequently, this paper analyzed the mutual reference behavior in Japanese public education. In addition, it inferred that population aging had some impact on public education expenditure. This paper provides a tentative conclusion on the relaxation of regulations on education. The expenditure <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> on public education is positively affected by the expenditure <b>of</b> other <b>local</b> <b>governments.</b> <b>Local</b> <b>governments</b> should increase expenditure on public education if other <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> do so. In addition, the decision making <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> is affected by not only neighboring governments but also all other governments. If this decision making were affected only by neighborhood, the effect of mutual reference behaviors would probably be small. In addition, this paper also shows that <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> may decrease public education expenditure, considering the progressive aging of society.
