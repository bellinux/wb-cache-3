The May 4, 1942 issue of Time magazine noted Rutherford's burial at Rossville, New York, on Staten Island; a private burial plot for Watch Tower branch volunteers is on Woodrow Road. In 2002, a caretaker at the immediately adjoining graveyard answered an inquiry about Watch Tower's graveyard by noting, [...] "I couldn't tell you who is buried <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it has absolutely no markers or headstones".|$|E

Once I picked my jaw up off the floor, I was really keen to get started working <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> it's such an epic sequence." ...|$|E
500|$|Ultimate Play the Game, {{represented}} by its co-founding brothers, Tim and Chris Stamper, was uncommonly taciturn {{in matters of}} press and marketing, though they provided some details on Knight Lore development to Crash magazine. While Knight Lore was released as the third game in the Sabreman series, the Stamper brothers had finished it first. They withheld the game {{for about a year}} for market reasons: they thought that Knight Lore advancements—copyrighted as the Filmation engine—would hurt sales of their upcoming Sabre Wulf, and used the extra time to prepare another Filmation game (Alien 8) to preempt the sales that would be lost when other publishers would try to copy the technique. [...] "We just had to sit <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> everyone else was so far behind," [...] Tim Stamper recalled. Sabre Wulf was released to commercial and critical success in 1984. Alien 8 and the next two Sabreman titles—Underwurlde and Knight Lore—followed in close succession {{before the end of the}} year.|$|E

500|$|While Campbell feared {{televised}} hockey {{would cause}} people to stop attending games in person, Smythe felt the opposite.

[...] They'll be sold <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> it's a great game, and they won't be satisfied to stay [...] but {{will turn out to}} the rinks." [...] As an experiment in the 1956–57 season, CBS first broadcast hockey games in the United States. [...] Amazed with the initial popularity of the broadcasts, it inaugurated a 21-game package of games the following year. The NHL itself adapted to become viewer-friendly. [...] In 1949, to make the puck easier to see, the league mandated the ice surface painted white. [...] In 1951, so each team was distinguishable on black and white television, the League required home teams wear colored jerseys, and the road teams wear white. [...] For the same reason, teams painted the centre red line in a checkered pattern to set it apart from the solid blue lines.|$|E
500|$|Sound {{effects from}} {{previous}} games, {{such as that}} of the judge's gavel, were remade for Dual Destinies: Toshihiko Horiyama, the game's sound director, re-imagined the original [...] "crisp and dry" [...] gavel effect as one where the initial sound of the gavel peaks early, leading into the richer sound of the gavel's core. He went through a similar process for all the effects, trying to both preserve the original sounds and revitalize them. After Horiyama came up with a sound concept, the game's sound designer, Amagishi, created the sound based <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Because</b> of the improved hardware capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS compared to the Nintendo DS, the development team was able to use unprocessed sounds of real instruments at some points in the music, such as in the title track, which features Iwadare playing the trombone. A feature was implemented where the game detects whether headphones are plugged into the Nintendo 3DS, and it adjusts the audio output to be optimal for the player's current setup. While Capcom staff provided all voice acting in previous Ace Attorney games, Dual Destinies instead used professional voice actors, with some smaller roles being handled by Capcom staff. Only the cutscenes are fully voiced; this was a deliberate choice, as the developers wanted to give the player the freedom to read dialogue in whatever kind of voice they want in their head. Eshiro also said that full voice acting would ruin the game's pacing and tempo.|$|E

Without access to modern day samplers at the time, Lillywhite had to match the tempos of the two tape recordings by hand and then, as they played, transfer the requested sections of each onto a half-inch tape recorder. He said it [...] "was never all played at the same time; it was a real mish-mash of two things." [...] Lanois said Lillywhite's final mix was much different from his and Eno's version, leaning more heavily on effects and overdubs: [...] "I wouldn't have had as many effects <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> <b>because</b> we had a bit of a purist attitude toward some of these recordings, essentially that there was a sound that was captured in performance in a room, and we wanted to remain loyal to that space, to convey that sound.

2500|$|A Red Cow born by a {{caesarean}} section, the hire of a harlot, or {{the price}} of a dog was invalid. Rabbi Eliezer ruled it valid, for [...] states, [...] "You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or {{the price of}} a dog into the house of the Lord your God," [...] and the Red Cow was not brought into the Temple. The Mishnah taught that all blemishes that caused consecrated animals to be invalid as sacrifices also caused the Red Cow to be invalid. If one had ridden on the cow, leaned on it, hung on its tail, crossed a river with its help, doubled up its leading rope, or put one's cloak on it, the cow was invalid. But if one had only fastened it by its leading rope or made for it a sandal to prevent it from slipping, or spread one's cloak <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>because</b> of flies, it remained valid. The general rule was that wherever one did something for its own sake, the cow remained valid; but if one did something for the sake of another purpose, it invalidated the cow. If a bird rested on the cow, it remained valid. If a bull mounted it, it became invalid; but Rabbi Judah ruled that if people brought the bull to mate with the cow, the cow became invalid, but if the bull did so on its own, the cow remained valid.|$|E
