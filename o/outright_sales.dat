For both schemes, we derive a critical transfer payment that induces a bank manager to participate. Participation improves the bank's solvency and enables the bank to grant new loans. Therefore, both schemes can reestablish stability and avoid a credit crunch. However, an <b>outright</b> <b>sale</b> will be less costly to taxpayers than a repurchase agreement only if the transfer payment is sufficiently low.

5000|$|Investment in land {{often takes}} the form of {{long-term}} leases, as opposed to outright purchases, of land. These leases often range between 25 and 99 years. Such leases are usually undertaken between national or district governments and investors. Because the majority of land in Africa is categorized as “non-private" [...] as a result of government policies on public land ownership and a lack of active titling, governments own or control most of the land that is available for purchase or lease.

50|$|By {{effectively}} {{ending the}} practice of subinfeudation, Quia Emptores hastened the end of feudalism in England, which had already been on the decline for quite some time. Direct feudal obligations were increasingly being replaced by cash rents and <b>outright</b> <b>sales</b> of land which gave rise to {{the practice of}} livery and maintenance or bastard feudalism, the retention and control by the nobility of land, money, soldiers and servants via direct salaries, land sales and rent payments. This would later develop into one of the underlying causes of the Wars of the Roses, the English civil wars fought by the House of York and House of Lancaster for control of the English Crown from 1455 to 1485. By the mid-fifteenth century the major nobility, particularly the Houses of York and Lancaster, were able to assemble vast estates, considerable sums of money and large private armies on retainer through post-Quia Emptores land management practices and direct sales of land. The two noble Houses thus grew more powerful than the Crown itself, with the consequent wars between them for control of the realm.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a marketing channel depends on its information structure. It is high when both manufacturer and retailers have accurate information about demand conditions. Accordingly, in the case where only the manufacturer has such information, it has an incentive to transmit its information to the retailers. In the <b>outright</b> <b>sales</b> contracts (spot-market transactions), the manufacturer overstates demand conditions to encourage large orders by the retailers and thus earn a large profit. Hence, the retailers {{do not believe the}} transmitted information.

40|$|Under a {{revenue-sharing}} contract, {{a retailer}} pays a supplier a wholesale price for each unit purchased plus {{a percentage of}} the revenue the retailer generates. Such contracts have become more prevalent in the video cassette rental industry relative to the more conventional wholesale price contract. This paper studies revenue-sharing contracts in a general supply chain model with revenues determined by each retailer’s purchase quantity and price. Demand can be deterministic or stochastic and revenue is generated either from rentals or <b>outright</b> <b>sales.</b> Our model includes the case of a supplier selling to a classical fixed-price newsvendor or a price-setting newsvendor. We demonstrate that revenue sharing coordinates a supply chain with a single retailer (i. e., the retailer chooses optimal price and quantity) and arbitrarily allocates the supply chain’s profit. We compare revenue sharing to a number of other supply chain contracts (e. g., buy-back contracts, price-discount contracts...|$|E

40|$|We {{construct}} a dynamic game to model a monopoly of finitely durable goods. The solution concept is Markov perfect equilibria with general equilibria embedded in every time period. Our model is {{flexible enough to}} simultaneously explain or accommodate many commonly observed phenomena or stylized facts, such as concurrent leasing and selling, active secondary markets for used goods, heterogeneous consumers, endogenous consumption patterns, depreciation, an infinite time horizon, and non-trivial transaction costs. Within our model, consumers have incentives to segment themselves into various consumption classes according to their willingness to pay; and non-trivial transaction costs to sell used goods put strong constraints on consumers consumption sequences in time. As {{a direct consequence of}} the finite durability the market power of the monopolist remains intact. Leasing manifests itself as a facilitator of price discrimination, by de-bundling the durable good into new and used portions that are naturally bundled together under <b>outright</b> <b>sales.</b> The concurrent leasing and selling reflects the degree of the comparative advantage the monopolist has over consumers in disposing used goods. This comparative advantage, which is partially exploited by the monopolist and partially shared by the consumers, provides a sufficient mechanism to gain Pareto improvement on the market...|$|E
40|$|Background. Funding and {{maintaining}} infrastructure and critical services {{is a vital}} and recurring government function. The need to provide cost-effective options while maintaining expected levels of service can cause governments to search for alternative service delivery options. While not a guaranteed solution, privatization provides an alternative that, given the proper research and due diligence, may present governments with numerous advantages. Recent examples demonstrate the effectiveness {{as well as the}} concerns surrounding privatization initiatives. This recommended practice develops the role of the finance officer and presents a high-level framework for evaluating the policy decisions if a government decides to pursue a privatization initiative. Within this recommended practice, privatization encompasses the long-term transfer or sale of public assets or asset management rights to a private entity in exchange for a range of government financial, liability transfer, and risk mitigation benefits. Privatization resulting in an outright sale is a permanent transaction where title transfers from the government to a private entity(s). This may consist of {{all or part of the}} entire government facilities/asset network. <b>Outright</b> <b>sales</b> may include potential reversionary provisions should the private entity fail to perform, particularly in the sale of core government functions.

30|$|Up to the mid- 2000 s, {{private investors}} {{seem to have}} mostly held mines through {{structures}} such as leases, entrusted management or rental agreements. While the details of these arrangements no doubt varied tremendously, the basic structure {{seems to have been}} as follows: The mine and the underlying coal concession remained formally the property of the village or township, to which the mining licenses, too, were made out. The private investor then leased the use of the mine from the village for a fixed number of years, albeit often on a relatively short-term basis (i.e., only for a few years). During this period, the investor was responsible for operating the mine, paying all taxes, fees, and wages, as well as a rental fee to the village, while keeping all residual profits (Martin 2016 : 257 : interview 929). De facto, the mine was privately controlled, but nominally it remained registered as collective property, owned by the village or the township (Martin 2016 : 30). Structures of this kind seem to have been preferred to <b>outright</b> <b>sales</b> because the legality of private coal-mine ownership and of privatizing coal resources was unclear and because, to be formally correct, sales and transfers of rights would have required approvals from higher levels. Because of this, the real (private) owners often seem to have established multiple layers of (nominal) legal representatives and lessees between themselves and the village or township from which they had obtained the mine, making it difficult to establish who really owned the mine. Opaque and complex legal structures of this kind also created obstacles for private investors to raise new capital or cooperate with other firms or institutions to upgrade their mines (Caijing 2003; China Comment 2007; China Economic Times 2007; Southern Weekend 2006 b; all cited in Martin 2016 : 200).|$|E

We compare revenue sharing to a number of other supply chain contracts (e. g., buy-back contracts, price-discount contracts, quantity-flexibility contracts, sales-rebate contracts, franchise contracts, and quantity discounts). We find that revenue sharing is equivalent to buybacks in the newsvendor case and equivalent to price discounts in the price-setting newsvendor case. Revenue sharing also coordinates a supply chain with retailers competing in quantities, e. g., Cournot competitors or competing newsvendors with fixed prices. Despite its numerous merits, we identify several limitations of revenue sharing to (at least partially) explain why it is not prevalent in all industries. In particular, we characterize cases in which revenue sharing provides only a small improvement over the administratively cheaper wholesale price contract. Additionally, revenue sharing does not coordinate a supply chain with demand that depends on costly retail effort. We develop a variation on revenue sharing for this setting...|$|E
