We are a growing nation living on a dry continent with extremely variable rainfall patterns, and recent years have brought water supply security problems to <b>our</b> agricultural <b>industries,</b> major rural centres {{and a number of}} our cities.

The issue is made more difficult by the complexity and uncertainty of the science of assessing the resource, and predicting the impacts of drought and increased climate variability. Ultimately {{we need to be able}} to make good decisions on the basis of the available information knowing that we cannot predict the future. We need flexible and adaptable water management systems that can deliver equity and certainty to all users.
