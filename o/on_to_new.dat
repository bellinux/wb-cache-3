5|$|Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, {{accompanied}} by his wife and her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York. The voyage was exceptionally stormy, and Bellomont's ship was blown well south, eventually putting into Barbados before continuing <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York. He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.|$|E
5|$|Bruchus rufimanus, {{commonly}} known as the broad bean weevil, broad bean beetle, or broad bean seed beetle is a weevil which inhabits crops and fields, as well as some homes. It is a pest of faba beans (Vicia faba L.).The adult weevils feed on pollen, while their larvae tunnel in seeds destroying crops and moving <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> ones once they dry out. The adult beetle, being one of the biggest of its genus, ranges from 3 to 5mm in length.|$|E

5|$|It was for Simon Called Peter, {{a tale of}} {{a wartime}} romance between an English priest and a Red Cross nurse, that Keable {{acquired}} most of his notoriety. As well as its best-selling print editions, the story was adapted as a stage play by Jules Eckert Goodman and Edward Knoblock in 1924. The show enjoyed popular success in Chicago before moving <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps most importantly, Pinckney's Treaty granted both Spanish and American ships {{unrestricted}} navigation rights {{along the}} entire Mississippi River, as well as duty-free transport for American ships through the Spanish port of New Orleans, opening much of the Ohio River basin for settlement and trade. Agricultural produce could now flow on flatboats down the Ohio River to the Mississippi and <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Orleans and Europe. Spain and the United States further agreed to protect the vessels of the other party anywhere within their jurisdictions and to not detain or embargo the other's citizens or vessels.|$|E
5|$|Sailing more {{directly}} than de Grasse, Hood's fleet arrived off {{the entrance to}} the Chesapeake on 25 August. Finding no French ships there, he then sailed <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York to meet with Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Graves, in command of the North American station following Arbuthnot's departure, whom had spent several weeks trying to intercept a convoy organised by John Laurens to bring much-needed supplies and hard currency from France to Boston. When Hood arrived at New York, he found that Graves was in port (having failed to intercept the convoy), but had only five ships of the line that were ready for battle.|$|E

5|$|During the English {{winter of}} 1922–23, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{selected}} {{a team to}} tour Australia and New Zealand. This side, captained by Archie MacLaren and composed mainly of amateurs, was not particularly strong and contained several players chosen for their social standing rather than cricketing ability. The team played four first-class games in Australia against state teams; the first was drawn {{and the others were}} lost. After scores of 75 and 58 against Western Australia, Chapman played consecutive innings of 53, 73 and 69 against South Australia and Victoria, followed by 100 in the most eagerly awaited match of the tour against a strong New South Wales side. The press and public praised his attacking batting and his fielding, although Frank Iredale, a former Test cricketer, noticed some flaws in his technique. When the team moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> Zealand, after an uncertain start Chapman scored 533 runs at an average of 48.45, including two centuries. The tourists returned to Australia for the last leg of the tour; Chapman scored 91 against New South Wales and 134 in 142 minutes against South Australia. In all the Australian games, he totalled 782 runs at 65.16; in all the matches on tour he had 1,315 runs at an average of 57.15.|$|E

After making two trips to Philadelphia and back, she departed for Cape Cod Bay to form up with convoy BX 28 for Halifax, where she arrived on 11 July. Hobbema sailed from Halifax to Sydney, Nova Scotia, in convoy HS 28, and from there sailed on 17 July for Liverpool with convoy SC 92. After her arrival on 31 July, she spent nearly a month at Liverpool before joining convoy ON 126 for New York, arriving at that destination on 19 September.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, Dey {{retired after}} selling his {{ownership}} interest to Gorman and new investor Frank Ahearn. Ahearn and Gorman had an uneasy partnership {{and at one}} point Gorman was going to buy out Ahearn. By January 1925, the deal was nearly finalized when Gorman backed out of the deal. Instead, Ahearn bought Gorman's interest in the club for $35,000 and a share of the Connaught Park Racetrack and Gorman moved <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>New</b> York to manage the New York Americans. In 1929, Ahearn sold the club to the Ottawa Auditorium corporation for $150,000, financed by a share issue. William Foran, the Stanley Cup trustee, became president of the Club. As the Auditorium did not meet its payments, Ahearn resumed a share of the club in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The Mounties {{convince}} Kripik {{to come to}} {{the post}} to answer questions, and Kripik agrees. Several months pass. Hunt and Balk give Kripik the freedom of the post, and Hunt learns about the horrors the white traders visited on the Eskimo. When the Eskimo village moves <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>new</b> hunting rounds, Kripik's family stays behind to wait for him. They begin to starve, and Kripik learns of their plight. However, the rigid and rule-bound Inspector White has arrived at the RCMP outpost, and he demands that Kripik not only no longer be allowed to hunt during the day but also be chained down in his bed at night. Hunt tries to dissuade White, but White insists — and Hunt is forced to break his word that Kripik will not be chained.|$|E
