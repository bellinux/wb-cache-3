40|$|The Xiphias gladius (Linnaeus, 1758) {{data used}} in the present study were {{obtained}} from commercial fishing cruises of the pelagic longline fleet based in Itajaí, operating in the Southwest Atlantic. For the Covariance models, fishing effort (number of hooks) and catches (kg) were pooled and categorized into the following groups: (1) year (1997, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2007); (2) lunar phase; and (3) seasons, fishing effort being the covariate. The highest mean swordfish catch (kg) occurred during the waxing crescent moon and during wintertime. The Mantel-Haenszel procedure was applied to compare the efficiency of the two hooks tested, and showed that the "J" hook type (J 9 / 0 10 º offset), traditionally used by the fleet, catches 1. 2 -fold more Xiphias gladius than the circle hook (18 / 0 10 º offset), used as an <b>optional</b> <b>device</b> to reduce sea turtle bycatch.

40|$|Software {{development}} for mobile devices {{has become very}} popular {{in the last few}} years. There are hundreds of programmable micro devices on the market, each having different properties in terms of memory capacity, screen size, networking protocols, audio/video support, peripheral extensions and software platforms. Despite the technical differences of these devices, people use them in a similar fashion for communicating, organizing and interacting with their personal data. For a mobile software developer, it would save {{a great deal of time}} and effort to program an application in a way that allows it to run on all of these devices without modification. However, the variability of hardware in these mobile phones, PDA’s or music players has led the vendors to provide additional levels of software support for different devices. For example, with the Java programming language, vendors and standards bodies have introduced <b>optional,</b> <b>device</b> specific libraries (APIs) that only run on certain hardware devices.

No presente estudo foram analisados os dados obtidos para Xiphias gladius (Linnaeus, 1758) através de observadores, mapas de bordo e fichas de desembarque de carcaças, coletadas pela frota de espinhel-de-superfície sediada em Itajaí (SC). Modelos de análise de covariância (ANCOVA) foram aplicados aos dados de captura (peso em kg) do espadarte, tendo como efeitos: (1) anos de 1997, 1998, 2001, 2002 e 2007 (2) fases lunares e (3) épocas do ano. A covariável foi o esforço de pesca (n° de anzóis). As maiores médias de captura ocorreram durante as fases de lua crescente e no inverno. O procedimento estatístico de Mantel-Haenszel foi utilizado para comparar as capturas do espadarte no anzol tipo "Jota" (J 9 / 0 10 º offset), comumente utilizado pela frota, com o anzol tipo "circular" (18 / 0 10 º offset), este último oferecido como alternativa mitigadora à captura de tartarugas marinhas. O teste M-H mostrou que o anzol "Jota" apresentou 1, 2 mais chances de capturar Xiphias gladius que no "circular".

40|$|International audienceElectric {{vehicles}} embed a low {{amount of}} energy, so their devices {{need to be}} managed efficiently to optimize the vehicle autonomy. A vehicle management is achieved by the embedded systems, modeled following the AUTOSAR standard. AUTOSAR covers most of the automotive concerns, but it lacks energy consumption and user-oriented Quality of Service models. This paper presents ORQA, a framework to model and manage the electric vehicle devices through energy consumption and user-oriented Quality of Service. At design time, the architects choose and tune the actual vehicle device models through their power requirements and, if appropriate, quality levels. The generated implementation is then embedded in the existing AUTOSAR models. Thus, at run-time, the vehicle's system is able to evaluate the global consumption of a trip and to propose the user a specific driving strategy. The <b>optional</b> <b>devices</b> are managed throughout the trip, based on the driver preferences. ORQA is illustrated with a classic use-case: a work to home trip...|$|R

40|$|IMAPS (Interactive Minicomputer Array Processing System) is {{a system}} of {{minicomputer}} software for processing large, two-dimensional arrays of gridded data such as those employed in the earth sciences, particularly remote sensing of the environment. IMAPS was designed to have wide applicability based on {{the flexibility of the}} software and its modest hardware requirements. Written in Fortran and operating in an interactive, single-user mode, the system provides a variety of array processing functions. These functions presently include routines for reading and calibrating LANDSAT and NOAA satellite data tapes, statistically summarizing array regions and transects, generating contrast-enhanced images via line printer or electrostatic plotter, and converting data from contoured to gridded format. Users having specialized needs can add their own functions to the system; this can be done without increasing core requirements inasmuch as each function is organized as a separate overlay. The design of new functions is facilitated by the availability of a library of utility subroutines, which perform tasks commonly required in array processing, such as buffering array data to and from disc. The data buffering subroutines are quite flexible, allowing variable array size, processing of from 2 to 10 arrays in parallel, and sequential or random access to individual array elements. IMAPS is currently implemented on Coastal Studies Institute 2 ̆ 7 s Nova 1220 minicomputer in support of programs in deltaic sedimentation and remote sensing of coastal waters. The basic system requires a 16 -bit minicomputer with 32 K words of core memory, console, and disc; <b>optional</b> <b>devices</b> include magnetic tape, line printer, digitizer, and electrostatic plotter...|$|R

The paper ran between two electrodes. The electrode on one side was a thin straight bar oriented across the paper width. The electrode on the other side was a thin helical bar wrapped around a rotating drum. One rotation of the drum scanned an intersecting area of the electrodes across the width of the paper.
