5|$|Historically, {{due to its}} {{northern}} location, the peninsula's population had been sparse: in 1913, for example, only about 13,000–15,000 people lived there; mostly along the shores. However, the discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> natural resource deposits and industrialization efforts led to an explosive population growth during the Soviet times. By 1970, {{the population of the}} peninsula was around 799,000. The trend reverted in the 1990s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The population of the whole Murmansk Oblast went down from 1,150,000 in 1989 to 890,000 in 2002 to 795,000 in 2010.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-16thcentury Henry VIII of England {{dissolved}} the monasteries, {{resulting in}} the large areas of land owned by Meaux Abbey, Bridlington Priory and other monastic holdings being confiscated.

5|$|Phase III: At {{the height}} of the Roman Empire's power, forces were tasked with manning and {{securing}} the borders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> provinces which had been brought under Roman control.

5|$|The Soviet period saw a rapid {{increase}} of the population, although most of it remained confined to urbanized territories along the sea coast and the railroads. The Sami people were subject to forced collectivization, including forced relocation to Lovozero and other centralized settlements, and overall the peninsula was heavily industrialized and militarized, largely due to its strategic position and the discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> apatite deposits in the 1920s. As a result, {{the ecology of the}} peninsula suffered major ecological damage, including contamination by military nuclear waste and nickel smelting.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, European {{colonialism}} in Africa {{had reached}} its height.

Since David Livingstone had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.|$|E
5|$|From 1603, {{when the}} Scottish monarch James VI {{inherited}} the English throne as James I, both the English and Scottish kingdoms were {{ruled by a}} single sovereign. From 1649 to 1660, the tradition of monarchy was broken by the republican Commonwealth of England, which followed the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The Act of Settlement 1701 excluded Roman Catholics, or those who married Catholics, from succession to the English throne. In 1707, the kingdoms of England and Scotland were merged to create the Kingdom of Great Britain, and in 1801, the Kingdom of Ireland joined to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The British monarch became nominal head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> British Empire, which covered {{a quarter of the}} world's surface at its greatest extent in 1921.|$|E
5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above.
