30|$|To assess {{knee and}} lower leg angles, {{we used a}} {{three-dimensional}} motion analysis system (Motive:Tracker; OptiTrack, Corvallis, OR, USA), a force plate (9268 B; Kistler Group, Winterthur, Switzerland), and six infrared cameras (V 100 :R 2; OptiTrack) with a sampling rate of 100  Hz. The jump landing point was on the force plate; GRF data were measured (sampling rate of 1000  Hz) and {{used to calculate the}} GRF at the jump landing point. Referring to a report by Kifuji [17], we placed reflective markers (diameter, 14  mm) on the tips of each participant’s shoes, lateral malleolus, inside and <b>outside</b> <b>margins</b> of the knee, greater trochanter, and anterior superior iliac spine. The inside and <b>outside</b> <b>margins</b> of the knee were defined based on the midpoint of their anteroposterior diameter, except the patella, which was defined {{at the height of the}} knee joint space.

60|$|It {{is one of}} {{the first}} things to be said about Macaulay, that he was in exact accord with the common average {{sentiment}} of his day on every subject on which he spoke. His superiority was not of that highest kind which leads a man to march in thought on the <b>outside</b> <b>margin</b> of the crowd, watching them, sympathising with them, hoping for them, but apart. Macaulay was one of the middle-class crowd in his heart, and only rose above it by splendid attainments and extraordinary gifts of expression. He had none of that ambition which inflames some hardy men, to make new beliefs and new passions enter the minds of their neighbours; his ascendency is due to literary pomp, not to fecundity of spirit. No one has ever surpassed him in the art of combining resolute and ostentatious common sense of a slightly coarse sort in choosing his point of view, with so considerable an appearance of dignity and elevation in setting it forth and impressing it upon others. The elaborateness of his style is very likely to mislead people into imagining for him a corresponding elaborateness of thought and sentiment. On the contrary, Macaulay's mind was really very simple, strait, and with as few notes in its register, to borrow a phrase from the language of vocal compass, as there are few notes, though they are very loud, in the register of his written prose. When we look more closely into it, what at first wore the air of dignity and elevation, in truth rather disagreeably resembles the narrow assurance of a man who knows that he has with him the great battalions of public opinion. We are always quite sure that if Macaulay had been an Athenian citizen towards the ninety-fifth Olympiad, he would have taken sides with Anytus and Meletus in the impeachment of Socrates. A popular author must, in a thorough-going way, take the accepted maxims for granted. He must suppress any whimsical fancy for applying the Socratic elenchus, or any other engine of criticism, scepticism, or verification, to those sentiments or current precepts of morals, which may in truth be very equivocal and may be much neglected in practice, but which the public opinion of his time requires to be treated in theory and in literature as if they had been cherished and held sacred semper, ubique, et ab omnibus.|$|E

5000|$|For {{hundreds}} of years, Albariño vines {{could be found}} growing around the trunks of poplar trees and in bushes along the <b>outside</b> <b>margins</b> of a field. A practice which some growers still use in Portugal's Vinho Verde region. However, {{in the middle of}} the century, the growers made big investments and became professional grape growers. [...] In Vinho Verde, the vines are typically trained on high pergolas, which encourages over-cropping, often leading to grapes that are unable to exceed more than 8.5% potential alcohol. When grown in a vineyard, the vines need to be wire trained with large canopies to accommodate the 30 to 40 buds per vine that is typical. The grape responds well to the heat and humidity though the high yields and bunching of clusters usually keeps the grapes within the margins of ripeness.|$|R

50|$|The {{geometrical}} {{solution of}} the construction of Van de Graaf's canon, which works for any page width:height ratio, enables the book designer to position the text body in a specific area of the page. Using the canon, the proportions are maintained while creating pleasing and functional margins of size 1/9 and 2/9 of the page size. The resulting inside margin is one-half of the <b>outside</b> <b>margin,</b> and of proportions 2:3:4:6 (inner:top:outer:bottom) when the page proportion is 2:3 (more generally 1:R:2:2R for page proportion 1:R). This method was discovered by Van de Graaf, and used by Tschichold and other contemporary designers; they speculate that it may be older.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{treatments}} for men with localized prostate cancer is radiation therapy, which involves delivering small doses of radiation to the prostate {{for an extended period of}} time. Stereotactic-body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a form of radiotherapy that delivers increased dosage to the prostate with more precision. The results are shorter treatment times, increased effectiveness, and less toxicity to surrounding tissue. However, the prostate has been found to move around during treatment (intrafraction) and between treatments (interfraction). With greater precision, there is a greater risk of missing the target while the prostate is moving. This study assesses the impact of intrafractional prostate motion on the accuracy and efficiency of SBRT on CyberKnife. Prostate tracking log files were acquired from 6 patients with prostate cancer, which comprises 18 SBRT fractions and 1, 892 X-ray image registrations. Each image contains real-time prostate motion in 6 D. The data were compared against clinically used margins to identify periods of large prostate motion during treatment. Results indicate significant periods of prostate motion, with the greatest movement occurring in anterior-posterior translation (6. 2 % <b>outside</b> <b>margin)</b> and pitch rotation (4. 3 % <b>outside</b> <b>margin).</b> The percentage of prostate motion beyond margins varied among patients, with an average of 12. 8 % outside clinical margins and 36. 0 % outside hypothetically reduced margins. The treatment time for each fraction was also recorded to quantify the efficiency of CyberKnife delivery. Because of motion-related delays, optimal setup of 5 - 15 minutes was seen in only 50 % of the fractions, and optimal beam delivery times of 30 - 40 minutes in 44 % of fractions. Thus, results suggest that treatment accuracy and efficiency were negatively affected by the occurrence of large prostate motion. Techniques that immobilize the prostate during treatment may be considered to reduce intrafractional prostate motion and ensure greater accuracy and efficiency of prostate cancer SBRT. by Ricardo Eduardo De Armas.

40|$|A “lagg” {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} {{confined}} transition zone along the <b>outside</b> <b>margin</b> of a raised bog, characterized by a fen or swamp plant community. It is an important landscape element for biodiversity and helps to maintain a high water table within the peat mass of a bog, but has received little research attention. Greater knowledge of the variability in laggs will improve designation of appropriate conservation sites and restoration of damaged bogs. We therefore examined the hydrological, hydro-chemical, vegetative, and peat characteristics of laggs of bogs in coastal British Columbia, Canada. The 17 studied lagg transects were classified into four vegetative lagg types: Spiraea Thicket, Carex Fen, Peaty Forest, and Direct Transition. These vegetative lagg types fell within two hydrogeomorphic lagg forms: confined or unconfined. The Spiraea Thicket and Carex Fen laggs were topographically confined at the bog margin and characterized by a higher water table and a smaller tree basal area compared to the unconfined Peaty Forest and Direct Transition laggs. Half of the studied laggs were unconfined, highlighting the importance of considering both confined and unconfined laggs in the delineation, conservation, and restoration of raised bog ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Background: Skull bone tumor {{resection}} {{is sometimes}} difficult, when tumor is {{hidden under the}} bone surface or similar to the normal bone in appearance. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence {{has been used in}} various surgical fields for visualizing vascular and tumor tissues. This is the first report to show that intraoperative ICG fluorescence is useful for skull bone tumor resection. Case description: Four patients underwent skull bone tumor resection from June to December 2014. Two patients had Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and the others had hemangiomas. During surgical treatment, intraoperative ICG injection revealed the bone tumors hidden in normal bone tissue in real time. Three of the four tumors were identified as a high intensity area, and the other, a cavernous hemangioma, as an area lacking fluorescent enhancement. Each area was marked and then removed en bloc with an <b>outside</b> <b>margin</b> of 1  cm. On pathological examination, the surgical margin corresponded to the actual margin. In all cases, Postoperative course was uneventful, and there was no tumor recurrence. Conclusion: Our experience illustrates that intraoperative ICG fluorescence examination might be a useful supplemental method for skull bone tumor resection, especially for tumors extending under the bone surface or similar to normal bone in appearance...|$|E
