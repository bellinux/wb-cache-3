5|$|Following the French colonization, the {{language}} <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> and media changed from Malagasy to almost exclusively French. Moreover, the first French governor-general, Gallieni, also encouraged the French officials to learn Malagasy as well. After {{the advent of}} the Malagasy independence, the Madagascans tried to reinstate Malagasy as a language <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> especially in secondary schools. However, {{the language}} policy was inadequately planned and Malagasy was struggling to surpass French as the language <b>of</b> <b>instruction.</b>|$|E

5|$|Klein ISD offers {{four main}} foreign {{language}} courses: French, Spanish, German, and Latin. All {{four of these}} language courses are taught with curriculum approved by the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) and supplemented with textbooks for each course. German and Latin have four years <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> total - starting in German/Latin 1-3 and ending with AP French/Latin Language. French, however, has five years <b>of</b> <b>instruction</b> total, French 1-4 and ending with AP French Language. Spanish, like French, has five years <b>of</b> <b>instruction,</b> but offers Spanish 1-3 and then offers AP Spanish Language and AP Spanish Culture. In the 2017-2018 school year, Klein ISD will be adding Chinese and American Sign Language to its course selection, but no classes have been held yet for these two courses.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a lightweight protocol to support selective re-execution on the TRIPS processor. The protocol permits multiple waves of speculation to be traversing a dataflow graph simultaneously {{and in any}} order, with a cleanup "commit" wave propagating as well to determine completion of a group <b>of</b> <b>instructions.</b> The protocol is completely distributed, consisting of point-to-point messages and requiring no centralized control. Thus, recovery from value mis-speculations requires no additional fetching or decoding <b>of</b> <b>instructions,</b> and no issue <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> that were independent <b>of</b> the faulting <b>instruction.</b> We describe briefly {{one way in which}} this protocol can be exploited: by allowing every instruction to use a decentralized last value predictor.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the concept <b>of</b> dynamic <b>instruction</b> reuse. Empirical observations suggest that many <b>instructions,</b> and groups <b>of</b> <b>instructions,</b> {{having the same}} inputs, are executed dynamically. Such instructions {{do not have to}} be executed repeatedly — their results can be obtained from a buffer where they were saved previously. This paper presents three hardware schemes for exploiting the phenomenon <b>of</b> dynamic <b>instruction</b> reuse, and evaluates their effectiveness using execution-driven simulation. We find that in some cases over 50 % <b>of</b> the <b>instructions</b> can be reused. The speedups so obtained, though less striking than the percentage <b>of</b> <b>instructions</b> reused, are still quite significant. ...|$|R
