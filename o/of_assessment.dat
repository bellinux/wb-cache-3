5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships {{that may lead}} to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and {{there is a lack of}} clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b> Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E
5|$|Claims {{to three}} lode mines {{and a single}} coal mine were made within the Goat Rocks Wilderness, but the United States Bureau of Mines has no record of {{production}} from any of these claims. Historically, two claims have actually been staked in the area, the Mosquito lode near Walupt Lake in 1934, and later, the Glacier lode near Packwood Glacier in 1939. Neither show evidence <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> work, and both deposits are now abandoned. Miners may have been drawn to the area by news of lode deposits containing gold, silver, and copper along breccia and shear zones {{to the north of}} the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|James Campbell refutes {{suggestions}} that the hides given for each tribe were {{the sum of}} a system of locally-collected assessments and argues that a two-tier system <b>of</b> <b>assessment,</b> one for large areas such as kingdoms and a more accurate one for individual estates, may have existed. He considers the possibility that many of the tribes named in the Tribal Hidage were no more than administrative units and that some names did not originate from a tribe itself but from a place from where the people were governed, eventually coming to signify the district where the tribe itself lived. Barbara Yorke suggests that the -sætan/sæte form of several of the place-names are an indication that they were named after a feature of the local landscape. She also suggests the tribes were dependent administrative units and not independent kingdoms, some of which were created as such after the main kingdoms were stabilized.|$|E

5|$|There {{are five}} {{prominent}} {{features on the}} ECG: the P wave (atrial depolarisation), the QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and the T wave (ventricular repolarisation). As the heart cells contract, they create a current that travels through the heart. A downward deflection on the ECG implies cells are becoming more positive in charge ("depolarising") {{in the direction of}} that lead, whereas an upward inflection implies cells are becoming more negative ("repolarising") {{in the direction of the}} lead. This depends on the position of the lead, so if a wave of depolarising moved from left to right, a lead on the left would show a negative deflection, and a lead on the right would show a positive deflection. The ECG is a useful tool in detecting rhythm disturbances and in detecting insufficient blood supply to the heart. Sometimes abnormalities are suspected, but not immediately visible on the ECG. Testing when exercising can be used to provoke an abnormality, or an ECG can be worn for a longer period such as a 24-hour Holter monitor if a suspected rhythm abnormality is not present at the time <b>of</b> <b>assessment.</b>|$|E
5|$|When Dean Solomon {{suffered}} a season-ending knee injury in late March, Hall {{was one of}} three players in contention to be promoted to the senior list in place of Solomon. After approximately one month <b>of</b> <b>assessment</b> Hall was deemed the most impressive of Essendon's three rookies and was elevated to the senior list. In early June, Hall played particularly well in defence for the reserves against the Murray Kangaroos, and was subsequently in consideration to play for Essendon's senior team. Essendon had been plagued by injury throughout 2002 and this, coupled with Hall's good form in the VFL, resulted in him making his AFL debut in round 12 against Hawthorn. After a poor performance in his debut match, in which he did not record a statistic and spent most of the match on the bench, Hall was dropped backed to the VFL side the following round. Despite showing good form in the VFL for the remainder of 2002, Hall was unable to break back into the senior Bombers line-up. Although Hall failed to have an impact at AFL level, he played well at VFL level and was third in the reserves' best and fairest award.|$|E
