[...] "Part of that force is the sex drive. No <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a victim of that, {{but when you look at}} Pauline's interest in the murders, it's sexual.

After the first verse, the sound of keyboard is heard during the effect. It continues like this through the second verse, which is followed by an interlude featuring vocal echos, a piano segment and violin phrases. Madonna follows the music played by the piano and utters the words [...] "Pa-da-pa-da-pappa pappa pa pa" [...] in the same melody. The lyrics deal with Madonna making the listener remember that [...] "Everybody is a Star" [...] and that if <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> famous and be under the [...] "Spotlight", the person should sing about it and reality may catch up with him or her.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Octagonecologyst {{has been}} praised for its {{original}} sound, which {{has often been}} attributed to Nakamura. However, Thornton states that he was largely involved with {{the production of the}} album. Thornton is quoted as saying [...] "Automator and Kurt are probably receiving more credit than I did, but I was a big musical person behind Octagon." [...] Nakamura has said he wanted Dr. Octagonecologyst to stand out from other hip hop albums, citing the music of Eric B. & Rakim, Mantronix, and Run-D.M.C. as influences. [...] "Hip-hop was always inventive. Then the '90s hit and everyone wants to be Dr. Dre; no <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their own thing anymore. Everyone now wants to have the Lexus and deal pounds of drugs. We don't do that. That's not our lifestyle. You don't see us coming out with the fur coat. There's more to music than that," [...] Nakamura said. The album incorporates use of organic instrumentation and features Moog synthesizer, flute, and string instruments.|$|E

500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, [...] "Improvements in studio {{technology}} meant that possibilities for shaping the sound {{after it has}} been recorded are almost limitless." [...] Such possibility were applied in the song composition and the remixes present in You Can Dance. Previously to change the sound of an instrument, or to jump from one sound to another, recordings used to stop playing the instrument and the drums at that point. But for the remixes on You Can Dance, the fade engineering technology was applied to the songs, wherein the fader was simply pulled down, and was pushed up again when the sound of the instruments were made to come up to the surface. The first song on the album is [...] "Spotlight" [...] which begins with the sound of drums, bass synths and handclaps, followed by Madonna uttering the words [...] "Spotlight, shine bright". After the first verse, the sound of keyboard is heard during the chorus. It continues like this through the second verse, which is followed by an interlude featuring vocal echoes, a piano segment and violin phrases. Madonna follows the music played by the piano and utters the words [...] "Pa-da-pa-da-pappa pappa pa pa" [...] in the same melody. The lyrics deal with Madonna making the listener remember that [...] "everybody is a star" [...] and that if <b>one</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> famous and be under the [...] "spotlight", the person should sing about it and reality may catch up with him or her. According to the sheet music published at SheetMusicPlus.com, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is set in the key of F major with Madonna's voice spanning from the notes of C5 to B5. [...] "Spotlight" [...] has a basic sequence of Am–C–Am–C–G–F as its chord progression.|$|E

The cell phone enables the migrant workers 	 to stay connected at all time to their networks whether they are absent from home, at work or crossing the border 	 both in Thailand and Malaysia...|$|R
