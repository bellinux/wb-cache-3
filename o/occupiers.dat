5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Belgium in World War I, many Belgian workers {{had refused to}} work for the German administration as a form of passive resistance. This had led to large-scale reprisals against civilians as the <b>occupiers</b> had attempted to enforce their policies by armed force.|$|E
5|$|The <b>occupiers</b> looted and {{destroyed}} much of Poland's {{cultural and historical}} heritage, while persecuting and murdering members of the Polish cultural elite. Most Polish schools were closed, and those that remained open saw their curricula altered significantly.|$|E
50|$|Both {{the owner}} and the <b>occupier</b> are liable for rates. In practice, this {{will depend on the}} terms of the {{agreement}} between {{the owner and}} <b>occupier</b> of the property. In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, liability of rates rests with the <b>occupier.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Act first {{identifies}} the <b>occupier.</b> Section 1(2) {{identifies the}} <b>occupier</b> {{as the person}} occupying or {{in control of the}} premises, not necessarily the owner, with the underlying premise being that the person liable should be the person most likely {{to have been able to}} prevent the harm; the person occupying the premises, not necessarily the owner of those premises. The Act does not define <b>occupier,</b> but provides that the person to be treated as the <b>occupier</b> is the person who would be considered an <b>occupier</b> under common law rules. In Wheat v E Lacon & Co Ltd [...] 1 All ER 582 it was established that more than one person can be an <b>occupier.</b> In Harris v Birkenhead Corporation [...] it was held that it was possible to be an <b>occupier</b> without having physical possession of the house if the [...] "occupier" [...] has legal control of the property. Section 1(3) extends the standards set by the Act not only to land but to any fixed or movable structure, which includes ships and aircraft.|$|R

5|$|After the war, 53,000 Belgian {{citizens}} (0.6 {{percent of}} the population) were found guilty of collaboration, providing the only estimate of the number involved during the period. Around 15,000 Belgians served in two separate divisions of the Waffen-SS, divided along linguistic lines. In particular, many Belgians were persuaded {{to work with the}} <b>occupiers</b> as a result of long-running hostility to Communism, particularly after the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Belgium had {{pursued a}} policy of {{neutrality}} since its independence in 1830, successfully avoiding becoming a belligerent in the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71). In World War I, the German Empire invaded Belgium. During the ensuing occupation, the Allies encouraged Belgian workers to resist the <b>occupiers</b> through non-compliance, leading to large-scale reprisals against Belgian civilians by the German army.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Đujić {{was tried}} and sentenced in {{absentia}} {{for war crimes}} by Yugoslavia. He was declared a war criminal who as commander of the Dinara Division was responsible for organizing and carrying {{out a series of}} mass murders, massacres, tortures, rapes, robberies, and imprisonments, and collaborating with the German and Italian <b>occupiers.</b> He was accused of being {{responsible for the deaths of}} 1,500 people during the war.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Occupier's</b> Liability Act 1957 imposes {{upon the}} <b>occupier</b> a duty of care. The <b>occupier</b> must [...] "take such care {{as in all}} the {{circumstances}} of the case is reasonable to see that the visitor will be reasonably safe in using the premises for the purposes for which he is invited or permitted by the <b>occupier</b> to be there". The standard of care an <b>occupier</b> is expected to meet is the standard of [...] "a reasonable occupier", no different from the usual common law negligence standard of care. Under Australian Law the Scope and content of a duty of care depends on 6 main factors. (1) magnitude of the risk as perceived by the reasonable occupier;(2) degree of probability of its occurrence;(3) expense, difficulty and inconvenience of taking precautions;(4) obviousness of the harm;(5) type of occupier(6) degree of the entrant’s skill or knowledge.|$|R
50|$|If {{the person}} serving the {{proposal}} is neither the owner nor the <b>occupier</b> of the tenement, he must also serve copies of the proposal on both the owner and <b>occupier,</b> and must notify the Commissioner of such service within the months of April and May of that year. Within 14 days of service, the owner or <b>occupier</b> may send comments on the proposal to the Commissioner and the person serving the proposal.|$|R
5000|$|An Excluded <b>occupier</b> {{is a term}} in English {{property}} law used to describe someone with limited rights to remain in a home. If you share your accommodation with your landlord {{you are likely to}} be an excluded <b>occupier.</b> An excluded <b>occupier</b> is only entitled to 'reasonable notice' before being asked to leave a property so {{does not have to be}} evicted using section 21 notice like if they were an assured shorthold tenant.|$|R
5|$|In July 1943, the Montenegrin Partisan leader Đilas {{contacted}} both Ostojić and Baćović {{to establish}} their willingness to work jointly against the Axis <b>occupiers,</b> given that a new government-in-exile {{was about to be}} established without Mihailović. They reported this contact to Mihailović who threatened to exclude them from his Chetnik organisation if they maintained contact with the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, {{many of the}} proprietors {{pulled out of the}} real estate market and voluntarily sold their property to the government so that sale to the land's <b>occupiers</b> could be facilitated. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation. One of the terms of the Island joining the Confederation was the sale of the estates of land to their <b>occupiers.</b> The agreement to join the Confederation contained a clause outlining the possibility that the federal government of Canada could provide a grant of up to CA$800,000 to the provincial government to facilitate the purchase of the land from the proprietors. In 1875, through 'The Commissioners Appointed Under The Provisions of The Land Purchase Act, 1875' all of the outstanding proprietor-owned land was compulsorily purchased by the provincial government, at rates decided by a 'Commission of Enquiry'.|$|E
5|$|During Keyser's lordship, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales listed Adminston as a {{possible}} name for the village. On his death in 1929, his wife, Mary, continued to occupy the house until she died in 1938. The estate was auctioned off in September 1938, and many lots were purchased by their <b>occupiers.</b> The manor house was bought by Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) for £16,000. One of the houses in the village is recorded as having fetched £1,375. As AEI's chairman, Felix Pole became the de jure Lord of the Manor upon their purchase of Aldermaston Court.|$|E
500|$|Section 2(4)(b) {{establishes}} that [...] "where {{damage is}} caused to a visitor by a danger {{due to the}} faulty execution of any work of construction, maintenance or repair by an independent contractor employed by the <b>occupier,</b> the <b>occupier</b> {{is not to be}} treated without more as answerable for the danger if in all the circumstances he had acted reasonably in entrusting the work to an independent contractor and had taken such steps (if any) as he reasonably ought in order to satisfy himself that the contractor was competent and that the work had been properly done". This accords with the previous general rule that an <b>occupier</b> cannot be held vicariously liable for the negligence of an independent contractor. When a visitor does suffer harm from the work of an independent contractor, the question is instead whether the <b>occupier</b> has taken reasonable steps to establish if the contractor is competent, and, if the job permits, whether the <b>occupier</b> has checked that the work has been properly done.|$|R

5|$|During the French Revolution, the Pavillon de Flore {{was renamed}} Pavillon de l'Égalité (House of Equality). Under its new name, {{it became the}} meeting point for several of the Committees of the period. Many other {{committees}} of the Revolutionary Government occupied the Palais des Tuileries (referred to by contemporaries as the Palace of the Nation) {{during the time of}} the National Convention. Notable <b>occupiers</b> included the Monetary Committee, the Account and Liquidation Examination Committee. However, the most famous was the Committee of Public Safety.|$|E
5|$|Dąbrowski {{was seen}} as a cavalry expert, and King Stanisław August Poniatowski was {{personally}} interested in obtaining Dąbrowski's services. As a cavalryman educated in a Dresden military school under Count Maurice Bellegarde, a reformer of the Saxon army's cavalry, Dąbrowski was asked to help modernize the Polish cavalry, serving in the ranks of the 1st Greater Poland Cavalry Brygade (1 Wielkpolska Brygada Kawalerii Narodowej). In January 1793, stationed around Gniezno with two units of cavalry, about 200 strong, he briefly engaged the Prussian forces entering Poland {{in the aftermath of the}} Second Partition of Poland, and afterward became a known activist advocating the continuation of military struggle against the <b>occupiers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1983 {{the site}} was bought by {{property}} developers Regalian Properties. A competition to develop {{the site was}} won by architect Terry Farrell, with an urban village as Farrell's original proposal. A scheme of office blocks was subsequently developed for the site, with a government agency as their occupier. The building had been sold for £130million in 1989, with construction planned to take three years, built by John Laing. SIS ultimately became the <b>occupiers</b> of the building. Farrell's design for the SIS building was influenced by 1930s industrial modernist architecture such as Bankside and Battersea Power Stations and Mayan and Aztec religious temples.|$|E
50|$|It also {{laid down}} {{an example of}} the scope of an <b>occupier's</b> defence when workmen are warned of some danger before they do a job at the <b>occupier's</b> premises. The judges in the Court of Appeal were Lord Denning MR, Harman LJ and (in dissent) Pearson LJ.|$|R
50|$|The Occupiers' Liability Act 1957 regulates occupiers' {{liability}} to visitors. S 1(2) of the Act defines “visitors” as persons {{to whom the}} <b>occupier</b> gives (or is {{to be treated as}} giving) an invitation or permission to enter or use the premises. In other words, visitors are persons who have the express or implied permission of the <b>occupier</b> to be on the premises. A visitor who exceeds the <b>occupier's</b> permission, e.g. by going to the part of the premises where he was told by the <b>occupier</b> not to go, or by outstaying his leave, will become a trespasser and will fall outside the sphere of application of the Act. He will then be in the sphere of application of the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984, with lower standards of protection.|$|R

5|$|In October 1940, Marcinkus reached Liverpool, {{and from}} there {{travelled}} on to London. On 24 December of the same year, Marcinkus became a pilot in the Royal Air Force (RAF). To achieve that, he changed some of his personal data; he stated that he was three years younger, otherwise {{he would have been}} too old for service in the RAF. At that time, his homeland Lithuania had already lost its independence, and the Lithuanian air force was rapidly liquidated by its <b>occupiers.</b> Throughout the years, Maricinkus maintained close contacts with the Lithuanian attaché in Britain in order to receive news about Lithuania and his family.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Gens {{was named}} the {{commander}} of the Jewish policemen for the Vilnius Ghetto by the head of the new Judenrat, Anatol Friend. Officially, the duties of Gens and his policemen were to carry out German and Judenrat orders and provide law enforcement for the inhabitants of the ghetto. Included in their first duty, and considered by the <b>occupiers</b> as the single most important task, was the uncovering of any anti-German activity in the ghetto.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1944, Marinić filed {{charges against}} Pulherija and Gaudencija before the Land Commission for the Determination of Crimes by the <b>Occupiers</b> and Their Supporters. Pulherija fled to Austria {{before the end}} of the war, the only one of the nuns to do so. Gaudencija {{remained}} at the Children's Home, eventually moving to Ljubljana. No extradition of Pulherija was ever attempted, and neither nun was ever declared a war criminal. According to Fumić, the inhumane actions of Pulherija and other nuns and their role in the deaths of many children has never been condemned by the Catholic Church. Pulherija died in Austria in 1981.|$|E

5|$|On 27 August 1941, about 75 {{prominent}} Serbs {{convened a}} meeting in Belgrade where they resolved that Nedić should form a Government of National Salvation to replace the Commissioner Government. The same day, Nedić wrote to Danckelmann agreeing to become the Prime Minister {{of the new government}} on the basis of five conditions and some additional concessions. Two days later, the German authorities appointed Nedić and his government. Real power continued to reside with the <b>occupiers.</b> Aćimović initially retained his position as Minister of the Interior. In March 1945, he joined a Chetnik group in the NDH, and was killed battling the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the German <b>occupiers</b> was heavily repressed. Displays of patriotism, such as singing the national anthem, La Brabançonne, or celebrating Belgian National Day were banned and those breaking the rules risked strict prison sentences. Newspapers, books and mail were all tightly censored and regulated. Numerous high-profile Belgian figures, including Adolphe Max, the mayor of Brussels, and the historian Henri Pirenne, were imprisoned in Germany as hostages. The aftermath of the Battle of Verdun in 1916 marked {{a turning point in}} the occupation and was followed by more repressive measures by the administration, including the deportation of workers to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Račić {{signed a}} mutual {{cooperation}} agreement against the occupation {{forces with the}} commander of the Podrinje Partisans, Nebojša Jerković. Due to its lack of action against the Germans and puppet government, the Jadar Chetnik Detachment became quite isolated. Their leadership realised that the Partisans were getting stronger with each success against the <b>occupiers,</b> and the Chetnik position was becoming relatively weaker due to their inaction. Misita's decision to attack Loznica was a consequence of the cooperation agreement Račić signed with the Partisans.|$|E

50|$|Section 2(3)(a) {{provides}} that an <b>occupier</b> {{must be prepared}} for children to be less careful than adults. As a result, {{a higher standard of}} care is expected from the <b>occupier</b> when children are visiting his premises.

However, an <b>occupier</b> may reasonably expect that his child visitors be accompanied by their parents or other guardians, who will look after them. Therefore, it had been held that the <b>occupier</b> will have discharged his duty toward a child if he had made the premises reasonably safe for the child accompanied by the kind of guardian that he can expect them to be accompanied by in the circumstances.|$|R
