5|$|Even before non-aboriginal {{people came}} to the region, the Kootenay River valley was an {{important}} path of trade and transport between the tribes of the Canadian Rockies and the Idaho Panhandle, mostly between the Ktunaxa (who practiced agriculture and aquaculture) and the Salish, Blackfeet and Pend d'Oreilles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>and</b> east, and with the Shuswap in the north. The physiographic continuation of the Kootenai Valley southwards from present-day Bonners Ferry, Idaho into the Pend Oreille basin via the Purcell Trench formed a natural corridor through which natives of the area could interact. The barrier formed by the Rocky Mountains to the east, however, meant that tribes of the area, especially the Ktunaxa, were economically and linguistically isolated from the Great Plains tribes (with {{the exception of the}} Shoshone, whose territory spanned both sides of the Rockies).|$|E
5|$|In total, the Central Recreation Ground hosted 228 {{first-class}} matches, and 14 List A matches. The {{ground was}} initially leased from the Cornwallis family (the descendants of Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis), until 1869 when {{the ground was}} purchased by the cricketing trust. Between 1887 and the 1960s, the ground hosted the Hastings & St. Leonards Festival in September, which was the southern equivalent of the Scarborough Festival. During these festivals, seven Gentlemen v Players matches were played on the ground between 1889 and 1903, and in 1907 & 1909, matches took place between Gentlemen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>and</b> Players of the South. The 1909 match was the only first-class match played by British Army officer Leonard Slater, and was {{a victory for the}} Players of the South by 228 runs.|$|E
5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from French colonial rule in 1960, Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences.

Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms. Outside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (gargottes) or sit-down eateries (hotely). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from ambulatory street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, ingredients and presentation alike.|$|E

5|$|The {{next season}} Vanderbilt tied Navy and met rival Sewanee, {{in a battle}} of the unbeaten for the mythical crown <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South,</b> <b>and</b> won using a trick double-pass play. Sewanee led 12–11 with twelve minutes to play. At McGugin's signal, the Commodores went into a freakish {{formation}} in which Stein Stone remained at center but all the other players shifted to his left. Quarterback Hugh Potts took the snap and lateraled the ball to Vaughn Blake, who lateraled it across to Bob Blake, who had lined up deep in punt formation, as Stone ran down the field. Blake completed a 35-yard pass to Stone who was inside the 5-yard line. Honus Craig ran it in to win the game. It was cited by journalist Grantland Rice as the greatest thrill he ever witnessed in his years of watching sports.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{believed}} that the nation {{was on the verge}} of major political change, and that he could be elected president in 1896, uniting the silver supporters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>and</b> West. He was willing to consider a third party bid if Cleveland kept control of the Democratic Party, but felt the Populists, by allowing African Americans to seek office, had destroyed their credibility among southern whites. The stinging oratory of the South Carolina senator brought him national prominence, and with the 1896 Democratic National Convention in Chicago likely to be controlled by silver supporters, Tillman was spoken of as a possible presidential candidate along with others, such as former Missouri representative Richard P. Bland, Texas Governor James Hogg, and former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the second half the match was dominated by Queen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>and</b> they extended their lead after only two minutes. Defender Andy Aitken made a long pass to Joe McAlpine who crossed the ball from the left to the unmarked Derek Lyle near the six-yard box who headed the ball past the goalkeeper to score his third goal of the tournament. Brechin made the first substitution of the match three minutes after the second goal, replacing Graham Gibson with Chris Templeman. Brechin's best chance of the game came in the 58th minute when Charlie King's 20-yard shot forced goalkeeper Goram to make his first proper save of the match. In the 62nd minute, Brechin made their last substitution with Marc Millar replacing Paul Riley in the midfield. With three minutes left to play, Queen of the South had an opportunity to extend their lead further when Sean O'Connor's attempted header was hit wide from a corner kick by McAlpine.|$|E

5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. In the postwar period, veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>and</b> promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln {{was elected}} {{president}} on November 6, 1860, and the following month Booth drafted a long speech, apparently undelivered, that decried Northern abolitionism and made clear his strong support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>and</b> the institution of slavery. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War began, and eventually 11 Southern states seceded from the Union. In Booth's native Maryland, some of the slaveholding {{portion of the population}} favored joining the Confederate States of America. Although the Maryland legislature voted decisively (53–13) against secession on April 28, 1861, it also voted not to allow federal troops to pass south through the state by rail, and it requested that Lincoln remove the growing numbers of federal troops in Maryland. The legislature seems to have wanted to remain in the Union, while also wanting to avoid involvement in a war against southern neighbors. Adhering to Maryland's demand that its infrastructure not be used to wage war on seceding neighbors would have left the federal capital of Washington, D.C. vulnerable and would have made the prosecution of war against the South impossible, which was no doubt the legislature's intention, so Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus and imposed martial law in Baltimore and portions of the state, ordering the imprisonment of many Maryland political leaders at Ft. McHenry and the stationing of Federal troops in Baltimore. Many Marylanders, including Booth, agreed with the ruling of Marylander, and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, Roger B. Taney in Ex parte Merryman that Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus in Maryland was unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|Most historians sharply criticize Davis for his flawed {{military}} strategy, {{his selection}} of friends for military commands, and his neglect of homefront crises. Until {{late in the}} war, he resisted efforts to appoint a general-in-chief, essentially handling those duties himself. On January 31, 1865, Lee assumed this role, but it was far too late. Davis insisted on a strategy of trying to defend all Southern territory with ostensibly equal effort. This diluted the limited resources <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>and</b> made it vulnerable to coordinated strategic thrusts by the Union into the vital Western Theater (e.g., the capture of New Orleans in early 1862). He made other controversial strategic choices, such as allowing Lee to invade the North in 1862 and 1863 while the Western armies were under very heavy pressure. When Lee lost at Gettysburg, Vicksburg simultaneously fell, and the Union {{took control of the}} Mississippi River, splitting the Confederacy. At Vicksburg, the failure to coordinate multiple forces {{on both sides of the}} Mississippi River rested primarily on Davis's inability to create a harmonious departmental arrangement or to force such generals as Edmund Kirby Smith, Earl Van Dorn, and Theophilus H. Holmes to work together.|$|E
