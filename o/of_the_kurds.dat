5|$|The Kurdish {{geographical}} name changes were exempt under the Ottoman Empire {{due to the}} Islamic religious orientation of Kurds. During the Republican era and especially after the Dersim massacre, Kurdish {{geographical name}} changes became more common. During the Turkish Republican era, the words Kurdistan and Kurds were banned. The Turkish government had disguised the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> statistically by categorizing them as Mountain Turks. This classification was changed to the new euphemism of Eastern Turk in 1980.|$|E

The Taghlibs had traditionally controlled Mosul and its region until the late 9th century, when the Abbasid government tried to impose firmer control over the province. Hamdan ibn Hamdun was one of the most determined Taghlibi leaders in opposing this move. Notably, in his effort to fend off the Abbasids, he secured the alliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> living in the mountains north of Mosul, a fact which would be of considerable importance in his family's later fortunes. Family members intermarried with Kurds, who were also prominent in the Hamdanid military.|$|E
