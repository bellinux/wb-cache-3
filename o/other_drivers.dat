5|$|At {{the first}} round of pit stops, Hamilton had a lead of nearly 20seconds over Massa, and fuelled longer than all the <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> in the points-scoring {{positions}} when he pitted on lap18. Coming out of the pits, Hamilton made an error and was passed by Trulli. The two drivers then nearly collided at the hairpin, with Hamilton holding back {{for the rest of the}} lap waiting for Trulli to pit. Trulli's teammate Glock stayed out on the track longer than all of the <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> except Barrichello and Piquet, meaning that when he pitted, he was actually in third position and rejoined the race in eighth. Hamilton regained the lead by lap22 after Massa, Kovalainen, Trulli and Räikkönen made their pit stops, and had in the region of an 11second lead over Massa at the half-way stage of the race. Behind the leaders, fourth-placed Kubica was beginning to catch Kovalainen in third, while Trulli, Räikkönen, Alonso and Vettel battled over the final four point-scoring places.|$|E
5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their time spent behind the wheel, there is very little to stop them from forging their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. <b>Other</b> <b>drivers</b> maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E
5|$|Webber {{took his}} only {{victory of the}} season at , taking the lead from {{teammate}} Vettel after he developed a gearbox issue. With this result, he moved into third place in the championship, ahead of Fernando Alonso. Webber also achieved his seventh fastest lap of the season at the race, with no <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> scoring more than three in the season. This resulted in him winning the DHL Fastest Lap Award for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} usual {{tactical}} aspects of racing, Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered the chance to eliminate <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> from the competition by destroying their craft with weapons. Each craft has a shield energy quota, and when this quota reaches zero—either from damage sustained from weapon attacks, or impact from other craft or {{the edges of the}} circuit—the craft blows up. The craft also blows up if the time limit is reached, though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the Quake Disruptor, which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a quake to thrust a destructive wave down the track that dunks the crafts it smash into.|$|E
5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E
5|$|In , Schumacher {{took his}} fourth drivers' title. Four <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> won races, but none {{sustained}} a season-long {{challenge for the}} championship. Schumacher scored a record-tying nine wins and clinched the World Championship with four races yet to run. He finished the championship with 123 points, 58 ahead of runner-up Coulthard. Season highlights included the , where Schumacher finished 2nd to his brother Ralf, thus scoring the first ever 1–2 finish by brothers in Formula One; and the Belgian Grand Prix in which Schumacher scored his 52nd career win, breaking Alain Prost's record for most career wins.|$|E

50|$|Back {{into the}} race, another driver loses two rear tires. Pooch, coming from behind, shows {{the gesture of}} a gentleman as he stops by and helps that driver run again. But that <b>other</b> <b>driver</b> {{exhibits}} ingratitude by just leaving and blowing smoke at Pooch. As they continue running, the <b>other</b> <b>driver</b> scatters nails which destroy all of Pooch's tires. Pooch then resorts to using rats as replacements for his tires. The rats make good carriers until his vehicle gets knocked off the track after colliding a tree. After going airborne, Pooch's car lands on a cow which carries {{him back into the}} race. Despite the <b>other</b> <b>driver's</b> clever wheel tactics, Pooch's cow-carried car reaches the finish line and wins.|$|R
5|$|In August 2009, Bianchi {{was linked}} by the BBC {{and various other}} media sources to the second Ferrari Formula One seat {{occupied}} by Luca Badoer during Felipe Massa's absence. Bianchi tested for Ferrari at the young drivers test at Circuito de Jerez {{for two of the}} three days, over 1–2 December 2009. The <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> tested on 3 December included Daniel Zampieri, Marco Zipoli and Pablo Sánchez López as the top three finishers in the 2009 Italian Formula Three Championship. Bianchi's performance in this test led to him becoming the first recruit of the Ferrari Driver Academy and signing up to a long-term deal to remain at the team's disposal.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to other racing series such as Formula One, Formula E has a specific qualifying mode, {{in which the}} twenty drivers are divided up into four groups, leaving enough space on track for everyone to produce lap times without interference by <b>other</b> <b>drivers.</b> Each group had ten minutes on track and the fastest time of each driver determined the grid position. A lottery determined which drivers started in which group. With five-minute breaks between the groups, qualifying had an overall length of 55 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton was fastest in Q2, two-tenths of {{a second}} ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. In his last qualifying session with Lotus, Romain Grosjean experienced technical difficulties that forced {{him to come back}} into the pits. Even though he was sent out again, he was unable to set a time, stopping his car at turn seven. His teammate Pastor Maldonado also did not proceed into Q3, as did Jenson Button who missed out by two-tenths {{of a second}}. The two <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> eliminated were Felipe Nasr for Sauber and Max Verstappen, who was unable to match the time of his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr.|$|E

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of war in September 1939, Bessie left her union post and joined G Division of the Liverpool Ambulance Service, as a driver. Initially her main job was to train <b>other</b> <b>drivers,</b> mostly young women. She became a section leader and then a deputy leader of G Division, an administrative post that should have kept her at headquarters. However, she records that she drove her ambulance through all the 68 major air raids that struck Liverpool during the war years. It was dangerous work; on a single day, 3May 1941, 14 drivers lost their lives. Bessie remained with the ambulance service almost {{until the end of}} the war in 1945.|$|E

5|$|The race {{concluded}} with four different leaders, eight lead changes, and six cautions. Dillon led the most laps with 64, followed by Larson (51), Peters (23) and Schrader (15). Despite winning the race, Dillon, along with six <b>other</b> <b>drivers,</b> {{did not receive}} Truck Series points due to a rule that allowed drivers to compete in only one series' drivers championship. The win was Dillon's first of 2013 and fifth Truck Series victory in 53 starts. It was also the 29th Truck Series win for owner Richard Childress and Richard Childress Racing's second Truck win of 2013.|$|E
5|$|A {{week before}} the start of the Grand Prix weekend, Dutch driver Giedo van der Garde {{launched}} legal action against Sauber before the Supreme Court of Victoria, to enforce a contract he entered into in June 2014 to drive for the team during the 2015 season. This action was based on an award that van der Garde obtained on 2 March 2015 through international arbitration in Switzerland, which he initiated after the team announced in November 2014 that their 2015 drivers would instead be Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr. On Wednesday, 11 March 2015, van der Garde succeeded by obtaining court orders compelling Sauber to permit him to drive in Melbourne. On the same day, Sauber appealed the orders made against them and also publicly announced that they would not compromise the safety of the team or <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> by putting van der Garde in the car, since the C34 chassis had only been tailored to fit Ericsson and Nasr.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the United States National Anthem, the children of the late sports marketer Ed Shull gave the command for drivers to start their engines. On the pace laps, Johnson, after changing his engine, and teammate Earnhardt, who had to move to a back-up car, had to fall behind all the <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> in the event after doing major changes during practice. At the start, Newman was the leader going through the first corner, but on the same lap Menard, with pushing assistance from Martin, passed him. On the second lap, the first caution was given because Newman spun sideways in the second turn but avoided impacting the wall. During the caution, he drove to pit road for a pit stop.|$|E

5|$|In second {{practice}} on Thursday afternoon, Ricciardo was fastest, setting {{a time of}} 1:14.607, {{more than half a}} second clear of Hamilton in second place. Rosberg and Verstappen, in third and fourth, were the only <b>other</b> <b>drivers</b> to get within a second of Ricciardo, while the two Williams drivers Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa struggled, ending the session 14th and 16th respectively. At Ferrari, Kimi Räikkönen was fastest in seventh spot. His teammate, Vettel, had an incident-packed session that eventually ended with him setting the ninth fastest time. He spun at Mirabeau corner, damaging his rear wing, only to hit the wall in turn one after coming back to the track, albeit continuing with wheel rim damage. A VSC period occurred after Romain Grosjean crashed into the outside barrier at the exit of the tunnel. Two more VSC periods ensued when Rio Haryanto touched the inside barrier at the same spot and later after Kevin Magnussen crashed at the final corner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{practice}} session, Chip Ganassi Racing driver Scott Dixon recorded the fastest lap, ahead of Team Penske's Ryan Briscoe, the Andretti Autosport car of Tony Kanaan and Briscoe's teammate Will Power. Due to the slippery {{nature of the}} circuit, drivers were caught out and ended up inflicting damage to their cars. Defending series champion Dario Franchitti ventured down the escape road before damaging his suspension against the Turn 8 wall. He ended the session in seventeenth position. <b>Other</b> <b>drivers</b> to hit the wall included Romancini and Milka Duno. Incidents continued in the second practice session, with no less than five drivers spinning or making {{contact with the outside}} retaining walls. The session saw the same top four drivers as the first session.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{practice}} session, Sam Hornish, Jr. was fastest, placing ahead of Kahne in second, and Kyle Busch in third. Biffle was fourth fastest, and Hamlin placed fifth.
