Sperry arranged for AC Spark Plug to take over manufacture, initially on a sub-contract basis and later for direct sales to the UK.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile <b>ones</b> <b>like</b> deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear found no evidence that they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
5|$|Anthropogenic ecology {{refers to}} the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, to smaller <b>ones</b> <b>like</b> rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries might {{indicate}} that Mesa Verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa. Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that, {{with the exception of}} invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover, the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4,000 years.|$|E

Like in most Arab cultures, meals are a {{time to spend with}} family and could last 1–2 hours depending on the specific time of the day.

5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There {{was a massive}} outpouring of community and business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round <b>ones</b> <b>like</b> the one used in Haymarket Square.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequel to}} Dungeon Keeper, Dungeon Keeper 2 carries over many {{gameplay}} aspects, and adds new <b>ones.</b> <b>Like</b> the original, Dungeon Keeper 2 places the {{player in the}} role of a malignant overlord bent on world domination. The player controls the world with a hand, performing actions such as moving creatures around the map, casting spells, and interacting with specific items. All the underground lands in the kingdom must be conquered to recover the portal gems. The kingdom itself {{takes the form of a}} large table containing a 3D map where the player selects where to attack from the highlighted regions. There are twenty main levels in the campaign. Some levels have multiple versions with differing methods of attack, allowing the player to choose the method and sub-region.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller <b>ones</b> <b>like</b> leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E

25|$|The spinner dolphin feeds {{mainly on}} small mesopelagic fish, squids, and sergestid shrimps, and will dive 200–300 m {{to feed on}} them. Spinner {{dolphins}} of Hawaii are nocturnal feeders and forage in deep scattering layers, which contain many species. The dwarf spinner dolphin may feed mostly on benthic fish in reefs and shallow water. Off Oahu, Hawaii, spinner dolphins forage at night and cooperatively herd their prey into highly dense patches. They swim around the prey {{in a circle and}} a pair may swim through the circle to make a catch. Spinner dolphins are in turn preyed on by sharks. Other possible predators include the killer whale, the false killer whale, the pygmy killer whale and the short-finned pilot whale. They are susceptible to parasites, both external <b>ones</b> <b>like</b> barnacles and remoras, and internal <b>ones,</b> <b>like</b> nematodes, trematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans.|$|E
