5|$|McGovern did not mourn {{leaving the}} Senate. Although being {{rejected}} {{by his own}} state stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted a more conservative representative; he and Eleanor felt out <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> country {{and in some ways}} liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat the Moral Majority and other new Christian right forces. In 1982, he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. Congressional elections. McGovern shut the committee down when he decided to run for president again.|$|E

5|$|Potter {{had become}} tired of writing for {{children}} and increasingly unfamiliar with them. The Moore children (for whom she had written several tales early in her career) were grown, and Potter had not replaced them with other children, although she continued to write letters to child fans who had written her. She was out <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> interests of American children. Her marriage to William Heelis on October 15, 1913 effectively ended her literary and artistic career. Although she published sporadically {{in the years following}} her marriage, her works depended principally upon decades-old concepts filed away in her publisher's offices and ageing illustrations tucked away in her portfolio. Only The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (1918) brought forth a completely new set of illustrations from the artist. She devoted herself to marriage and farming, and avoided publicity and fans.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 28 June, a battle group of the 1st SS Panzer Division, Kampfgruppe Frey, arrived at the front and was placed under the command of the 12th SS Panzer Division. At 0810, General Friedrich Dollmann, the 7th Army commander, ordered SS-Obergruppenführer Paul Hausser to divert the II SS Panzer Corps, to {{counter-attack}} south of Cheux. Hausser replied that no counter-attack could be launched until the following day, as so many of his units had yet to reach the front. The German command was thrown into disarray by Dollmann's sudden death, when Rommel and Gerd von Rundstedt (OB West) were en route to a conference with Hitler and out <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> situation. It was not until 1500 that Hausser was appointed commander of the 7th Army, with Willi Bittrich replacing him as commander of II SS Panzer Corps. (Hausser was advised to retain control of the Corps until the following morning.) Pending the return of Rommel to Normandy, Hausser was also to be supreme commander in the invasion area. At 1700 the command structure was changed again; the 7th Army under Hausser would be responsible for the invasion front facing the American army, while the Panzer Group West (General Geyr von Schweppenburg) was to be responsible for the invasion front facing the Anglo-Canadian forces.|$|E
5|$|For Alderson {{the battle}} {{had been a}} failure: {{although}} his troops had held, he had found himself out <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> front line and unable to get accurate information about the situation. At one stage he had been commanding 33 battalions across several miles of front line with no central co-ordination and great confusion between his distant headquarters and the trenches. In addition to his personal failings however, the Ross rifles had proven almost useless in battle and some of Alderson's officer corps had performed poorly. In particular Brigadier-General Richard Turner, commander of the 3rd Brigade, and Turner's brigade-major, Colonel Garnet Hughes, the son of Sam Hughes, caused much havoc when {{on the second day}} of the battle, they unilaterally withdrew the 3rd Brigade from the front line, opening up a 4,000-yard gap through which the Germans threatened the entire Ypres Salient. Colonel John Carson however, who reported personally to Hughes, downplayed the difficulties and blamed the heavy casualties on Alderson's leadership, indicating that the division had only been saved from annihilation by the actions of Turner and Hughes.|$|E

40|$|This diploma work deals <b>with</b> what {{influence}} <b>the</b> colour (red, yellow, {{green and}} blue) of an obstacle {{has on the}} jumping performance of horses. Eleven horses of different ages and breeds which are used for both recreational as well as sport riding purposes participated in the trial. The success of the horses at jumping over obstacles of variours colours was evaluated {{in relation to other}} selected variables, namely gender, age, height of the jump, and the type of riding surface. The horses were most successful at jumping yellow (96. 4 %) and red (95. 2 %) obstacles, whilst being less successful over green (85. 7 %) and blue (83. 3 %) ones. A successful jump included those where the front or hind hoof touched the obstacle without actually knocking the obstacle down. The values for <b>touching</b> <b>the</b> obstacle <b>with</b> <b>the</b> front or hind hoof were approximately the same for the red (7. 1 %) and green (9. 5 %) obstacles. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> yellow obstacles, there was a higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> front hoof (11. 9 %) than the hind hoof (4. 7 %). <b>With</b> <b>the</b> blue obstacles, there was also a higher percentage <b>of</b> <b>touching</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> front hoof (10. 7 %) than the hind hoof (9. 5 %), although the difference was not as marked as <b>with</b> <b>the</b> yellow obstacles. The influence of the other selected variables on the jumping performance of the horses over the different coloured obstacles was diverse. The values of the correlation coefficients for gender and the type of riding surface did not prove there was a statistically significant influence of the horse´s success. In contrast, statistically significant relationships were proven for the height of a jump which was green, with a correlation coefficient rxy = - 0. 236 + (i. e. the higher the green jump the less successful the jumps), or yellow, with a correlation coefficient rxy = - 0. 377 +++ (i. e. the older the horse the less successful the jumps) ...|$|R

25|$|Egypt {{was neither}} an {{independent}} ally nor {{a member of}} the British Empire and as such held a unique position amongst the belligerents. The recently appointed High Commissioner Sir Reginald Wingate and Murray agreed that Egypt's contributions would be restricted {{to the use of the}} country's railway and Egyptian personnel. However, Maxwell had proclaimed on 6 November 1914 that Egypt would not be required to aid Britain's war effort. Martial law allowed the British administration to control foreign European residents, monitor foreign agents and intern dangerous persons who were the subjects of hostile nations. The powers were also used to police prostitution and the sale of alcohol. The Capitulations, however provided some protection to the Europeans who controlled both these industries. In the autumn of 1917 GHQ was transferred from Cairo to the front leaving garrison battalions. This move took the commander in chief of the EEF, who was responsible for martial law, out <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> civil authorities, and unrest in Egypt became serious during the winter of 1917/18.|$|E
25|$|The {{high winds}} {{and the lack}} of {{observation}} in the preceding days due to rain, reduced the accuracy of the British artillery and the presence of German aircraft, which correspondingly increased the accuracy of German defensive barrages, contributed to the failure of the infantry to reach their objectives, except at Le Sars and beyond Gueudecourt. The 47th Division attack on the Butte de Warlencourt succeeded on the right flank but failed to capture the butte, which was on the left flank. The 23rd Division had captured all its objectives and credited the artillery support for the success of the attacks, along with the efforts of the troops on the lines of communication, who from 2 to 8 October endured constant shelling. Telephone lines were frequently cut by the German artillery-fire but the brigade headquarters were rarely out <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> battalions for many minutes. Runners from battalion headquarters to the front, crossed ground under severe bombardment yet rarely delivered messages late. The initiative of the battalion commanders and the co-ordination of units, so that the 13th DLI immediately reinforced the Green Howards and the discretion of the 12th DLI in waiting at the tangle were commended.|$|E
25|$|Towards this end, Hamilton {{added to}} the Committee local {{attorney}} Hughes Spalding, chairman of the Fulton-DeKalb Hospital Authority, which owned and operated Grady Memorial Hospital.

Hamilton saw it as a beginning, but black leaders saw it as being out <b>of</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reality of the times. The Hospital Authority donated the land for the hospital site, adjacent to Grady. Spalding won endorsements from county commissioners of Fulton and DeKalb, as well as the Fulton County Medical Society and area newspapers, which helped promote the concept. By 1949, $1.725 million in funds had been raised, with the remaining funding to come from the state and the Hospital Authority. Ground was broken on February 1, 1950. Named the Hughes Spalding Pavilion, it was dedicated May 29, 1952. Hamilton was named as secretary to the advisory board of trustees. In 1955, Hamilton and black members of Atlanta's legal and medical community organized Foundation for the Advancement of Medical and Nursing Education, with Hamilton as secretary. The foundation raised $10,000. No one applied for the money. Black interns could not serve at Grady. The United States Public Health Service provided $40,000 in surgery grants.|$|E
