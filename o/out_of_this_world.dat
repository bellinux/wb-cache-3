5|$|The {{game was}} {{published}} in North America under the title <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> {{in order to avoid}} confusion with the popular but unrelated soap opera television series Another World. Coincidentally, the science fiction sitcom <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> aired {{at the same time as}} the game's USA-Canada release.|$|E
5|$|Through Interplay Entertainment, {{the game}} was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), the Sega Genesis (Mega Drive), and the Apple IIGS in 1992. The SNES, Sega CD, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer (3DO) and Apple IIGS ports each contain a prologue before the {{introduction}} begins, which consists of an entry that comes from Lester's diary. The Mega Drive port's prologue {{is different from that}} of the SNES and 3DO ports. The Sega CD version of Another World combines the original game (with CD quality new music by Freitas) with the sequel, Heart of the Alien, and was released exclusively in North America as Heart of the Alien: <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> Parts I and II.|$|E

25|$|Earle is a vocal {{opponent}} of capital punishment, which he considers his primary area of political activism. Several {{of his songs}} have provided descriptions of the experiences of death row inmates. He is also pro-choice on abortion, and has argued that rich Americans have always had access to abortions, and that the political issue in the US is really whether poor women should have access. His novel I'll Never Get <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> Alive describes {{the life of a}} morphine-addicted doctor in San Antonio before Roe v. Wade who treats gunshot wounds and provides illegal abortions to poor women.|$|E
25|$|Irene Shubik {{began her}} career working on {{educational}} films for Encyclopædia Britannica Inc in Chicago. Returning to London, she joined ABC Television {{as a story}} editor on the anthology series Armchair Theatre, under producer Sydney Newman in 1960. Shubik had been a science fiction fan since college, and in 1961 approached Newman with a proposal to create a science fiction version of Armchair Theatre. This became <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>World,</b> a sixty-minute anthology series hosted by Boris Karloff that ran for thirteen episodes between June and September 1962. Many of the episodes were adaptations of stories by writers including John Wyndham, Isaac Asimov and Philip K. Dick.|$|E

25|$|A {{title for}} the series had not been decided when {{production}} began. Names including Dimension 4, The Edge of Tomorrow and From the Unknown were considered before settling on Out of the Unknown. The title music was composed by Norman Kay and the title sequence was created by Bernard Lodge. It was intended from an early stage that, as with Boris Karloff on <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>World,</b> each story would be introduced by a regular host. Christopher Lee and Vincent Price were approached but were not available and the idea was dropped. The episode “Some Lapse of Time” is notable for having Ridley Scott, future director of such films as Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator, as designer.|$|E
25|$|Lake's career faltered {{with her}} unsympathetic role as Nazi spy Dora Bruckman in The Hour Before the Dawn (1944). Scathing reviews of The Hour Before the Dawn {{included}} criticism of her unconvincing German accent. She had begun drinking more heavily during this period, {{and a growing}} number of people refused to work with her. Lake had a number of months off work, during which time she lost a child and was divorced. She was brought back in Bring on the Girls (1945), Lake's first proper musical (although she had sung in This Gun for Hire and Star Spangled Rhythm). There were two more movies with Bracken, <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> and Hold That Blonde (both also 1945).|$|E
25|$|These {{cautions}} being duly observed, I {{do not see}} how {{any person}} can devote himself too entirely {{to the cause of}} the Apostolical Church in these realms.

He may have to wait long, and very likely pass <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>world</b> before he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and as a true Churchman, he has that encouragement, which no other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:—he is calmly, soberly, demonstrably, SURE, that, sooner or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal.|$|E

25|$|Along the {{way they}} find Patrick Danville, a young man imprisoned by someone who calls himself Joe Collins but is really a psychic vampire named Dandelo. Dandelo feeds off the {{emotions}} of his victims, and starts to feed off of Roland and Susannah by telling them jokes. Roland and Susannah are alerted to the danger by Stephen King, who drops clues directly into the book, enabling them to defeat the vampire. They discover Patrick in the basement, and find that Dandelo had removed his tongue. Patrick is freed and soon his special talent becomes evident: his drawings and paintings become reality. As their travels bring them nearer to the Dark Tower, Susannah comes {{to the conclusion that}} Roland needs to complete his journey without her. Susannah asks Patrick to draw a door she has seen in her dreams to lead her <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>world.</b> He does so and once it appears, Susannah says goodbye to Roland and crosses over to another world.|$|E
25|$|The {{package was}} aimed at {{attracting}} viewers to NBC stations in the half-hour preceding prime time (8:00p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone, 7:00p.m. elsewhere), and was conceived {{as a result of}} the FCC's loosening of the Prime Time Access Rule, legislation passed in 1971 that required networks to turn over the 7:30p.m. (Eastern) time slot to local stations to program local or syndicated content; and the relaxation of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which had prevented networks from producing content from their own syndication units to fill the void. The shows that were part of the package were regularly outrated in many markets by such syndicated game shows as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy! and Hollywood Squares. Marblehead Manor, We Got It Made and You Can't Take It With You were cancelled at the end of the 1987–88 season, with She's the Sheriff lasting one more season in weekend syndication before its cancellation. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> ran for three additional seasons, airing mainly on weekends, and was the most successful of the five series.|$|E
500|$|Despite these failures, Joseph Meyers, Avon's owner, {{decided to}} try another pulp {{magazine}} the following year when his printer, J.W.

Wollheim, Avon's executive editor, titled the new magazine 10 Story Fantasy, although it actually contained thirteen stories. [...] The layout bore a strong resemblance to that of <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> Adventures: both magazines had unusually elaborate artwork for the table of contents, and in both magazines the first letter of each story was decorated with black and white art. [...] As in <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> Adventures, the interior art was mostly supplied by William McWilliam and [...] "Martin", both of whom worked in Avon's comics department.|$|E

60|$|And {{then the}} fatal thought came to him--why should he {{restrain}} himself? What was this girl to him? Had he not always hated {{her and her}} kind?

60|$|He saw {{and thanked}} {{her for the}} effort, felt the {{sustaining}} power of a true wife's heart, and {{seemed to have no}} other care, since she was by him steadfast to the end.

500|$|<b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> Adventures was a pulp {{magazine}} which published two issues, in July and December 1950.

[...] Sales were weak, and after two issues Avon decided to cancel it.|$|E
500|$|In 1947 Avon Books {{launched}} the Avon Fantasy Reader, {{a series of}} fantasy anthologies in digest format, edited by Donald A. Wollheim. [...] Two years later, Joseph Meyers, Avon's president, decided to launch a science fiction magazine, and Wollheim purchased six stories for it before it was cancelled for financial reasons. The following year, Avon's printer, J.W. Clements, suggested to Meyers {{the idea of a}} pulp magazine which included a few pages of comics. [...] Meyers asked Wollheim to try the idea, thinking that the additional section might draw comics readers to buy a pulp magazine, and in July 1950 Wollheim duly launched Sparkling Love Stories and <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> Adventures. [...] The romance magazine was cancelled after a single issue because of poor sales; but <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> <b>World</b> Adventures seemed promising enough to try a second issue, which appeared in December 1950, along with a third magazine in the part-comic format: Pioneer Western. [...] Neither sold well enough to extend their runs any further.|$|E
