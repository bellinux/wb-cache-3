5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years are unable to reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are unable to consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E
5|$|Mother hippos {{are very}} {{protective}} {{of their young}} and may keep others at a distance. However, calves are occasionally left in nurseries which are guarded by <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> adults. Calves in nurseries engage in playfights. Weaning starts between six and eight months after birth, and most calves are fully weaned after a year. Like many other large mammals, hippos are described as K-strategists, in this case typically producing just one large, well-developed infant {{every couple of years}} (rather than many small, poorly developed young several times per year as is common among small mammals such as rodents).|$|E
5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing with <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> reference translations: in real life, sentences {{can be translated}} in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render {{the meaning of the}} translation in practice means HyTER also is only an approximation.|$|E

5|$|Bloet {{continued}} to be an advisor to the king even after Rufus was succeeded by King Henry I, and was a supporter of Henry during the rebellion of 1102. During the rebellion, Bloet was sent by King Henry to besiege Tickhill Castle, which surrendered when the king joined Bloet with a larger army. When the king and Anselm clashed over investiture, the king persuaded Bloet to consecrate {{a number of the}} king's abbatial appointments in 1102 and 1103. Throughout Henry's reign, Bloet {{continued to}} be a trusted councillor, and was often trusted with advising the queen when the king was absent from England. Bloet is only recorded as accompanying the king outside England once, in 1114. He served as a royal justice often, being named by Henry of Huntingdon as one of the justices who were not restricted to <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> counties but who served throughout England. During Henry's reign, Bloet witnessed 155 royal documents.|$|E
5|$|In a hierarchy, {{individuals}} are either dominant or submissive. A despotic hierarchy is where one individual is dominant {{while the others}} are submissive, as in wolves and lemurs, and a pecking order is a linear ranking of individuals {{where there is a}} top individual and a bottom individual. Pecking orders may also be ranked by sex, where the lowest individual of a sex has a higher ranking than the top individual of the other sex, as in hyenas. Dominant individuals, or alphas, have a high chance of reproductive success, especially in harems where <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> males (resident males) have exclusive breeding rights to females in a group. Non-resident males can also be accepted in harems, but some species, such as the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), may be more strict.|$|E
5|$|Most {{bees are}} polylectic (generalist) meaning they collect pollen {{from a range}} of {{flowering}} plants, however, some are oligoleges (specialists), in that they only gather pollen from <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> species or genera of closely related plants. Specialist pollinators also include bee species which gather floral oils instead of pollen, and male orchid bees, which gather aromatic compounds from orchids (one of the few cases where male bees are effective pollinators). Bees are able to sense the presence of desirable flowers through ultraviolet patterning on flowers, floral odors, and even electromagnetic fields. Once landed, a bee then uses nectar quality and pollen taste to determine whether to continue visiting similar flowers.|$|E

5000|$|No {{redundancy}} - Since {{there is}} usually <b>one</b> switch, <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> devices, {{it is possible for}} the switch to fail. Since there is no alternative path, the network will become inaccessible and computers may lose connectivity.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{shows are}} {{designated}} as [...] "All-breed" [...] events, open to multiple breeds of the given animal. Others shows may be breed shows, limited to <b>one</b> <b>or</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> specific breeds {{of a given}} animal.|$|R
5|$|Other {{countries}} and languages followed soon. The first German translations appeared in 1954, {{and in the}} 1960s Bessy {{and to a lesser}} extent Jerom were an enormous success, with combined over a 1000 weekly comics with a circulation of some 200,000 copies. Later in the 1950s followed publications in Chile and Portugal, and Spain followed in the 1960s. In the following years, Vandersteen's comics and especially Suske en Wiske were published in dozens of languages, but in most cases only <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> albums are translated. More 9 albums were published in the United States, and in Sweden 69 albums were published, accompanied by merchandising. The Finnish series experienced success as well.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals are {{perfectly}} monogamous, {{meaning that they}} mate for life and take no other partners (even after the original mate’s death), as with wolves, Eurasian beavers, and otters. There are three types of polygamy: either one or multiple dominant males have breeding rights (polygyny), multiple males that females mate with (polyandry), or multiple males have exclusive relations with multiple females (polygynandry). It is much more common for polygynous mating to happen, which, excluding leks, are estimated to occur in up to 90% of mammals. Lek mating occurs in harems, wherein <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> males protect their harem of females from other males who would otherwise mate with the females, as in elephant seals; or males congregate around females and try to attract them with various courtship displays and vocalizations, as in harbor seals.|$|E
5|$|The best-known role of {{proteins}} {{in the cell}} is as enzymes, which catalyse chemical reactions. Enzymes are usually highly specific and accelerate only <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> chemical reactions. Enzymes carry {{out most of the}} reactions involved in metabolism, as well as manipulating DNA in processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription. Some enzymes act on other proteins to add or remove chemical groups in a process known as posttranslational modification. About 4,000 reactions are known to be catalysed by enzymes. The rate acceleration conferred by enzymatic catalysis is often enormous—as much as 1017-fold increase in rate over the uncatalysed reaction in the case of orotate decarboxylase (78 million years without the enzyme, 18 milliseconds with the enzyme).|$|E
5|$|In the Arthurian legends, each {{knight of}} the Round Table is often {{accompanied}} by a heraldic description of a coat of arms. Although these arms could be arbitrary, some characters were traditionally associated with <b>one</b> coat <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> different coats.|$|R
5000|$|Jurisdictions {{frequently}} adopt <b>one</b> <b>or</b> only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the prefixes {{allowed to}} them within a block-range, reserving the others for other occasions. Canada has 24 possible, two-letter prefixes from its assigned ranges, but only assigns CY, VA, VE, VO, and VY for normal operation.|$|R
50|$|Fires of {{any kind}} can have both {{positive}} and negative effects on the ecosystem. In some instances, a fire can cause <b>one</b> <b>or</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> species to predominate when the forest begins to regenerate. However, fire can also promote more diversity within the regenerated forest.|$|R
5|$|Writing {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the Brazilian {{abolitionist}} leader Joaquim Nabuco {{said that}} Rio Branco was—of all the politicians who held the office during PedroII's reign—the most fitted to the post of President of the Council of Ministers. Nabuco considered him one of the greatest statesmen of the Empire. However, he also argued that as a leader, a lawmaker, and a creator of doctrines, there were many other politicians far better than Rio Branco. But unlike all the others, who were brilliantly accomplished in <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> skills, but lacking in many others, Rio Branco was good—though unexceptional—in all. In other words, he was a competent generalist. Nabuco's view was that due to Rio Branco's lack of first-rate abilities, he would not have been the best leader in troubled times—such as the anarchy which existed during PedroII's minority, or {{at the end of}} a period of chaos when strong action was needed to rebuild. Rio Branco was, however, the perfect choice in a time of peace and stability where his multiple skills could shine. His ability exactly fit the situation in Brazil when he became President of the Council of Ministers in 1871.|$|E

50|$|In {{software}} development, {{programming in}} the small describes the activity of writing a small program. Small programs are typified by being small {{in terms of their}} source code size, are easy to specify, quick to code and typically perform <b>one</b> task <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> very closely related tasks very well.|$|R
25|$|The {{standard}} {{advice for}} people to stay put until rescued relied {{on the assumption that}} construction standards such as concrete and fire-resistant doors would allow fire services to contain a fire within <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> affected flats. However, at Grenfell the fire was spread rapidly via the building's exterior cladding.|$|E
25|$|Three-dimensional {{games have}} used spatial {{partitioning}} methods for -body pruning, {{and for a}} long time used <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> spheres per actual 3D object for pairwise checks.

25|$|HBO {{also had}} a 30-minute program of music videos called Video Jukebox, that first aired {{around the time of}} MTV's launch and would last until late 1986. Also around this time, HBO, as well as other premium {{channels}} such as Cinemax, Showtime and The Movie Channel, would occasionally play <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> music videos between movies.|$|E

50|$|A faulty {{generalization}} is {{a conclusion}} about all or many instances of {{a phenomenon that}} has been reached {{on the basis of}} just <b>one</b> <b>or</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> instances of that phenomenon. It is an example of jumping to conclusions. For example, we may generalize about all people, or all members of a group, based on what we know about just <b>one</b> <b>or</b> just <b>a</b> <b>few</b> people. If we meet an angry person from a given country X, we may suspect that most people in country X are often angry. If we meet a lazy recipient of social welfare benefits, we may suspect that all welfare recipients are lazy. Faulty generalizations may lead to further incorrect conclusions. We may for example conclude that citizens of country X are genetically inferior, or that poverty is generally the fault of the poor.|$|R

The stem tuber has a vertical orientation with <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> vegetative buds on the top and fibrous roots produced on the bottom from a basal section, typically the stem tuber has an oblong rounded shape.|$|E
25|$|Gladwell often {{speaks of}} the {{importance}} of holism to unconscious intelligence, meaning that it considers the situation as a whole. At the same time, he stresses that unconscious intelligence relies on finding simple underlying patterns. However, only when a situation is overwhelmingly determined by <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> interacting factors is holism consistent with simple underlying signatures. In many situations, holism and simple underlying signatures pull in different directions.|$|E
