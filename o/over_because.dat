5|$|The multi-coloured {{platform}} tiles on the Northern line were reconstructed in the 1920s {{in conjunction}} with an extension to Morden station. The tiles were carefully replicated in 2006 to replace the originals, which were in poor condition. The original C tiles dating from 1890 remain on the tunnel roofs of the Northern line platforms, albeit now covered over by the new cable-management system. The station was refurbished in 2007. The original maroon and cream tiling on the Bakerloo line platforms has been covered <b>over.</b> <b>Because</b> of {{the arrangement of the}} lighting, cabling and public address loudspeakers, {{it was not possible to}} arrange the new roundels at alternate ‘low’ and ‘high’ positions, all being at the lower level.|$|E

25|$|The explosion's {{effect on}} the trees near the {{hypocentre}} of the explosion was replicated during atmospheric nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s, and {{was similar to the}} effects of the conventional Operation Blowdown. These effects are caused by the blast wave produced by large explosions. The trees directly below the explosion are stripped as the blast wave moves vertically downward, while trees farther away are knocked <b>over</b> <b>because</b> the blast wave is travelling closer to horizontal when it reaches them.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{crashed on}} 10 January 1964, on its 125th sortie, during a low-altitude hover. During a vertical descent the aircraft experienced uncontrollable divergent wing oscillations, the port wing eventually striking {{the ground at}} an acute angle with the aircraft rolling <b>over</b> <b>because</b> of the continued lift engine thrust. The loss was attributed to loss of control because the stabilising limits of the three-axis autostabilisation system's 'puffer pipes' were exceeded in roll. Although airframe damage was relatively light, the Centre D'Essai en Vol test pilot, Jacques Pinier, did not eject and died in the crash.|$|E

25|$|In March 1993, {{with much}} help from ECOMOG troops {{provided}} by Nigeria, the SLA recaptured the Koidu and Kono diamond districts {{and pushed the}} RUF to the Sierra Leone – Liberia border. The RUF was facing supply problems as the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) gains inside Liberia were restricting the ability of Charles Taylor’s NPFL to trade with the RUF. By the end of 1993, many observers thought {{that the war was}} <b>over</b> <b>because</b> {{for the first time in}} the conflict the Sierra Leone Army was able to establish itself in the Eastern and the Southern mining districts.|$|E
25|$|The {{armies of}} Hamilcar and Agathocles clashed in the Battle of the Himera River in 311BC. Agathocles {{suffered}} a disastrous defeat there because {{a large part}} of his army was killed or taken prisoner by the Carthaginians. He gathered the survivors, burned his camp and withdrew to Gela. There he remained for some time to divert the Carthaginian army from Syracuse. This allowed the Syracusans to harvest their crops. Hamilcar first besieged the Gela, but gave up when he discovered that Agathocles had large supplies and enough soldiers to defend the city. He then visited the cities and strongholds which were still siding with Agathocles to win them <b>over.</b> <b>Because</b> they despised Agathocles they soon deserted to the Carthaginians.|$|E

In 2014, he posthumously received the Medal of Honor in a ceremony that awarded it to 23 other servicemen who were passed <b>over</b> <b>because</b> of their ethnicity.

25|$|The {{subsequent}} ODI series {{between the}} two teams was drawn 3–3. The series was notable for two incidents. In the fifth match at Georgetown, Guyana, Waugh was facing the bowling of Keith Arthurton with his team needing four runs from the final over to win. He struck the last ball of the match into the outfield, and attempted three runs to tie the match. A crowd invasion resulted in all the stumps being removed, with Waugh out of his ground when the ball was returned by the fielder. The match was declared a tie. During the West Indies run-chase in the final match in Barbados, local batsman Sherwin Campbell was run out after he fell <b>over</b> <b>because</b> of a collision with the bowler (Brendon Julian) who was attempting to field the ball. This resulted in a crowd riot and Waugh was nearly struck {{in the head with}} a glass bottle. The match continued after Campbell was reinstated, but Waugh criticised the security and questioned the integrity of the match.|$|E
25|$|Stacey {{decides not to}} tell Ryan {{that he must be}} {{the father}} of her baby. He {{exhibits}} a romantic interest in her, which is later revealed {{to be part of a}} bet with his girlfriend Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks). Upset by this revelation, Stacey's waters break. Ryan stays with her as she gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Lily. When Ryan later rescues them from a fire at The Queen Victoria pub, Stacey admits that he is Lily's father. Ryan initially refuses to act as a parent to her, but bonds with her when Stacey and a jealous Janine are arrested for fighting during a night out. Janine's jealousy escalates to kidnapping Lily, but Ryan convinces her to return her. Stacey and Ryan grow closer, spending time together, and they passionately kiss. During this time, Lauren (now Jacqueline Jossa) discovers Stacey's guilt in Archie's death and records a confession on her phone. Stacey attempts to flee to Palma, Majorca, but Ryan stops her, telling her he has feelings for her and wants to date her. They start an affair, but unbeknownst to them, Janine finds out, who poisons Ryan in revenge. Ryan is hospitalised and on his return, he convinces Janine he loves her but publicly declares his love for Stacey in The Queen Victoria. Janine walks in as they are in a passionate embrace. She concedes defeat until Lauren, who still believes Max is emotionally involved with Stacey, gives Janine the recorded confession. The next day, Janine attempts to play the recording in front of punters in The Queen Victoria, but it has been recorded <b>over</b> <b>because</b> Lauren warned Max. Janine says that Stacey killed Archie but no one believes her. Stacey leaves the pub in tears, followed by Ryan. She then breaks down and tells Ryan that Janine said the truth.|$|E

25|$|The England innings {{began with}} 10 extras from Jeff Thomson with Rod Marsh leaping behind the stumps in vain as one ball lifted {{over the heads}} of the batsman and wicketkeeper for four. Thereafter wickets fell {{regularly}} with the Hillites cheering on the fast bowlers, but it was Max Walker (2/77) who made the breakthrough when he swung the ball to the edge of Dennis Amiss's bat to see it superbly caught by Mallett in the gully. Thomson took a surprisingly good catch to dismiss Lloyd off a Lillee bouncer and then beat Cowdrey three balls in a row before the master was caught by McCosker at short leg. This left England 69/3, but Edrich and Fletcher saw the day out safely enough. One ball from the captain was driven full into McCosker's face, knocking him unconscious for five minutes and he was helped off the field. Mallet was brought on at the end of the day, but asked to be taken off after one <b>over</b> <b>because</b> of his bruised had from that morning. Returning on the third day Thomson was bowling at his fastest and took 1/12 off five overs, having Edrich missed by Redpath in the slips, Greig caught by Greg Chappell and almost having Alan Knott out on the second, third and fourth balls he faced, dropped by Marsh, a caught behind not given and almost bowled by an inswinger. Fletcher was hit on the head by a bouncer and was caught by Redpath off Walker to leave England were 123/5, their top order failing again. After his escape Knott rode his luck and sliced 11 fours in an innings of 82, adding 57 with Edrich (50), 60 with Fred Titmus (22) and 33 with Derek Underwood (27). Knott and Underwood took 14 runs off one Lillee over and Ian Chappell had to set a defensive field for the first time in the series. The wicketkeeper was finally dismissed leaning back ready to cut the short ball and had his stumps flattened by a Thomson half-volley, but Lillee repeatedly bounced the tailenders and gave Bob Willis a beamer which fortunately missed his head. Willis was bowled by Thomson (4/74) and Lillee took the last wicket, having Underwood caught by Walker when he drove high into the covers. England were out for 295, having saved the follow on, which looked unlikely at one point, but still 110 runs behind.|$|E

Walmesley lent his support to Johnson's application, but Johnson was passed <b>over</b> <b>because</b> the school's directors thought he was [...] "a very haughty, ill-natured gent., and that he has such a way of distorting his face (which though he can't help) the gent think it may affect some lads". He was also rejected for a position at a school in Brewood for similar reasons. Johnson did not give up his ambition to teach; with Walmesley's encouragement, he decided to set up his own school.|$|E

500|$|Buckell soon {{receives}} {{word that}} noted radiation-poisoning specialist Dr. Jacob Hoffman (Fred La Porta) {{has agreed to}} help Gil and plans on arriving in the area within a few days. When radiation poisoning studies offer no leads on solving Gil's own particular symptoms, the distraught scientist contemplates suicide, but soon changes his mind. Instead, Gil returns to the bar where Trudy joins him for a drink and comments that the evening is not <b>over</b> <b>because</b> it is [...] "never late until the sun comes up." [...] Although Gil is disturbed by the comment, his loneliness draws him closer to her. When bar patron George insinuates that he has purchased Trudy's company for the evening, Gil defends her, causing a fight between the two men. After knocking George unconscious, Gil flees with Trudy into the night. Later that evening, after walking the shoreline, they make love, falling asleep in the sand until the morning light awakens Gil. Horrified, Gil flees in his car leaving Trudy stranded on the beach. Arriving at the house, Gil runs in, but not before the transformation occurs.|$|E
500|$|A nightclub {{manager in}} Glendale, C. J.

Although Bradley was replaced early during filming, he {{can be seen in the}} paintball sequence of the film. Graham opted to perform most of his own stunts, including the scene where Jason catches on fire while battling Tommy in the lake. The rest of the cast spoke highly of Graham, remarking that he never complained during all the uncomfortable situations he was placed in. Graham had no intention of being an actor or a stuntman, but the idea of playing the [...] "bad guy", and the opportunity to wear the prosthetics, intrigued him. Graham was not brought back to reprise the role, but has often been cited as speaking highly of his time in the part.|$|E
