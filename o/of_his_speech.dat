5|$|During the 1952 presidential election, the Eisenhower {{campaign}} toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In {{a speech}} delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared {{that while he}} agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>speech,</b> Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of conservative colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>speech.</b> The deletion was discovered by William H. Laurence, a reporter for The New York Times, and featured on its front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point of his campaign.|$|E
5|$|On the day {{following}} the meeting, Shea offered his resignation, becoming instead a special advisor to Daniel Goldin. NASA {{reported that he}} had resigned due to health reasons. However, The Scientist offered a different interpretation, quoting sources who speculated that the bluntness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>speech,</b> including criticisms of Goldin, may have been controversial in NASA circles.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> in the General Council of Senegal, {{governor}} Henri de Lamothe {{proposed that the}} country should take a loan for infrastructure development. The council agreed on a loan worth five million gold francs, {{much of the money}} being {{for the construction of a}} metallic bridge between Saint-Louis and Sor. The loan was approved on November 2, 1892, by the French president Marie François Sadi Carnot. A French bank, CDG, agreed to give the loan with a low interest of only four percent.|$|E

60|$|These remarks {{may seem}} {{to belong to a}} study <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{character}} rather than <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>speeches,</b> yet they are not irrelevant, because the interest <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>speeches</b> lies in their revelation <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character. Let us, however, return to the speeches and to the letters, some of which, given in this volume, are scarcely less noteworthy than are the speeches.|$|R

5|$|Rambhadracharya {{was one of}} {{the spiritual}} and {{religious}} Gurus from India at the Millennium World Peace Summit, organised by the United Nations in New York City from 28 to 31 August 2000. While addressing the gathering, he gave Sanskrit definitions for the words Bharata (the ancient name of India) and Hindu, and touched upon the Nirguna and Saguna aspects of God. In his speech on Peace, he called for developed and developing nations to come together to strive for the eradication of poverty, the fight against terrorism, and nuclear disarmament. At the end <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>speech,</b> he recited the Shanti Mantra.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, events held at Speakers' Corner {{must not}} deal with any matter that relates {{directly}} or indirectly to any religious belief or to religion generally, or which may cause feelings of enmity, hatred, ill-will or hostility between different racial or religious groups in Singapore. On 19 September 2008, Thamiselvan Karuppaya, an Indian real estate agent who wished to speak at Speakers' Corner {{about the use of}} Tamil on public signs, had to change his plans after being informed by the police that he required a permit as the topic <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> was racially sensitive. A subsequent application for a permit was turned down.|$|E
5|$|Demosthenes {{tailored}} {{his style}} {{to be very}} audience-specific. He took pride in not relying on attractive words but rather simple, effective prose. He was mindful of his arrangement, he used clauses to create patterns that would make seemingly complex sentences easy for the hearer to follow. His tendency to focus on delivery promoted him to use repetition, this would ingrain the importance into the audience's minds; he also relied on speed and delay to create suspense and interest among the audience when presenting to most important aspects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>speech.</b> One of his most effective skills was his ability to strike a balance: his works were complex so that the audience would not be offended by any elementary language, {{but the most important}} parts were clear and easily understood.|$|E

5|$|At {{his first}} {{speech to the}} {{assembled}} troops, Alcibiades complained bitterly about {{the circumstances of his}} exile, but the greatest part of the speech consisted of boasting about his influence with Tissaphernes. The primary motives <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>speech</b> were to make the oligarchs at Athens afraid of him and to increase his credit with the army at Samos. Upon hearing his speech the troops immediately elected him General alongside Thrasybulus and the others. In fact, he roused them so much that they proposed to sail at once for Piraeus and attack the oligarchs in Athens. It was primarily Alcibiades, along with Thrasybulus, who calmed the people and showed them the folly of this proposal, which would have sparked civil war and led to the immediate defeat of Athens. Shortly after Alcibiades's reinstatement as an Athenian general, the government of the Four Hundred was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.|$|E
