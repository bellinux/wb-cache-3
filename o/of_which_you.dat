500|$|The 1947 Michigan Wolverines {{football}} team went 10–0 and outscored their opponents 394 to 53. Dworsky led a defensive unit that gave up {{an average of}} 5.3points per game and shut out Michigan State (550), Pitt (600), Indiana (350), Ohio State (210), and USC (490). He also played fullback and center for the 1947 team and was named a third team All-American by the American Football Coaches Association. In a 1988 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Dworsky described the 1947 team's defensive scheme as follows: [...] "We were an intelligent team and we had some complex defenses, the nature <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> see today. I called the defensive signals and we would shift people, looping, or stunting." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{his left}} hand healed, Prokofiev toured the United States {{successfully}} {{at the start of}} 1930, propped up by his recent European success. That year Prokofiev began his first non-Diaghilev ballet On the Dnieper, Op. 51, a work commissioned by Serge Lifar, who had been appointed maitre de ballet at the Paris Opéra. In 1931 and 1932, he completed his fourth and fifth piano concertos. The following year saw the completion of the Symphonic Song, Op. 57, which Prokofiev's friend Myaskovsky – thinking of its potential audience in the Soviet Union – told him [...] "isn't quite for us... it lacks that which we mean by monumentalism – a familiar simplicity and broad contours, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> are extremely capable, but temporarily are carefully avoiding." ...|$|E

Still, Eisenhower noted Patton continued [...] "to exhibit some of those unfortunate traits <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> and I have always known." [...] He informed Marshall of the two incidents and his requirement that Patton apologize. Eisenhower stated he believed Patton would cease his behavior [...] "because fundamentally, he is so avid for recognition as a great military commander that he will ruthlessly suppress any habit of his that will tend to jeopardize it." [...] When Eisenhower arrived in Sicily to award Montgomery the Legion of Merit on 29 August, Patton gave him a letter expressing his remorse about the incidents.|$|E

500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had {{the heart of a}} lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity." ...|$|E

By this he means that no matter what private understandings and/or misunderstandings we may have of some public entity, it is still there before us in reality. The idea that qualia intervene between ourselves and their origins he regards as [...] "a massive error"; as he says, [...] "it is just not credible that visual experiences are systematically misleading in this way"; [...] "the only objects <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>you</b> are aware are the external ones making up the scene before your eyes"; there are [...] "no such things as the qualities of experiences" [...] for [...] "they are qualities of external surfaces (and volumes and films) if they are qualities of anything."
