25|$|Green cement is a {{cementitious}} material that meets or exceeds the functional performance capabilities of <b>ordinary</b> <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> by incorporating and optimizing recycled materials, thereby reducing consumption of natural raw materials, water, and energy, {{resulting in a}} more sustainable construction material.|$|E
25|$|Portland-fly ash cement {{contains}} up to 40% fly ash under ASTM standards (ASTM C595), or 35% under EN standards (EN 197-1). The fly ash is pozzolanic, so that {{ultimate strength}} is maintained. Because fly ash addition allows a lower concrete water content, early strength {{can also be}} maintained.

Five different brands of cement were tested for their chemical constituents such as silica, alumina, iron, calcium, magnesium, sulfates, insoluble residue, free lime and loss on ignition with American standards for testing and materials (ASTM).

25|$|White Portland cement {{or white}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> (WOPC) {{is similar to}} ordinary, grey, Portland cement in all respects, except for its high degree of whiteness. Obtaining this colour {{requires}} high purity raw materials (low Fe2O3 content), and some modification to the method of manufacture, a.o. a higher kiln temperature required to sinter the clinker {{in the absence of}} ferric oxides acting as a flux in normal clinker. As Fe2O3 contributes to decrease the melting point of the clinker (normally 1450°C), the white cement requires a higher sintering temperature (around 1600°C). Because of this, it is somewhat more expensive than the grey product. The main requirement is to have a low iron content which should be less than 0.5wt.% expressed as Fe2O3 for white cement, and less than 0.9wt.% for off-white cement. It also helps to have the iron oxide as ferrous oxide (FeO) which is obtained via slightly reducing conditions in the kiln, i.e., operating with zero excess oxygen at the kiln exit. This gives the clinker and cement a green tinge. Other metallic oxides such as Cr2O3 (green), MnO (pink), TiO2 (white), etc., in trace content, can also give colour tinges, so for a given project it is best to use cement from a single batch.|$|E
2500|$|Portland cement is {{the most}} common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic {{ingredient}} of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grout. It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century, and usually originates from limestone. It is a fine powder, produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker, grinding the clinker, and adding small amounts of other materials. [...] Several types of Portland cement are available. The most common, called <b>ordinary</b> <b>Portland</b> <b>cement</b> (OPC), is grey in colour, but white Portland cement is also available. Its name is derived from its similarity to Portland stone which was quarried on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. It was named by Joseph Aspdin who obtained a patent for it in 1824. However his son William Aspdin is regarded as the inventor of [...] "modern" [...] Portland cement due to his developments in the 1840s.|$|E

The reaction kinetics of the four principal clinker minerals, C 3 S, C 2 S, C 3 A, C 4 AF, are coupled to the microstructure development.

The hydration was carried out with pure water and in the presence of additives such as superplasticizers and setting accelerating agents. As soon as water is added to the cement, ettringite crystallizes. Its evolution appears to be very complex, and lattice parameters change as a function of setting time, indicating a possible chemical evolution of ettringite with time and as a function of pH.

40|$|Abstract. The {{magnesium}} slag is discarded from {{production of}} magnesium metal from dolomite.

As a raw material, SMS can be used for calcining clinker of good quality; and as a blend it is suitable for production of <b>ordinary</b> <b>portland</b> <b>cements.</b> Because the magnesium slag is slaked, SMS has no problem on soundness.

The key for the improved performance of blends (which substitute fine amorphous silicates for cement) is related to their resistance to water penetration. The mechanism of this water resistance is of great environmental and economical impact but is not yet understood due {{to the complexity of}} the cement's hydration reactions. Using neutron spectroscopy, we studied a blend where cement was replaced by ash from sugar cane residuals originating from agricultural waste.
