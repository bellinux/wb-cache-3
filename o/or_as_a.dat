5|$|A complete, {{tenacious}} {{and consistent}} two-footed player, Nedvěd frequently played as a left-sided, offensive wide midfielder <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> left-winger throughout his career, {{due to his}} crossing ability with his left foot, as well as due to his ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot, although {{he was capable of}} playing anywhere in midfield due to his offensive and defensive work-rate. He was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion, as well as in an attacking midfield and playmaking role, <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> supporting striker, where he excelled as an assist-man due to his excellent dribbling ability, passing range and vision. Primarily known for his powerful shots and volleys from distance, as well as his stamina, he was also noted for his speed, endurance, technique and goal-scoring ability. He was also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker.|$|E
5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and hadal zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "learner autonomy" [...] {{was first}} coined in 1981 by Henri Holec, the [...] "father" [...] of learner autonomy. Many {{definitions}} {{have since been}} given to the term, depending on the writer, the context, and the level of debate educators have come to. It has been considered <b>as</b> <b>a</b> personal human trait, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> political measure, <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> educational move. This is because autonomy is seen either (<b>or</b> both) <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> end in education.|$|R

He appears once as a witness to a charter of King Stephen's in 1136, but the authenticity of this document has been questioned. He had built a castle in Normandy at Montreuil-au-Houlme, but Basset did not have possession of it in 1136, when it was held against Stephen's opponents by William de Montpincon.|$|E

5|$|Angels {{on horseback}} {{can be served}} a hors d'œuvre, as a canapé, <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> savoury. Angels on horseback are canapés when served with breads.

5|$|Argon {{is used in}} {{the poultry}} {{industry}} to asphyxiate birds, either for mass culling following disease outbreaks, <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means of slaughter more humane than the electric bath. Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during gassing. Its non-reactive nature makes it suitable in a food product, and since it replaces oxygen within the dead bird, argon also enhances shelf life.|$|E

5|$|Chaoyangsaurus is {{recovered}} {{in a more}} basal position than Psittacosauridae, although Chinnery's original analysis finds it within Neoceratopsia.

The fragmentary Asiaceratops was included in these studies and is found to have a variable position, either as a basal neoceratopsian <b>or</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> leptoceratopsid, most likely due to the amount of missing information. Removal of Asiaceratops stabilizes the entire cladogram.|$|E
