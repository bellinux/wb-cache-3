5|$|The {{earliest}} {{songs that}} could be considered American popular music, as opposed to the popular music of a particular region <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> were sentimental parlor songs by Stephen Foster and his peers, and songs meant for use in minstrel shows, theatrical productions that featured singing, dancing and comic performances. Minstrel shows generally used African instruments and dance, and featured performers with their faces blackened, a technique called blackface. By the middle of the 19th century, touring companies had taken this music not only to every part of the United States, but also to the UK, Western Europe, and even to Africa and Asia. Minstrel shows were generally advertised as though the music of the shows was in an African American style, though this was often not true.|$|E

25|$|An individual's culture <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity</b> {{plays a role}} {{in their}} music cognition, {{including}} their preferences, emotional reaction, and musical memory. Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features. Additionally, individuals' musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music.|$|E
25|$|Another major group, {{inhabitants}} {{who follow}} Eastern Orthodox Christianity, practised chiefly by the Russian minority, and the Russian Orthodox Church {{is the second}} largest denomination with 150,000 members. The Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, under the Greek-Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate, claims another 20,000 members. Thus, the number of adherents of Lutheranism and Orthodoxy, without regard to citizenship <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> is roughly equal. Catholics have their Latin Apostolic Administration of Estonia.|$|E
25|$|The two-nation is the {{ideology}} {{that the primary}} identity and unifying denominator of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent is their religion, rather than their language <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> and therefore Indian Hindus and Muslims are two distinct nations, regardless of ethnic or other commonalities. The two-nation theory was a founding principle of the Pakistan Movement (i.e. {{the ideology}} of Pakistan as a Muslim nation-state in South Asia), and the partition of India in 1947.|$|E

25|$|Another {{theory on}} {{cultural}} assimilation {{centers on the}} racial/ethnic disadvantage model. This theory emphasizes {{that the process of}} assimilation for certain immigrant groups is blocked due to their race <b>or</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> meaning that discrimination in society and in the workplace hinders assimilation into mainstream U.S. society. The major critique of this theory is that it overstresses social barriers along racial and ethnic lines without providing adequate explanations for why many second-generation immigrants overcome these barriers and experience socioeconomic mobility.|$|E
25|$|Some European {{countries}} make {{it illegal}} to collect demographic census information based on ethnicity or ancestry (e.g. France), but some others do query along racial lines (e.g. the UK).

This includes marriages between a Hispanic and non-Hispanic (Hispanics are an ethnic group, not a race) as well as marriages between spouses of different races– be they white, black, Asian, American Indian or those who identify as being of multiple races or some other race.|$|E
50|$|Mapping {{can also}} show spatial {{distributions}} of delinquency and crime, but it cannot explain the results.

50|$|Other {{factors in}} the {{constitutional}} changes were continued Hungarian dissatisfaction with rule from Vienna and increasing national consciousness {{on the part of}} other nationalities (<b>or</b> <b>ethnicities)</b> of the Austrian Empire. Hungarian dissatisfaction arose partly from Austria's suppression with Russian support of the Hungarian liberal revolution of 1848-49. However, dissatisfaction with Austrian rule had grown for many years within Hungary and had many other causes.|$|R
