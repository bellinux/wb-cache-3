40|$|SummaryBecause {{activation}} of ERK 1 / 2 MAP kinase (MAPK) {{is critical for}} hippocampus-dependent memory, there is considerable interest in mechanisms for regulation of MAPK during memory formation. Here we report that MAPK and CREB-mediated transcription are negatively regulated by SCOP (suprachiasmatic nucleus [SCN] circadian oscillatory protein) and that SCOP is proteolyzed by calpain when hippocampal neurons are stimulated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), KCl depolarization, or NMDA. Moreover, training for novel object memory decreases SCOP in the hippocampus. To determine if hippocampus-dependent memory is influenced by SCOP in vivo, we generated a transgenic mouse strain for the inducible overexpression <b>of</b> <b>SCOP</b> in the forebrain. Overexpression <b>of</b> <b>SCOP</b> completely blocked memory for novel objects. We conclude that degradation <b>of</b> <b>SCOP</b> by calpain contributes to {{activation of}} MAPK during memory formation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Benchmarking {{algorithms}} in structural bioinformatics {{often involves}} {{the construction of}} datasets of proteins with given sequence and structural properties. The SCOP database is a manually curated structural classification which groups together proteins {{on the basis of}} structural similarity. The ASTRAL compendium provides non redundant subsets <b>of</b> <b>SCOP</b> domains on the basis of sequence similarity such that no two domains in a given subset share more than a defined degree of sequence similarity. Taken together these two resources provide a 'ground truth' for assessing structural bioinformatics algorithms. We present a small and easy to use API written in python to enable construction of datasets from these resources. Results We have designed a set of python modules to provide an abstraction <b>of</b> the <b>SCOP</b> and ASTRAL databases. The modules are designed to work as part of the Biopython distribution.

40|$|Abstract Background Prediction of {{function}} of proteins {{on the basis}} of structure and vice versa is a partially solved problem, largely in the domain of biophysics and biochemistry. This underlies the need of computational and bioinformatics approach to solve the problem. Large and organized latent knowledge on protein classification exists in the form of independently created protein classification databases. By creating probabilistic maps between classes of structural classification databases (e. g. SCOP 1) and classes {{of function}}al classification databases (e. g. PROSITE 2), structure and function of proteins could be probabilistically related. Results We demonstrate that PROSITE and SCOP have significant semantic overlap, in spite of independent classification schemes. By training classifiers <b>of</b> <b>SCOP</b> using classes <b>of</b> PROSITE as attributes and vice versa, accuracy of Support Vector Machine classifiers for both SCOP and PROSITE was improved. Novel attributes, 2 -D elastic profiles and Blocks were used to improve time complexity and accuracy. Many relationships were extracted between classes <b>of</b> <b>SCOP</b> and PROSITE using decision trees. Conclusion We demonstrate that presented approach can discover new probabilistic relationships between classes of different taxonomies and render a more accurate classification. Extensive mappings between existing protein classification databases can be created to link the large amount of organized data. Probabilistic maps were created between classes <b>of</b> <b>SCOP</b> and PROSITE allowing predictions of structure using function, and vice versa. In our experiments, we also found that functions are indeed more strongly related to structure than are structure to functions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Individual {{recognition}} <b>of</b> <b>Scops</b> Owls (Otus scops) by spectrographic {{analysis of}} their calls: A preliminary study Numerous studies have confirmed that males of several species can be individually identified by spectrographic {{analysis of their}} vocalizations. Spectrographic analysis of 12 recordings <b>of</b> <b>Scops</b> Owl (Otus scops) males made on Ljubljansko barje (central Slovenia) and in Istria (NW Croatia) revealed that this method is suitable for individual recognition of males. Average values for the following three parametres of calls were calculated (±SE) : lenght of call 278. 3 ± 3. 69 ms (min 228 -max 371 ms), time interval between calls 2. 72 ± 0. 05 s (min 2. 08 -max 3. 39 s) and fundamental frequency of call 1. 32 ± 0. 01 kHz (min 1. 17 -max 1. 50 kHz). Discriminant function analysis successfully separated recordings of differents males {{on the basis of}} above mentioned parametres (Wilkins’l= 0. 0027, P< 0. 001). Variables considered in the model were length of call and time interval between calls, whereas fundamental frequency was omit-ted as its variance between individuals was too low. Both discriminant functions were statistically significant (p< 0. 001), the first one accounting for 90 % of variance, and both together for 100 % of variance. Considering the fact that Scops Owls may form larger calling groups and may breed in loose colonies where conditions are favourable, this method represents a very important tool for accurate determination of the number of calling males. Recordings <b>of</b> <b>Scops</b> Owl are relatively easy to obtain as the species is highly vocal and males respond well to playback of another male.

40|$|Protein {{sequences}} contain {{great potential}} revealing protein function, structure families and evolution information. Classifying protein sequences into different functional groups or families {{based on their}} sequence patterns has attracted lots of research efforts in the last decade. A key issue of these classification systems is how to interpret and represent protein sequences, which largely determines the performance of classifiers. Inspired by text classification and Chinese word segmentation techniques, we propose a segmentation-based feature extraction method. The extracted features include selected words, i. e., substrings of the sequences, and also motifs specified in public database. They are segmented out and their occurrence frequencies are recorded as the feature vector values. We conducted experiments on two protein data sets. One is a set <b>of</b> <b>SCOP</b> families, {{and the other is}} GPCR family. Experiments in classification <b>of</b> <b>SCOP</b> protein families show that the proposed method not only results in an extremely condensed feature set but also achieves higher accuracy than the methods based on whole k-spectrum feature space. And it also performs comparably to the most powerful classifiers for GPCR level I and level II subfamily recognition with 92. 6 and 88. 8 % accuracy, respectively. 1...|$|R

40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} assumption, {{the rate of}} growth of {{structural}} data has slowed, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has not been growing exponentially since 1995. Reaching such a dramatic conclusion requires careful measurement of growth of novel structures, which can be achieved by clustering entry sequences, or by using a novel index to down-weight entries with a higher number of sequence neighbors. These measures agree, and growth rates are very similar for entire PDB files, clusters, and weighted chains. The overall sizes of Structural Classification <b>of</b> Proteins (<b>SCOP)</b> categories (number <b>of</b> families, superfamilies, and folds) appear to be directly proportional to the number of deposited PDB files. Using our weighted chain count, which is most correlated to the change in the size <b>of</b> each <b>SCOP</b> category in any time period, shows that the rate <b>of</b> increase <b>of</b> <b>SCOP</b> categories is actually slowing down. This enables the final size of each <b>of</b> these <b>SCOP</b> categories to be predicted without examining or comparing protein structures. In the last 3 years, structures solved by structural genomics (SG) initiatives, especially the United States National Institutes of Health Protein Structure Initiative, have begun to redress the slowing growth of the PDB. Structures solved by SG are 3. 8 times less sequence-redundant than typical PDB structures. Since mid- 2004, SG programs have contributed half the novel structures measured by weighted chain counts. Our analysis does not rely on visual inspection of coordinate sets: it is done automatically, providing an accurate, up-to-date measure of the growth of novel protein structural data...|$|R

Results: In the paper, we describe how kernels dened in terms of Vorolign scores can be used in SVM learning, and explore variants of combined instance-based and model-based learning, up to exclusi-vely model-based learning.
