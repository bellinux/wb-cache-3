40|$|This {{paper offers}} a general {{overview}} of the conceptualization of 'ordinary theology', first developed in 2002, together with an apologia for its study and for its relevance for theological and ecclesiastical debate. Ordinary theology is first defined, located and explicated, {{and the use of}} the adjective 'ordinary' defended, along with the significance of the ordinary for Christian theology and spirituality. The nature of ordinary theology is then briefly portrayed in terms of its linguistic style or form (rich in story and metaphor; aphoristic, autobiographical and unsystematic), its posture (midway between kneeling and sitting theology) and its voice (on Ursula Le Guin’s account, closer to the mother tongue than to the father tongue). The notion of ordinary theology is further related to Edward Farley’s delineation of the early understanding of theologia, as well as to the popular accounts of John Cobb, Stanley Grenz and Roger Olson. The paper then discusses the understanding of <b>ordinary</b> theology as <b>lay</b> theology, noting three possible meanings of that phrase (to designate a theological theme, the theology of a group within the Church, or theology that is non-expert). It goes on to argue for the significance of <b>ordinary</b> and <b>lay</b> theology both within the wider theology of the Church and in dialogue with academic theology. In this context, it makes particular reference to the relevance of ordinary theology to the concept of the consensus fidelium, in dialogue with some aspects of George Lindbeck’s work; and concludes with an argument for the importance of theological listening in ordinary theological research, and therefore in more general theological discussion in Church and academy. This includes an argument for a two stage process for a fuller study of ordinary theology, which comprises both theological listening and description, on the one hand; and a (separate) critical appraisal of the resulting data, in which the normative criteria of academic and ecclesiastical theology are employed, on the other. The importance of this latter process is acknowledged, but the author contends that it should never disable the empirical stage of listening to ordinary theology (which enables others to learn from it) by silencing or side-lining the voices of ordinary theologians. ...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePursuant to the {{adoption}} of the European Concil's 1995 Pan-European Strategy for Biological and Landscape Diversity, connectivity between natural spaces has become an increasingly important issue in European biodiversity conservation. In this frame France began, in 2007, creating an ecological network "Trame verte et bleue-TVB (Green and blue ways) designed as a tool for zoning planning agency. The construction of this network can be understood as a process of "ecologisation" in which the involvement of the diverse inhabitants and users of the territory raises question. More precisely, we show how different visions of the land that come from different ways of knowing - whether they are naturalistic or linked to other approaches to space - come into conflict in the process of identifying these networks. These knoweledge is necessarily incomplete, especialy when it concerns <b>ordinary</b> nature, and <b>lay</b> knoweledge can be particularly difficult to mobilize. We analyse the debates provoked by the connectivity modeling for a "Parc Regional Naturel" using cadastral data and naturalist data collected by local experts (naturalists, farmers, hunters, etc). This example of building an ecological infrastructure reveals the fondamental incompatibilities between data used by officials and lay knoweledge. It also highlighits the incompatibility of the different scales at which stakeolders perceive ecological connectivity and territory, in addition to questioning the reliability of the data used and the conditions of the data production, this study emphasizes the need to confront different types of knoweledge - qualitative or quantitative - at the intersection of ecological and socio-economic dynamics.

5000|$|In {{considering}} whether {{the decision of}} an industrial tribunal is perverse in a legal sense, there is one feature which does not occur in other jurisdictions {{where there is a}} right of appeal only on a point of law. The Industrial Tribunal is an industrial jury which brings to its task a knowledge of industrial relations both from the view point of the employer and the employee. Matters of good industrial relations practice are not proved before an industrial tribunal as they would be proved before an <b>ordinary</b> court: the <b>lay</b> members are taken to know them. The lay members of the Industrial Tribunal bring to their task their expertise in a field where conventions and practices are of the greatest importance. Therefore in {{considering whether}} the decision of an industrial tribunal is perverse, it is not safe to rely solely on the common sense and knowledge of those who have no experience in the field of industrial relations. A course of conduct which to those who have no practical experience with industrial relations might appear unfair or unreasonable, to those with specialist knowledge and experience might appear both fair and reasonable: and vice versa.For this reason, it seems to us that the correct approach is to consider whether an industrial tribunal, properly directed in law and properly appreciating what is currently regarded as fair industrial practice, could have reached the decision reached by the majority of this tribunal. We have reached the conclusion that it could not.......the question we have to decide is whether a reasonable tribunal could have reached the conclusion that the dismissal of the applicants in this case lay within the range of conduct which a reasonable employer could have adopted. It is accordingly necessary to try to set down in very general terms what a properly instructed industrial tribunal would know to be the principles which, in current industrial practice, a reasonable employer would be expected to adopt. This is not a matter on which the chairman of this appeal tribunal feels that he can contribute much, since it depends on what industrial practices are currently accepted as being normal and proper. The two lay members of this appeal tribunal hold the view that {{it would be impossible to}} lay down detailed procedures which all reasonable employers would follow in all circumstances: the fair conduct of dismissals for redundancy must depend on the circumstances of each case. But in their experience, there is a generally accepted view in industrial relations that, in cases where the employees are represented by an independent union recognised by the employer, reasonable employers will seek to act in accordance with the following principles::1. The employer will seek to give as much warning as possible of impending redundancies so as to enable the union and employees who may be affected to take early steps to inform themselves of the relevant facts, consider possible alternative solutions and, _f necessary, find alternative employment in the undertaking or elsewhere.:2. The employer will consult the union as to the best means by which the desired management result can be achieved fairly and with as little hardship to the employees as possible. In particular, the employer will seek to agree with the union the criteria to be applied in selecting the employees to be made redundant. When a selection has been made, the employer will consider with the union whether the selection has been made in accordance with those criteria.:3. Whether or not an agreement as to the criteria to be adopted has been agreed with the union, the employer will seek to establish criteria for selection which so far as possible do not depend solely upon the opinion of the person making the selection but can be objectively checked against such things as attendance record, efficiency at the job, experience, or length of service.:4. The employer will seek to ensure that the selection is made fairly in accordance with these criteria and will consider any representations the union may make as to such selection.:5. The employer will seek to see whether instead of dismissing an employee he could offer him alternative employment.The lay members stress that not all these factors are present in every case since circumstances may prevent one or more of them being given effect to. But the lay members would expect these principles to be departed from only where some good reason is shown to justify such departure. The basic approach is that, in the unfortunate circumstances that necessarily attend redundancies, as much as is reasonably possible should be done to mitigate the impact on the work force and to satisfy them that the selection has been made fairly and not on the basis of personal whim.|$|R

50|$|Stranded ropes are an {{assembly}} of several strands laid helically {{in one or}} more layers around a core. This core can be one of three types. The first is a fiber core, made up of synthetic material or natural fibers like Sysal. Synthetic fibers are stronger and more uniform but can't absorb much lubricant, natural fibers can absorb up to 15% of their weight in lubricant and so protect the inner wires much better from corrosion than synthetic fibers do. Fiber cores are the most flexible and elastic, but have the downside of getting crushed easily. The second type, wire strand core, is made up of one additional strand of wire, and is typically used for suspension. The third type is independent wire rope core (IWRC), which is the most durable in all types of environments. Most types of stranded ropes only have one strand layer over the core (fibre core or steel core). The lay direction of the strands in the rope can be right (symbol Z) or left (symbol S) and the lay direction of the wires can be right (symbol z) or left (symbol s). This kind of rope is called <b>ordinary</b> <b>lay</b> rope if the lay direction of the wires in the outer strands is in the opposite direction to the lay of the outer strands themselves. If both the wires in the outer strands and the outer strands themselves have the same lay direction, the rope is called a lang lay rope (formerly Albert’s lay or Lang’s lay). Regular lay means the individual wires were wrapped around the centers in one direction and the strands were wrapped around the core in the opposite direction.|$|E
