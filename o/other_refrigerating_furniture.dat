40|$|Abstract. There {{is a large}} {{potential}} in the heat loss from the urban wastewater. In all kinds of low-grade heat sources, urban wastewater is gradually widely used because of its advantages such as huge quantities, small variation of temperature, warm in winter and cool in summer, etc. By integrating a heat pump to utilize this heat, the wastewater source heat pump (WWSHP), which is a new water reuse and treatment strategy to tackle the water problems of China and to realize the sustainable development, recovers the heat of wastewater. The WWSHP air conditioning system as residential application can reduce the need of energy systems based on fossil fuel for cooling, heating, and hot water's supply purposes. The system's working principle, classification and the wastewater's characteristic parameters were discussed in this paper. And the scheme of using WWSHP system for central air-conditioning compared with <b>other</b> <b>refrigerating</b> and heating equipments was analyzed in detail. The investigation into COP (Coefficient of Performance) and PER (Primary Energy Ratio) was shown in this paper. Among the four kinds of common air conditioning units, when the loads are same respectively, the WWSHP has the most significant energy-saving effect. Furthermore, mechanism of heat transfer enhancement for falling-film evaporation and condensation surface of tubes packed with wire-mesh is also studied in detail. Theoretical simulation {{will be carried out}} for the heat transfer process and the flow of falling-film outside horizontal tubes. Improvement of controlling parameters influenced the evaporation and condensation performance, and then led to an increase in the refrigerating quantity and the COP. Consequently, this WWSHP system has its theoretical significance and promising engineering application potentials for the residential refrigerating and air-conditioning system using low-temperature waste heat source...|$|R

40|$|Aluminum-water {{reactions}} {{have been}} proposed and studied for several decades for underwater propulsion systems, and other applications such as hydrogen generation. Aluminum and water mixtures have also been proposed as propellants {{and there have been}} proposals for <b>other</b> <b>refrigerated</b> propellants that could be mixed, frozen in place and used as solid propellants. However, little work has been done to determine the feasibility of these concepts. With the recent availability of nano-scale aluminum (nAl), a simple binary formulation of nAl and water is now plausible. Nano-scale aluminum has a lower ignition temperature than micron-sized aluminum particles, partly due to its high surface area, and burning times are much faster than micron Al. Previous research has shown that frozen nAl and ice mixtures are stable, as well as insensitive to electrostatic discharge, impact and shock. However, the feasibility of a nAl-ice (ALICE) propellant in small-scale rocket experiments has not been fully explored. It is the intent of this work to further the possibility and show the feasibility of using a frozen solid propellant to power a sounding rocket. ^ The first part of this work outlines previous research related to the advancement of nAl and water propellants. In addition, previous research pertaining to the determination of propellant 2 ̆ 7 s mechanical properties is discussed. The experimental approach is reviewed for mixing large-scale ALICE propellant samples, testing center-perforated ALICE grains, and determining the mechanical properties of the propellant. The focus here is not to develop an optimized propellant, however improved formulations are possible and could be explored in future work. Additionally, a modeling code was written to both predict and complement the experimental data from the static test fires. ^ Results of the static motor experiments reveal that the large-scale testing of the ALICE propellant is feasible. However, different methods of mixing the propellant produce dissimilar burning rate coefficients. The mechanical properties of the ALICE propellant are also determined, but further work needs to be performed to verify the findings. Finally, a specially designed flight weight casing is used in the first sounding rocket test of an aluminum-ice propellant, establishing the stepping stone of a refrigerated aluminum-ice propellant. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility of cooling 3 He atoms in dilute solutions with liquid 4 He by “filtering out” the hot atoms through a screen of small holes or channels. The proposed method is somewhat analogous to that employed to evaporatively cool trapped gases, and the specific heat of the 3 He- 4 He mixture makes it feasible to use in a device to <b>refrigerate</b> <b>other</b> samples. Three methods are considered: 1) Effusion through holes having diameters larger than a mean free path allowing atoms to pass through easily; 2) Particle waveguide-like motion (also effusive) using very narrow channels that greatly restrict the quantum states of the atoms in them; and 3) Wall-limited diffusion through channels of various widths, in which the wall scattering is disordered so that local density equilibrium is established within a channel. The methods studied all require sufficiently low temperatures and holes or channels with sufficiently small dimensions that temperature equilibrium between the escaping gas and the original gas is avoided; that is, we assume that channel dimensions are smaller than the mean free path for atom-atom interactions. We find that the particle waveguide and the wall-limited diffusion methods using channels {{on the order of}} the de Broglie wavelength give cooling.

Proximate composition and sensory, chemical and microbiological changes of pangus fish burger were determined to evaluate the shelf life and storage stability kept at room (28 ºC) and refrigeration (5 ºC) temperature. It was observed that, the moisture, pH and protein contents in pangus burger were decreased than that of fish mince. On the other hand, lipid and ash contents were higher. Among the variable levels of mashed potato level, 25 % mashed potato level showed the best sensory performance and was recommended for the commercial production.

Since January 1 st, 2012 this legislation sets for pasteurized milk type A the Somatic Cell Count (SCC) limit of 4. 8 x 10 5 cel.   mL - 1 until June, 30 th, 2014, decreasing the limit in the following years til it reaches 3. 6 x 10 5 cel.   mL - 1 from July, first 2016. From now, the limit of SCC for refrigerated raw milk in the Southeast region is 6. 0 x 10 5 cel.   mL - 1, decreasing in the following years til it reaches 5. 0 x 10 5 cel.   mL - 1 from July, 1 st 2014. The control of the amount of SCC in the milk is important for monitoring the milk quality and sanity from a dairy herd. The objective {{of the present study was}} to verify if nine dairy farms in the state of São Paulo attend the NI 62 to the limit of SCC. Milk samples were collected directly from the milk glass recording jar in sterile flasks containing bromothymol as conservative. It was evaluated in each herd 15 cows randomly selected. From the results, averages were made from all farms. The determination of SCC was performed by flow cytometry in clinical milk ESALQ-USP, Piracicaba-SP. The herds had different results. One of the properties (A) produces pasteurized milk type A and the SCC is under the limit imposed by the NI 62. The <b>others</b> produce <b>refrigerated</b> raw milk. The properties B, C and I are in the limit established by NI 62. The properties D, E, F, G and H are out of the limits stablished by the NI 62 (6. 0 x 10 5 cel.   mL - 1). The most worrisome findings derive from the properties E and F, which are the result of mismanagement and poor conditions of milking. It is known that high SCC is related to the presence of subclinical mastitis, which represents significant losses in milk production, compromises animal welfare and offers potential risks to consumer health. The owners of properties E and F should be notified about these results and try to solve the problem of high SCC to reach the minimum values required by the NI 62.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a dynamic model to simulate a whole household refrigeration unit {{taking into account}} both the refrigeration cycle itself and the refrigerated compartments network. The methodology implemented to achieve the transient simulation of the whole system combines a steady-state approach for the refrigerating cycle loop with a transient approach for the refrigerated compartments loop. Both loops are solved at each time step (the linking boundary conditions for the refrigerating cycle and the compartments network are the air temperature of the evaporator chamber and the heat generated by the evaporator, respectively). The numerical infrastructure implemented to simulate the whole system and its elements is described in [1]. On one hand, the refrigerating cycle loop includes appropriate numerical models for the main components, namely, hermetic compressor, wire-and-tube condenser, non-adiabatic capillary tube [2], and finned-tube evaporator. In addition, the receiver located at the outlet position of the evaporator, is also considered and modeled according to [3]. On the <b>other,</b> the <b>refrigerated</b> compartments loop {{is made up of}} connected chambers and a damper to regulate the cold air flow going to the refrigerator and freezer. The transient solution of the system includes two important features: i) a numerical model for the refrigerating cycle when the compressor is turned off, and ii) a control system to regulate the compartments temperatures by means of the damper position and the compressor working condition. In {{the first part of this}} work the main details of the resolution procedure and the numerical model of both the whole system and all its components are given. In the second part a set of parametric studies to analyse the influence of specific aspects of the main elements on the refrigerating cycle is carried out, namely, arrangements of fins and tubes in the evaporator, non-adiabatic capillary tube geometrical configurations, and gap between wire-and-tube condenser and rear wall. The trends of the numerical results are compared against experimental data at similar conditions. In the last section, an illustrative numerical case including most of the model features is shown in order to see the model potential. REFERENCES [1] N. Ablanque, C. Oliet, J. Rigola, O. Lehmkuhl, C.

ChambersVegetables {{are popular}} among {{consumers}} {{because of their}} versatility of preparation, unique sensory characteristics, and exceptional health benefits. Trends such as organic farming and breeding to increase nutrition and functional health components have increased interest in understanding the flavor of vegetables, such as leafy greens. A lexicon of thirty-two flavor attributes was created to help describe the flavor of fresh leafy vegetables. This lexicon includes five “green” attributes; mouth feel characteristics such as pungent, bite, tooth-etch, and heat/burn; fundamental tastes including bitter and umami; seven terms that describe unique flavors related to specific vegetables such as cabbage, celery, lettuce, spinach, parsley, beet, and radish leaves; {{and a group of}} other terms including citrus, piney, woody, water-like, musty/earthy, floral, sulfur, metallic, soapy, petroleum-like, and overall sweet. In addition, our study encompassed a series of sensory tests which will aid in better understanding the effects of several production variables on the sensory characteristics of pac choi and tomato. Variables evaluated were production systems (i. e. organic and conventional), fertilizer amount (i. e. high, low, and no fertilizer), environment (i. e. field and high tunnel), maturity level (i. e. 2. 5, 4. 5, and 6. 5 -week old plants at the time of harvest), and shelf life (i. e. 1, 4, 9, 18 days of refrigerated storage).

40|$|Seven {{species of}} the genus Gymnosporangium occur in Iowa, but only G. juniperi-virginianae, causing {{cedar-apple}} rust, and G. globosum, causing hawthorn rust, are common. The latter is of little economic importance. The epidemic of cedar-apple rust in 1928 caused an estimated loss of 200, 000 in Iowa. Six to seven hours were required to produce abundant sporulation from air dry galls of G. juniperi-virginianae {{regardless of whether the}} period of soaking was 30 or 180 minutes. Newly-matured aecidiospores of G. juniperi-virginianae germinated to the extent of 54 percent in July. A lot was divided and the percentage of germination in the portion refrigerated at 5 to 13 °C. increased rapidly for at least 22 days, while that in the portion held at room temperature for the same interval dropped to zero. At Shenandoah the interval between infection and first opening of aecidia of cedar-apple rust on Bechtel 2 ̆ 7 s flowering crab was about 72 days. That for hawthorn rust on Crataegus mollis was about 81 days. Seedlings of red cedar were successfully inoculated using aecidiospores of G. juniperi-virginianae. Large differences in the number of galls on trees which had received similar treatments suggested a variation in disease resistance. The only appreciable germination of aecidiospores of G. globosum was obtained in November from diseased hawthorn leaves which had fallen to the ground and <b>others</b> which were <b>refrigerated</b> 41 days at 5 °C. Differences in the degree of maturity reached by the cedar rusts are utilized in defining the relative susceptibility of their aecidial hosts. The percentage of leaf area covered by lesions of cedar-apple rust is recorded for 138 varieties of apples and 28 varieties of crabapples which were growing in nursery rows at Shenandoah during the years, 1928 to 1930. Aecidiospores were matured on only 30 percent of these hosts. The percentage of infected apple leaves seemed to vary roughly as the percentage. of diseased leaf area, but leafiness was not related to the amount of rust infection. These lines of evidence suggest that the period of susceptibility in leaves of susceptible varieties may be longer than that of resistant ones. Artificial inoculations show that Tolman and York Imperial varieties of apple are very susceptible to the strain of G. juniperi-virginianae from Morgantown, W. Va., but are resistant to other strains from Ames and Shenandoah, Iowa; Manhattan, Kan., and Cochrane,,Vis. The results indicate the presence of physiologic specialization within the species. There is little evidence that the susceptibility of trees of one variety of apple may vary in different sections of the country.
