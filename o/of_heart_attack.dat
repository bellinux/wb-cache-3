5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at lower risk <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or stroke—for instance, those without {{a history of}} these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested {{as a component of}} a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, {{they are unable to}} synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of intracerebral hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E

5|$|Clock shifts {{were found}} to {{increase}} the risk <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> by 10 percent, and to disrupt sleep and reduce its efficiency. Effects on seasonal adaptation of the circadian rhythm can be severe and last for weeks. A 2008 study found that although male suicide rates rise {{in the weeks after}} the spring transition, the relationship weakened greatly after adjusting for season. A 2008 Swedish study found that heart attacks were significantly more common the first three weekdays after the spring transition, and significantly less common the first weekday after the autumn transition. A 2013 review found little evidence that people slept more on the night after the fall DST shift, even though it is often described as allowing people to sleep for an hour longer than normal. The same review stated that the lost hour of sleep resulting from the spring shift appears to result in sleep loss for at least a week afterward. In 2015, two psychologists recommended that DST be abolished, citing its disruptive effects on sleep as one reason for this recommendation.|$|E
5|$|Rovelizumab, trade-named LeukArrest {{and also}} known as Hu23F2G, was {{developed}} to treat patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock, which is caused by massive blood loss. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the recruitment of white blood cells {{to the site of}} inflammation. During testing, few patients were given the drug, because LeukArrest had to be administered within four hours of the injury and informed consent was required; patients were often unconscious, and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In June1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the FDA to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in August1998 for five medical centers. Development of LeukArrest was halted in April2000 when interim data from phaseIII clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals of significantly reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death rate from shock at 28days. LeukArrest was also tested unsuccessfully for treatment <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> multiple sclerosis, and stroke.|$|E

40|$|The role of plasma {{fibrinogen}} as {{a potential}} indicator <b>of</b> susceptibility to <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> was studied {{in a sample of}} 297 men aged 40 - 69 years at entry who were initially free from overt coronary heart disease. During a mean observation period of 7. 3 years (range 0. 1 - 16. 1) new <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> occurred in 40 men. There was a significant positive correlation between initial plasma fibrinogen levels and the subsequent incidence <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks.</b> In men with high cholesterol or high systolic blood pressure levels the incidence <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> was respectively six times and 12 times greater in those with high plasma fibrinogen levels than in those with low fibrinogen levels. In multivariate models plasma fibrinogen was a highly significant and independent explanatory variable, at least as important as serum cholesterol, blood pressure or cigarette smoking. These results suggest that high plasma fibrinogen levels are an important coronary risk factor and should be included in profiles used to identify those at high risk <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks...</b>|$|R
50|$|Nissen has led {{a number}} of {{inquiries}} as to the scientific integrity of many medications currently on the market. Starting with linked COX-2 inhibitors, such as Vioxx (rofecoxib) in 2001, Nissen {{was one of the}} first physicians to link it to an increased risk <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and strokes. Three years later Merck pulled Vioxx from the market when additional studies confirmed that daily, long-term use of the drug could increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> and strokes.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to its own studies, on September 23, 2004, Merck apparently received information about new research by the FDA that supported previous findings of increased risk <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> among rofecoxib users (Grassley, 2004). FDA analysts estimated that Vioxx caused between 88,000 and 139,000 heart attacks, 30 to 40 percent of which were probably fatal, {{in the five years}} the drug was on the market.|$|E

25|$|The current US Surgeon General’s Report {{concludes that}} there is no {{established}} risk-free level of exposure to second-hand smoke.
