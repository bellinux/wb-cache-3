25|$|But these differences, though {{demonstrating a}} Lagašite respect of {{religious}} figures simply {{in the amount}} <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> they required, is not as telling as the language Gudea uses to justify any punishment. Whereas Sargon or Naram-Sin simply demand punishment to any who change their words, based on their power, Gudea defends his words through tradition, “since the earliest days, since the seed sprouted forth, no one was (ever) supposed to alter the utterance of a ruler of Lagaš who, after building the Eninnu for my lord Ningirsu, made things function as they should”. Changing the words of Naram-Sin, the living god, is treason, {{because he is the}} king. But changing the words of Gudea, simple governor of Lagaš, is unjust, because he made things work right.|$|E

25|$|Reaching {{maturity}} and a fully-grown body became {{only a part}} of the development process; gradually a new anatomy and new abilities - only possible in the later stages of life - emerged. The anatomy insects were born and grew up with had limitations which the adults who had learned to fly didn't have. If they couldn't live their early life the way adults did, immature individuals had to adapt to the best way of living and surviving despite their limitations till the moment came when they could leave them behind. This would be a starting point in the evolution where imago and nymphs started to live in different niches, some more clearly defined than others. Also, a final anatomy, size and maturity reached at once with a single final nymphal stage meant less waste <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy,</b> and also made a more complex adult body structure. These strategies obviously became very successful with time.|$|E
25|$|Insects have a {{wide variety}} of predators, {{including}} birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, carnivorous plants, and other arthropods. The great majority (80–99.99%) of individuals born do not survive to reproductive age, with perhaps 50% of this mortality rate attributed to predation. In order to deal with this ongoing escapist battle, insects have evolved a wide range of defense mechanisms. The only restraint on these adaptations is that their cost, in terms <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy,</b> does not exceed the benefit that they provide to the organism in question. The further that a feature tips the balance towards beneficial, the more likely that selection will act upon the trait, passing it down to further generations. The opposite also holds true; defenses that are too costly will have a slim to zero chance of being passed down. Examples of defenses that have withstood the test of time include hiding, escape by flight or running, and firmly holding ground to fight as well as producing chemicals and social structures that help prevent predation.|$|E
500|$|The Peace of Amiens {{came into}} effect on 1 October 1801, {{bringing}} the French Revolutionary Wars to an end. Confirmation of this armistice {{did not reach}} India until 1 February 1802, {{but it had been}} widely expected and neither side had undertaken significant naval operations during the interim. The terms of the treaty returned all territory captured by British forces in the East Indies to its original masters with the noted exception of Ceylon, which was officially named a British Crown Colony. No one in the Indian Ocean believed that the Peace would last, each side building substantial forces in the region. As historian William James noted, [...] "who then could doubt that, although the wax on the seals of the treaty concluding the last had scarcely cooled, a new war was on the eve of bursting forth?". [...] The peace was short lived, the Napoleonic Wars erupting in May 1803, by which time Emperor Napoleon had sent substantial reinforcements to Île de France and the other French territories in the East Indies. Although the campaign had personally benefited Rainier by around £300,000 (the equivalent of £ as of 2015), historian C. Northcote Parkinson wrote that [...] "It cannot be said that the naval war in the Indian Ocean from 1794 to 1801 had been a brilliant success" [...] for either side. The lack of French reinforcements [...] and Sercey's ineffectiveness counterbalanced by confused British leadership and scattered priorities, with aborted operations against Manila and Batavia and a marginal campaign in the Red Sea consuming inordinate amounts <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E

2500|$|When Schneersohn came to America (he was {{the first}} major Chasidic leader to move {{permanently}} to the United States) two of his chassidim came to him, and said not to start up all the activities in which Lubavitch had engaged in Europe, because [...] "America is different." [...] To avoid disappointment, they advised him not even to try. Schneersohn wrote, [...] "Out of my eyes came boiling tears", and undeterred, the next day he started the first Lubavitcher Yeshiva in America, declaring that [...] "America is no different." [...] From 1940-1945, the Rebbe created a lot of turmoil within the US Jewish community since he refused to work with Rabbi Kalmanowitz and Rabbi Kotler of the VAAD in trying to help rescue more Jews out of Hitler's Europe. Instead, he focused heavily on trying to bring about the coming of the Messia. Also, instead of putting a most of his efforts into rescuing other Jews, he placed inordinate amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>energy</b> in saving his books. Historian and head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Israel and Orthodox Jew Efraim Zuroff asks, [...] "How can one justify expending even a small amount of resources and energies to try and save the rebbe's library {{at a time when the}} rescue of lives should have taken precedence?" [...] One wonders why no one talked about using the funds and political contacts necessary for retrieving the books to save more Jews, but the Lubavitchers never discussed this matter. As Zuroff writes, Lubavitchers [...] "do not consider such a set of priorities controversial or in any way problematic", for the preservation of knowledge and torah learning is one of their highest priorities. In 1949, Schneersohn became a U.S. citizen, with his son-in-law Menachem Mendel assisting to coordinate the event. A special dispensation was arranged wherein the federal judge came to [...] "770" [...] to officiate at Rabbi Yoseph Yitzchak's citizenship proceedings, rather than the Rebbe travel to a courthouse for the proceedings. Uniquely, the event was recorded on color motion film. In 1950, Schneersohn died in his home in Brooklyn and many members, even the next Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, declared him the Messiah. This caused a lot of problems for the Chabad community just like it would when Menachem Mendel Schneerson died in 1994, and many in the community declared him the Messiah. In 1951, Menachem Mendel Schneerson took over the leadership of Chabad and became the next Rebbe of Chabad. When this happened, many stopped declaring Rebbe Schneersohn the Messiah and focused on building out the community under the new Rebbe Schneerson (note: the confusion on names results from the fact that Rebbe Schneerson was the second cousin and son-in-law of Rebbe Schneersohn).|$|E
