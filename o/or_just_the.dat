5|$|However, it {{is unclear}} whether Lucas {{intended}} Palpatine to be the reigning Emperor <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> first of a succession of Emperors. Michael Kaminski, author of The Secret History of Star Wars, claims that Lucas' initial notes discuss a line of corrupt Emperors, not just one. If Palpatine was the first, Kaminski infers, he would therefore not be the current. Later Lucas would abandon this idea, opting instead to focus on a sole villainous ruler.|$|E

5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E
5|$|In the hippocampus, ApoER2 is {{complexed}} with NMDA receptors {{through the}} PSD-95 adapter protein. When reelin binds ApoER2, it initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of NMDA receptors. This occurs through Dab-1 activation of Src family kinases, which {{have been shown to}} play a role in regulating synaptic plasticity. VLDLR also acts as a receptor coupled to ApoER2 as it does during development, but its role is not well understood. ApoER2 plays a more important role in this process, most likely due to its ability to bind the PSD-95 adapter protein through the 59 amino acid insert on its cytoplasmic tail. Studies with mice have shown that knocking out ApoER2 <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> alternatively spliced exon 19 causes a much greater impairment of LTP than knocking out VLDLR.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{known as}} the Convict Establishment (<b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>The</b> Establishment), Fremantle Prison was {{constructed}} between 1851 and 1859, using convict labour. It was initially used for convicts transported from Britain, but {{was transferred to the}} colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. Royal Commissions were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison.|$|E

25|$|The Pinch District <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>The</b> Pinch {{is an area}} of Uptown, Memphis {{that played}} an {{important}} role in local immigration patterns beginning in the early 19th century. Memphis' first business district, the Pinch encompassed all of Memphis north of Adams Street, from the River to Third Street. The name was originally a term of derision, referring to emaciated Irish immigrants who fled the Irish Potato Famine. Later, Italian, Russian, Greek and, especially, Jewish immigrants also called it home before migrating to more affluent sections of the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{slope of}} the tangent line to the {{squaring}} function at the point (3, 9) is 6, that is to say, it is going up six {{times as fast as}} it is going to the right.

This defines the derivative function of the squaring function, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> derivative of the squaring function for short.

25|$|Brighton railway works (also {{known as}} Brighton {{locomotive}} works, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> Brighton works) {{was one of}} the earliest railway-owned locomotive repair works, founded in 1840 by the London and Brighton Railway in Brighton, England, and thus pre-dating the more famous railway works at Crewe, Doncaster and Swindon. The works grew steadily between 1841 and 1900 but efficient operation was always hampered by the restricted site, and there were several plans to close it and move the facility elsewhere. Nevertheless, between 1852 and 1957 more than 1200 steam locomotives as well as prototype diesel electric and electric locomotives were constructed there, before the eventual closure of the facility in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Construction of the Sagene Line {{commenced}} {{in early}} 1899. Although originally stipulated {{to open in}} August, this was delayed until 24 November, when revenue operation started. Initially there was not more power available than allowed a ten-minute headway with the Class S trams. Once additional power supply had been secured, the headway was cut to five minutes. To begin with services altered between running the full length to Sagene <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> southern part of St. Hanshaugen. In the city center they terminated at Athenæum. From 1900 an agreement was reached with KES, allowing the Sagene services to continue along its tracks to Jernbanetorget. The services from St. Hanshaugen were run onwards along the Vippetangen Line.|$|E

The S 500 index components and their weightings are determined by S Dow Jones Indices. It differs from other U.S. stock market indices, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the Nasdaq Composite index, because of its diverse constituency and weighting methodology. It {{is one of the}} most commonly followed equity indices, and many consider it one of the best representations of the U.S. stock market, and a bellwether for the U.S. economy.

25|$|The various {{different}} {{possibilities for}} a united Germany were: a Greater Germany, or a Greater Austria <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> German Confederation without Austria at all. As Austria was {{not willing to}} relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the German Empire of 1848, the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm IV. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against Denmark and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. As they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, though, they fought the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. Defeated by Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz, Austria had to leave the German Confederation and subsequently no longer took part in German politics.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people use}} the terms Internet and World Wide Web, <b>or</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> Web, interchangeably, but the two terms are not synonymous.

The Web is a global set of documents, images and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, servers, and other databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. Web services also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.|$|E
