The livers were excised and perfused with aerated Locke's solution through the hepatic portal vein, using 13 different flow rates. Portal pressures at these flow rates were recorded continuously. Resistances were calculated as the ratio of pressure to flow rate, for each of three groups of livers: those from uninjected control rats, those from rats injected with olive oil, and those from rats injected with olive oil and C Cl 4. Findings. Resistance was found to be significantly higher in livers of rats injected with olive oil or with olive oil plus C Cl 4, than in livers of uninjected control rats. The difference was especially noticeable at the lower flow rates. Conclusions. It is clear that increased vascular resistance is not merely a late side-effect of cirrhosis. Recommendations.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} water {{footprint}} of Spanish olives and <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> the period 1997 - 2008. In particular, it analyses the three colour {{components of the}} water footprint: green (rainwater stored in the soil), blue (surface and groundwater) and grey (freshwater required to assimilate load of pollutants). Apparent water productivity and virtual water embedded in olive oil exports have also been studied. Results show more than 99. 5 % of the water footprint of one liter of bottled olive oil {{is related to the}} olive production, whereas less than 0. 5 % is due to the other components such as bottle, cap and label. Over the studied period, the green water footprint in absolute terms of Spanish olive oil production represents about 72 % in rainfed systems and just 12 % in irrigated olive orchards. Blue and grey water footprints represent 6 % and 10 % of the national water footprint, respectively. It is shown that olive production is concentrated in regions with the smallest water footprint per unit of product. However, the increase of groundwater consumption in the main olive producing region (Andalusia), from 98 to 378 Mm 3 between 1997 and 2008, has added significant pressure in the upstream Guadalquivir basin. This raises questions about the sustainability of irrigated olive orchards for export from the region. Finally, the virtual water related to olive oil exports illustrate the importance of green water footprint of rainfed olives amounting to about 77 % of the total virtual water exports...|$|E

40|$|The {{maintenance}} {{of the quality of}} oil is a very complex operation, due to the storage conditions of the oil after the extraction step. The storage of oil must ensure the conditions necessary to avoid the increase of acidity, and consequently the onset of rancidity, or problems related to the anaerobic fermentation of suspended matter in the oil or deposited on the bottom of storage vessels. This work describes the development of a prototype integrated storage system. The storage system consists of a nitrogen gas generator, three stainless steel tanks, and a feedback controller of nitrogen concentration and tank temperature. In the experimentation, three tanks were used in order to test the functionality of the system. The experimental design is based on the creation of different modified atmospheres on the head space of steel tanks, using the nitrogen gas generator and feedback controller of head space composition of each tank. The results show that the prototype performs well in terms of its ability to detect and adjust the atmosphere of tank headspace. The oxygen percentage in the headspace of the three tanks remained between 0. 7 and 0. 9 %. Chemical analyses of acidity, total phenol content and peroxides index show that the controlled headspace maintained acidity levels within the range 0. 32 - 0. 36 % during the experiment, total phenol content in the range 152 - 146 ppm (gallic acid equivalent) and peroxides index values in the range 7. 9 - 8. 2 meq O 2 /kg of oil. The proposed prototype performs a function of effective control and regulation of the concentration of the headspace of tanks and can help to maintain the chemical characteristics of extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> time.

Materials and methods: A total of 120  healthy female Sprague Dawley rats aged 6  months were divided into four groups: 1) sham-operated control (Sham group, n= 30); 2) ovariectomized (OVX group, n= 30); 3) ovariectomized rats supplemented with EVOO (OVX + Olive, n= 30); 4) ovariectomized rats supplemented with estrogen (OVX + E 2, n= 30). EVOO and estrogen were administered by oral gavage at a dose of 1  mL/ 100  g weight on a daily basis for 12  consecutive weeks. Twelve weeks later blood samples were obtained to detect the levels of calcium, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), malonyldialdehyde (MDA), and nitrate content. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometer measured bone mineral density (BMD) of ovariectomized Sprague Dawley rats that had been fed olive oil for 3  months. Blood samples from patients, who regularly consumed <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> a 1  year period were also used to measure carbohydrate antigen 125, carcino-embryonic antigen, α-fetoprotein, and carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9  levels. BMD of lumbar spine and left femur was also evaluated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: Animal experiments showed that EVOO significantly increased BMD and decreased phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, IL- 6, MDA, and nitrate levels. However, it had no significant effect on the Ca 2 + level. In clinical follow-up, EVOO also improved patient BMD levels on L 3, L 4, and left femoral neck, and reduced carbohydrate antigen 125, α-fetoprotein, and carcino-embryonic antigen levels. But it had no significant effect on the carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9  level.

40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{group of}} chronic, painful, {{disabling}} conditions affecting synovial joints where the pathology includes damage and loss of articular cartilage, irregular remodelling and erosion of sub-articular bone, synovial distension and inflammation(1). Whilst current management strategies include exercise, weight loss and pharmacological therapies, there is evidence to suggest that particular food sources consistent with a Mediterranean type diet (e. g. rich in omega- 3 fatty acid) may slow the pathogenesis of degenerative joint diseases(2) and moderate markers of inflammation(3). Consequently, following a diet which is plant based, favours <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>over</b> animal fats, and is high in fibre, vegetables, and fruits, combined with a low intake of foods which are associated with increased inflammation (e. g. meat, dairy, fat and sugar) may reduce joint degradation and inflammation associated with OA.

For oil samples with {{free fatty acid}} (FFA) contents larger than 2 %, FFA esterification and glyceroly-sis took place simultaneously, but the esterification reaction was faster than glycerolysis. Similar product distributions were ob-tained for glycerol/oil mole ratios of 3 : 1 and 6 : 1. Therefore, an excess of glycerol does not result in {{a significant increase in}} monoglyceride yield within the experimental range tested. The main reaction product at 80 °C was diglyceride.

To test the hypothesis that these phenolics can modulate the serum and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triacylglycerol concentrations in humans, a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial was designed. Thirty-three participants received 25 mL/d of refined <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (devoid of phenolic content [PC]), common <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (PC = 370 mmol/kg), and virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (PC = 825 mmol/kg) in a Latin square design.

The interventions did not modify the concentrations of serum and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triacylglycerol; but they exerted changes in the cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and phospholipid content of VLDL. The virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> consumption led to increased oleic and palmitic acids, as well as decreased linoleic acid, in VLDL. The main outcome was the significant dose-dependent linear trend between the PC in the <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> and the palmitic (16 : 0) and linoleic (18 : 2 n- 6) acid and their corresponding triacylglycerol molecular species in VLDL. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Wastewaters from <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> mills are difficult to clean because effluents contain high levels of phenolic compounds that cannot be removed by biological treatment or incineration. Therefore, we tested the catalytic wet air oxidation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid, as model molecule of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> mills wastewaters, <b>over</b> Ru-supported CeO 2 –TiO 2 mixed oxides. We focussed on the Ce/Ti molar ratio because this ratio modifies {{the properties of the}} Ru catalysts. Supports were prepared by using the sol–gel method. The Ru catalysts were prepared by impregnation. Those products were characterized by N 2 adsorption–desorption, X-ray diffraction, H 2 chemisorption, transmission electron microscopy and inductively coupled plasma. Catalytic wet air oxidation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid was performed in a batch reactor at 140  °C and 50  bar of air. Our results show that the most efficient catalyst was Ru with a Ce/Ti ratio of 1 / 5, which converted totally p-hydroxybenzoic after 7  h of reaction without Ru leaching. We explain this finding by an enhanced dispersion of Ru due to better structural properties of the CeO 2 –TiO 2 support. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

40|$|The hydrolytic and {{oxidative}} {{degradation of}} <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> used as covering liquids in canned dried tomatoes, was studied during storage {{by means of}} conventional (acidity, peroxide value, p-anisidine value) and non conventional (polar compounds) analyses. The effects of the addition of spices were also considered. The hydrolysis and oxidation of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> increased faster and was {{higher than that of}} extravirgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> in terms of absolute values but some other indices, such as percentage of oligopolymers and percentage of oxidized triglycerides, increased faster in extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> than in <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> The antioxidant effect given by a higher concentration of polyphenols in the extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> was shown by a reduced amount of secondary oxidation. However, <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and extra-virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> showed similar behaviour in terms of peroxide formation...|$|R
