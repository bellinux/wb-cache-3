2500|$|In 2003, {{under the}} title A Dead Shark Isn't Art, the Stuckism International Gallery {{exhibited}} a shark which had first been put on public display two years before Hirst's by Eddie Saunders in his Shoreditch shop, JD Electrical Supplies. Thomson asked, [...] "If Hirst’s shark is recognised as great art, then how come Eddie’s, which was on exhibition for two years beforehand, isn’t? Do we perhaps have here an undiscovered artist of genius, who got there first, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> a dead shark isn’t art at all?" [...] The Stuckists suggested that Hirst may have {{got the idea for}} his work from Saunders' shop display.|$|E
2500|$|Pollard has {{attempted}} to examine the negative views of Crabbe {{and the reasons for}} limited readership since his lifetime: [...] "Why did Crabbe's 'realism' and his discovery of what in effect was the short story in verse fail to appeal to the fiction-dominated Victorian age? <b>Or</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> somehow psychological analysis and poetry are uneasy bedfellows? But then why did Browning succeed and Crabbe descend to the doldrums or to the coteries of admiring enthusiasts? And why have we in this century (the 20th century) failed to get much nearer to him? Does this mean that each succeeding generation must struggle to find his characteristic and essential worth? FitzGerald was only one of many among those who would make 'cullings from' or 'readings in' Crabbe. The implications of such selection are clearly that, though much has vanished, much deserves to remain." ...|$|E
