5|$|The Duesenberg Model A was {{the first}} {{automobile}} in series production to have hydraulic brakes and the first automobile in series production in the United States with a straight-eight engine. Officially known as the Duesenberg Straight Eight, the Model A was first shown in late 1920 in New York City. Production was delayed by substantial changes {{to the design of}} the car, including a change in the engine valvetrain from horizontal <b>overhead</b> <b>valves</b> to an overhead camshaft; also during this time, the company had moved its headquarters and factory from New Jersey to Indiana. The Model A was manufactured in Indianapolis, Indiana, from 1921 to 1925 by the Duesenberg Automobiles and Motors Company and from 1925 to 1926 at the same factory by the restructured Duesenberg Motor Company. The successors to the company began referring to the car as the Model A when the Model J was introduced.|$|E

25|$|The Halberstadt D.III {{primarily}} {{differed from}} the D.II version in its substitution of the Argus As.II 90kW (120hp) straight-six engine, which {{differed from the}} usual Mercedes D.II powerplant in having its camshaft in the engine block and using pushrods to operate the <b>overhead</b> <b>valves,</b> rather than having a camshaft running atop all of the cylinders as in a single overhead cam engine. A total of 50 D.III examples were built by Halberstadt, with the first 30 ordered in July 1916 and the last 20 ordered in August 1916.|$|E

50|$|An <b>overhead</b> <b>valve</b> engine (OHV engine) is {{an engine}} {{in which the}} valves are placed in the {{cylinder}} head.

Cadillac pioneered the dual-plane V8 crankshaft in 1918. In 1928 Cadillac introduced the first clashless Synchro-Mesh manual transmission, utilizing constant mesh gears. In 1930 Cadillac implemented the first V-16 engine, with a 45-degree overhead valve, , and , {{one of the}} most powerful and quietest engines in the United States. The development and introduction of the V8, V16 and V-12 helped to make Cadillac the [...] "Standard of the World".

2500|$|The engine, {{slightly}} larger than the One-O-Four's, was an inline six of 3.8 litres (3794cc), based on previous Daimler sixes with pushrod operated <b>overhead</b> <b>valves</b> and retaining the [...] stroke, but with the bore increased to [...] from the [...] of the One-O-Four, giving a power output of over [...] at 4,400 rpm and produced [...] of torque at 2,800 rpm. The Majestic had a maximum speed of around [...] (see Performance below). To help {{with the increase in}} the bore, the cylinder block was considerably enlarged to allow for the fitting of completely new liners: dry liners as present on the One-O-Four were absent on the Majestic. The Borg-Warner transmission required repositioning of the starter motor and consequent modifications to the crankcase and cylinder block castings. The crankshaft has four main bearings, integral balance weights and a torsional vibration damper mounted at the front.|$|E

2500|$|From 1895 Clément cycles {{started to}} focus on {{motorized}} vehicles. In 1895 it introduced its first internal combustion vehicle, a naphtha powered tricycle. In 1902 they offered a motorized bicycle with a 142 cc engine bolted to the frame, using <b>overhead</b> <b>valves</b> and a detachable cylinder head; the inlet valve 'automatic' (controlled by engine suction), the exhaust valve mechanically operated. A coil-and-battery ignition was used, and a two-barrel carburetor controlled by small levers attached to the frame top tube. [...] An external flywheel kept the crankcase very small, and a long belt from the engine pulley to a 'dummy' rim on the rear wheel was tensioned by a small 'jockey' pulley on the seat tube. [...] The front brake pressed direct on the front tire, the rear was a 'coaster' brake activated by back-pedaling. [...] This 'motorisation adaptation' was sold on both Clément and Gladiator cycles.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the Primula {{was fitted}} with the 1221cc engine from the Fiat 1100 D (for the coupé it was uprated to [...] ), but in 1968 it was {{replaced}} with Fiat 124 engines—the berlinas received the 1197cc [...] engine from the standard versions, while the coupé was fitted with the more powerful 1438cc [...] unit. All engines used in the Primula had <b>overhead</b> <b>valves</b> (OHV)—the later twin cam derivative of the 1438cc unit was not used in any Autobianchi (Fiat did use it later in the Lancia Beta- the issue {{at the time in}} a transverse installation of a twin-cam head being the arrangement of the exhaust manifold of the necessarily cross-flow head). Unlike [...] contemporaneous BMC and Peugeot models, which had the transmission in the oil sump, the Primula had its manual transmission placed end-on, above the differential. The Primula also featured disc brakes on all four wheels, uncommon in small cars of the time.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{construction}} of the first prototype of the 501, Böning had calculated the mass of the car as designed, and realized that the six-cylinder engine would be barely adequate to power the car. [...] He proposed the development of a larger engine to power future versions of the car to the management, who accepted his proposal. [...] Böning began the design and development of a V8 engine similar in general design to the then-new Oldsmobile Rocket V8, with a single camshaft in the vee operating <b>overhead</b> <b>valves</b> in wedge-shaped combustion chambers through pushrods. The BMW OHV V8 engine differed from its Detroit contemporaries in the use of an aluminium alloy block with cast-iron cylinder liners, and in its smaller size, initially with a [...] bore and a [...] stroke, giving a displacement of [...] [...] The development of the V8 was completed by Fritz Fiedler, who replaced Böning as BMW's chief engineer in 1952.|$|E

A 425cc engine was introduced in 1955, followed in 1968 by a 602cc one giving [...] at 7000rpm. With the 602cc engine, the tax classification of the car changed so that it became a 3CV, but the name remained unchanged. A 435cc engine was introduced {{at the same time to}} replace the 425cc; the 435cc engine car was named 2CV 4 while the 602cc took the name 2CV 6 (a variant in Argentina took the name 3CV). The 602cc engine evolved to the M28 [...] in 1970; this was the most powerful engine fitted to the 2CV. A new 602cc giving [...] at a slower 5,750rpm was introduced in 1979. This engine was less powerful, [...] and more efficient, allowing lower fuel consumption and better top speed, at the price of decreased acceleration. All 2CVs with the M28 engine can run on unleaded petrol.|$|E
