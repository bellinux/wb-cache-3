5|$|Barnard Castle School (colloquially Barney School or locally the County School) is a co-educational {{independent}} day and {{boarding school}} in the market town of Barnard Castle, County Durham, in the North East of England. It {{is a member of}} The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC). It was founded in 1883 with funding from a 13th-century endowment of John I de Balliol and the bequest of the local industrialist Benjamin Flounders. The ambition was to create a school {{of the quality of the}} ancient public schools at a more reasonable cost, whilst accepting pupils regardless <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b>|$|E
5|$|The unique {{position}} of the Christians and Jews of the empire became increasingly apparent. The Jews had earned imperial toleration {{on account of the}} great antiquity <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b> They had been exempted from Decius's persecution and continued to enjoy freedom from persecution under Tetrarchic government. Because their faith was new and unfamiliar and not typically identified with Judaism by this time, Christians had no such excuse. Moreover, Christians had been distancing themselves from their Jewish heritage for their entire history.|$|E
5|$|In March 624, Muhammad {{led some}} three hundred warriors in {{a raid on}} a Meccan {{merchant}} caravan. The Muslims set an ambush for the caravan at Badr. Aware of the plan, the Meccan caravan eluded the Muslims. A Meccan force was sent to protect the caravan {{and went on to}} confront the Muslims upon receiving word that the caravan was safe. The Battle of Badr commenced. Though outnumbered more than three to one, the Muslims won the battle, killing at least forty-five Meccans with fourteen Muslims dead. They also succeeded in killing many Meccan leaders, including Abu Jahl. Seventy prisoners had been acquired, many of whom were ransomed. Muhammad and his followers saw the victory as confirmation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> and Muhammad ascribed the victory as assisted from an invisible host of angels. The Quranic verses of this period, unlike the Meccan verses, dealt with practical problems of government and issues like the distribution of spoils.|$|E

5|$|Other {{victims were}} college students, {{many of whom}} were {{expelled}} from their institutions and had their careers destroyed, academic teachers who tried to defend the students and the academic institutions themselves: Warsaw University had several departments administratively dissolved. Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred. The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which, early in his term, gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power.|$|E
5|$|The polyptych was {{commissioned}} to provide both comfort and {{warning to the}} dying. It was intended to remind them <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faith,</b> and direct their last thoughts towards the divine. This is evident in its positioning in the chapel, within view of the patients' beds. Rolin specified that 30 beds be placed {{within sight of the}} altarpiece for those too ill to walk, where it was visible to them through a pierced screen. There were usually only two patients per bed, luxurious at a time when six to fifteen in a large bed was more common. Medical care was expensive and primitive in the 15th century; the spiritual care of patients was as important as the treatment of physical ailments.|$|E
25|$|The College’s broader identity, now as in 1947, is to {{encourage}} active participation in the thoughtful life of the Church.

50|$|The {{relationship}} between Pagan studies scholars and the contemporary Pagan community which it studies has at times been strained, with some practitioners rejecting academic interpretations <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faiths.</b> At the same time, many academics involved in Pagan studies are practicing Pagans themselves, bringing an insider's perspective to their approaches.|$|R

25|$|In Nazi Germany in the 1930s {{and early}} 1940s, Jehovah's Witnesses refused to renounce their {{political}} neutrality {{and they were}} placed in concentration camps as a result.

25|$|The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Oriental Orthodoxy {{also have}} distinctive, living icon {{painting}} traditions.

25|$|Early Protestant {{movements}} {{were characterized by}} theological eclecticism. For instance, the first Lutheran synod of Hungarian pastors, held in Erdőd (Ardud, Romania) in 1545, adopted twelve articles based on the Augsburg Confession, but otherwise the participants disagreed on the precise formulation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b> Contacts between the second generation of reformers in Hungary and their German and Swiss counterparts also increased theological differences.|$|E
25|$|During this time, Christians could {{retain their}} churches and {{property}} {{on condition of}} paying a tribute (jizya) for every parish, cathedral, and monastery; frequently such tribute was increased at {{the will of the}} conqueror. Christians also had to abstain from any public displays <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faith</b> in the presence of Muslims, as such an act was considered blasphemy under Islamic law and punishable by death.|$|E

5000|$|Nowadays, estimations of {{the size}} of the irreligious {{population}} vary widely. The self declared atheist population has been given figures ranging from 2.5% to 8% to 9% while other estimates of irreligiosity have reported figures of 39% declaring as [...] "atheists"(9%) or [...] "nonreligious"(30%), 61% not saying religion was [...] "important" [...] to their lives, and 72% [...] "non-practicing".

25|$|Therefore, {{in order}} to attain these goals, Syed {{launched}} the Aligarh Movement, of which Aligarh was the center.

25|$|Most Christian traditions teach {{belief in}} {{life after death}} as a central and {{indispensable}} tenet <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b> Critics argue that the Christian conception of the afterlife is inconsistent with that described in the Old Testament.

25|$|The Trinitarian {{doctrine}} {{is considered by}} most Christians to be a core tenet <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faith.</b> Nontrinitarians typically hold that God, the Father, is supreme; that Jesus, although still divine Lord and Savior, is the Son of God; and that the Holy Spirit is a phenomenon akin to God's will on Earth. The holy three are separate, yet the Son and the Holy Spirit are still seen as originating from God the Father.|$|E
