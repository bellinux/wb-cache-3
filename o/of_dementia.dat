5|$|Neuropsychological tests {{such as the}} mini–mental state {{examination}} (MMSE) are widely {{used to evaluate the}} cognitive impairments needed for diagnosis.

5|$|People {{who engage}} in {{intellectual}} activities such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments, or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease.

40|$|BACKGROUND: At present 34 {{million people}} live with Alzheimer's disease around the world. This figure is {{expected}} to triple in the next 40 years. The major cause of this increase is the well-known aging of the society in Europe and in the US as well. AIMS AND METHODS: In this paper we review {{the results of the}} last 10 years, and discuss those pharmaceutical and other methods, which can be effective in the prevention <b>of</b> <b>dementias.</b> RESULTS: The most important pharmaceutical agents are beta secretase inhibitors, and active and passive immunizations. Several drugs in these groups are in phase III at the moment. The results from studies with intranasal insulin are also encouraging. As a non-drug option Mediterranean diet can be effective. However at present cognitive trainings seem to be the most effective in the prevention <b>of</b> <b>dementias.</b> These remediation therapies are based on the lifelong plasticity of the human brain. CONCLUSIONS: In summary we can conclude that there are promising drug developments in progess for the prevention <b>of</b> <b>dementias,</b> but the breakthrough has not been achieved yet. At present the best option is decreasing risk factors, that is treatment of hypertension, prevention of obesity and diabetes, and cognitive trainings are recommended for prevention...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the consumption of}} psychotropic medications by caregivers of elderly patients with or without dementia. This was a cross-sectional study conducted at all geriatric units in Brasília, Brazil, during a two-month period.

Among the caregivers, 196 (63 %) were caregivers <b>of</b> patients with <b>dementia</b> and 115 (37 %) were caregivers <b>of</b> patients without <b>dementia.</b> Forty-four caregivers (14. 1 %) were taking psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines or antidepressants), and this usage was more frequent among caregivers <b>of</b> patients with <b>dementia</b> (p< 0. 01). Twenty-two caregivers <b>of</b> patients with <b>dementia</b> (11. 4 %) had used sleeping pills after beginning care, compared with only five (4. 3 %) caregivers <b>of</b> patients without <b>dementia</b> (p< 0. 01).

5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases <b>of</b> <b>dementia.</b> The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} an incurable {{neurodegenerative}} disease which most often affects {{the elderly and}} {{accounts for more than}} half of all cases <b>of</b> <b>dementia.</b> Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk <b>of</b> <b>dementia</b> compared to the general population.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms <b>of</b> <b>dementia.</b> The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to {{the diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and neuropathology.|$|E
