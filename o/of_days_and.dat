5|$|Almost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 {{continued}} {{the study of}} the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck for a couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{northern}} latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 2 minutes of daylight. The difference in the length <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> nights between the summer and winter solstices is 10 hours and 30 minutes.|$|E

5|$|Because of Copenhagen's {{northern}} latitude, {{the number}} of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On the winter solstice, it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 1 minute of daylight.

5|$|By 24 November, Potiorek was {{predicting}} that Serbia would be defeated {{within a matter}} <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> appointed Stjepan Sarkotić to be the country's governor once it was occupied. The Austro-Hungarians made further gains on 25 November, forcing the Serbian Army from Čovka and Vrače Brdo with an intense artillery bombardment. On 26 November, they attempted to cross the Kolubara at its junction with the Sava River and managed {{to do so in}} their initial attack. The Serbs soon counterattacked and forced the invaders back, inflicting 50 percent casualties on the Austro-Hungarians and causing their offensive to grind to a halt. On 27 November, the Serbian Army attacked Čovka and Vrače Brdo and succeeded in forcing the Austro-Hungarians out.|$|E

5|$|On May21, 2006, a {{tropical}} wave crossed Central America {{and entered the}} East Pacific. The wave drifted westward, and after several days began to interact with a low-level trough near the Gulf of Tehuantepec, {{and as a result}} deep convection increased. By May25, a large area of low pressure formed several hundred miles south of Acapulco, Mexico. Wind shear inhibited development initially, though conditions became slightly more favorable after a number <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> at 0600UTC on May27, {{a tropical}} depression formed about 190mi (305km) south of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|On January 30, the poorly {{organised}} Tropical Disturbance 08F developed {{within a}} convergence zone about 325km (200mi) {{to the northeast}} of Apia on the Samoan island of Upolu. Over {{the next few days}} the system remained weak and poorly organized, and was classified as a tropical depression during February 5. The depression then moved westwards, before dissipating on February 9. Tropical Disturbance 10F developed on February 15, about 170km (105mi) {{to the north of the}} Fijian Dependency of Rotuma Island. The system was poorly defined and disorganised, while convection surrounding the system was mostly confined to the southern and eastern flanks of the low level circulation. Over the next few days the disturbance remained weak and was last noted during February 21, while nestled within the Solomon Islands. On March 6, Tropical Depression 11F developed under an upper trough of low pressure about 220km (140mi) to the northeast of Nadi, Fiji. Convection surrounding the depression was displaced to the north of the low level circulation center. The depression remained weak over the next couple <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> was last noted during March 8. A fairly disorganized tropical disturbance developed during April 6, within a monsoonal convergence zone, about 236km (145mi) to the northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu. It was initially located within an area of weak vertical windshear, but was expected to move into an area of stronger vertical windshear over the following 24hours and gradually become extratropical. During the next day, as the disturbance moved southwards, it was assigned the designation 14F, before it was dropped by RSMC Nadi during April 8, as convection surrounding the system became sheared and displaced. On April 13, Tropical Disturbance 15F developed within a monsoon trough, about 355km (220mi) to the southeast of Apia, Samoa. The system moved towards the south, with convection surrounding it poorly organised, and displaced to the north of the depression's low level circulation centre. The depression was then last noted, during the next day as Tropical Depression 16F developed into Tropical Cyclone Fili.|$|E

25|$|In Judaism, {{the main}} textual {{source for the}} belief in the end <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> {{accompanying}} events is the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible.

The books of the Hebrew Prophets elaborated and prophesied about the end of days.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Hasmoneans and the {{subsequent}} Roman occupation, many Jews believed it to be the end <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> hoped that the Romans would somehow fall or be replaced by a Jewish king. Most Jews believed that their history was governed by God, meaning that even the conquest of Judea by the Romans was a divine act. They believed that the Romans would be replaced by a Jewish king only through divine intervention.|$|E

25|$|Despite McPherson's victory, the {{presence}} of Confederate forces attacking Grant's right flank caused him to reconsider his plan. He learned that Gen. Joseph E.

In this situation, the Union army would be between enemy forces on each flank.

25|$|After {{the capture}} of Burki, the Indian advance {{continued}} towards Dograi, a town {{in the immediate vicinity}} of Lahore. They subsequently went on to capture Dograi on 20 September, thus bringing the main city of Lahore within range of Indian tank fire. However, no attempt was made to capture Lahore and the main assault on Lahore was not launched because a ceasefire was to be signed in the following couple <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> it was known that the city would have been given back to Pakistan even if it was captured.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to escape, Schenck jumped into the river but his heavy armor weighed him down, and, {{although}} he tried to swim to a nearby vessel, the weight was too great.

Schenck's body also was found a few days later; the body was decapitated, his head placed on a pike, and his body quartered. The pieces were exhibited at four gates.|$|E

25|$|Alien land {{laws in the}} West Coast states {{barred the}} Issei from owning their pre-war homes and farms.

However, those unable to strike a deal with caretakers had to sell their property, often in a matter <b>of</b> <b>days</b> <b>and</b> at great financial loss to predatory land speculators, who made huge profits.|$|E

In relation to population size, the Swedish army was also the largest in Europe. Because of the allotment system, mobilization was quick. It took time, weeks and months, to enlist, equip, train and organize a unit of mercenaries, while the Swedish croft soldiers gathered at the company meeting place in a couple <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> <b>and</b> then at the regimental meeting place in around a week.
