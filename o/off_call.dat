5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{principle of}} the five-level hierarchy was to provide economies of scale by establishing direct connections between centralized call [...] "collection points" [...] (essentially the Class 4 offices) where economically feasible, and to provide additional concentration points (Class 1 through 3) to handle overflow traffic {{that could not be}} handled directly, or to handle traffic to locations which {{were less likely to be}} dialed from a given point - usually longer distances and/or smaller locations in other parts of the North American dialing plan. The North American plan differed from those of other continents in the existence of three concentration levels of hierarchy for domestic (here defined as including all those points [...] "within" [...] the dialing plan) calls, a need not required where the larger geographic area was broken into several national plan jurisdictions. However, it is important to note that this was not a strict hierarchy of absolute levels. If enough call traffic existed between geographic areas, for example, a Class 4 office could have direct trunk connections not only to a Class 3 office, but to a Class 2 or Class 1 office, and vice versa. For example, the Class 2 switch in Toronto (TOROON0101T2) had connections not only to the Class 1 switch in Montréal (MTRLPQ0201T1), but to the Class 1 switch in White Plains (WHPLNY0201T1), one of the Class 2 switches in New York City (NYCMNYAA02T2) and a Class 3 switch in Buffalo (BFLONYFR04T3). Network engineers re-worked the system as necessary to balance <b>off</b> <b>call</b> completion percentages with budgetary limitations. In fact, minor changes were made almost every month.|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Liu et al. [281] propose a {{self-learning}} call admission control mechanism for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) cellular networks that have both voice and data services. Their admission control mechanism is built atop a novel learning control architecture (e.g., adaptive critic design) that {{has only one}} controller module, namely, a critic network. The critic network is trained with an 3 : 6 : 1 MLP-NN that uses inputs such as network environment (e.g. total interference received at the base station), user behavior (e.g. call type—new or hand <b>off</b> <b>call),</b> call class (e.g. voice, data), and the action to accept or reject calls. The output is the Grade of Service (GoS) measure. The MLP-NN is retrained to adapt {{to changes in the}} admission control requirements, user behaviors and usage patterns, and the underlying network itself. Through simulation of cellular networks with two classes of services, the authors demonstrate that their admission control mechanism outperforms non-adaptive admission control mechanisms, with respect to GoS, in CDMA cellular networks.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Morning {{report is}} one of the most {{important}} corner stones of medical train-ing and education in internal medicine training program. However, the pattern and exact template is not definitely described. Studying the quality of morning report courses helps to find out the weak and power points of the courses. The aim of this research is to study the quality of morning report courses prospectively with the assistance of the academic members, residents, and the students in the Department of Infectious Diseases at Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in 2010, Tabriz, Iran. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the comments of the academic members, residents, and the students in the Infec-tious diseases course who attended to the morning report course meetings were collected utilizing two separate questionnaires about the goals of the classes. Results: The mean spending time for morning report classes was 60 ± 20 minutes. 68. 2 % of participants were satisfied because of the acceptable discipline of the meetings. 57. 85 % of sessions were run by <b>off</b> <b>call</b> attendants. 95. 2 % of the reports were according to charts in the absence of the patients. In 47. 1 % of courses, the class management was teacher-centered. The ethical and social issues in 95. 1 % of cases have been observed. The evaluation of classes was gener-ally good. Conclusion: Although in this study the evaluation of meetings were generally good, it seems that the goals and the planning of the meetings should be revised...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — For {{cellular}} communication systems, {{mobility and}} limited radio {{coverage of a}} cell require calls {{to be handed over}} from one base station system (BSS) to an another BSS. Due to the limited bandwidth available in various cells, there is a finite probability that an ongoing call while being handed off may get dropped. Minimizing the dropping of ongoing calls during handoff is an important design criterion. Some digital cellular systems, e. g., the GSM and the IS- 136 use the mobile assisted hand off (MAHO) in which a mobile terminal (MT) assists its BSS and mobile switching center (MSC) in making handoff decisions. MAHO requires an MT to regularly report back to its serving BSS, its current radio-link state (defined in terms of the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the bit error rate (BER)) of transmissions received from the neighboring BSSs. Some researchers have suggested that a base station needs to give priority to the handoff calls over the new calls. This requires each cell to reserve a number of guard channels (GCs) to be used exclusively for processing the handoff calls. Since MAHO makes handoff decisions based solely on RSSI/BER measurements, there is a finite probability that some handoff calls may get dropped due to the non-availability of free channels in the neighboring cell that is being handed off the call. Conversely, if a handoff decision is based solely on the availability of a free channel without regard to the signal quality, it may also result in some of the handed off calls being dropped due to poor signal quality. In this paper, we propose a new handoff technique by combining the MAHO and GC techniques. In the proposed technique, the MT reports back not only the RSSI and the BER, but also the number of free channels available for the handoff traffic. This will ensure that a handed <b>off</b> <b>call</b> has acceptable signal quality as well as a free available channel. The performance of this handoff technique is analyzed using an analytical model whose solution gives the desired performance measures in terms of blocking and dropping probabilities...|$|E
