40|$|Content of {{graduation}} theses {{is focused on}} civil divorce and church nullity <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> Graduation theses are divided in three Themes, secular law, canon law and comparison. First part is aimed at civil law which regulates divorce. Second part is focused on canon law. It conducts a study of church nullity <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> in consequence <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> agreement failure, canon form or impedimenta presence. Third part compares ways <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> termination in Czech secular law and ways <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> cessation in catholic canon law. It tries to find their equivalent components, their dissimilarities and relationship. The canon law is a base of comparison. Secular law {{is based upon the}} tenet <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> dissolvability. Canon law is based upon the tenet <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> indissolubleness. Marriage divorce in the civil law is ineffective in the canon law respectively church nullity <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> is ineffective in the secular law of the Czech Republic...|$|R

5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. The divorce rate is high, with 50% <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E

5|$|Pressure from an {{increasing}} population {{led to the}} town being supplied with amenities such as sewers, which were built in 1875–1880; and Sale {{was connected to the}} telephone network in 1888. As in the late-19th century, the early-20th century saw a great deal of construction work in Sale. The town's first swimming baths were built in 1914, and its first cinema, the Palace, was opened during the First World War. The end of the war in 1918 resulted in a rush <b>of</b> <b>marriages,</b> which highlighted a shortage of housing. The local councils of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey took the initiative of building council housing, and rented it to the local population at below market rates. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Sale had 594council houses. The building programme was interrupted by the start of the war. additional private housing development brought the total of inter-war houses built in Sale to around 900, including large housing estates like Woodheys Hall estate in Ashton.|$|E

However, a certain Andriscus claiming Antigonid descent rebelled against the Romans and was pronounced king of Macedonia, defeating the army of the Roman praetor Publius Iuventius Thalna during the Fourth Macedonian War (150–148 BC). Despite this, Andriscus was defeated in 148 BC at the second Battle of Pydna by Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, whose forces occupied the kingdom.

The alliances between him and local notables were bolstered by a network <b>of</b> <b>marriages</b> between the influential families of the area, including Zahir's Zaydani clan.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{marriage in}} multicultural and multi-faith Australia. It considers the history of, and reasons for, State recognition <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> in Australia between {{one man and}} one woman entered into voluntarily for life. It argues that the tradition in Australia since European settlement {{has been for the}} State to only recognize this traditional form <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> as marriage. The paper considers the meaning of equality and discrimination and argues that for those concepts to have meaning in the context <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> it is first necessary to have a clear understanding of why the State does and should continue to have any role in marriage. The paper argues that tradition and empirical evidence support the continuation of State recognition <b>of</b> traditional <b>marriage.</b> The paper also examines the absence of State recognition in Australia of other conceptions <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> including certain forms <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> within the Islamic tradition, all cultural marriages celebrated within the traditions of Australia’s Aboriginal peoples and marriages between two persons of the same sex. It argues that tradition and empirical evidence do not presently support the redefinition <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> to include State recognition of these forms <b>of</b> <b>marriage.</b> The paper concludes that there are powerful grounds for preserving the current definition <b>of</b> <b>marriage</b> in Australia and that it should be preserved...|$|R
