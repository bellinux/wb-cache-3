5|$|The MSHD {{completed}} a major rerouting of M-66 around 1944–45. The M-14 designation {{of the time}} was decommissioned and replaced with M-66. Starting at Six Lakes, M-66 turned west along M-46 instead of east and then turned south through Stanton and Ionia ending north of Battle Creek. The highway between Lowell and Lakeview was redesignated as M-91. A minor realignment in late 1950 removed two 90° curves near the Osceola–Missaukee county line {{and replaced them with}} a pair <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> curves.|$|E
5|$|Khandoba is {{described}} as doing odd jobs under Banai's orders. Banai first assigns him the task <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> the entire vada. He is responsible for cleaning the sheep pens and taking the sheep and lambs for grazing. He completes all tasks by spreading his magical bhandara. The shepherds are astonished how a single old man can handle all the animals. Their vanity is crushed. Banai assigns him the additional responsibility {{of taking care of}} five hundred children. She commands if any sheep or lamb is lost or a child cries, she will not give him his food. But Khandoba fulfils the tasks again by spraying his bhandara. She assigns him the job of washing the sheep and lambs. Instead, Khandoba kills all her sheep and lambs to humble the shepherds and Banai. He skins the sheep and separates the meat. A repentant Banai begs his forgiveness; he agrees to revive her flock on the condition that Banai marries him. Khandoba revives the sheep by spreading his bhandara and reveals his true form.|$|E
5|$|The game {{moved into}} extra time, and both teams had chances {{to score a}} vital second goal; first, Lampard hit the {{underside}} of the bar with a left-footed shot after the ball was played in to him with a disguised pass from Ballack, then Giggs stabbed the ball left-footed towards goal instead <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> it with his weaker right foot, only to see it headed off the line by Terry. Late {{in the second half of}} extra time, the ball was put out of play so players could be treated for cramp. In returning the ball to Chelsea, Carlos Tevez put it out for another throw-in deep in Chelsea's half then signalled to his teammates to put pressure on the restart. John Terry and Michael Ballack reacted angrily to this and were joined by several of their teammates, while Manchester United's players rushed in to protect Tevez. Ultimately, most of the 22 players were involved in the fracas. Amid the melée, assistant referee Martin Balko saw Drogba slap Nemanja Vidić and reported the incident to referee Ľuboš Micheľ. After showing a yellow card to Ballack, Micheľ showed a red card to Drogba for violent conduct, making him only the second player in history to be sent off in a European Cup final after Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in 2006.|$|E

5|$|Villa {{was one of}} the {{founding}} members of the Premier League in 1992, and finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season. The 1990s was a decade of inconsistency; the club had three different managers and league positions were unpredictable, despite winning two League Cups. They reached the FA Cup Final {{for the first time since}} 1957 in 2000, but lost 10 to Chelsea in the last game to be played at the old Wembley Stadium. Once again Villa's league position fluctuated under various managers and in the summer of 2006, David O'Leary left under acrimonious circumstances. Martin O'Neill soon arrived and received a rapturous reception. After 23years as chairman and largest shareholder, owning approximately 38% of the club, Doug Ellis decided to sell his stake to Randy Lerner, the owner of the NFL franchise Cleveland Browns. The arrival of a new owner and manager marked the start <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> changes throughout the club, including a new crest, a new kit sponsor and new players in the summer of 2007. After several years of narrowly avoiding the drop, Villa were relegated at the end of the 2015–16 season.|$|E
25|$|The {{educational}} {{reforms of}} the nineteenth century, a period <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> social, economic and political transition, resulted from various undercurrents occurring at different levels within the realms of the Ottoman Empire from the Mashreq (Greater Syria) to the Maghreb (North Africa).

25|$|In October 1943, the German {{commander-in-chief}} in south-eastern Europe, Generalfeldmarschall Maximilian von Weichs made {{a proposal}} to the Wehrmacht operations staff which included the merging of the Ustaša militia into the Croatian Home Guard. The proposal effectively recommended removing the Ustaše from power as part <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> changes to {{the administration of the}} NDH. Although the proposal was considered by Hitler, the decision was made not to proceed with it due mainly to the additional German troops that would have been required to implement it.|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} <b>of</b> a <b>sweeping</b> jet actuator to {{a circulation}} control system was initiated by a risk reduction {{series of experiments}} to optimize the authority <b>of</b> a single <b>sweeping</b> jet actuator.

While this paper will describe the scaling and optimization of the actuators for future high Reynolds number applications, the major focus of this effort was to target the transonic flight regime by increasing the amplitude authority of the actuator. This was accomplished by modifying the diffuser <b>of</b> the <b>sweeping</b> jet actuator, and this paper highlights twelve different diffuser designs.

25|$|East of Healdsburg, Maacama Creek {{joins the}} Russian River. After {{it makes a}} series <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> bends, the Healdsburg Memorial Bridge carries Old Redwood Highway over the river just {{upstream}} of U.S. Route 101's Healdsburg crossing. It receives water from Lake Sonoma via Dry Creek. The river turns westward, where it is spanned by the Wohler Bridge, and it is joined by Mark West Creek north of Forestville, followed by Green Valley Creek to the south. The river passes Rio Nido and Guerneville. In that area, State Route 116 parallels the river, bordering it past Guernewood Park and Monte Rio.|$|E

25|$|Wilson's {{government}} {{was responsible for}} a number <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> social and educational reforms {{under the leadership of}} Home Secretary Roy Jenkins such as the abolishment of the death penalty in 1964, the legalisation of abortion and homosexuality (initially only for men aged 21 or over, and only in England and Wales) in 1967 and the abolition of theatre censorship in 1968. Comprehensive education was expanded and the Open University created. However Wilson's government had inherited a large trade deficit that led to a currency crisis and ultimately a doomed attempt to stave off devaluation of the pound. Labour went on to lose the 1970 general election to the Conservatives under Edward Heath.|$|E
25|$|Taking {{into account}} the socio-religious {{landscape}} of Junagadh, Swaminarayan decided to appoint Gunatitanand Swami as the mahant (religious and administrative head) due to his leadership abilities and experience. Gunatitanand Swami {{played a significant role}} in shaping the administration of Junagadh Mandir. His emphasis on listening to spiritual discourses and attaining spiritual knowledge became de rigueur for all aspirants. Furthermore, he encouraged devotional service as a means of putting the theory of the discourses into practice and insisted that everyone, regardless of social standing, engage in service. For many decades, even into his old age, Gunatitanand Swami would perform the menial task <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> the mandir courtyard himself despite being the head of the temple.|$|E
25|$|A reverse sweep is a crossbatted sweep shot {{played in}} the {{opposite}} direction to the standard sweep, thus instead <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> the ball to the leg side, it is swept to the off side, towards backward point or third man. The batsman may also swap his hands on the bat handle to make the stroke easier to execute. The batsman may also bring his back foot to the front therefore making it more like a traditional sweep. The advantage of a reverse sweep is that it effectively reverses the fielding positions and thus is very difficult to set a field to. It is also a risky shot for the batsman as it increases the chance of LBW and also is quite easy to top edge to a fielder.|$|E

For general deterministic and stochastic environments, prioritized sweeping performs better even when memory and computation demands are restricted to be equal to those of episodic control. These results suggest generalizations <b>of</b> prioritized <b>sweeping</b> to partially observable environments, its combined use with function approximation and the search for possible implementations <b>of</b> prioritized <b>sweeping</b> in brains...|$|R

25|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of First Division Chelsea in June 1952. Upon Drake's arrival at Chelsea, {{he made a}} series <b>of</b> <b>sweeping</b> changes, doing much to rid the club of its previous amateurish, music hall image. He discarded the club's Chelsea pensioner crest {{and with it the}} Pensioners nickname, and insisted a new one be adopted. From these changes came the Lion Rampant Regardant crest and the Blues nickname. He introduced scouting reports and a new, tougher, training regime based on ballwork, a rare practice in English football at the time. The club's previous policy of signing unreliable big-name players was abandoned; Drake instead used his knowledge of the lower divisions and the amateur game to recruit little-known, but more reliable, players such as John McNichol, Frank Blunstone, Derek Saunders, Jim Lewis and Peter Sillett.|$|E
