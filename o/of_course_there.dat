25|$|MWI, being a decoherent formulation, is axiomatically more {{streamlined}} {{than the}} Copenhagen and other collapse interpretations; and thus favoured under certain interpretations of Occam's razor. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> are other decoherent interpretations that also possess this advantage {{with respect to}} the collapse interpretations.|$|E

25|$|Baracoa {{has some}} very typical dishes, such as cucurucho, a mix of coconut and lots of sugar and other {{ingredients}} like orange, guava and pineapple and wrapped in a palm leaf. Another is Bacán, which is made from bananas and wrapped in a banana leaf. And <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> is lots of chocolate in this cocoa producing region.|$|E
25|$|Locally {{produced}} newspapers, {{they could}} go to the cinema or one of the churches, there was live entertainment and sport was encouraged. Soldatenheimes were established, being similar to a British NAFFI or American PX, officers established clubs. Freudenhaus or brothels were established in Guernsey and Jersey, importing women to work in them. Hobbies, including photography, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> were the beaches.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, 22% of American {{households}} had two income earners. The {{vast majority}} (97%) of {{households in the}} top quintile had two or more income earners. This means {{that the majority of}} household income in the top quintile are the result of two income earners pooling their resources, establishing a close link between perceived affluence and the number of income earners in a given household. This {{raises the question of whether}} or not the combination of incomes results in higher social status. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> is no definite answer as class is a vague sociological concept.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{experiments}} aid {{in investigating}} {{many aspects of}} human psychology, including perception, emotion, learning, memory, and thought, to name a few. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to demonstrate classical conditioning. Non-human primates, cats, dogs, pigeons, rats, and other rodents are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one independent variable at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, {{that it is difficult}} to control important variables for human subjects. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans through animal models.|$|E
25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} involves ocean venting {{of hydrogen}} sulfide gas. Portions {{of the deep}} ocean will periodically lose all of its dissolved oxygen allowing bacteria that live without oxygen to flourish and produce hydrogen sulfide gas. If enough hydrogen sulfide accumulates in an anoxic zone, the gas can rise into the atmosphere. Oxidizing gases in the atmosphere would destroy the toxic gas, but the hydrogen sulfide would soon consume all of the atmospheric gas available. Hydrogen sulfide levels might have increased dramatically over a few hundred years. Models of such an event indicate that the gas would destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere allowing ultraviolet radiation to kill off species that had survived the toxic gas. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> are species that can metabolize hydrogen sulfide.|$|E

25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> is Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, {{it seems to me}} that I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E

Cameron replied that he [...] "had no choice but to agree with the settlement. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> was a gag order as well, so I couldn't tell this story, but now I frankly don't care. It's the truth." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Today, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> is {{exponentially}} {{more news}} coverage {{than there was}} in 1964 — not to mention exponentially more attempts to slot attention-getting events into simple, truthy stories about human nature. The gap between the famous version of the Genovese story and the true one, then, is worth remembering, if only as a check on our natural tendency to hear a story and then nod along and say, 'Of course that’s what happened!'” ...|$|E

500|$|Most {{textbooks}} {{date the}} establishment of the [...] "Publicity Bureau" [...] in 1900 as the start of the modern public relations (PR) profession. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> were many early forms of public influence and communications management in history. Basil Clark is considered the founder of the public relations profession in Britain with his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924. Academic Noel Turnball points out that systematic PR was employed in Britain first by religious evangelicals and Victorian reformers, especially opponents of slavery. In each case the early promoters focused on their particular movement and were not for hire more generally.|$|E
500|$|Nowak {{wanted to}} start the design process after talking through the story with the filmmakers {{so that he could}} {{formulate}} [...] "a sense of the atmosphere" [...] which they wanted to create for the film. He wanted to create a [...] "dark, scary and oppressive environment" [...] for the characters, especially Mulder. While familiar with the television series, Nowak decided not to review any episodes as preparation {{for his role in the}} production. Explaining this decision, he said, [...] "I wanted the movie to be as fresh and new as possible in its design. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> were some elements from the show that had to be retained." ...|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein {{split the}} {{composition}} into two panels {{to separate the}} action from its consequence. The left panel features the attacking plane—placed at a diagonal {{to create a sense}} of depth—below the text balloon, which Lichtenstein has relegated to the margin above the plane. In the right panel, the exploding plane—depicted head-on—is outlined by the flames, accompanied by the bold exclamation [...] "WHAAM!". Although separate, with one panel containing the missile launch and the other its explosion, representing two distinct events, the two panels are clearly linked spatially and temporally, not least by the horizontal smoke trail of the missile. Lichtenstein commented on this piece in a 10 July 1967, letter: [...] "I remember being concerned with the idea of doing two almost separate paintings having little hint of compositional connection, and each having slightly separate stylistic character. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> is the humorous connection of one panel shooting the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Moratorium," [...] {{reflected}} Mr. Britling; [...] "Moratorium. What nonsense you talk! It's {{something that}} delays, <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> Nothing {{to do with}} death.

500|$|For Peel, Thunderbirds is [...] "without a {{doubt the}} peak of the Supermarionation achievement". Suggesting that the series is pitched at a [...] "more adult" [...] level than its predecessors, he adds that its sense of adventure, {{effective}} humour and [...] "gripping and convincing" [...] episodes ensured that [...] "everyone in the audience found something to love about it." [...] Simon Heffer, a fan of Thunderbirds in childhood, commented positively on the series for The Daily Telegraph in 2011: [...] "All the elements we children discerned in whatever grown-up television we had been allowed to watch were present in Thunderbirds: dramatic theme and incidental music; well-developed plots; goodies and baddies; swaggering Americans, {{at a time when the}} whole of Britain was in a cultural cringe to them; and, of course, glamorous locations... Then, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there</b> was the nail-biting tension of the rescues themselves..." [...] Film critic Kim Newman describes the series as a [...] "television perennial".|$|E
500|$|Ethan Sack from New York Daily News {{said that}} [...] "it's a tossup over who looks better in tights and high-heels, the 53-year-old Material Girl or the bevy of shirtless male dancers who gyrate around her." [...] Lanford Beard of Entertainment Weekly praised the video {{saying that it}} [...] "shows Madonna looking the best she has since at least 2005's video for 'Hung Up'. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> is the {{requisite}} writhing, hip grinding, a rousing dance sequence, and a smoldering mantourage. It is, in a word, awesome". HitFix's Melinda Newman praised the direction by Mert and Marcus, feeling that [...] "the clip is a luscious collection of erotic images: two men biting an apple together, backlit men dancing in high heels, and Madge, looking as if she’s a dewy 25-year old." [...] A review in The Week praised the video for being self-referential with its [...] "dark, dominatrix-y" [...] visuals. Amanda Dobbins from New York magazine gave a positive review for the appearance of Kazaky and Madonna's look in the video. Caryn Ganz from Spin noticed that along with her old videos, Madonna also referenced her contemporary releases, like the videos for [...] "Give It 2 Me" [...] (2008) and [...] "Celebration", with the scenes showing her [...] "incredible" [...] dancing alone.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{apocryphal}} {{story of}} King emulating a famous baseball pitcher of the day, Rube Waddell, by sending all his fielders {{back into the}} pavilion and finishing off the opponent's innings on his own. King and Belmont were playing Trenton in the Halifax Cup at Elmwood Cricket Ground. Some versions of the story have him banishing the fielders and then calling {{one of them to}} a position [...] back and [...] to the leg side. This fielder was stationed there to pick up the bails which landed at his feet after King bowled his trademark [...] "angler". This story was disputed some years later by the captain of Trenton, who claimed that when he [...] "went in to bat that afternoon, King had four balls left in his over." [...] He claimed to have [...] "hit the first delivery to cover point but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>there</b> was no one there. The ball stopped within three feet of the boundary, and King had to chase it. By the time he got back we had run six." [...] The captain claimed to be the only batsmen to have hit four consecutive sixes off King, but commended the bowler on his ability to spin a tale.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] assented Prescott thoughtfully, [...] "I {{guess that}} would be wiser. You want to keep his mind at rest {{as far as you}} can. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>there's</b> a big chance that I may fail." ...|$|R
