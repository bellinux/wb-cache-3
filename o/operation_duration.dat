40|$|Abstract Background The {{incision}} {{used for}} thyroid surgery has become shorter over time, from the classical 10 [*]cm long Kocher incision to the shortest 15 [*]mm access achieved with Minimally Invasive Video-Assisted Thyroidectomy. This rather large interval encompasses many different possible technical choices, {{even if we}} just consider open surgery. The aim {{of the study was}} to assess the correlation between incision length and <b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> with a set of biometric and clinical factors and establish a rationale for the decision on the length of incision in open surgery. Methods Ninety-seven consecutive patients scheduled for total thyroidectomy were prospectively evaluated. All operations were performed by the same team and the surgeon decided the length of the incision according to his personal judgement. Patients who had previously undergone neck surgery were excluded. Results The length of the incision was strongly correlated with gender, thyroid volume, neck circumference and clinical diagnosis and weakly correlated with the body mass index. <b>Operation</b> <b>duration</b> was only weakly correlated with gender and neck circumference. Multiple linear regression revealed that the set of factors assessed explained almost 60 [*]% of the variance in incision length but only 20 [*]% of the variance in <b>operation</b> <b>duration.</b> When patients were classified according to the distribution of their thyroid volume, cases within one standard deviation of the mean did not show a significant difference in terms of <b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> with incisions of various lengths. Conclusions Although thyroid volume was a major factor in driving the decision with respect to the length of the incision, our study shows that it had only minor effect on the duration of the operation. Many more open thyroidectomies could therefore be safely performed with shorter incisions, especially in women. Duration of the operation is probably more closely linked to the inherent technical difficulty of each case. </p...|$|E

Methods Sixty patients clinically diagnosed of lung cancer were selected according to the adopt standardization, from January 2008 to December 2008. All of the patients were divided into two groups randomly: the filling-fat group and the non-fillling-fat group. The surgical information such as <b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> time bleeding volume during operation, post-operation bleeding volume were recorded. After one month, FACT-L and LCQ were completed.

40|$|A Prospective {{randomised}} controlled {{study was}} done to determine statistical difference between the standard microsurgical discotomy (MC) and a minimally invasive microscopic procedure for disc prolapse surgery by comparing <b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> and clinical outcome. Additionally, the transferability of the results was determined by a bicentric design. The microscopic assisted percutaneous nucleotomy (MAPN) has been advocated as a minimally invasive tubular technique. Proponents have claimed that minimally invasive procedures reduce postoperative pain and accelerate the recovery. In addition, there exist {{only a limited number}} of well-designed comparison studies comparing standard microdiscotomy to a tubular minimally invasive technique that support this claim. Furthermore, there are no well-designed studies looking at the transferability of those results and possible learning curve phenomena. We studied 100 patients, who were planned for disc prolapse surgery at two centres [50 patients at the developing centre (index) and 50 patients at the less experienced (transfer) centre]. The randomisation was done separately for each centre, employing a block-randomisation procedure with respect to age and preoperative Oswestry score. <b>Operation</b> <b>duration</b> was chosen as a primary outcome parameter as there was a distinguished shortening observed in a preliminary study at the index centre enabling a sound case number estimation. The following data were compared between the two groups and the centres with a 12 -month follow-up: surgical times (<b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> and approach duration), the clinical results, leg and back pain by visual analogue scale, the Oswestry disability index, length of hospital stay, return to work time, and complications. The <b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> was statistically identical for MC (57. 8  ±  20. 2  min) at the index centre and for MAPN (50. 3  ±  18. 3  min) and MC (54. 7  ±  18. 1  min) at the transfer centre. The <b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> was only significantly shorter for the MAPN technique at the index centre with 33. 3  min (SD 12. 1  min). There was a huge clinical improvement for all patients regardless of centre or method revealed by a repeated measures ANOVA for all follow-up visits Separate post hoc ANOVAs for each centre revealed that there was a significant time–method (MAPN vs. MC) interaction at the index centre (F =  3. 75, P =  0. 006), whereas this crucial interaction was not present at the transfer centre (F =  0. 5, P =  0. 7). These results suggest a slightly faster clinical recovery for the MAPN patients only at the index centre. This was due to a greater reduction in VAS score for back pain at discharge, 8 -week and 6 -month follow up (P <  0. 002). The Oswestry-disability scores reached a significant improvement compared to the initial values extending over the complete follow-up at both centres for both methods without revealing any differences for the two methods in either centre. There was no difference regarding complications. The results demonstrate that a shorter <b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> and concomitant quicker recovery is comprehensible at an experienced minimally invasively operating centre. These advantages could not be found at the transfer centre within 25 minimally invasive procedures. In conclusion both procedures show equal mid term clinical results and the same complication rate even if the suggested advantages for the minimally invasive procedure could not be confirmed for the transfer centre within the framework of this study...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{current power}} grid is {{conservatively}} provisioned for rarely-occurring peaks. Expensive, quickly-ramping genera-tors, typically with high carbon emissions, provide peak power. Therefore, {{it is possible}} to reduce both capital cost and carbon footprint by reducing the peak load. We address this issue by proposing to intelligently reduce loads from household appliances during peak times. Our scheme capitalizes {{on the fact that the}} power consumed by resistive loads can be reduced, at the cost of a small increase in appliance <b>operation</b> <b>duration,</b> with little impact on perceived user comfort. Specifically, on the receipt of congestion signals from the grid, appliance-based controllers intelligently reduce their load while ensuring that user comfort does not degrade below a pre-specified level. Simulations show that significant gains in energy reduction can be obtained with our scheme. For example, in Quebec, an estimated 12. 9 MWh of peak power reduction can be obtained for a maximum of 10 % increase in appliance <b>operation</b> <b>duration.</b> I...|$|E

The opening dates and duration times of skating over the last 26 years showed periodic variations over three-year cycles.

40|$|Abstract】Objective: The main {{treatment}} method used for thoracolumbar fractures is open reduction and in-ternal fixation. Commonly {{there are three}} surgical approaches: anterior, posterior and paraspinal. We attempt to compare the three approaches based on our clinical data analysis. Methods: A group of 94 patients with Denis type A or B thoracolumbar burst fracture between March 2008 and September 2010 were recruited in this study. These patients were treated by anterior-, posterior- or paraspinal-approach reduction with or without decompression. The fracture was fixed with titanium mesh and Z-plate via anterior approach (24 patients), screw and rod system via posterior approach (38 patients) or paraspinal approach (32 patients). Clinical evaluations included <b>operation</b> <b>duration,</b> blood loss, inci-sion length, preoperative and postoperative Oswestry dis-ability index (ODI). Results: The average <b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> (94. 1 min± 13. 7 min), blood loss (86. 7 ml± 20. 0 ml), length of incision (9. 3 mm± 0. 7 mm) and postoperative ODI (6 ± 0. 5) were signifi-cantly lower (P< 0. 05) in paraspinal approach group than in traditional posterior approach group (<b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> 94. 1 min± 13. 7 min, blood loss 143. 3 ml± 28. 3 ml, length of incision 15. 4 cm± 2. 1 cm and ODI 12 ± 0. 7) and anterior approach group (<b>operation</b> <b>duration</b> 176. 3 min± 20. 7 min, blood loss 255. 1 ml± 38. 4 ml, length of incision 18. 6 cm± 2. 4 cm and ODI 13 ± 2. 4). There was not statistical {{difference in terms of}} Cobb angle on radiographs among the three approaches. Conclusion: The anterior approach surgery is conve-nient for resection of the vertebrae and reconstruction of vertebral height, but it is more complicated and traumatic. Hence it is mostly used for severe Denis type B fracture. The posterior approach is commonly applied to most thora-columbar fractures and has fewer complications compared with the anterior approach, but it has some shortcomings as well. The paraspinal approach has great advantages com-pared with the other two approaches. It is in accordance with the concept of minimally invasive surgery and can re-place most posterior approach operations.
