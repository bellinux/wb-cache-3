It features screenings <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>new</b> films, interviews with directors, and the festival's Osprey Awards for short films by local filmmakers. The ten-day Words by the Water literary festival is held in March every year, based at the Theatre by the Lake. The festival began in 1995, and events have been presented by Melvyn Bragg, Louis de Bernières, Germaine Greer, Steve Jones, Penelope Lively, Princess Michael of Kent, Michael Rosen and Joanna Trollope.|$|E
5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, a synthesis <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>new</b> hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, {{in particular the}} proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and the bourgeois one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, young and old, harsh and gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci opine that Rommel's military brilliance provoked a masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was skilled at his profession, {{he must have been}} an anti-Nazi hero.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} to tour as a duo, with Linnell playing accordion and Flansburgh on guitars, or occasionally playing a marching band bass drum. Large posters of postage stamps adorned the stage as props; the minimal arrangement was {{received as a}} boldly simple choice. Sets included a combination <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>new</b> material. As in the past, the band was backed by a tape deck playing drum tracks or a metronome {{in lieu of a}} full rhythm section.|$|E

5|$|As {{proof of}} the {{successful}} revival of the British hard rock and metal scene, tours and gigs <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>new</b> acts were sold out, {{both at home and}} in other European countries, where the movement had spread. Groups arising from the NWOBHM were no longer precluded from world tours and were often chosen as opening acts for major bands in arenas and stadiums. Iron Maiden supported Kiss in Europe in 1980, embarking on their first world tour as headliners in 1981, as well as opening for Judas Priest and UFO in the US. Def Leppard visited the US {{for the first time in}} 1980 for a three-month trek supporting Pat Travers, Judas Priest, Ted Nugent, AC/DC and Sammy Hagar. Saxon opened for Judas Priest in Europe and for Rush and AC/DC in the US in 1981. NWOBHM bands were already present on the roster of the famous Reading Festival in 1980, and were quickly promoted to headliners for the 1981 and 1982 events. The 1980 edition was also remarkable for the violent protests against Def Leppard, whose declared interest in the American market was received badly by British fans. In addition to Reading, a new festival called Monsters of Rock was created in 1980 at Castle Donington, England, to showcase only hard rock and heavy metal acts.|$|E

25|$|The early {{defense of}} images {{included}} exegesis <b>of</b> <b>Old</b> <b>and</b> <b>New</b> Testament. Evidence {{for the use}} of religious images is found in Early Christian art and documentary records. For example, the veneration of the tombs and statues of martyrs was common among early Christian communities. In 397 St. Augustine of Hippo, in his Confessions 6.2.2, tells the story of his mother making offerings for the statues and tombs of martyrs.|$|E

25|$|Webern's music {{does not}} fall into clearly demarcated periods of {{division}} because the concerns and techniques of his music were cohesive, interrelated, and only very gradually transformed with the overlap <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>new,</b> {{particularly in the case}} of his middle-period lieder. For example, his first use of twelve-tone technique was not especially stylistically significant and only eventually became realized as otherwise so in later works. As such, the divisions employed below are only a convenient simplification.|$|E
25|$|Osiris was the Egyptian {{god of the}} afterlife. Ancient Egyptians {{believed}} that kings preserved in the likeness of Osiris would rule the Kingdom of the Dead.

This confluence <b>of</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>new</b> beliefs resulted in a mixture of emblems inside Tutankhamun's sarcophagus and tomb.|$|E
