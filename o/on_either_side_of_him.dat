5|$|The Crucifixion {{itself is}} conspicuously absent, {{and there is}} no trace or shadow of its {{presence}} in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced Christ and the two thieves crucified <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso's late 1920s and mid-1930s pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's The Bathers (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's figures have been replaced by a sense of menace and terror derived in part from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Caudy {{participated in}} the French and Indian War and {{is best known for}} having purportedly defended himself from a band of Native American fighters on Caudy's Castle—a {{sandstone}} outcrop that now bears his name. According to tradition, Caudy used his long rifle barrel to push his Native American attackers off the rock into the Cacapon River below. In his later life, Caudy became involved in a land dispute with John Capper that was resolved by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in November 1762. Caudy died in 1784 and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> while another tradition says Caudy was buried with his horse.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands {{was placed on the}} top of the table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic instrument that Home had concealed.|$|E
50|$|Depictions include Saint Peter and Andrew the Apostle, these shown <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a Christ in Majesty. <b>On</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> {{the central}} {{painting}} are large statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Peter.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{because the}} level set filter not only {{preserves}} edges but also enhances edges by inhibiting diffusion across edges and allowing diffusion <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge. So, standard deviation will become large in Table 1. Meanwhile, {{it appears that}} some edges are enhanced, that is, the difference <b>of</b> intensity value <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge becomes large (Figure 3 (i)). At a word, black will become more black while white more white <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge.|$|R
50|$|Fracture {{zones and}} the {{transform}} faults that form them are separate features. Transform faults are plate boundaries, meaning that <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the fault {{is a different}} plate. In contrast, <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a fracture zone, the crust belongs to the same plate.|$|R
5|$|Caudy {{never learned}} to write in English; he signed his last will and {{testament}} with an X mark in 1784. Caudy died on March 15, 1784, and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Another tradition says he was buried with his horse. The site of Caudy's interment is located on property now known as Hartford Bealer farm. In the 1930s, Caudy's burial site was attended to by a local Boy Scouts troop, who landscaped the site and planted shrubbery. By 1976, Caudy's burial place was marked with four posts. In 2002, the Capon Bridge Ruritan Club removed the overgrown shrubs and erected a white fence around Caudy's interment site. The project was initiated by Capon Bridge area residents Roy Giffin, Ken Edmonds, and Roberta Munske. The Ruritans purchased a marble marker and erected it on the site at 9 a.m. on November 15, 2003. The burial site is accessible and visible from Christian Church Road, West Virginia Secondary Route 13.|$|E
5|$|In essence {{this type}} of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on {{psychological}} shock for effect. Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not {{get close enough to}} the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive. Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. Captain Mercer, who commanded 'G' Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, thought the Brunswick troops <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.|$|E
25|$|In {{between the}} columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On {{them had been}} carved the monograms of Justinian and Theodora (6th century), even though Theodora {{had been dead for}} several years, as well as a many-armed cross in the center. On the center of the {{architrave}} was a repoussé medallion of Christ. <b>On</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>Him</b> were medallions of angels, the Prophets, the Apostles, and finally the Virgin Mary. The carvings on the architrave were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia’s is that of the church to St. John of Ephesus, rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix. There was an inscription to St. John the Theologian over a side door, since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. St. John the Baptist was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{of the church is}} relatively plain, with two towers <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the main door, topped with onion domes.The interior is decorated in lavish Baroque style, with pink marble columns.There are three <b>side</b> chapels <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a wide main nave.|$|R
50|$|At {{the top of}} {{the command}} tower were the captain's {{personal}} quarters, including a chair mounted on a vertical track giving him the capability of rapidly transiting to his command post in Bridge 1. <b>On</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the main bridge were radar units. Below that was Bridge 2, and directly below the command tower, {{on the underside of the}} ship, is Bridge 3. There were also observation domes <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the command tower, and larger windowed sections <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the main hull.|$|R
50|$|The medial {{and lateral}} {{portions}} of the quadriceps tendon pass down <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the patella to be inserted into the upper extremity <b>of</b> the tibia <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the tuberosity; these portions merge into the capsule, as stated above, forming the medial and lateral patellar retinacula.|$|R
500|$|Wales {{referred}} to the site's softcore pornography as [...] "glamour photography", and Bomis became familiar to Internet users for its erotic images. During this period Wales was photographed steering a yacht with a peaked cap, posing as a sea captain with a female professional model <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> In the photograph, the women were wearing panties and T-shirts advertising Bomis.|$|E
500|$|In this temple, built {{entirely of}} gold, the people worship the statues of three gods. These images are {{arranged}} so that Thor, the most powerful, has his throne {{in the middle}} of the group of three. <b>On</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> sit Othin and Freyr. [...] Near that temple is a very large tree with widespread branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled.|$|E
2500|$|During the Empire of Ashanti period, Ashanti swords {{also had}} ranks (hierarchy) {{depending}} on who wielded them and what their purpose was. The highest ranking of these swords {{was known as the}} Mpomponsuo, literally meaning [...] "responsibility sword." [...] Only two such swords existed and were wielded by the King's two bodyguards, who always stood <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and held the nobility title of Ankobia.|$|E

A Gerkules sonar was also fitted in addition to various radio direction finders.|$|R

2500|$|On the calvary {{platform}} {{are three}} crosses. We see Jesus {{on the central}} cross with four angels collecting his blood and on the reverse an [...] "Ecce Homo". Jesus has a horsed cavalier <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and on the lower crosspiece there is a depiction of the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus, with St Peter {{on one side and}} John the Evangelist on the other, whilst on the reverse of these three figures there is a pietà in the centre with the Virgin Mary on one side and St Yves on the other. There are two smaller crosses, one {{on each side of the}} crucifixion cross, from which the two robbers hang. The good robber turns to Jesus whilst the bad robber turns away from him. At the foot of the main cross there is a statue of Mary Magdalene looking up towards Jesus and on the pedestal platform a [...] "mise au tombeau" [...] and a depiction of Jesus' resurrection.|$|E
