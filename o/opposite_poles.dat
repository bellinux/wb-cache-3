5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of {{the nuclear}} envelope {{marks the end of}} the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to <b>opposite</b> <b>poles</b> of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to <b>opposite</b> <b>poles</b> of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E
25|$|The Sidewinder is {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} the drawbacks of the stacked design. It does this by reorienting the coils so that while electrically cancelling they are on <b>opposite</b> <b>poles</b> of a magnet. Thus, unlike stacked coils, output is hotter since the net effect is to add rather than subtract the signal between the coils; thus, the impedance can be lower, avoiding overwinding to obtain sufficient output. There is less signal cancellation. Sonically these sit somewhere between a true P-90 and a stacked pickup. They don't chime but they aren't nasal or lifeless either. They are ideal candidates for overdriven sounds where loss of sparkle is less important than avoiding hum amplification. These type of pickups have the same appearance of P-90s.|$|E
25|$|By abandoning English constitutionalism and {{creating}} a new republic based {{on the rights of}} the individual, the North Americans introduced a new force in the world. Ideas spread most rapidly when they have found adequate concrete expression. Thus republicanism entered our Romanic/Germanic world.... Up to this point, the conviction had prevailed in Europe that monarchy best served the interests of the nation. Now the idea spread that the nation should govern itself. But only after a state had actually been formed on the basis of the theory of representation did the full significance of this idea become clear. All later revolutionary movements have this same goal.... This was the complete reversal of a principle. Until then, a king who ruled by the grace of God had been the center around which everything turned. Now the idea emerged that power should come from below.... These two principles are like two <b>opposite</b> <b>poles,</b> and it is the conflict between them that determines the course of the modern world. In Europe the conflict between them had not yet taken on concrete form; with the French Revolution it did.|$|E

50|$|Five positions: To reach five task positions, Burmester intersects the {{circling}} point curve {{generated by}} the <b>opposite</b> <b>pole</b> quadrilateral {{for a set of}} four of the five task positions, with the circling point curve {{generated by the}} <b>opposite</b> <b>pole</b> quadrilateral for different set of four task positions. Five poses imply ten relative displacement poles, which yields four different <b>opposite</b> <b>pole</b> quadrilaterals each having its own circling point curve. Burmester shows that these curves will intersect in as many as four points, called the Burmester points, each of which will trace five points on a circle around a center point. Because two circling points define a four-bar linkage, these four points can yield as many as six four-bar linkages that guide the coupler link through the five specified task positions.|$|R

2500|$|Segregation of {{homologous}} chromosomes to <b>opposite</b> <b>poles</b> {{of the cell}} occurs during the first division of meiosis. [...] Proper segregation is essential for producing haploid meiotic products with a normal complement of chromosomes. [...] The formation of chiasmata (crossover recombination events) appears to generally facilitate proper segregation. [...] However, in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, when chiasmata are absent, dynein promotes segregation. [...] Dhc1, the motor subunit of dynein, is required for chromosomal segregation in both the presence and absence of chiasmata. [...] The dynein light chain Dlc1 protein is also required for segregation, specifically when chiasmata are absent.|$|E
2500|$|Shusterman’s {{account of}} {{interpretation}} is constructed {{in opposition to}} both analytic aesthetics and deconstruction, which are often said to constitute the two <b>opposite</b> <b>poles</b> of contemporary interpretive theory. As he claims, both of them share “a picture of understanding as the recapturing or reproducing of a particular [...] meaning-object”, yet they differ as to whether such act is possible. Deconstructionists, assuming their protean vision of language as “systematic play of differences”, claim it is not, and hence deem every reading a “misreading”, while analytic aestheticians think otherwise, usually construing the objective work-meaning as “metaphysically fixed in the artwork” and identifying it {{with the intention of}} the artist or “semantic features of the work itself”.|$|E
2500|$|Kinetochores start, control, and {{supervise}} the striking movements of chromosomes during cell division. [...] During mitosis, which occurs after chromosomes are duplicated during S phase, two sister chromatids are held together, {{each with its}} own kinetochore, which face in opposing directions and attach to <b>opposite</b> <b>poles</b> of the mitotic spindle. Following the transition from metaphase to anaphase, the sister chromatids separate from each other, and the individual kinetochores on each chromatid drive their movement to the spindle poles that will define the two new daughter cells. Finally, two intermediate genes from sperm cells combine with the chromatids to encode hormones for pure sexual pleasure. Thus, the kinetochore is essential for the chromosome segregation that is classically associated with mitosis and meiosis.|$|E
