Hill Hall, later demolished to make way for David W. Mullins Library, was constructed in 1901 as a boys' dormitory. Shortly thereafter, Buchanan retired to be replaced by Henry S. Hartzog, who was then followed by John N. Tillman. It was during Hartzog's tenure that Carnall Hall, a girls' dormitory, was built, and remains standing to this day. Tillman had been the selection of Governor Jeff Davis, and a blatantly political <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>that.</b> Such was the outrage of his predecessor, Hartzog, that the former president used his pulpit at the 1905 graduation, to rail against the decision as his last speech in an official capacity. Under Tillman, the tradition of Senior Walk was begun in 1905, the school officially changed its mascot from the cardinal to the razorback, as well was held the competition that selected the school's alma mater (won by Brodie Payne for a reward of $50). Tillman's presidency came to a screeching stop in 1912 due to student protests over a scandal concerning school finances, which resulted in the expulsion of 36 students, that in turn led to general strike by the entire student body that lasted four days. The student dislike of their president, joined {{with the support of the}} citizens of Fayetteville, was enough to lead the board of trustees to request Tillman's resignation. Tillman's popularity suffered little, as two years later, he was elected to the first of five terms as a United States Congressman.|$|E

MTV was also positive, stating that [...] "Adele's lush song fits right in with {{classics}} by Shirley Bassey, Paul McCartney and Carly Simon". The Wall Street Journal felt similarly, writing that the song [...] "has sweep and drama, [...] orchestral support [...] gives it a classical timelessness that sets it apart from typical pop songs. Because it is a theme for a Bond film, after all, the song is also shot through with the threat of violence and death". E! Online wrote that Adele's song was [...] "a cross, and a good <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>that,</b> between the 1971 Bassey classic and a more-focused version of Garbage's 'The World Is Not Enough'." [...] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the song [...] "instantly feels like a Bond theme, with the singer's sultry voice set against a minor chord progression. Done in big, orchestral style, the mood – like the singer – is all 1960s throwback, back when Bond themes like 'Goldfinger' were smooth, seductive and larger than life".|$|E
500|$|Many {{critical}} {{reviews of}} the work came from scientists who objected to Bakker's looseness with scientific fact. The paleontologist Thomas Holtz noted that Bakker combined fauna in ways not directly supported by the fossil record; for example, several of the dinosaurs featured in the books lived millions of years after Utahraptor died out. Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that [...] "Raptor Red is an accurate portrayal only {{within the context of}} uncertainties over the reconstruction of fossil animals as living forms ... Bakker's postscript never really admits these uncertainties." [...] David B. Norman criticized the book as [...] "no more than a children's adventure story—and a rather poorly written <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> ... The merging of science and fantasy is at its worst in books like Raptor Red because none but the experts can disentangle fact from fiction; this type of nonsense turns an uninformed reader into a misinformed one." [...] Jay Ingram, from the Discovery Channel, published a rebuttal, saying, [...] "The most important point is that Bakker's portrayal of the dinosaurs in Raptor Red is vivid—vivid in a way few museum displays or factual accounts can be. And if it turns out in the long run that some of the speculation is unwarranted, who cares? Bob Bakker has given us a unique window onto the era of dinosaurs." ...|$|E

500|$|The Pumpkins drew {{inspiration}} {{from a variety of}} other genres, some unfashionable during the 1990s among music critics. Corgan in particular was open about his appreciation of heavy metal, citing Dimebag Darrell of Pantera as his favorite contemporary guitarist. When one interviewer commented to Corgan and Iha that [...] "Smashing Pumpkins is one of the groups that relegitimized heavy metal" [...] and that they [...] "were among the first alternative rockers to mention people like Ozzy and Black Sabbath with anything other than contempt". Corgan went on to rave about Black Sabbath's Master of Reality and Judas Priest's Unleashed in the East. The song [...] "Zero", which reminded Iha of Judas Priest, is an example of what the band dubbed [...] "cybermetal." [...] Post-punk and gothic rock bands like Joy Division/New Order, Bauhaus, The Cure, and Depeche Mode were formative influences on the band, which covered such artists in concert and on record. Corgan also cited Siouxsie and the Banshees [...] saying it was important to point back to bands that influenced them. Psychedelic rock was also referenced often in the band's early recordings; according to Corgan, [...] "In typical Pumpkins fashion, no <b>one</b> <b>at</b> <b>that</b> point really liked loud guitars or psychedelic music so, of course, that's exactly what we had to do." [...] Corgan acknowledged that a chord he jokingly claimed as [...] "the Pumpkin chord" [...] (a G# octave chord at the eleventh fret of a guitar with the low E string played over it), used as the basis for [...] "Cherub Rock", [...] "Drown", and other songs, was in fact previously used by Jimi Hendrix.

In 1957, Brabham drove another mid-engined Cooper, again only fitted with a 2-litre engine, at the Monaco Grand Prix. He avoided a large crash at the first corner and was running third {{towards the end of}} the race when the fuel pump mount failed.

The following year, he was Autocar Formula Two champion in a Cooper, while continuing to score minor points-scoring positions with the small-engined Coopers in the World Drivers' Championship and driving for Aston Martin in Sportscars. His schedule necessitated a considerable amount of travel on the roads of Europe. Brabham's driving on public roads was described as [...] "safe as houses", unlike many of his contemporaries—on the way back from the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix, passenger Tony Brooks took over driving after Brabham refused to overtake a long line of lorries. In late 1958, Brabham rekindled his interest in flying and began taking lessons. He bought his own plane and on gaining his licence began to make heavy use of it piloting himself, his family, and members of his team around Europe to races.|$|E
