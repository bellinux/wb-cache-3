5|$|After {{the subject}} of {{business}} was eschewed for a few days, Thompson explained to the king in Setswana what he and his confederates had come to talk about. He said that his backers, unlike the Transvaalers, were not seeking land, but <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to mine gold in the Zambezi–Limpopo watershed. During the following weeks, talks took place sporadically. Moffat, who had remained in Bulawayo, was occasionally called upon by the king for advice, prompting the missionary to subtly assist Rudd's team through his counsel. He urged Lobengula to work alongside one large entity rather than many small concerns, telling him that this would make the issue {{easier for him to}} manage. He then informed the king that Shippard was going to pay an official visit during October, and advised him not to make a decision until after this was over.|$|E
5|$|At 2am on March 10, 1975, the North Vietnamese army {{began their}} assault on South Vietnamese forces at Ban Me Thuot. The North Vietnamese 198th Special Forces Regiment spearheaded the attack by hitting the Hoa Binh Airfield, the {{district}} of Mai Hac De, and {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment. The initial North Vietnamese attack, which was marked by heavy artillery bombardment and actions initiated by the 198th Special Forces Regiment, had shocked ARVN Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang, both subordinates of Major General Pham Van Phu. Despite the strength of the initial assault, Quang believed the North Vietnamese <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to cause disruption and would withdraw their forces by daybreak. By 3:30am, the 4th Battalion, 198th Special Forces Regiment, had successfully secured Phan Chu Trinh Road and the southern part of Hoa Binh airport, and they waited there for the regular infantry and tank units to arrive.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, Ray {{directed}} Kanchenjungha. Based on {{his first}} original screenplay, {{it was his first}} film in colour. The film tells of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in Darjeeling, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal. They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid engineer educated in London. He had first conceived shooting the film in a large mansion, but later decided to film it in the famous hill town. He used the many shades of light and mist to reflect the tension in the drama. Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting conditions, a commercial film contingent present {{at the same time in}} Darjeeling failed to shoot a single scene, as they <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to do so in sunshine.|$|E

5|$|Stevens' {{time with}} the Blues would only last one season. In the offseason {{following}} the 1990–91 NHL season, the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils, who, like Stevens the year before, was a restricted free agent, entitling the Devils to compensation. As the Blues still owed first round picks to the Capitals (now five instead of two, as the 1991 pick given up ended up being the 21st pick), other compensation had to be negotiated, and the Blues and Devils could not agree on what the compensation was; the Blues offered goalie Curtis Joseph, forward Rod Brind'Amour, and two draft picks, but the Devils <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> Stevens. The case went to arbitration, and arbitrator Edward Houston awarded Stevens to the Devils as compensation on September 4, 1991.|$|E

He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys {{a majority of the}} lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a spade, a journal of pressed flowers, and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth.

The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother is all around in him in nature.|$|E

5|$|Becoming an {{unrestricted}} free {{agent in the}} off-season, Bertuzzi agreed to a two-year, $8 million contract with the Anaheim Ducks on July 2, 2007. Signing him was Ducks general manager Brian Burke, who had served as the Canucks general manager during Bertuzzi's time in Vancouver. Bertuzzi had reportedly been in negotiations to re-sign with Detroit, but the club <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> a one-year deal. Playing the Red Wings in the Ducks' {{first game of the}} regular season on October 3, 2007, he registered a goal and an assist in a 3–2 shootout loss. In the first month of the 2007–08 campaign, he suffered a concussion and was sidelined for 14 games in October and November 2007. Bertuzzi returned to the lineup in time for the Ducks' away game against the Canucks on November 27, which marked his first NHL game in Vancouver since being traded away. Bertuzzi was received warmly by Canucks fans, as the Ducks lost the game 4–0. Playing in 68 contests over the season, he registered 40 points with Anaheim. Entering the 2008 playoffs as the defending champions, the Ducks were eliminated in the first round four games to two by the Dallas Stars. In six playoff contests, Bertuzzi recorded two assists.|$|E
5|$|No {{sooner had}} Bryan left the state than Governor Bradley {{reversed}} course and began stumping for Taylor. Though he insisted he <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to defend his}} administration from Democratic attacks, Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson suggested that Bradley was seeking to enlist Taylor's support for his anticipated senatorial bid. Bradley kicked off his tour {{of the state in}} Louisville, charging that Democrats had to import an orator for their candidate because all of the state's best men had deserted him. As evidence, he cited Goebel's lack of support from Democrat John G. Carlisle, his former ally, as well as Senator William Lindsay, W. C. P. Breckinridge, John Y. Brown, Theodore Hallum, W. C. Owens, Wat Hardin, and William Stone. He also encouraged blacks not to desert the Republican Party. He contrasted his appointments of blacks to his cabinet with the Democrats' support of the Separate Coach Bill. Bradley and Republican leader (and later governor) Augustus E. Willson toured the state on behalf of the Republican ticket, often drawing crowds larger than those assembled for Taylor.|$|E
5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that I needed a break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out...

5|$|The {{development}} of SAS began in 1966 after North Carolina State University re-hired Anthony Barr to program {{his analysis of}} variance and regression software {{so that it would}} run on IBM System/360 computers. The project was funded by the National Institute of Health and was originally intended to analyze agricultural data to improve crop yields. Barr was joined by student James Goodnight, who developed the software's statistical routines, and the two became project-leaders. In 1968, Barr and Goodnight integrated new multiple regression and analysis of variance routines. In 1972, after issuing the first release of SAS, the project lost its funding. According to Goodnight, this was because NIH <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to fund projects with medical applications. Goodnight continued teaching at the university for a salary of $1 and access to mainframe computers for use with the project, until it was funded by the University Statisticians of the Southern Experiment Stations the following year. John Sall joined the project in 1973 and contributed to the software's econometrics, time series, and matrix algebra. Another early participant, Caroll G. Perkins, contributed to SAS' early programming. Jolayne W. Service and Jane T. Helwig created SAS' first documentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{first story}} is about the opening of Shiva's third eye when he visits Madurai, {{the capital city of}} the Pandya Kingdom, ruled at that time by Shenbagapandian. Shenbagapandian wants to find the answer to a {{question}} posed by his wife— whether the fragrance from a woman's hair is natural or artificial— and announces a reward of 1000gold coins to anyone who can come up with the answer. A poor poet named Dharumi desperately wants the reward and starts to break down in the Meenakshi Amman Temple. Shiva, hearing his cries, {{takes the form of a}} poet and gives Dharumi a poem containing the answer. Overjoyed, Dharumi takes the poem to Shenbagapandian's court and recites it, but Nakkeerar, the court's head poet, claims the poem's meaning is incorrect. On hearing this, Shiva argues with Nakkeerar about the poem's accuracy, burning him to ashes when he refuses to relent. Later, Shiva revives Nakkeerar, and says that he <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> to test his knowledge. Nakkeerar asks the king to give the reward to Dharumi.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the cancellation of}} county cricket in 1914, Fender enlisted in the army, joining the Inns of Court Regiment. Commissioned as a lieutenant in the Royal Fusiliers, Fender disliked the routine of army life. With {{the help of the}} cricketer Pelham Warner, who worked in the War Office, he was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps in 1915. Fender was initially stationed in London, where he was involved in work repelling Zeppelin attacks, before being sent to India in 1916. Soon after his arrival, he became ill with dysentery, possibly cholera and several other diseases. He returned to England to recover but was left weak for much of the following two years. Army doctors were unsure what exactly was wrong with Fender and he remained in their care until 1918. He played some charity cricket in 1917 and 1918, but did not return to light duties with the Royal Flying Corps until the latter year. Just as he seemed to have recovered fully, he fractured his left leg in five places playing football at the end of 1918. He remained on crutches throughout the remainder of 1918 and 1919, missing the resumption of county cricket in 1919. While incapacitated, Fender attempted to gain a place at Caius College, Cambridge, but was turned down owing to the restriction his injury placed upon his cricket, and his desire to concentrate on academic interests to further his business career—the interviewing panel <b>only</b> <b>wanted</b> him as a cricketer. Although he recovered in time to play in the 1920 season, his leg troubled him for the remainder of his career; he was left with a minor limp, and long spells of fielding left him in pain.|$|E
