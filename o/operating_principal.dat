50|$|The great {{majority}} of contemporary spectrometers use a mixture of commercially available and bespoke components which users integrate according to their particular needs. Instruments can be broadly categorised according to their general <b>operating</b> <b>principals.</b> Although rotational transitions can be found across a very broad region of the electromagnetic spectrum, fundamental physical constraints exist on the operational bandwidth of instrument components. It is often impractical and costly to switch to measurements within an entirely different frequency region.

30|$|The {{second major}} {{regulatory}} consideration {{was how to}} document changes to our manufacturing process with the FDA. Our original ANDA included use of both Ag and Nb targets to produce fluorine- 18 and therefore did not represent a change to our process from a regulatory point of view. In contrast, our original ANDA only contained production of FDG using a TRACERLabMX-FDG. Pursuant to section VII.D. 1 of the FDA Guidance for Industry: Changes to Approved NDA or ANDA, for drug products changes to equipment of the same design and <b>operating</b> <b>principal</b> is considered a minor change that can be documented in the next annual report submitted for the ANDA (FDA Guidance for Industry 2004). The FASTLab 2 has the same design and <b>operating</b> <b>principal</b> as the TRACERLabMX-FDG identified in our original ANDA submission, and both systems are from the same manufacturer. Moreover, no additional changes {{were made to the}} manufacturing process, quality control, formulation specifications, aseptic processing, sterilization of the final product or labeling and, as stated above, consistency with the RLD was maintained. As such, we completed verification batches during Performance Qualification (PQ) of the FASTLab 2 modules prior to beginning clinical delivery of FDG to establish that product made using the FASTLab 2 met or exceeded all established quality specifications and was identical to that prepared on the TRACERLabMX-FDG module. We documented the equipment change in our 2017 annual report, presenting a side-by-side comparison of the verification data from both synthesis modules to the FDA, and have been manufacturing FDG under our ANDA using FASTLab 2 for about 18  months.|$|E
40|$|A {{medium scale}} {{hydrogen}} liquefaction plant is presented and its efficiency analyzed {{on the basis}} of exergy. In a first step, the <b>operating</b> <b>principal</b> of a medium scale hydrogen liquefier is presented. The liquefaction plant consists of a compressor system and a vacuum insulated cold box where the liquefaction takes place. In the cold box, the refrigeration capacity required to liquefy the hydrogen is provided by a hydrogen refrigerant cycle and a liquid nitrogen pre-cooling step. The cooling capacity is extracted from high pressure hydrogen through oil bearing turbines and cooling takes place in aluminum plate fin heat exchangers. Secondly, an extensive exergy analysis of the liquefaction process considering the exergy losses of each step will be presented. The exergy losses in hydrogen liquefaction are caused within the liquefier itself, for example in the compressor system or the turbines, but also occur during filling procedure of the liquid hydrogen in trailers, or distribution of the liquefied hydrogen. Within this paper the efficiency of the liquefaction process from gaseous hydrogen supply to the delivery of liquid hydrogen into the storage tank will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|A typical {{operating}} temperature {{of a solid}} oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is quite high above 750 °C and affects the thermomechanical behavior of the cell. Thermal stresses may cause microstructural instability and sub-critical cracking. Therefore, a joint analysis by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational structural mechanics based on the finite element method (FEM) was carried out to analyze thermal stresses in a planar SOFC and to predict potential failure locations in the cell. A full numerical model {{was based on the}} coupling of thermo-fluid model with the thermo-mechanical model. Based on a temperature distribution from the thermo-fluid model, stress distribution including the von Mises stress, shear stress as well as the <b>operating</b> <b>principal</b> stress were derived in the thermo-mechanical model. The FEM calculations were performed under different working conditions of the planar SOFC. The highest total stress was noticed at the lower operating voltage of 0. 3 V, while the lowest total stress was determined at the voltage of 0. 7 V. The obtained stress distributions allowed a better understanding of details of internal processes occurring within the SOFC and provided helpful guidance in the optimization of a new SOFC design...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we analyze {{infinite}} discrete-time games between hydraulic {{and thermal}} power operators in the wholesale electricity market. Two types of games are considered: Cournot closed-loop game and Stackelberg closed-loop game. We consider a deregulated electrical industry where certain demand is satisfied by hydraulic and thermal technologies. The hydraulic operator decides the production in each season of each period that maximizes {{the sum of}} expected profit from power generation {{with respect to the}} stochastic dynamic constraint on the water stored in the dam, the environmental constraint and the non-negative output constraint. In contrast, the thermal plant is operated with quadratic cost function, with respect to the capacity production constraint and the non negativity output constraint. This paper is devoted to the numerical computations of equilibrium strategies and value function in each kind of games. We show that under imperfect competition, the hydraulic operator has a strategic storage of water in the peak season. Then, we quantify the strategic inter annual and intra annual water transfer in the both games and we compare the numerical results. Under Cournot closed-loop game, we show that the traditional principle of least-cost operation is inverted at the binding capacity constraint of thermal operator. Finally, under Stackelberg closed-loop game, we show that thermal operator can restrict the hydraulic output without compensation. The technical complementarities and Stackelberg competition may distorted the traditional "merit order " <b>operating</b> <b>principal...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{hydraulically}} driven wheel loader, {{which has a}} flexible crane mounted {{in front of the}} machine, has been under research. Flexible boom was excited with a operator given commands, which caused the system vibrate due to different sources of flexibility. The goal was to test cylinder load pressure as a estimate of boom vibrations {{and use it as a}} feedback signal to suppress the system oscillations. Therefore, a simulation of wheel loader was created, which replicates real four wheel loader located at the facilities of Laboratory of Automation and Hydraulics. The first simulator represents a traditional hydraulical system, which has proportional directional valves and variable displacement pump with load sensing functions. A simple controller with pressure feedback vibration damping was designed and tested with different scenarios. After promising results, another simulator was created, which emulates the existing wheel loader better. This experimental wheel loader, called as IHA-machine, has different directional valves and pump <b>operating</b> <b>principal.</b> For working hydraulics, a digital flow control unit was installed. As a power source, IHA-machine has a variable displacement pump-motor, which has a possibility to collect energy from hydraulic system. Updated simulation version was tested with a controller, which was able to control flow and supply pressure. Vibration damping was added to the flow controller and tested in simulator. After this, the same controller was also tested in real IHA-machine. The results showed, that load pressure as an estimate of system vibrations is a promising way to damping the oscillations that exist in the application. However, the simulation results couldn't be repeated at the same level in the real machine. The control of boom with flow in digital valve environment appeared to be a difficult task when vibration damping was implemented. Regardless, some oscillation canceling was still achieved...|$|E
40|$|A new {{approach}} to ultrasonic NDE called spread-spectrum ultrasonic evaluation (SSUE) is investigated. It regards the ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation as an acoustic-impulse-response estimation and characterization problem. This problem has been compared with the analogous problems of radio-detection-and-ranging from communications field and the seismic exploration problem of geophysics. Out of the various options for the impulse response estimation, the continuous pseudorandom signal correlation method {{has been shown to}} be the optimum for peak-power limited systems such as the ultrasonic NDE systems. The problem of self-noise and its consequences in pseudorandom correlation systems is investigated, followed by the development of various optimum and sub-optimum approaches to self-noise elimination. After verifying the theoretical results through computer simulations, a lab-grade SSUE instrument was developed and analyzed. Also, a new, efficient method for the implementation of DSP-based correlator is developed. The application of SSUE technique to various practical NDE situations like, flaw detection, velocity/thickness measurements, attenuation measurement, global integrity assessment, etc., was investigated through various laboratory experiments. It is concluded that the SSUE technique holds great promise for all ultrasonic NDE applications where high signal attenuation results into the loss of signal-to-noise ratios beyond workable limits;SSUE employs a non-traditional approach to ultrasonic NDE that makes it more robust and powerful. One significant feature of the SSUE technique is that it overcomes the maximum average power limitation of the existing techniques. Conventional pulsed ultrasonic NDE systems are peak power limited by the transducer breakdown voltage and the average power is limited by the narrow pulse duration which is important to maintain good resolution. In certain NDE applications there are factors other than the transducer peak power limitation, which limit the amplitude of the transmitted signal. In case of medical ultrasound devices, for example, the peak power limit arises from the risk of causing tissue damage. For such kind of applications, SSUE has a direct solution to increasing the average power while maintaining the resolution. Ultrasonic NDE instrument in a field or industrial environment is subject to all kinds of acoustic and electromagnetic interferences. This results into a degradation of instrument sensitivity and reliability. SSUE technique, by virtue of its robust <b>operating</b> <b>principal,</b> is capable of interference rejection to a much larger extent...|$|E
