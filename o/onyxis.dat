40|$|Some mycotoxins {{are among}} the most toxic natural products. They are {{metabolites}} produced by food-borne and feed-borne moulds. Dirty and soiled nails, and contaminated or infected <b>onyxis</b> by these specific moulds can be the origin of oral contamination and mycotoxicosis. Hence, nail cleaning, correct hygiene and treatment of mould onychomycosis have a potentially great impact on health...|$|E
40|$|The Afrotropical banchine fauna (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) {{comprises}} 12 genera. One of these, Cryptopimpla Taschenberg, 1863, is a predominately {{northern hemisphere}} genus represented by 47 described species of which only one is {{known from the}} Afrotropical region. We describe nine new species of this rare Afrotropical genus: C. elongatus sp. n., C. fernkloofensis sp. n., C. goci sp. n., C. hantami sp. n., C. kogelbergensis sp. n., C. neili sp. n., C. <b>onyxi</b> sp. n., C. parslactis sp. n., and C. zwarti sp. n. All the Afrotropical species are only known from South Africa. Online interactive Lucid keys to the nine Cryptopimpla species are available at: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We {{have treated}} 48 cases of onychomycosis (of which 37 {{were caused by}} dermatophytes, 10 by yeasts and one by Scopulariopsis brevicaulis) with 200 mg {{ketoconazole}} daily. We obtained recovery in 65 p. 100 of the cases of <b>onyxis</b> caused by dermatophytes and in 80 p. 100 of the cases of onychomycosis due to Candida. The one patient presenting an infection with Scopulariopsis brevicaulis recovered in 13 months. The average duration necessary to obtain complete recovery was 6 1 / 2 months for onychomycosis of the hands due to dermatophytes and 12 1 / 2 months for those of the feet. Perionyxis due to Candida needed 2 months of treatment with this drug, however 6 months of treatment were necessary to obtain recovery for onycholysis due to Candida. Biological tests remained normal and the side-effects were minimal and essentially gastrointestinal in our study. Ketoconazole is an effective treatment for onychomycosis: it is active against the different mycotic agents infecting nails and well tolerated by the patient. Several minor effects such as itching, nausea, headache and more serious reactions such as erythrodermia and hepatitis have been reported. Regular control and biological tests are therefore necessary. Patients with other diseases should avoid the use of ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis.
