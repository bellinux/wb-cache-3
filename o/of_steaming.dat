The US inquiry began on 19April under the chairmanship of Senator William Alden Smith, while the British inquiry commenced in London under Lord Mersey on 2May 1912. They reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate; Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings; the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed; and the collision was the direct result <b>of</b> <b>steaming</b> into a danger area at too high a speed.
