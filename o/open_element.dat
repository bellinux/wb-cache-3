The {{aim is to}} show quantitatively {{the significance of the}} <b>opened</b> parasitic <b>elements</b> that affect the {{characteristics of}} the antenna system, and hence cannot be ignored as the radius of the elements becomes thick and the interelement spacing becomes small. The effect of a parallel shorted parasitic element upon a nearby dipole antenna has been reported by A h and Warren [11. On the other hand, the case where <b>opened</b> parasitic <b>elements</b> are used has not been treated numerically so far, as the <b>opened</b> <b>elements</b> have usually been considered to affect the characteristics of the antenna system very little. Harrington has pointed out in his paper [2] that an <b>opened</b> parasitic <b>element</b> would act as a scatterer.

40|$|Uniform excess {{pressure}} dike model We assume that uniform {{excess pressure}} acts everywhere {{on the wall}} of the magma body, with no shear traction. This uniform-pressure boundary condition is physically more plausible than a kinematic displacement boundary condition if we can assume that low-viscous fluid such as basaltic magma is at hydrostatic (or magmastatic) pressure equilibrium. Magma at depth migrates commonly in the form of a crack. We divide the crack into <b>elements</b> that either <b>open</b> or remained closed. The <b>open</b> <b>elements</b> define the geometry of the crack. The uniform pressure boundary condition is enforced on all the <b>open</b> <b>elements.</b> In an inversion various combinations of <b>open</b> and closed <b>elements</b> are selected, and for each combination (i. e. crack geometry), the opening distribution of the entire crack is uniquely determined by a boundary element calculation under the uniform excess pressure (1). Figure S 1 shows an example of this procedure. The crack (dike or sill) plane is divided into many dislocation elements (Fig. S 1 A), and then <b>open</b> <b>elements,</b> which are indicated as white, are randomly selected (Fig. S 1 B). A uniform excess pressure is then applied to those <b>open</b> <b>elements</b> and the amount of opening at each element is calculated using a boundary element method (Fig. S 1 C).

40|$|Patterns of {{biodiversity}} {{are influenced by}} habitat features at multiple spatial scales, yet few studies have used a multi-scale approach to examine ground-dwelling beetle diversity patterns. We trapped and quantified ground-dwelling beetle assemblages at two spatial scales: (1) microhabitat <b>elements,</b> represented by <b>open</b> ground, ground under trees and ground next to logs and (2) macrohabitat, represented by three vegetation types in a box-gum grassy woodland in south-eastern Australia. Species richness and evenness was highest at samples from under trees and lowest at samples in the open. At the macrohabitat scale, species richness and evenness did not differ among vegetation types. Assemblage composition was significantly different between trees, logs and <b>open</b> <b>elements.</b> Assemblage composition was different only between vegetation types with contrasting high and low shrub cover. Estimation of true species richness indicated assemblages at logs may have a higher number of species compared to trees and <b>open</b> <b>elements,</b> and implied greater spatial heterogeneity in assemblages at logs. Significant spatial autocorrelation in beetle assemblages was detected for logs at up to 400 m, but not for ground under trees or in the open. In agreement with previous studies, a mix of vegetation types at the macrohabitat scale is important for beetle conservation. Assemblage composition, however, {{appears to be more}} closely linked with habitat elements at the microhabitat scale, where logs support a high diversity of beetle species. This strongly supports the idea that restoring logs to box-gum grassy woodlands would be useful for increasing beetle species richness and assemblage heterogeneity. Crown Copyright © 2009...|$|R
