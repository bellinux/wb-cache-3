25|$|In Indiana, county sheriffs {{are elected}} to office and {{limited by the}} state {{constitution}} to serving {{no more than two}} four-year terms consecutively. Indiana sheriffs are empowered to make the arrest of persons who commit an offense within the sheriff's view, and take them before a court of the county having jurisdiction, and detain them in custody until the cause of the arrest has been investigated. They possess a general power to suppress breaches of the peace, calling the power of the county to the sheriff's aid if necessary; pursue and jail felons; serve and execute judicial process; attend and preserve order in all courts of the county; take care of the county jail and the prisoners there; take photographs, fingerprints, and <b>other</b> <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> as the sheriff shall prescribe of persons taken into custody for felonies or misdemeanors. They are required to provide an accounting to the state department of correction concerning the costs of incarcerating prisoners in the county.|$|E

One specific application for this transmitter is as a distress transmitter where a conventional, legislated audio tone modulated signal is transmitted followed {{first by the}} acquisition signal and then the information bearing signal, the information bearing signal being encoded with, among <b>other</b> things, vehicle <b>identification</b> <b>data.</b> The acquistion signal enables a receiver to acquire the information bearing signal where the received signal is low and/or where the received signal has a low signal-to-noise ratio {{in an environment where}} there are multiple signals in the same frequency band as the information bearing signal...|$|R

30|$|To this end, {{the edge}} router creates 42 bytes {{signature}} value (size of ECDSA digital signature with 160 bits elliptical curve key) by applying ECDSA signing algorithm to 60 bits <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> plus 13 bytes flow ID. This 42 bytes signature should also {{transfer to the}} destination along with 60 bits of <b>identification</b> <b>data.</b> Obviously, {{it is not a}} good idea to embed 42 bytes of data to the IP header because embedding 42 bytes data and 60 bits <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> to 32 bits marking field requires at least 13 packets, while looking at Table  6 shows that K[*]=[*] 13 has a bad TR (64 % to 88 %). So we decided to add 42 bytes ECDSA digital signature to the end of the K th packet payload of each flow. It is assumed that when this system is used it would be known that DFM is using ECDSA signing algorithm.|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{explicit}} certificates {{are made}} up of three parts: <b>identification</b> <b>data,</b> a public key and a digital signature which binds the public key to the user’s <b>identification</b> <b>data</b> (ID). The digital certificate is created by a trusted third party and its signature can be independently verified by anyone in the network. The public key, ID and digital signature are distinct data elements which make up the physical size of the certificate. Conventional certificates can get very large. For example, a standard X.509 certificate is on the order of 1KB in size (~8000 bits).|$|R
