5000|$|Lance-corporal <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> (LCoH) is an {{appointment}} {{unique to the}} Household Cavalry of the British Army, equivalent to lance sergeant in the Foot Guards. It was introduced in 1971. On promotion to corporal, an NCO is automatically appointed lance-corporal <b>of</b> <b>horse,</b> so that the rank structure effectively goes straight from lance-corporal to lance-corporal <b>of</b> <b>horse,</b> and then to corporal <b>of</b> <b>horse.</b> However, lance corporals <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> are still addressed as [...] "Corporal".|$|R
50|$|The 3rd Troop <b>of</b> <b>Horse</b> Guards {{was formed}} in 1658 as the 2nd, or The Duke of York's Troop <b>of</b> <b>Horse</b> Guards from {{followers}} of Charles II in exile in Holland.

5|$|Horse {{improvement}} as a goal, {{and horse}} breeding as an enterprise, date to medieval times; King John imported a hundred Flemish stallions, Edward III imported fifty Spanish stallions, and various priories and abbeys owned stud farms. Laws were passed restricting and prohibiting horse exports {{and for the}} culling <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> considered undesirable in type. By the 17th century, specific horse breeds were being recorded as suitable for specific purposes, and new horse-drawn agricultural machinery was being designed. Fast coaches pulled by teams <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> with Thoroughbred blood could make use of improved roads, and coaching inn proprietors owned hundreds <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> to support the trade. Steam power took over the role <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> in agriculture from the mid-19th century, but horses continued {{to be used in}} warfare for almost another 100 years, as their speed and agility over rough terrain remained unequalled. Working horses had all but disappeared from Britain by the 1980s, and today horses in Britain are kept almost wholly for recreational purposes.|$|E

5|$|The Shire has an {{enormous}} capacity for pulling weight. In 1924, at a British exhibition, a pair <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> was estimated to have pulled a starting load equal to 45 tons, although an exact number could not be determined as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the dynamometer. Working in slippery footing, the same pair <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> pulled 16.5 tons at a later exhibition.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> in warfare {{occurred}} over 5,000 years ago. The earliest evidence <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> ridden in warfare dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000BC. A Sumerian illustration of warfare from 2500BC depicts {{some type of}} equine pulling wagons. By 1600BC, improved harness and chariot designs made chariot warfare common throughout the Ancient Near East, and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350BC. As formal cavalry tactics replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360BC, the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology, including {{the invention of the}} saddle, the stirrup, and later, the horse collar.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} mainly used {{horses for}} logistical support; {{they were better}} than mechanized vehicles at traveling through deep mud and over rough terrain. Horses were used for reconnaissance and for carrying messengers, as well as pulling artillery, ambulances, and supply wagons. The presence <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> often increased morale among the soldiers at the front, but the animals contributed to disease and poor sanitation in camps, caused by their manure and carcasses. The value <b>of</b> <b>horses,</b> and the increasing difficulty of replacing them, was such that by 1917 some troops {{were told that the}} loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than the loss of a human soldier. Ultimately, the blockade of Germany prevented the Central Powers from importing horses to replace those lost, which contributed to Germany's defeat. By the end of the war, even the well-supplied U.S. Army was short <b>of</b> <b>horses.</b>|$|E

5|$|The use <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> in World War I {{marked a}} {{transitional}} {{period in the}} evolution of armed conflict. Cavalry units were initially considered essential offensive elements of a military force, but {{over the course of the}} war, the vulnerability <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> to modern machine gun and artillery fire reduced their utility on the battlefield. This paralleled the development of tanks, which would ultimately replace cavalry in shock tactics. While the perceived value of the horse in war changed dramatically, horses still played a significant role throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|About 900years ago, {{attempts}} were made to introduce eastern blood into the Icelandic, resulting in a degeneration of the stock. In 982AD the Icelandic Althing (parliament) passed laws prohibiting the importation <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> into Iceland, thus ending crossbreeding.

5|$|Horses {{have been}} used in warfare for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> in warfare was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective.

5|$|In 1986, {{the park}} sold off {{a large number}} <b>of</b> <b>horses,</b> {{including}} herd stallions, and released several stallions with outside bloodlines into the herds.

Later, a second, short-lived, registry was begun by another organization in Minnesota. In 2009, the North Dakota Badlands Horse Registry was created, which registers the slightly different type <b>of</b> <b>horses</b> which have been removed from the park in recent years. Today, the park conducts regular thinning of the herd to keep numbers between 70 and 110, and the excess horses are sold off.|$|E

50|$|The {{domestication}} <b>of</b> the <b>horse</b> had {{a wide-ranging}} {{effect on the}} steppe cultures, and Anthony has done field-work on this topic. Bit wear is a sign <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> riding, and the dating <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> teeth that had signs of bit wear gives clues for the dating of the appearance <b>of</b> <b>horse</b> riding. The presence <b>of</b> domesticated <b>horses</b> in the steppe cultures was an important clue for Marija Gimbutas {{in the development of}} her Kurgan hypothesis. According to Anthony, horseback riding may have appeared as early as 4200 BCE, and horse artifacts show up in greater amounts after 3500 BCE. Horseback riding greatly increased the mobility of herders, allowing for greater herds, but also leading to increased warfare because of the need for additional grazing land.|$|R
