More than half a million jobs had salaries worth five minimum wages (about MXN$10,000 per month) and there was a 22% increase in jobs with salaries greater than 20 minimum wages.|$|E

I began with a class ring that I {{remember}} reading in the script that she'd worn. Starting with that, I traced Pamela back to my own high school days in the early 1940s. So it's 1944, a very conservative time, and Pamela has a steady boyfriend. They have sex—which is very bad of course—and Pamela soon gets pregnant with Jason. The father takes off and when Pamela tells her parents, they disown her because having... babies out of wedlock isn't something that good girls do. I think she took Jason and raised him the best she could, but {{he turned out to}} be a very strange boy. [...] lots of odd jobs and one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>jobs</b> was as a cook at a summer camp. Then Jason drowns and her whole world collapses. What were the counselors doing instead of watching Jason? They were having sex, which is the way that she got into trouble.

But, ye goddesses of Art! listen to the monstrosity he expects me to paint. He wants himself in the centre of the canvas, of course. He is to be painted as Jupiter sitting on Olympus, with the clouds at his feet. At one side of him stands George Washington, in full regimentals, with his hand on the president's shoulder. An angel with outstretched wings hovers overhead, and is placing a laurel wreath on the president's head, crowning him--Queen of the May, I suppose. In the background is to be cannon, more angels and soldiers.

30|$|Lastly, we {{hypothesize that}} the use of SOC at work mediates the {{relationship}} between learning and developmental opportunities/job control and work engagement, such {{that there will be a}} significant indirect effect of these job resources on work engagement through employees SOC use. Drawing on action theory that describes individual action regulation in the workplace, we argue that job resources at work affect individuals not until these conditions are internally represented in the job-incumbents (Frese and Zapf 1994; Hacker 2003). In regard to the job features under study, not only the mere presence of job resources should be relevant for work engagement, but the effective individual use <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>job</b> resources in terms of individual behaviour, i.e., SOC use. In regard to the interplay of job resources, SOC, and work engagement, SOC strategies are assumed to act as an intervening variable, mediating indirect effects of job resources on work engagement. Results from a previous investigation in nursing personnel provide preliminary support for this mediator hypothesis (Müller et al. 2012).|$|R

Control of postoperative pain proved to be satisfactory; 72 hours after surgery, 26. 1 per cent of patients no longer felt any pain, whereas 54. 4 per cent had slight pain without the need for painkillers; on Day 7, 92. 8 per cent felt no pain at all.

[Methods] The subjects’ subjective physical condition, exercise status, smoking status, and drinking status were investigated, and precise physical measurements, cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, reflexes, and reactions were measured. [Results] Subjectively, the physical condition and exercise status <b>of</b> <b>those</b> with office <b>jobs</b> were superior to <b>those</b> <b>of</b> production <b>job</b> workers.
