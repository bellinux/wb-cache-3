50|$|Casters used in <b>and</b> around <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> <b>ovens</b> must {{withstand}} extreme heat. General purpose casters cannot survive excessive heat because tread materials, lubricants {{and other}} critical components can fail. For example, at 200 degrees F, common resilient tread materials are {{at or above}} their functional temperature limits. High temperature casters employ special lubricants and materials that can withstand higher heat. Additionally, for very high temperatures, special sleeve bearings may be used that have no lubricant whatsoever.|$|R

40|$|Chinese {{translation}} of the Using Waste Heat for External Processes fact sheet. Provides {{suggestions on how to}} use waste heat in industrial applications. The temperature of exhaust gases from fuel-fired industrial processes depends mainly on the process temperature and the waste heat recovery method. Figure 1 shows the heat lost in exhaust gases at various exhaust gas temperatures and percentages of excess air. Energy from gases exhausted from higher temperature processes (primary processes) can be recovered and used for lower temperature processes (secondary processes). One example is to generate steam using waste heat boilers for the fluid heaters used in petroleum crude processing. In addition, many companies install heat exchangers on the exhaust stacks of <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> <b>ovens</b> to produce hot water or to generate hot air for space heating...|$|R

25|$|The {{particle}} size distribution of milled coal depends partly on the rank of the coal, which determines its brittleness, and on the handling, crushing and milling it has undergone. Generally coal is utilised in <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> coking <b>ovens</b> at a certain size, so the crushability of the coal must be determined and its behaviour quantified. It is necessary to know these data before coal is mined, so that suitable crushing machinery can be designed to optimise the {{particle size}} for transport and use.|$|R

50|$|Although {{these days}} of rapid {{industrialisation}} and rapid growth of population were days of ignorance and squalor, they also saw the 19th century drive for education and religion. A National School was built and opened in 1841; St.Paul's Church was built at Spennymoor in 1858 and all through these formative years the Non-conformist churches combined welfare work with prayer. An era of prosperity dawned in the 1860s and 1870s when the miners were earning £1 per day. Spennymoor was ringed with collieries, black <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> coke <b>ovens</b> <b>and</b> the new prosperity showed itself {{in the building of}} better houses and in the opening of Co-operative stores.

40|$|In the {{industrial}} sector approximately 30 % of the fuels used are consumed by furnaces. On top of that, 10 % of {{the industrial}} electricity demand is used in furnaces. Prior studies on industrial <b>furnaces</b> <b>and</b> <b>ovens</b> have concluded that potential for efficiency improvements lie between 10 and 40 % depending on the sector and the application. Within our paper we will describe an approach to assess the future energy demand of industrial furnaces. In addition, the corresponding CO 2 -emissions and saving potentials will be determined. The timeframe of our analysis is from 2015 to 2030 considering the EU- 28 countries and Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. To show the application of our methodology, we will present the glass sector as a case study. There, we will analyse the saving options corresponding to the furnaces used in glassmaking processes. For the purpose of our study we have built a proprietary bottom-up simulation model for energy demand. We will present the underlying methodology and data of our modelling approach. The dataset represents a detailed representation of the EUs glass production sites. Therefore, {{we are able to}} model the diffusion of the efficiency technologies on a site level. In parallel, we will present an approach to derive a dataset from sources like the ETS register. Finally, we will present the results of our modelling approach and discuss the potential impacts of energy efficiency technologies in the glass sector. Furthermore we will show the transferability of our approach to other sectors...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{recovery}} combustion systems {{operating in}} the steel industry, energy is provided by boilers burning residual gases of blast <b>furnace</b> <b>and</b> coke <b>oven.</b> To help understand combustion of this particular type of fuels, a numerical study is conducted where the major chemical properties of steel gas ﬂames are collected. The chemical composition of representative fuel and oxidizer steel gas is varied over a large range in calculations using detailed chemistry and complex transport properties. The chemical equilibrium compositions, premixed ﬂame speeds and diffusion ﬂame extinction strain rates are determined. The advantages and shortcomings {{of the use of}} vitiated air emerge, and its introduction into the boiler appears as an interesting alternative to reduce NOx emission. The detailed information obtained with laminar ﬂame calculations is also introduced in ﬂamelet turbulent combustion modeling. Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations of a test case burner are performed and some comparisons between numerical predictions and experimental results are presented. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
