ACCESS Getting people and goods to the central area is one of the most important goals which must be achieved to develop a successful Central Business District. The guiding principle which is used in planning the central area is to provide efficient and direct vehicular access to the central from all parts of the region. In developing this proposal we will also try to (1) avOTO routing t hrough-traff ic downtown streets, (2) develop distribution ring route to spread the vehicles entering the central ong several entrances (3) develop connections between the ring route and major thoroughfares the corners. !:. £ dis courage through-traffic !!. 2 !. driving into the center of the CliD. It is desirable to separate the several different types of traffic present in any system. The Key principles of cnD access planning are: Do not mix different types of traffic; provide bypass routes for through traffic; provide a CliD distributor sy"s-tem; provide corner access to the distributor system _ and, provide connections to existing street pattern. There must always be connections between major elements of the system. 8 Y p' [...] S- ::(ACc;si=£;;":. c" i.

Connections in the central area are of four types: (1) Between establishments, (2) Between diff erent functional elements in the area, as in the case;̇here employees also become shoppers, (3) For many services requirin easy coverage of t he cent ral area (professional activities, office equipment servicing, etc.), (4) Bet;̇een central area activities and transportation terminals, including parking f acilities. Important connections should be established by the arrangement of land uses. coordinated system pedestrianways at-and above-grade, an expanded system of pedestrian arcades through blocks shou d be developed. A third obj ective in arranging connections· is the development of complementary activities in a vertical direction, connected by elevators, escalators and ramps, to reduce time and dis­tance. It is very important that not only persons and vehicles have good con­nections but that there be a development of systems for distributing goods and equipment, from a single loading area, if possible.

To achieve compactness in t he central area it is desi rable t o (1) encourage high overall density within the main retail and office districts. This is the area in which the need for efficient communication and personal contact is greatest, (2) hold the scale of the main retail district so t hat it does not exceed desirable pedeStrian walking distances, (3) hold the s cale of the main office and service district to one-half mile on a side, (4) substantially lower densities outside retail office distri cts ex­cept in specific loca. ions, (5) compactness. !!!.. !. design technique to highlight special open' spaces and (6) achieve control of compactness chiefly t hrough the use of permissive zoning and floor ratio controls.

In groupinp. the uses or activi ties the principle of cumulative attraction is also important. Two activities that are compatible will do better side £ 2 side, other things being equal. In developing a plan to organize the various land use activiti es at least three arrangements are possible: (1) Related activities could be arranged to­'!etllcr in compact groups clearly separated from each other. (To a degree this i s a natural condition), (2) Activities could be mixed with little regard to grouping those with common characteristics or (3) The distinction can be made be tween activities which function best when grouped and those which function best when dispersed, and a plan be developed to acconunodate each. TIle development of the "best" plan should be guided by the several st ate­ments which follow:. (1) distinction shoul;d be made between those activities which function best when grouped and those which function best when in dis­pe rsed locations, (2) broad groupings £f compatible activities should achieved controlled by some sort of permissive zoning or planned area development, (f <b>or</b> <b>example,</b> <b>the</b> main retail district), (3) Smaller grouoings which cannot be directly controlled should E!:. encouraged through land ac­quisiti on, and coordinated development. (4) Special attention should be Given to maintaining physical continuity between mutually supporting activities (for example, retail store fronts should not be interrupted by office, church, parking or other non-shopping activities) -.

Each of these types of parking has several criterion which guide the development of that,type of parking. ' Long term parking: located at the periphery of the area. concentrated in large facilities. in direct contact with major vehicle entry points; dis­tributed according to major directions of fl ow. and be e 6 sentially self supporting at relatively low cost to the user. Employee parkins for executi ves and others requiring the mid-day use of their cars should be: convenient for the users even to the extent of being within the building. limited in quantit y. of sufficiently high fee t o meet the relatively high cost of development. Short term or patron parking should' be: (1) conveniently located in relation to the downtown areas they serve -even to the extent of havin di rect access to places of business.

The desire to drive an individual automobile to the central area is great. However, to better achieve the goals of downtown development an efficient public transit sys'tem must be developed. Efficient, convenient, and comfortable public transit must be maintained as an essential element of the transportation system, providing access to and circulation within the central area. The suggested goals which will aid transit service and its use to and within the central area include: maximum accommodation employee trips by transit to effectively reduce peak-hour vehicular traffic, special design features in streets 1 £ accommodate surface transit vehiclesi (transit malls, transit lanes, special ramps), transit facilities should serve ' their own distributors ££ passengers££ eliminate transfers, the focusing of all lines on a small, readily identi­fiable area where access to all or most of the system can be readily and naturally found (e. g. a transit mall on Superior Street a place where All lines move in one direction or the other.) and land uses should be located to capitalize on transit as well as maximize the market for transit.

I f the assumption is made that the vehicular traffic which finally enters t he CBD is f ree of vehicles which only use the streets there 8 S a "short cut" we can then deal with the CBD destined vehicles as a part of the central area system. At this time we put into this system the other elements, namely, pedestrians, service vehicles and transit vehicles. The basic principle of central circulation is that the system should provide of movement within central !!!! and should minimize conflicts between different forms £i movement s uch pedestrians, automobiles, transit vehicles and service vehicles. In developing a circulation system the following are also desirable attributes and be developed as a part of t he system. There should be in the circu­lation system: directness to avoid round-about travel, consistent pattern when intermixing one and two-way streets, the ability to circulate around those blocks which are high traffic generators, separation as much as possible of the routes used by various types of traf f i c, e. g. second level walkways, transit streets, underground delivery, parking on any major transportation elements, and emergency vehicle access to all parts of the central area.
