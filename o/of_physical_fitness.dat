5|$|In 1933, {{he scored}} 834 runs but his average fell to 21.94 {{and he never}} again {{averaged}} over 23 in any season in which he played regularly. Owing to his increasing weight and lack <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>fitness,</b> he found batting much harder. As his physique declined, {{he was unable to}} produce the same batting feats he had managed previously. In the field, although still catching effectively, his inability to chase the ball meant he fielded closer to the batsmen; he also took fewer catches. In both 1934 and 1935, he averaged around 22 with the bat and scored under 800 runs. In 1935, he scored his final first-class century, against Somerset, having not reached the landmark since 1931. Team-mates and observers noticed that in the final years of his career, Chapman frequently left the field during matches, and they suspected he was drinking in the pavilion.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{present study}} aimed: (1) {{to test the}} {{associations}} <b>of</b> overall <b>physical</b> <b>fitness</b> and subjective well-being with fibromyalgia severity and (2) {{to determine whether the}} combination <b>of</b> overall <b>physical</b> <b>fitness</b> and subjective well-being is associated with fibromyalgia severity among adult women patients. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 424 participants from Andalusia, southern Spain. Overall <b>physical</b> <b>fitness</b> and the components of subjective well-being (positive affect, negative affect and cognitive well-being), and fibromyalgia severity were assessed using the Functional Senior <b>Physical</b> <b>Fitness</b> Test Battery, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: Overall <b>physical</b> <b>fitness</b> (β = -. 23), positive affect (β = -. 18), negative affect (β =. 26), and cognitive well-being (β = -. 18) were all associated with fibromyalgia severity. The patients with the highest overall <b>physical</b> <b>fitness</b> and increased subjective well-being reported ~ 15 % lower fibromyalgia severity than those with the lowest fitness and poorest subjective well-being (Cohen's d > 1. 0). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that higher levels <b>of</b> overall <b>physical</b> <b>fitness</b> and subjective well-being are independently associated with lower fibromyalgia severity. Moreover, patients with higher overall <b>physical</b> <b>fitness</b> and increased subjective well-being (high positive affect, low negative affect, or high cognitive well-being) reported lower fibromyalgia severity than those with low levels <b>of</b> overall <b>physical</b> <b>fitness</b> and subjective well-being...|$|R

25|$|Module 1 assesses a candidate's level <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>fitness,</b> {{motivation}} and suitability to progress on towards further modules (2-5) of the SOFQ course {{similar to the}} previous selection course. Candidates must pass a series of fitness assessments, map reading and individual navigation assessments, claustrophobia, water confidence, and psychometric testing. The final phase of Module 1 includes individual navigation exercises with set weights over unknown distances and completion times which can be over 250km, culminating in an additional 65km cross-country march carrying a 65lb combat load in the Dublin & Wicklow mountain range. On average candidates get between four and five hours sleep per a night. Officer and senior NCO candidates are subjected to separate, rigorous scrutiny of their planning and decision-making skills to determine the suitability. The length of Module 1 is 3 weeks similar to the previous selection course length. Typically 85% of candidates fail Module 1. Between 2000 and 2005, approximately 240 attempted selection, including a female, with 50 successful.|$|E

25|$|Other {{studies have}} shown that a high resting heart rate is {{associated}} with an increase in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic disease. A faster resting heart rate is associated with shorter life expectancy and is considered a strong risk factor for heart disease and heart failure, independent of level <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>fitness.</b> Specifically, a resting heart rate above 65 beats per minute has been shown to have a strong independent effect on premature mortality; every 10 beats per minute increase in resting heart rate {{has been shown to be}} associated with a 10–20% increase in risk of death. In one study, men with no evidence of heart disease and a resting heart rate of more than 90 beats per minute had a five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Similarly, another study found that men with resting heart rates of over 90 beats per minute had an almost two-fold increase in risk for cardiovascular disease mortality; in women it was associated with a three-fold increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} Test and ODI series involving Sri Lanka were {{overshadowed by}} a series of spiteful clashes. The Tests were won 3–0 by the Australians with heavy margins of an innings, ten wickets and 148 runs respectively. Taylor's highlight being a 96 in the First Test at Perth as he compiled 159 runs at 39.75. He also made his 100th Test catch during the series. After accusations of ball tampering were levelled against the tourists in the First Test, leading spinner Muttiah Muralitharan was no-balled seven times in the Second Test, and during the ODI series, the Sri Lankans accused Taylor's men of cheating. The season hit a low point with the Sri Lankans which saw the teams refuse to shake hands {{at the end of the}} second final of the triangular series which Australia won 2–0. The match had included physical jostling between McGrath and Sanath Jayasuriya mid pitch, with the latter accusing McGrath of making racist attacks. Later in the match, stump microphones showed Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy alleging that portly Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga was feigning injury and calling for a runner because of his lack <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>fitness.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Fascist {{government}} {{endorsed a}} stringent education policy in Italy aiming at eliminating illiteracy, {{which was a}} serious problem in Italy at the time, as well as improving the allegiance of Italians to the state. To reduce drop-outs, the government changed the minimum age of leaving school from twelve to fourteen and strictly enforced attendance. The Fascist government's first minister of education from 1922 to 1924 Giovanni Gentile recommended that education policy should focus on indoctrination of students into Fascism and to educate youth to respect and be obedient to authority. In 1929, education policy took a major step towards being completely {{taken over by the}} agenda of indoctrination. In that year, the Fascist government took control of the authorization of all textbooks, all secondary school teachers were required to take an oath of loyalty to Fascism and children began to be taught that they owed the same loyalty to Fascism as they did to God. In 1933, all university teachers were required to be members of the National Fascist Party. From the 1930s to 1940s, Italy's education focused on the history of Italy displaying Italy as a force of civilization during the Roman era, displaying the rebirth of Italian nationalism and the struggle for Italian independence and unity during the Risorgimento. In the late 1930s, the Fascist government copied Nazi Germany's education system on the issue <b>of</b> <b>physical</b> <b>fitness</b> and began an agenda that demanded that Italians become physically healthy.|$|E
