50|$|After the Second World War, Soviet {{scientists}} started {{exploring the}} old mining areas for uranium, and mining commenced in 1946 even before SAG Wismut {{was established in}} 1947. Schneeberg {{at the southern end}} of the deposit became Object 03 and Oberschlema Object 02. Subsequently the blind (no mineralisation reaches the surface) northern part of the <b>ore</b> <b>field</b> (Niederschlema-Alberoda) was discovered and mining started there in 1949. Object 09 was established to mine the Niederschlema-Alberoda part of the <b>ore</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In 1666 the {{antiquarian}} John Aubrey observed an iron <b>ore</b> <b>field</b> at Seend and in 1684 {{he noted}} that Seend had a chalybeate well that attracted [...] "much company". The <b>ore</b> <b>field</b> was evidently {{the source of the}} iron oxide in the chalybeate waters. A chalybeate spring at Seend was discovered or rediscovered in 1813. In 1815 a saline spring was discovered and a spa company was founded, which built a pump room and houses for visitors. The Spa prospered until 1822.|$|E

50|$|Khao Chet Luk in the Tap Khlo District is {{the site}} of Thailand's largest gold mine, the Chatree Mining Complex. Akara Resources PCL, a Thai-Australian firm, owns and {{operates}} the mine. Akara is a subsidiary of Australian company, Kingsgate Consolidated Ltd. The complex includes the Chatree South <b>ore</b> <b>field,</b> which began commercial production in November 2001, and the Chatree North <b>ore</b> <b>field,</b> which began production in November 2008. The complex also includes processing plants. In 2015, the mine produced and exported four tonnes (4,000 kg) of gold. In May 2016, the Thai government announced that the Chatree mine would be closed at the end of 2016 due to environmental concerns. The mine has long been accused by local residents of poisoning residents, crops, and livestock. In January 2015 a government investigation team said that more than 300 neighboring villagers had tested positive for arsenic and manganese.|$|E

50|$|This <b>ore</b> <b>field</b> was {{the largest}} deposit in the Ore Mountains. It is {{situated}} about 20 km south of Zwickau in the western Ore Mountains. Schneeberg was an important mining center since the 15th century, producing silver, cobalt, nickel and bismuth, {{and the town of}} Oberschlema was known for its strongest naturally occurring radioactive waters {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. A radium health center was established in the town in 1914.|$|E
50|$|This iron {{mine was}} {{served by a}} siding off the WSMR. It closed around 1868. The shell of its engine house, which was moved lock, stock and barrel from Langham Hill mine, stands today, the <b>ore</b> <b>field's</b> only engine house to do so.|$|R

50|$|Eastern Thuringia {{developed}} in the 1950s {{into one of the}} major mining centers of Wismut, hosting the giant <b>ore</b> <b>field</b> of Ronneburg and the medium-sized deposit of Culmitzsch. Although the mineralisation at Ronneburg is hosted by the Gera-Jáchymov fault and it is likely its formation is linked to the vein-style deposits in the Ore Mountains sitting on the same structure, it is a completely different kind of mineralisation. This led to many problems {{in the first decade of}} mining.|$|E
50|$|The {{opening of}} the railway {{encouraged}} quarrying of the iron <b>ore</b> <b>field,</b> {{which began in the}} middle of the 19th century and continued intermittently for the next century or so. 77,984 tons of brown haematite were quarried between 1855 and 1861 and a further 86,443 tons between 1871 and 1874. Quarrying was renewed during the Second World War and was still continuing in 1950. Seend Ironstone Quarry and Road Cutting is now a Geological Site of Special Scientific Interest.|$|E
50|$|The Freiberg Mining Field (Freiberger Revier or Freiberger Bergbaurevier) is an <b>ore</b> <b>field</b> which, in its widest sense, {{is located}} on an ore deposit of {{precious}} and non-ferrous metals roughly 35 x 40 kilometres in area in the lower Eastern Ore Mountains in the German Free State of Saxony. The mining region is centred on Freiberg, but extends beyond that towns borough into the municipalities of Halsbrücke, Hilbersdorf, Bobritzsch, Weißenborn, Oberschöna and the boroughs of Brand-Erbisdorf and Großschirma. Mining {{has been carried out}} here since the last third of the 12th century. In a narrower sense the name refers to the area covered by the Freiburg and Halsbrück mining territories (Freiberger and Halsbrücker Grubenfelder). The Brand Mining Field (Brander Revier) immediately to the south comprises just the one mining territory, the Brander Grubenfeld.|$|E
25|$|In 1886, Carnegie's {{younger brother}} Thomas {{died at age}} 43. While owning steel works, Carnegie had {{purchased}} at low cost the most valuable of the iron <b>ore</b> <b>fields</b> around Lake Superior. The same year Carnegie became a figure of controversy. Following his tour of the UK, he wrote about his experiences in a book entitled An American Four-in-hand in Britain.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ore</b> <b>fields</b> as {{resource}} {{sites have}} been removed. These {{originated in the}} first Red Alert as a functionally identical equivalent to Tiberium, and what were ostensibly strip mines had ore growing out of the ground. Gameplay mechanics have not changed a great deal since fields have been replaced with stationary ore mines. Strategic ore-refinery placement and covert refining are impacted to an extent.|$|R
50|$|The name Jhangeli was {{commonly}} {{used for the}} metre-gauge network in Luxembourg. The lines were operated by different companies. Some lines were financed {{by the state of}} Luxembourg by means of granting exploration rights of iron ore to the railway companies. In the case of the Luxembourg-Remich line, for example, 3.3 ha of iron <b>ore</b> <b>fields</b> was granted per km built.|$|R
50|$|The {{grade of}} the ore mined was 0.08% uranium on average with a cut-off of 0.02% uranium. However, {{restricted}} zones of high grade mineralisation {{with more than}} 1% uranium occurred. An ore treatment plant was tested in Schmirchau to increase the grade before shipping to the mills, but this proved not to be effective. Most of the ore was sent without further treatment to the mills at Seelingstädt and Crossen. Small amounts of uranium were also produced by underground in-situ leaching and heap leaching of low grade ore and even waste rock. The mined resources of the <b>ore</b> <b>field</b> were 113,000 tonnes of uranium, of which about 100,000 tonnes were produced (the difference are production losses). The total resource of the deposit is about 200,000 tonnes of uranium (mined and unmined reserves as well as inferred and speculative resources).|$|E
5000|$|Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3 has {{received}} generally favorable reviews {{with an average}} critic score of 81/100 on Metacritic and 81% on Game Rankings, citing a strong cooperative and multiplayer component. Although the game does not innovate much on its two predecessors and basically follows the same road of Red Alert 2, this wasn't seen as a bad thing by everyone. It has been praised for seamlessly integrating naval warfare into gameplay, generally a neglected feature in real-time strategy games, though excessive focus on this aspect has been criticized as well. The game has been praised for its less serious story and brighter, more colorful environments than those found in Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars. The decision by developers to use more [...] "strip mines" [...] instead of the traditional <b>ore</b> <b>field</b> has been met with mixed response.|$|E
50|$|The Cumbria iron <b>ore</b> <b>field</b> lies to {{the south}} of Workington, and {{produced}} extremely high grade phosphorus-free haematite. The area had a long tradition of iron smelting, but this became particularly important with the invention by Sir Henry Bessemer of the Bessemer process, the first process for mass production of mild steel, which previously had been an expensive specialist product. For the first 25 years of the process, until Gilchrist and Thomas improved upon it, phosphorus-free haematite was required. With Cumbria as the world's premier source, and the local coalfield providing energy for steel production, the world's first large-scale steelworks was opened in the Moss Bay area of the town. The Bessemer converter continued to work until July 1974. The Moss Bay Steelworks closed in 1982, despite having received significant infrastructural investment and improvements almost immediately prior to the closure.|$|E
50|$|The forges, however, became {{central to}} a Grubb family tragedy and other {{unintended}} consequences. In 1783, Curtis' son Peter III {{had been given}} {{an interest in the}} family iron works by his father as an advance inheritance. The courts then had to determine how best to partition the overall assets. Peter III was given a 1/6 interest in the <b>ore</b> <b>fields</b> and a 1/3 interest in the forges, making him partners with his uncle Peter. Neither were happy with the arrangement and in 1785 Peter III sold his share of the forges (and the <b>ore</b> <b>fields)</b> to Robert Coleman, who thus became Peter Jr.'s partner. Peter Jr. became even more concerned for his business situation, especially for the supply of pig iron from his brother's Cornwall Furnace, and decided to build his own furnace at Mount Hope. He went deeply into debt and the pressures of the situation led him to commit suicide at Hopewell in 1786.|$|R

50|$|Peter Grubb Sr. (1702-1754): Founded the Cornwall Ironworks when he {{discovered}} the vast iron <b>ore</b> <b>fields</b> at Cornwall, PA, about 1737 and built the Cornwall Furnace and Hopewell Forges by 1742. He leased the operations to Cury & Company until 1765 and removed to Wilmington, Delaware, where he bought and sold real estate and lived out his life. Succeeding family generations built their fortunes on his discovery.|$|R
