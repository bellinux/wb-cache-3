In early 2007, the foundation sponsored a competition, soliciting designs for the planned project; Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects, a Charlottesville, Virginia landscape architecture firm, was the winner. The partnership to develop Citygarden was announced in June 2007. The project was initially proposed to the St. Louis Preservation Board in October 2007, while development of the land began in April 2008.

5|$|The history <b>of</b> <b>St.</b> <b>Louis,</b> Missouri {{began with}} the {{settlement}} of the St. Louis area by Native American mound builders who lived {{as part of the}} Mississippian culture from the 9th century to the 15th century, followed by other migrating tribal groups.
