This {{indicates that the}} risk for severe weather is also valid in that general area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the border or oceanic boundary.|$|E
5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side.</b> Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the Gatekeeper, whose job is to make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose job was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E
25|$|That, in the future, {{because of}} the {{progress}} in mutual understanding that has come about in recent decades, Orthodox and Catholics refrain from labeling as heretical the traditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> {{on the subject of}} the procession of the Holy Spirit.|$|E

25|$|Displays on {{one side}} of a {{cuttlefish}} can be independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the body; males can display courtship signals to females {{on one side}} while simultaneously showing female-like displays with the other side to stop rival males interfering with their courtship.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> {{effects that}} have been {{suggested}} is that atypical antipsychotics {{increase the risk of}} cardiovascular disease. The research that Kabinoff et al. found that the increase in cardiovascular disease is seen regardless of the treatment they receive, instead it is caused by many different factors such as lifestyle or diet.|$|E
25|$|Fighting {{spread in}} the Gaza Strip, with both factions attacking {{vehicles}} and facilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> Following a breakdown in an Egyptian-brokered truce, Israel launched an air strike which destroyed a building used by Hamas. Ongoing violence prompted fear that it could bring {{the end of the}} Fatah-Hamas coalition government, and possibly the end of the Palestinian authority.|$|E
50|$|A {{triangle}} {{with all}} interior angles measuring less than 90° is an acute triangle or acute-angled triangle. If c is <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> longest side, then a2 + b2 > c2, where a and b are <b>the</b> lengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>sides.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>sides</b> {{contains}} {{a coat of}} arms in relief, and its associated motto. In clockwise order from the front these are the arms and mottoes of Birkenhead, Cheshire, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, England, and the Royal arms. The middle two stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monument are open, with arcades and granite columns, and the top stage consists of a crocketed spire surmounted by a crown finial.|$|R
25|$|Laurens {{considers}} that with an appropriate approach the documentation gathered by Morris {{shows that the}} exodus was caused by mutual fears <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side's</b> intentions, Arabs fearing to be expelled by Zionists and in reaction Zionists fearing Arabs would prevent them by force {{to build their own}} state, and the fact that Palestine was not able to absorb both populations (he describes the situation as a zero-sum conflict).|$|R
25|$|Each side {{believed}} that it represented the starting position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> however it had actually been drawn up by two American Maryknoll priests and two mid-level Japanese officials. Konoe, believing the document was an agreed starting point for negotiation, began to line up support {{for the idea of}} a summit conference in Hawaii. However, Secretary of State Cordell Hull and Roosevelt had no intention of bargaining from this draft.|$|E
25|$|In {{the biblical}} account, Gad's {{presence}} on {{the east of the}} Jordan is explained as a matter of the tribe desiring the land as soon as they saw it, before they had even crossed the Jordan under Joshua, and conquered Canaan. Classical rabbinical literature regards this selection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> by Gad as something for which they should be blamed, remarking that, as mentioned in Ecclesiastes, the full stomach of the rich denies them sleep.|$|E
25|$|Another form of {{collecting}} regards postcards, a document {{written on a}} single robust sheet of paper, usually decorated with photographic pictures or artistic drawings {{on one of the}} sides, and short messages on a small part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> that also contained the space for the address. In strict philatelic usage, the postcard is to be distinguished from the postal card, which has a pre-printed postage on the card. The fact that this communication is visible by other than the receiver often causes the messages to be written in jargon.|$|E

25|$|On the right, Beauregard's men left Solre-le-Château at 7:00 am. Near Obrechies, four squadrons of Austrian cavalry charged {{them and}} drove them off, {{with the loss}} of three field guns. Duquesnoy's {{division}} departed Flaumont at 6:00 am and marched through Beugnies, Dimont and Dimechaux. Supported by a plentiful artillery, the French infantry drove two Austrian battalions out of Wattignies, but as the French poured out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the village they were met by an infantry-cavalry counterattack. Duquesnoy's soldiers abandoned Wattignies and retreated to Dimechaux and Dimont.|$|E
25|$|By August 1918 the US State Department had {{tightened}} wartime {{control at}} the border by limiting passport-carrying Mexican laborers to two entries per day and restricting nonworkers to one crossing per week. A Nogales newspaper reported that the new rules had “greatly curtailed traffic from the Mexican side of the international border, and there is universal weeping among retail merchants of Nogales, Arizona, who see ‘panicky’ times ahead, for those who depend on citizens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> of the international line, to swell their daily receipts.” Although businesses in Nogales, Arizona, protested, the persons most affected were working-class nogalenses who depended on wages from their jobs in the US.|$|E
25|$|Coercion or {{censorship}} {{refers to}} the use of intimidation or force to promote favorable reports and to confiscate unfavorable reports. In the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, both sides accuse each other of coercion or censorship as an explanation of alleged bias in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> In support of these claims, Israeli advocates point to kidnappings of foreign reporters by Palestinians, while Palestinian advocates point to media blackouts and confiscation of reports by Israelis. Additionally, both sides point to reports by both governmental and non-governmental organizations, which assess the degree of journalistic freedom in the region.

25|$|The gimbal {{was first}} {{described}} by the Greek inventor Philo of Byzantium (280–220 BCE). Philo described an eight-sided ink pot with an opening on each side, which can be turned so that while any face is on top, a pen can be dipped and inked — yet the ink never runs out through <b>the</b> holes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>sides.</b> This was done by <b>the</b> suspension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inkwell at the center, which was mounted {{on a series of}} concentric metal rings so that it remained stationary no matter which way the pot is turned.|$|R
2500|$|This theorem {{establishing}} inequalities is sharpened by Pythagoras' theorem to {{the equality}} that <b>the</b> square <b>of</b> <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypotenuse equals [...] <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> squares <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two <b>sides.</b>|$|R

25|$|When either {{wheel is}} {{deflected}} upward, the center {{span of the}} spring (the portion between the pivotable mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward {{at the same time}} (for example, when hitting a bump in the road) the center section bends uniformly between the pivot mounts. In a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> The extent to which the spring acts as an anti-roll bar depends on the distance between the pivot mounts and their rigidity.|$|E
25|$|Bund also {{states that}} nothing {{that had taken}} place in the war {{produced}} more controversy than the way in which Rupert treated Birmingham, and that it was certainly harsh, but by the laws of war as understood on the Continent, in the school in which Rupert had been brought up, there was nothing illegal or improper in it. If the owners of a house allowed firing from that house on the soldiers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> the soldiers fired on were justified in destroying that house. Burning has always been one of the recognised means of destruction. Bund says that if Birmingham had been a Continental town nothing would ever have been heard of it; but because the Continental laws of war were applied to an English town the outcry was terrible.|$|E
25|$|Back in England after World War I, Rosalind {{decided that}} she wanted to go on the stage, and signed on as a chorus girl with a Paris troupe that she had never {{previously}} heard of, the Folies Bergère. Eight months later, she sailed for New York, having decided to try her chance as an actress there. Within weeks, she met the as yet unknown writer F. Scott Fitzgerald; he had just handed in the MS <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side</b> of Paradise (1920) to Scribner’s. During their affair, she inspired him with a short story (published as Head and Shoulders) which his agent sold to the Saturday Evening Post for $300 and then the film rights to it for $2500. This money enabled him to marry Zelda, who had put their engagement on hold until he earned some money.|$|E

50|$|A 5 &times; 9 portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tetrakis square tiling {{is used to}} {{form the}} board for the Malagasy board game Fanorona.

500|$|After {{failing to}} corner Tatsuzou and puzzled about Tatsuya's motives, the party finally persuade Tatsuya {{to reveal the}} truth. During the {{original}} confrontation with Nyarlathotep, Maya was killed, prompting {{the rest of the}} group (Tatsuya, Lisa, Jun and Eikichi) to reset events. Tatsuya refused to forget the events <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side,</b> creating a dangerous loophole: if all the other members of the original group could be forced to remember, the Other Side would be brought back into existence, destroying the present reality. After revealing this, Tatsuya is allowed to join the party in place of either Kei or Eriko. After returning to Sumaru proper, the city is raised by Tatsuzou as part of Torifune. Successfully infiltrating Torifune and defeating Tatsuzou and his [...] "god" [...] Gozen, the city returns to the surface, but the party are drawn into the Collective Unconscious by Nyarlathotep. Making their way into his domain, they discover Nyarlathotep has kidnapped Eikichi, Lisa and Jun in an effort to force their memories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side</b> into reality. Defeating the Shadow Selves guarding them, the party saves each of them, then confront Nyarlathotep, who mocks Tatsuya for refusing to fulfill his part of Philemon's agreement. After Nyarlathotep is defeated, Tatsuya fulfills his side of the bargain, and after saying his final goodbyes separates his Other Side consciousness from his current self. With the city returned to normal and any specific memories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side</b> gone, the party return to their normal lives.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} artists who did not win either series of Pop Idol have also had success in the British charts. Gareth Gates, who {{finished}} as the runner-up behind Young in the first series, scored a number-one hit with a cover of [...] "Unchained Melody" [...] in March 2002, replacing Young's debut single {{at the top of}} the charts. Gates' subsequent releases [...] "Anyone of Us (Stupid Mistake)" [...] and the double A-side [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] / [...] "Suspicious Minds" [...] both reached the top of the charts in 2002.

500|$|One of Kennedy's advisors, Walt Whitman Rostow, {{advised the}} President {{to make a}} test ban {{conditional}} on the Soviet Union withdrawing troops from Cuba and abiding by a 1962 agreement on Laos, but Kennedy opted instead for test-ban negotiations without preconditions. On 10 June 1963, {{in an effort to}} reinvigorate and recontextualize a test ban, President Kennedy dedicated his commencement address at American University to [...] "the most important topic on earth: world peace" [...] and proceeded to make his case for the treaty. Kennedy first called on Americans to dispel the idea that peace is unattainable. [...] "Let us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable peace," [...] Kennedy said, [...] "based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions—on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interest of all concerned." [...] Second, Kennedy appealed for a new attitude towards the Soviet Union, calling Americans to not [...] "see only a distorted and desperate view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side,</b> not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodations as impossible and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats." [...] Finally, Kennedy argued for a reduction in Cold War tensions, with a test ban serving as a first step towards complete disarmament: ...|$|E
