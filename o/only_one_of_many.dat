5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceauşescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting to unravel the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E
5|$|The Polish treaty (signed in June 1919, as {{the first}} of the Minority Treaties, and serving as the {{template}} for the subsequent ones) {{is often referred to as}} either the Little Treaty of Versailles or the Polish Minority Treaty; the Austrian, Czechoslovak and Yugoslavian treaties are referred to as Treaty of St Germain-en-Laye (1919); the Romanian treaty as the Treaty of Paris (1919), the Greek as the Treaty of Sèvres (1920); the Hungarian as the Treaty of Trianon (1920), the Bulgarian as the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine (1919), and the Turkish as the Treaty of Lausanne (1923).

25|$|Competition is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>many</b> {{interacting}} biotic and {{abiotic factors}} that affect community structure. Moreover, competition {{is not always a}} straightforward, direct, interaction. Interspecific competition may occur when individuals of two separate species share a limiting resource in the same area. If the resource cannot support both populations, then lowered fecundity, growth, or survival may result in at least one species. Interspecific competition has the potential to alter populations, communities and the evolution of interacting species. On an individual organism level, competition can occur as interference or exploitative competition.|$|E
25|$|Beginning of the End made Bert I. Gordon {{famous for}} his giant monster films.

However, Beginning of the End had very little of the metaphorical creativity of films such as Godzilla or Them! A more recent assessment, however, concludes that the film taps more deeply into 1950s Americans' worries over invasive species and growing unease over pesticides (like DDT).|$|E
